            <li>By far the best diaper rash cream ever.</li>
            <li>Catch the diaper rash early and keep baby happy!</li>
            <li>But in my own clinical trials it worked better than petrolatum alone.</li>
            <li>...images showing all content need to be available on this kind of product.</li>
            <li>Buy all line for more results.</li>
            <li>Love it, love it.</li>
            <li>love it....</li>
            <li>Works better than diaper rash products.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why we ordered more when we ran out.</li>
            <li>This stuff works fantastic!</li>
            <li>This is definitely the best on the market from my experience.</li>
            <li>Ripping out part of the leak protection lining of his diapers to get more ventilation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell and she likes it very much.</li>
            <li>Her skin is easily irritated against clothing she wears and this ointment does excellent job of protecting against further irritation.</li>
            <li>Spread easily order</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good protection, particularly at night.</li>
            <li>this is smooth and wipes away easily our baby loves it</li>
            <li>This butt paste is fantastic.</li>
            <li>My son&#x27;s bum is smooth as...</li>
            <li>The person who shipped it to me, for whatever reason, wasn&#x27;t available either.</li>
            <li>On the whole, I would have to say that this stuff feels pretty good.</li>
            <li>and it was a huge hassle since I live in an apartment without my own washer and dryer</li>
            <li>We originally got this stuff from the NICU once my son was released.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t clean it all off everytime which gives time to heal.</li>
            <li>You may think getting a large tub of butt paste is a better deal</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty easy to clean off.</li>
            <li>There is absolutely nothing better.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true to its word.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about butt care, but this stuff works GREAT for nipple chafing due to running.</li>
            <li>Very effective at dealing with irritations due to urine exposure and friction of undergarments.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says!</li>
            <li>For BROKEN skin, we used a barrier film called STOMAHESIVE in the NICU, and that worked perfectly too.  </li>
            <li>Nothing works better than this for diaper rash....especially for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I do go through these tubes pretty quickly</li>
            <li>It worked right away like nothing else I tried and within 24 hours I could feel and see a difference.</li>
            <li>So when I ordered this paste I tried it right away.</li>
            <li>This is a a great product would recommend you use only a tiny bit and it works fast!</li>
            <li>This was recommended by my Dr. and it really does protect my skin!  </li>
            <li>Did exactly as it said it would.</li>
            <li>Works exactly as you would expect.</li>
            <li>The product works well in many different situations in addition to the one it was designed for.</li>
            <li>Coloplast is fast acting, I knew she would feel better in just 24 hours.</li>
            <li>This works very well and keep moisture off sore spots--the hospital gave me the first tube</li>
            <li>He gets frequent diaper rash and this stuff is a tremendous help.</li>
            <li>It helped keep the area dry to be able to heal and I am thankful for this product as it gave my son some much needed comfort.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really want to discuss this.</li>
            <li>the moisture barrier really works.  </li>
            <li>It really creates a moisture barrier, so no rashes, nothing.</li>
            <li>Treatment available today, especially for the elderly with skin issues or patients that might be bed ridden for a length of time.</li>
            <li>Would highly endorse this product!</li>
            <li>doing all of this together did NOTHING to clear up the rash!!!</li>
            <li>When I had it special ordered from the local drug store chains, the cost was around $20 for the 6 oz. tube.</li>
            <li>I love how it becomes a thick paste once it&#x27;s been on him a bit because this ensure a barrier against more poop and pee, especially at night.</li>
            <li>When a person is in diapers, they usually seem to get some kind of rash, This cream seems to help with this problem.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t find any in my local area, even at the clinic where I got the first tube!  </li>
            <li>It is the same color tube but it seems gritty instead of smooth cream.</li>
            <li>Within a week the sores were completely GONE!</li>
            <li>This is a clear barrier Ointment that works well for preventing moisture to cause irritation.  </li>
            <li>A friend recommended coloplast for my Dad to help clear up an irritation that nothing else had worked on.  </li>
            <li>If you notice a rash, start using it, it will clear up before baby is off antibiotics</li>
            <li>It really took care of my problem in short order.</li>
            <li>Purchased this for my 90 year old mother who has skin problem.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way!!! :)</li>
            <li>No other ointment OTC compares to this.</li>
            <li>My pediatrician reccomended the AF version which was the only thing to clear up some heartbreaking diaper rash.</li>
            <li>On the second day, he was completely cured.</li>
            <li>I took off 80 pounds in the last couple years and ended up with a whole bunch of loose skin in places I never expected to.</li>
            <li>It only got worse and spread more.</li>
            <li>only down side is that, if I use too much, I stain my underwear.</li>

            <li> It only got worse and spread more.</li>
            <li> only down side is that, if I use too much, I stain my underwear.</li>
            <li> This product was started by my visit to  hospital wound specialist for a sore that developed such as a bed sore due to my injury.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, thinking that the true active ingredient was petrolatum itself.</li>
            <li> My baby son had to have surgery which left his b-hole sensitive and with small cuts.</li>
            <li> Just use a dab as it goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about 7 months, we use it for every diaper change, and we are only half way through our 2nd tube.  </li>
            <li> Using a Blow Dryer to dry his bum after baths and changes to ensure it was completely dry</li>
            <li> Best thing ever and saved my son from an extremely raw and bloody bottom!  </li>
            <li> She is almost three now and has a little brother, and we STILL use only this paste for diaper cream.  </li>
            <li> This whole area of wound care treatment and prophylaxis is very confusing and clinical trials are lacking.</li>
            <li> received product as expected</li>
            <li> Once the tube was empty, we switched to destin.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> He suggested this although it is a bit pricey, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Its not like the other bum creams that have a toothpaste feeling</li>
            <li> I have tried desitin and other products.</li>
            <li> With my other two I had tried Destine, Triple paste, Vaseline, Butt Paste, and even a concoction my Dr. had the pharmacist make for my babies bums.</li>
            <li> Talked with our Pediatrician after everything we tried pretty much failed.  </li>
            <li> the rash was very minimal.</li>
            <li> My son had gotten a very bad rash that other rash creams seemed to only irritate more.</li>
            <li> The other stuff he was using, he put on at least ten times a day and he still was burning.</li>
            <li> but I can personally testify that those pastes were not nearly as effective.</li>
            <li> This Coloplast is what they used for any diaper rash breakouts and it worked like a dream and did not harm our tiny baby&#x27;s delicate skin.  </li>
            <li> This product might seem expensive to some, but there is a reason - it really works.</li>
            <li> MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS THE DELIVERY TIME WAS NOT EVEN CLOSE</li>
            <li> you only need a very small amount, less than the size of a dime.</li>

            <li> This butt paste is fantastic. My baby son had to have surgery which left his b-hole sensitive and with small cuts. Using this for just a couple of days after every messy diaper change really helped. It helped keep the area dry to be able to heal and I am thankful for this product as it gave my son some much needed comfort. Don&#x27;t mind the expense for the size of the bottle. A little goes a long way. You may think getting a large tub of butt paste is a better deal but I can personally testify that those pastes were not nearly as effective.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing for those of you who have a J pouch and are experiencing the pain associated with frequency.</li>
            <li> This works very well and keep moisture off sore spots--the hospital gave me the first tube</li>
            <li> I really love and need this ointment!  I was given a tube of this ointment when I was in the hospital.  I asked the nurse for something to soothe my &#x27;problem&#x27;.  She gave me a tube of this.  This was a miracle for me!!!  It healed my soreness and soothed those spots!  I am so happy to find it on Amazon!!!!  THANK YOU!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product will continue  to  use this for family member.</li>
            <li> This has helped my husband a great deal. The other stuff he was using, he put on at least ten times a day and he still was burning. With the Coloplast he applies this once a day and it has allowed him to heal over. Thank you for  Coloplast it is wonderful. If you ever run a sale on this please let us know.</li>
            <li> Wrong stuff...images showing all content need to be available on this kind of product.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my Dr. and it really does protect my skin!  Another good purchase and great delivery from Amazon!</li>
            <li> Best stuff for diaper rash. My son&#x27;s bum is smooth as...well... a baby&#x27;s bottom should be.</li>
            <li> Good thing! We use it during my baby stayed at NICU. So, no diper rush, no worries! Buy all line for more results.</li>
            <li> Very effective at dealing with irritations due to urine exposure and friction of undergarments.</li>
            <li> Works great to prevent diaper rash for my son without all the chemicals. Doesn&#x27;t help get rid of current diaper rash though.</li>
            <li> Got what I ordered. Works great on rash and sores. Hospitals use this, and now I do too. Little grandkids never have a rash!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really want to discuss this. If you need this product, there is nothing else out there in the marketplace that compares to it. It is very expensive, but when you consider the pain it is minimizing it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Only product that cures my newborns diaper rash!  I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING else.  It works immediately and is almost 100% cured in 24 hours.</li>
            <li> Our daughter was born three months early and spent three months in a Level 4 NICU at a naval hospital.  In the entire unit, there was not one tube of A&amp;D ointment or Desitin to be found.  This Coloplast is what they used for any diaper rash breakouts and it worked like a dream and did not harm our tiny baby&#x27;s delicate skin.  She is almost three now and has a little brother, and we STILL use only this paste for diaper cream.  There is absolutely nothing better.  For BROKEN skin, we used a barrier film called STOMAHESIVE in the NICU, and that worked perfectly too.  We love this product!!</li>
            <li> This product was started by my visit to  hospital wound specialist for a sore that developed such as a bed sore due to my injury.It really took care of my problem in short order.It totally cleared up my problem, and now that I had a similar incident, it is working for me again.</li>
            <li> My husband used this in the hospital and it worked so good we wanted to buy some for our home. This is a great product.</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing. i have ulcerative colitis and i use this every day. you only need a very small amount, less than the size of a dime.</li>
            <li> received product as expected</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended critic aid when my daughter had a diaper rash that wouldn&#x27;t go away and started bleeding.  Within a couple days of starting critic aid her rash was much better and almost cleared up!</li>
            <li> My pediatrician reccomended the AF version which was the only thing to clear up some heartbreaking diaper rash. These are the best on the market for your baby and used at Denver Children&#x27;s Hospital.</li>
            <li> I took off 80 pounds in the last couple years and ended up with a whole bunch of loose skin in places I never expected to. I began to get what I thought was prickly heat, but it wouldn&#x27;t heal.It was raw and painful and had a bad odor and I tried to treat it with salves, calamine, antibiotic ointments and powders to no avail. It only got worse and spread more. Afraid it would get infected, I saw my doctor who referred me to wound care! They said it looked like something akin to bed sores and gave me a tube of this to use. It worked right away like nothing else I tried and within 24 hours I could feel and see a difference. Within a week the sores were completely GONE! We recently moved and I lost my tube. After seeing it here on Amazon, I ordered 2 more because the price was very good and I couldn&#x27;t find any in my local area, even at the clinic where I got the first tube!  I won&#x27;t be without this stuff if I can help it, EVER.</li>
            <li> This was the only ointment that cured my son&#x27;s horrific diaper rash.  We always have a bottle on hand!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful.  Nothing works better than this for diaper rash....especially for sensitive skin.  I would recommend this product for anyone.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about butt care, but this stuff works GREAT for nipple chafing due to running.</li>
            <li> Work well on the skin as a barrier for the buttocks. Suggest as a try order now. Spread easily order</li>
            <li> Delighted to have found a source after two drugstores were unsuccessful.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Love it, love it. love it....the moisture barrier really works.  Just use a dab as it goes a long way.  I use it almost daily.</li>
            <li> Was given to me in the hospital when I had a bleeding ulcer. Works great for a colonoscopy preparation or severe irritation.  Works better than diaper rash products.</li>
            <li> Good product, has been reordered twice.</li>
            <li> Great product it works</li>
            <li> This product might seem expensive to some, but there is a reason - it really works. We were given some at the hospital for preventing skin irritation for a newborn. It really creates a moisture barrier, so no rashes, nothing. That&#x27;s why we ordered more when we ran out.</li>
            <li> Whatever happened, the shipment never made it.  As such, I say I don&#x27;t like it.  The person who shipped it to me, for whatever reason, wasn&#x27;t available either.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my 90 year old mother who has skin problem.  Her skin is easily irritated against clothing she wears and this ointment does excellent job of protecting against further irritation.</li>
            <li> THIS IS GOOD PRODUCT AND I WOULD RECOMMEND IT IF ANYONE NEEDS IT. MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS THE DELIVERY TIME WAS NOT EVEN CLOSE THE TO THE ESTIMATED TIME TO BE DELIVERED, THEREFORE, I WOULD ORDER FROM A DIFFERENT SUPPLIER THE NEXT TIME I NEED THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> This is a clear barrier Ointment that works well for preventing moisture to cause irritation.  It works as well as others I have tried for the same problem. I am happy with the prompt delivery. It is serving  its purpose.</li>
            <li> Treatment available today, especially for the elderly with skin issues or patients that might be bed ridden for a length of time.</li>
            <li> Does what it says it should</li>
            <li> A friend recommended coloplast for my Dad to help clear up an irritation that nothing else had worked on.  This seems to be doing the trick!  Order was delivered swiftly too.  Would highly endorse this product!</li>
            <li> Did exactly as it said it would. Have used it for our daughter since birth (3 months now) and it has helped prevent her from getting any diaper rash. A little goes a long way!!! :)</li>
            <li> On the whole, I would have to say that this stuff feels pretty good. Works exactly as you would expect.</li>
            <li> I it is very good but I think my problem is do to medication that I may be allergic to .</li>
            <li> By far the best diaper rash cream ever. My son was in NICU for 4 months and we used this in the hospital and they gave us some to go home with. He gets frequent diaper rash and this stuff is a tremendous help. We can&#x27;t use anything else</li>
            <li> This stuff works fantastic!</li>
            <li> it works as advertised.</li>
            <li> I actually was given this from a nurse during a stay in the hospital. Very good stuff! Sounds like its great for babies but I can vouch that this is legit for adults of all ages. It soothes the affected area as well as protects it from getting worse</li>
            <li> This is the only cream that would help on my daughters diaper rash. She had the worst rash and it wouldn&#x27;t heal unless this cream was on her.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says!</li>
            <li> We originally got this stuff from the NICU once my son was released. Once it was used on him it became his and we got 2 of these in the smaller size. My son had gotten a very bad rash that other rash creams seemed to only irritate more. I pulled this item out and in less than a day the rash was very minimal. However, my stash was running out so I purchased 2 of the 6oz tubes. My son gets rashes often from his poops, airing out seems to help a ton but doesn&#x27;t cure it. If I don&#x27;t catch them within minutes of him going the rash starts. I do go through these tubes pretty quickly but I goop the stuff on to ensure it creates a barrier. I love how it becomes a thick paste once it&#x27;s been on him a bit because this ensure a barrier against more poop and pee, especially at night. It&#x27;s pretty easy to clean off. Desitin and A&amp;D have nothing on this stuff. I do however, purchase from a medical site that sells them a tad cheaper and ships to me in about a day because of it&#x27;s close proximity to me. Definitely a baby must-have if you can put out the extra cash for it vs. store bought creams.</li>
            <li> This cleared my baby&#x27;s skin rash in two days.  Works great on diaper rashes too.  A little amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I used this when in rehab for a leg injury and it worked well.  great price.</li>
            <li> It is the same color tube but it seems gritty instead of smooth cream.</li>
            <li> I had used this from a hospital after surgery, so I wanted to replace it and found it at Amazon.  It&#x27;s good protection, particularly at night.</li>
            <li> The product works well in many different situations in addition to the one it was designed for.</li>
            <li> This is a a great product would recommend you use only a tiny bit and it works fast! Its not like the other bum creams that have a toothpaste feeling this is smooth and wipes away easily our baby loves it and so do we.</li>
            <li> I ordered this ointment at request of a friend. It has a pleasant smell and she likes it very much.</li>
            <li> I love this!! Provides rapid relief and healing. I have tried desitin and other products. This is definitely the best on the market from my experience. We used this on our patients at the children&#x27;s hospital I worked at. I have used this on myself and my daughter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true to its word. It works!</li>
            <li> When a person is in diapers, they usually seem to get some kind of rash, This cream seems to help with this problem.</li>
            <li> My baby had a horrible diper rush.  I even took him to the doctor and the creams he prescribed did not worked. I also tried over the counter creams and they didn&#x27;t work either.  So I ordered this paste hoping for the best cause I didn&#x27;t know what else to do. I even had my baby with not diper at times. So when I ordered this paste I tried it right away. The next day he was almost healed.  On the second day, he was completely cured. I was so happy. Since then, that is what I use.</li>
            <li> It provides me indescribable relief. This was, indeed, a great finding!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down side is that, if I use too much, I stain my underwear.</li>
            <li> This is great for protecting my infant&#x27;s skin.  So glad this product was recommended!</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product by the NICU nurses when my baby was there. She was on anibiotics and had a rash so bad it was bleeding. This works so well because it forms a barrier and you don&#x27;t clean it all off everytime which gives time to heal. No other ointment OTC compares to this.</li>
            <li> While my son was in the hospital with a high fever as an infant, he developed a terrible diaper rash.  This is what the hospital used on it and gave us samples to take home.  This is the best product as it keeps the wetness away from the skin, pricey, but definitely worth it.  A little goes a long way so it lasts longer than you would think.  I have not purchased this product yet from Amazon, but was notified that a family member is expecting so I thought I would see if they carried it.  When I had it special ordered from the local drug store chains, the cost was around $20 for the 6 oz. tube.</li>
            <li> My third baby had to spend time at children&#x27;s hospital for RSV. While he was there, they used this stuff to help with the rash that is accompanied by antibiotics. With my other two I had tried Destine, Triple paste, Vaseline, Butt Paste, and even a concoction my Dr. had the pharmacist make for my babies bums. Nothing even compared to this stuff.  If you have a baby and know s/he&#x27;s going to be on antibiotics, get this stuff and start using it immediately, it prevented a rash from even starting, where the others just didn&#x27;t work like this. If you notice a rash, start using it, it will clear up before baby is off antibiotics, It&#x27;s amazing! It is a bit gritty, and the grits release a protective skin once activated (with soil).  I noticed how it works when I would go to wash my hands, it took a while and some soap to get it off and my hands would turn slimy. Best Diaper Cream Ever!</li>
            <li> We started out using coloplast on our 4-pound newborn.  Best butt paste on the market.  Once the tube was empty, we switched to destin.  It took forever to work and it contains perfume.  Raw skin and perfume are not a match for baby&#x27;s tender bottom.  Coloplast is fast acting, I knew she would feel better in just 24 hours. Catch the diaper rash early and keep baby happy!</li>
            <li> This was recommended by a wound care nurse. I was skeptical at first, thinking that the true active ingredient was petrolatum itself. But in my own clinical trials it worked better than petrolatum alone. This whole area of wound care treatment and prophylaxis is very confusing and clinical trials are lacking. I wish there could be a clearinghouse for products to help consumers. This product seems to do its job.</li>
            <li> My son had the worst diaper rash that wouldn&#x27;t clear up!  We were using a maximum strength Butt Paste, in the midst of trying cloth diapers.  Talked with our Pediatrician after everything we tried pretty much failed.  He suggested this although it is a bit pricey, a little goes a long way.  It&#x27;s been about 7 months, we use it for every diaper change, and we are only half way through our 2nd tube.  Best thing ever and saved my son from an extremely raw and bloody bottom!  I would recommend this to everyone!  Here&#x27;s a list of things I tried before using this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Naked time, for about 2 hours a day&lt;br /&gt;- Oatmeal Baths&lt;br /&gt;- Oatmeal and Chamomile Baths&lt;br /&gt;- Oatmeal, Chamomile, and Baking Soda soaks&lt;br /&gt;- Cloth diapers - my friend had some she let me borrow and it was a huge hassle since I live in an apartment without my own washer and dryer&lt;br /&gt;- Maximum Strength Butt paste&lt;br /&gt;- Vinegar and Water spray with a cloth instead of diaper wipes&lt;br /&gt;- Using a Blow Dryer to dry his bum after baths and changes to ensure it was completely dry&lt;br /&gt;- Ripping out part of the leak protection lining of his diapers to get more ventilation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And doing all of this together did NOTHING to clear up the rash!!!</li>
