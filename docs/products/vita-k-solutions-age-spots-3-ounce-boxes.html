            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>This is Debbie&#x27;s husband and the Vita-K line-up delivers a great result!  </li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>Vita-K has done a good job of preventing the spread of age spots.  </li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Now it doesn&#x27;t look like I have age spots; it looks like I have some kind of skin disease.</li>
            <li>so I feel like if someone is looking for something safe to use then this is probably a good product to use.</li>
            <li>It does go on easily and if it eventually works, it is a good value for the money.</li>
            <li>I will make sure then is one of this in my makeup bag at all times.</li>
            <li>My hands look better also..</li>
            <li>Use the Facial lines, the Spider Veins and Eye products on your face and neck,  and the results are wonderful for your skin.</li>
            <li>Works ok, You may h ave to use it a while to see any results.</li>
            <li>Vita-K products are pretty good.</li>
            <li>All the Vita-K products are worth ordering or buying local, excellent products that work as they should.  </li>
            <li>I tried it a bit on a patch of skin of mine that was a bit darker and it worked just fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyhow, this cream seemed to work fine to me</li>
            <li>Works wonderful but a little bit</li>
            <li>I will continue using Vita-K Solutions for Age Spots to keep my skin tone free from age spots.</li>
            <li>I originally bought Vita-k for age spots for a spot on my face that turned out to be a growth and had to have it removed by a Dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>I have seen a significant fading of age spots on my arms and hands after three weeks of use.  </li>
            <li>At first I was satisfied with this product, then about two or three weeks of use my chest had a rash.</li>
            <li>I want the age spots to vanish fast.&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering more Vita-K very soon</li>
            <li>and I can tell it is not thick any more and maybe 1/5</li>
            <li>I use Vita-K dark circles and it works great.  </li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Methylparaben&amp;#34; is clearly listed in the ingredients list, and as many know</li>
            <li>The first month I used this cream on my arms, I thought it was going to work, as my skin looked as though it was visibly lighter.</li>
            <li>However, this most recent order of Vita-K came as an orange cream.  </li>
            <li>It was a bit of a shock finding out about the whole hydroquinone thing that apparently gets used in some anal bleaching procedures that made for hilarious stories about people going to the emergency room because their attempt at brightening the place where the sun don&#x27;t shine went awry.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it itches slash burns slightly consistently.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say anything positive about this product.</li>
            <li>For those thinking of buying this item, just use caution and test it on one part of your skin first rather than on your whole face</li>
            <li>Did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.  </li>
            <li>my shirt sleeves, especially on white and light color shirts.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice it until I thought my face was breaking out</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t until my face started to &amp;#34; breakout&amp;#34; except I couldn&#x27;t really see anything I could just feel a lot of bumps on my cheak areas.  </li>
            <li>The tan on my arms had faded, which only made the freckles and red spots stand out more.</li>
            <li>I have the spots on my legs and arms and if you have not tried this I recommend it highly.  </li>
            <li>so I ended up doing a bunch of google searches to learn a little bit about them, and from what I could gather, basically any of the safe creams to use won&#x27;t work all that rapidly, so you have to be kinda patient about using anything.</li>
            <li>I woke up with blotchy red itchy face right after the night I applied this cream in the hopes of lightening my freckles.  </li>
            <li>If you use a product with hydroquinone, be careful, the US is the only country I think that allows it, most countries ban the use of it.  </li>
            <li>Positive reviews must be written by people with a financial interest in the product.</li>
            <li>My mom tried this product for brown age spots on her face and it helped clear up her face a lot.</li>
            <li>It may be too early to judge.  </li>
            <li>So far the age spots are still there.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and makes my skin feel soft and firm.  </li>
            <li>skin was only a little bit dark, so it seemed nice to me that this seemed to work as well as it did.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that my arms look any different (better or worse) than they were before I tried this product, but apparently (hopefully) it didn&#x27;t do any long-term harm.</li>

            <li> There is a spot ... or there was a spot, by my eyelid that was thick and ugly.  I have been the using  &#x27;age spot creme&amp;#34;on it 2 X&#x27;s a day, and I can tell it is not thick any more and maybe 1/5 the size it was.  I was talking to a friend and I told here that I had been using  this creme on my hands, face and neck area, and this spot was almost gone. I  pointed to the spot and my friend kept getting closer and closer and she finally said &amp;#34;what spot?&amp;#34;  Those words were like the singing of the angels... I will make sure then is one of this in my makeup bag at all times. My hands look better also.. Great product!</li>
            <li> Followed instruction to the letter.  Did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.  Positive reviews must be written by people with a financial interest in the product.</li>
            <li> Now that I no longer wear foundation I wanted a product that would even out my skin tones and lighten sun spots on my face.  This product works like a charm.  I use it every morning over my usual moisturizer and under my sunscreen. It absorbs quickly and makes my skin feel soft and firm.  I love this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using for a few weeks.  It may be too early to judge.  But, I have not seen any noticeable results.  It does go on easily and if it eventually works, it is a good value for the money.</li>
            <li> I woke up with blotchy red itchy face right after the night I applied this cream in the hopes of lightening my freckles.  BIG MISTAKE! My face is now swollen. I wrote the company to tell them I have a bad reaction to their cream and to the ingredients in their formula. I can&#x27;t say anything positive about this product. I even paid 14 dollars.  For those thinking of buying this item, just use caution and test it on one part of your skin first rather than on your whole face or you&#x27;ll end up like me. I have used other face creams but this is just bad. :( I am not going to buy any of this Freeman products.  I just gave it a try because they were selling this at the pharmacy where I worked.</li>
            <li> I originally bought Vita-k for age spots for a spot on my face that turned out to be a growth and had to have it removed by a Dermatologist.  I started to get severe cracked skin on my hands and the Vita-k was there so I decided to use it.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how well it started to work on my hands, elbows and knees.  (I have Psoriasis on my elbows and knees)  With continued, regular use it cleared up all my problem areas.  Nothing, including a prescription from the Dermatologist worked, just the Vita-K.  the added benefit was that all the age spots on my hands disappeared!  Great product.  Be patient because with continual use you will see a difference!</li>
            <li> The first month I used this cream on my arms, I thought it was going to work, as my skin looked as though it was visibly lighter. But after about a month, the spots I wanted to get rid began turning red. The tan on my arms had faded, which only made the freckles and red spots stand out more. Now it doesn&#x27;t look like I have age spots; it looks like I have some kind of skin disease. Also, small itchy lumps have formed under my skin. They aren&#x27;t visible, but I feel them when I run my hand over my arm. (I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re an allergic reaction, since they took over a month to develop.) I&#x27;m hoping that they&#x27;ll go away and that the red spots will fade. I stopped using the cream about two weeks ago, but the lumps are still there and the spots are still red. Beware--if my arms still looked the way they did before I tried this stuff, age spots and all, it would be a big improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: The red spots have returned to a tan color. The lumps have disappeared, and so has the itch. I don&#x27;t know that my arms look any different (better or worse) than they were before I tried this product, but apparently (hopefully) it didn&#x27;t do any long-term harm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about 3 weeks now and I can see all of the sun spots and blotchy areas on my face  fading.  I will definitely be using this product again.</li>
            <li> The cream also makes the back of my hands smoother. Vita-K products are pretty good. I have used the under eye dark circle cream and it reallllly works.</li>
            <li> Vita K Solution Age Spots did not work for me. Used two months on age spot twice a day and still have spot. Used on freakel, and age spot on arm and still have spots.</li>
            <li> I have seen a significant fading of age spots on my arms and hands after three weeks of use.  I will continue using Vita-K Solutions for Age Spots to keep my skin tone free from age spots.</li>
            <li> I used the product as directed and could see no visible change after 4 weeks of continued use.  May work for someone else but not for me.</li>
            <li> This is Debbie&#x27;s husband and the Vita-K line-up delivers a great result!  The age or dark spot cream works wonders on the spots and practically removes them after use.  I have the spots on my legs and arms and if you have not tried this I recommend it highly.  If you use a product with hydroquinone, be careful, the US is the only country I think that allows it, most countries ban the use of it.  All the Vita-K products are worth ordering or buying local, excellent products that work as they should.  Use the Facial lines, the Spider Veins and Eye products on your face and neck,  and the results are wonderful for your skin. (Along with Vitamin-E cream and &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; Argon oil).  I will use and trust the products of Freeman&#x27;s for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> Works wonderful but a little bit eto slow.  I want the age spots to vanish fast.&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering more Vita-K very soon</li>
            <li> Vita-K has done a good job of preventing the spread of age spots.  However, this most recent order of Vita-K came as an orange cream.  The orange cream stains my shirt sleeves, especially on white and light color shirts.  Past orders were a white cream which did not stain.  I wish they would go back to white.</li>
            <li> I have been using this (mistakenly) on my face for 4 weeks, instead of hands, for reducing redness and now am just realizing it contains Parabens. &amp;#34;Methylparaben&amp;#34; is clearly listed in the ingredients list, and as many know, parabens are very bad for you. Methylparabens are a &amp;#34;skin and eye irritant,&amp;#34; an &amp;#34;endocrine disruptor linked to breast and ovarian cancer,&amp;#34; and are an environmental contaminant. #justsaying&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed that I missed this but noticed that no one in the reviews mentioned this so figured I&#x27;d let people know.</li>
            <li> I use Vita-K dark circles and it works great.  This product did nothing for the &#x27;age spots&#x27; I have on my hands.</li>
            <li> My mom tried this product for brown age spots on her face and it helped clear up her face a lot.</li>
            <li> I tried it a bit on a patch of skin of mine that was a bit darker and it worked just fine. From some of the reviews I guess it just doesn&#x27;t work that well on some people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me it took a few weeks for me to see much of a difference, which I suppose is a good thing since that means it isn&#x27;t all that harsh an effect like some of the other funky creams that use hydroquinone (the weird tumor causing cream that I&#x27;m surprised isn&#x27;t illegal in America yet).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin was only a little bit dark, so it seemed nice to me that this seemed to work as well as it did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a bit curious about all the really weird ass things in some of these skin lightening creams so I ended up doing a bunch of google searches to learn a little bit about them, and from what I could gather, basically any of the safe creams to use won&#x27;t work all that rapidly, so you have to be kinda patient about using anything. It was a bit of a shock finding out about the whole hydroquinone thing that apparently gets used in some anal bleaching procedures that made for hilarious stories about people going to the emergency room because their attempt at brightening the place where the sun don&#x27;t shine went awry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, this cream seemed to work fine to me so I feel like if someone is looking for something safe to use then this is probably a good product to use.</li>
            <li> and I just stopped using it and the spots faded while I used it (they just faded did not disappear) but you have to keep at it constantly...and I didn&#x27;t ..but it does fade the spots a bit.</li>
            <li> Works ok, You may h ave to use it a while to see any results.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not for me....my dark spots are very dark.</li>
            <li> I like  the product.  So far the age spots are still there.</li>
            <li> At first I was satisfied with this product, then about two or three weeks of use my chest had a rash. I didn&#x27;t really notice it until I thought my face was breaking out and my ear lobe started to burn / itch. Not sure if I was just getting old regarding my chest and maybe my earrings affecting my ears. It wasn&#x27;t until my face started to &amp;#34; breakout&amp;#34; except I couldn&#x27;t really see anything I could just feel a lot of bumps on my cheak areas.  Come to find out I had a rash as my face started to itch and burn on both cheeks part of my chin part of my forehead and my nose. Although my nose didn&#x27;t really itch I could still see the bumps and small red capillaries started to form. This is the third day and although itching is bearable it itches slash burns slightly consistently. I am using aveeno rash cream to curve the itch, hopefully this goes away soon.</li>
            <li> I definitely see a difference in my skin.  I use it on my face, neck, hands and arms.  I will buy it again.</li>
