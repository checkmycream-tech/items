            <li>I used this w/ a hair cap &amp; used a blow dryer 2 warm, then kept it on as I did things around the house.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>It made my hair to look much better</li>
            <li>i give it a thumbs UP :)</li>
            <li>waiitng for the shampoo and conditioner now then i will be all set :)</li>
            <li>The straw feeling on the ends of my hair were so much better.  </li>
            <li>I have used many hair conditioning treatments and hair masks and this does not deliver what&#x27;s promised.</li>
            <li>but once I realized how good it was I promptly invested in the large tub with the pump handle (much better deal).  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff works great after coloring hair keeps my hair feeling soft</li>
            <li>So I will look for a keratin free product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping from the supplier was fast, and transaction was smooth.</li>
            <li>My hair was silky soft and much more manageable.  </li>
            <li>It is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Makes hair super smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>usually a good product, works magic on hair, but had a strange smell to it and strange consistency when delivered.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it, I was sold.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased it several time and love it.  </li>
            <li>The product didn&#x27;t smell nice and the consistency was not of a normal deep conditioner treatment.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it was delivered by mail in hot weather and changed the consistency while on the road.</li>
            <li>It works well and really softens my hair.  </li>
            <li>This product worked really well.</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>My hair feels squeaky clean after clarifying and this brings the softness back.</li>
            <li>Works great on my long thick hair.</li>
            <li>and it also feels very soft.</li>
            <li>feels very soft</li>
            <li>My hair was easy 2 comb through, soft &amp; less flyaways.</li>
            <li>i thought it would be much bigger its super tiny</li>
            <li>My hair was severely damaged due to radiation treatments and after just one use I saw a tremendous difference.  </li>
            <li>My friend and I both have bought several times, has made my hair so much softer and stronger.</li>
            <li>I have &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; hair and this stuff makes it soft and shiny</li>
            <li>I bake it in with the blow dryer for 15 minutes after coloring with Natural Instincts.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>It just felt and looked the same as any other cheap hair care product.</li>
            <li>But it just didn&#x27;t add the moisture I needed for my very bleached dry hair.</li>
            <li>When I received this product, I compared it to the one bought at my local beauty supply store and this one was really runny and had a different texture....</li>
            <li>I bought the first time and have not used often, but from what little I applied, my hair is softer now.</li>
            <li>you live where it is very dry, you probably want to use an oil treatment once a week</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and gets weak with coloring</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Both products (this one and Back to Basics gel) had been obviously watered down.  </li>

            <li> Love it but I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the size, it&#x27;s crazy small and the full size it really pricy :(</li>
            <li> Love this stuff works great after coloring hair keeps my hair feeling soft</li>
            <li> Very good product. It made my hair to look much better and it also feels very soft. Only downside is thatit is very small and already finished.</li>
            <li> i thought it would be much bigger its super tiny i woulda have gotten larger but the picture loooked big so i thought it was atleast alil bigger. i just put it in my hair feels very soft havent taken it out yet so idk how its going to make my hair look but it came on time in the mail and other then it being little i give it a thumbs UP :) waiitng for the shampoo and conditioner now then i will be all set :)</li>
            <li> This conditioner is the best one I have tried.  It works well and really softens my hair.  I recommend this product for anyone who has dry or coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I saw that Tabatha Coffey recommended this for damaged hair and decided to try it.  The first time I tried it, I was sold.  My hair was silky soft and much more manageable.  I got this sample size to try it but once I realized how good it was I promptly invested in the large tub with the pump handle (much better deal).  Deducted a star for cost vs. amount of product.</li>
            <li> I bought after seeing on TV show, it works great! My friend and I both have bought several times, has made my hair so much softer and stronger. Great product!!</li>
            <li> My hair is thinning and this product makes my hair look and feel great.  I have purchased it several time and love it.  It is well worth the money.  The size of the container is great for travel.</li>
            <li> This is definitely not the same quality product I bought at my local beauty supply store.  When I received this product, I compared it to the one bought at my local beauty supply store and this one was really runny and had a different texture....Beware.</li>
            <li> I liked it. But it just didn&#x27;t add the moisture I needed for my very bleached dry hair. Oh well.</li>
            <li> Very good quality. For men spikey hair style, it lasted for a while</li>
            <li> I use joico products routinely,  but had not tried this one. I decided to try it, but was disappointed.  It was a thin product that didnt leave my hair feeling moisturized. It just felt and looked the same as any other cheap hair care product. Which was surprising, as I love the joico line.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping from the supplier was fast, and transaction was smooth. I only gaive the product the 3 star rating</li>
            <li> Makes hair super smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I used this w/ a hair cap &amp; used a blow dryer 2 warm, then kept it on as I did things around the house.  My hair was easy 2 comb through, soft &amp; less flyaways. The straw feeling on the ends of my hair were so much better.  Also my hair wasn&#x27;t all greasy and heavy after. Small bottle sm price.  Good 4 a try 2 c if u like.  This being said, smells like men&#x27;s cologne, has keratin in it. :( So I will look for a keratin free product.</li>
            <li> My hair tend to be very dry.....this is all the conditioner I need after I wash my hair (once a week).  Of course I use a little bit of leave in conditioner everyday.</li>
            <li> This product worked really well. My hair was severely damaged due to radiation treatments and after just one use I saw a tremendous difference.  The tube is small but I got 2 uses out of it.</li>
            <li> I really like this. I use once or twice a week. Leaves hair soft and not weighed down.</li>
            <li> Watched on Dr. Oz that this product would work miracles but was it didn&#x27;t. The product didn&#x27;t smell nice and the consistency was not of a normal deep conditioner treatment. I have used many hair conditioning treatments and hair masks and this does not deliver what&#x27;s promised. I would recommend Redken or Pureology.</li>
            <li> I am so diappointed with Amazon because of this and another beauty product I purchased.  Both products (this one and Back to Basics gel) had been obviously watered down.  The Loico treatment should have been like a lotion and instead it was runny.  Rip-off!</li>
            <li> usually a good product, works magic on hair, but had a strange smell to it and strange consistency when delivered. Perhaps it was delivered by mail in hot weather and changed the consistency while on the road. Try to place shipments during colder months if you can.</li>
            <li> I have &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; hair and this stuff makes it soft and shiny...love it.  Will always use it...as long as they keep making it!</li>
            <li> Very good.  I bake it in with the blow dryer for 15 minutes after coloring with Natural Instincts.&lt;br /&gt;Then I use it about once a week.&lt;br /&gt;If you live where it is very dry, you probably want to use an oil treatment once a week also.&lt;br /&gt;(I love coconut!)  My hair is fine and gets weak with coloring every 6 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;  Siva</li>
            <li> i use it after clarifying my hair every week. My hair feels squeaky clean after clarifying and this brings the softness back. Works great on my long thick hair. love it!</li>
            <li> I bought the first time and have not used often, but from what little I applied, my hair is softer now.</li>
