            <li>excellent product!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Gives me perfect curls!</li>
            <li>This is the best diffuser I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I have a Conair Ionic Ceramic Cord Keeper 1875, and the diffuser that came with it wasn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li>and i love it!!</li>
            <li>a hair stylist and clients always inquired about it because their curly hair looked so good.</li>
            <li>The fingers are a good length.</li>
            <li>Would give it 5 stars if it fit &amp; didn&#x27;t melt because the size is perfect.</li>
            <li>so there isn&#x27;t much air movement, but plenty of heat, it&#x27;s perfect for great curls,</li>
            <li>I was loving it - fit great, worked great.  </li>
            <li>;-) LOVE IT !!!!!</li>
            <li>my sister and I both are curlies and we love it!</li>
            <li>Cheap and works great</li>
            <li>and I get great curls, dries quickly and not having any melting issues ...</li>
            <li>I also used this diffuser with great success when I was</li>
            <li>It has held up great and fits all of my hair in at the same time drying quickly and perfect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got three blow dryers and the largest fitting</li>
            <li>great diffuser, love the price, thanks.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product fro some time now and love it.</li>
            <li>Magic hairdrying w</li>
            <li>I thought that this one would be better because it fits over the dyer.</li>
            <li>I might be able to get to hang of it soon.</li>
            <li>I have gotten used to using it and it no longer is falling off the top of the dyer.</li>
            <li>I understood that it fits most dryers.  </li>
            <li>It had the biggest \\&quot;bowl\\&quot; of the three diffusers i purchased and the plastic felt stronger and of better quality.</li>
            <li>Make sure to measure the dimensions of your dryer nozzle, before you buy this item.</li>
            <li>This type of deep dish diffusercreates the best curls.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Diffuser is great otherwise - nicely made and BIG!</li>
            <li>Love this Diffuser and you r able to make it fit to almos any Blow</li>
            <li>The tool itself is fine</li>
            <li>so I had to duct tape it, which works fine</li>
            <li>I thought this one would be great because it has different size adjustments to fit about any dryer, and that is the problem I am having in my search for a diffuser attachment.  </li>
            <li>The attachments didn&#x27;t really fit my dryer.</li>
            <li>Maybe it will fit someone else&#x27;s dryer.</li>
            <li>One of the adapters fit my dryer and the diffuser</li>
            <li>&amp;#34; that it will fit - It does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this just because you&#x27;re gambling if it will fit.</li>
            <li>Put doesent fit to my hairdryer ðŸ˜Ÿ</li>
            <li>This diffuser didn&#x27;t fit on my blow dryer, even when I attempted to use the size adjuster things.</li>
            <li>I thought this would fit my blow dryer but the attachments.  </li>
            <li>however I couldn not get to fit on either of my dryers</li>
            <li>This diffuser is a good product, it is of professional quality and it</li>
            <li>This is the first defuser that really does do a good job with my hair.</li>
            <li>I was so excited</li>
            <li>It does seem to heat more than my diffuser that came with my hot tools dyer.&lt;br /&gt;Update on this diffuser it is now melting.</li>
            <li>at first it took a little maneuvering to figure out a way to hook one of the attachments to my blowdryer but one of them fits perfect on my revlon ionic dryer</li>
            <li>This diffuser is superior and makes a big difference to curly hair.</li>
            <li>Really wanted to Love this product</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this diffuser for women with curly hair looking for more volume and definition of their curls.</li>
            <li>I really liked the attachments because they seemed to provide a better attachment than other diffusers.</li>
            <li>It was originally put out by hot tools.  </li>
            <li>Good extra large diffuser.</li>
            <li>It would be the best diffuser I&#x27;ve ever used, but the attachment (and the different sized connections too) are incredibly narrow and don&#x27;t fit any hairdryers I&#x27;ve tried it on.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t extend much further than the sides of the diffuser and the air flows nicely all around your hair.</li>
            <li>The difusser head is large and great for thick hair, I love mine!&lt;br /&gt;There were sever attachments to make it fit properly on your hair drying</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t fit my Helen of Troy dryer very well</li>
            <li>I can get so much of my hair into the bowl, and its really deep, so it coils nicely.</li>
            <li>Attachments should fit any blow-dryer I have used it with a professional dryer and store bought one as well.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was needing/looking for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m aware that there are probably hundreds of models.</li>
            <li>I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars because the barrel that fits on your hair dryer has a tendency to get pretty hot.</li>
            <li>Great for curling hair for an individual who has to perm her hair, this helps to create volume and long curled strands.</li>
            <li>Falls off hair dryer when it gets too hot.</li>
            <li>it covers more area of hair that the smaller ones.</li>
            <li>I got this because I have a hot tools dyer.</li>
            <li>When I first received this product I didn&#x27;t really like it.</li>
            <li>I ended up using packaging tape to secure the biggest adapter, so in that respect I should probably give this four stars, but I love this diffuser so much, I&#x27;m willing to look past that one issue.</li>
            <li>Dryer nozzle is way too large.</li>
            <li>fit that tightly enough not to fall off.  </li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t think that I can use it much longer because it&#x27;s melting.</li>
            <li>I really, really wish this set had worked for my dryer.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;j&#x27;bere\\&quot;; nothing really fits</li>
            <li>Very sturdy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to save my money in future and buy either dryers that come with their own diffusers, or diffusers that are made to work with a specific dryer.</li>
            <li>This Hot Tools diffuser didn&#x27;t fit the dryer very well, even with the included adapters (and there are lots of them) as the dryer nozzle is too wide.</li>
            <li>The fingers also lift the hair, this is important if you have wavy hair which can have flat spots.  </li>
            <li>Originally bought for easier travel but will be using thus regularly.  </li>
            <li>I waited a full day for it to cool down and still not working.  </li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s not that great of a fit on my babyliss ceramix, but it works as long as I&#x27;m holding my head upside down, or the dryer upside down.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it if you have curly hair.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for a Helen of Troy hair dryer and it worked great however, keep in mind it will not fit any other dryers.</li>
            <li>More store should carryt this item as it&#x27;s hard to find a diffuser that will fit a different hair dryers.</li>
            <li>I had this Diffuser for fifteen years and it was time for a new one.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll have to wait until I need a new dryer.</li>
            <li>Make sure to take off blow dryer when finished, if left on it may melt the plastic that leads to over heating because venting holes may melt closed.</li>
            <li>It does get hot, but if you follow the instructions; remove when finished and use on low heat setting you will have no problems at all.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday but still melts some if I&#x27;m not careful or will fall out because it just doesn&#x27;t fit really well.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that even though it comes with three attachments, it didn&#x27;t fit a single hair dryer in our house.</li>
            <li>BUT in the end it caused the hair dryer to completely over heat</li>
            <li>When my old Conair dryer died (from old age--through no fault of the diffuser), I bought a dryer that came with a diffuser that was made for it.</li>
            <li>The adaptor works very well and woith the big drying head</li>
            <li>Maybe I haven&#x27;t used it enough, but this one wants to come off a lot too.</li>
            <li>so I had to search frantically when my old one broke into pieces after years of heat and use.  </li>
            <li>i believe it could work for more common dryers.</li>
            <li>I have a hot tools hair dryer and the diffuser always comes off because it is partially melted so I am in search of a new diffuser attachment.</li>
            <li>And it definitely won&#x27;t stay on if the dryer is on high.</li>
            <li>and I only use on low setting Never used on high.</li>
            <li>Wow is this big!</li>
            <li>It fits on the dryer, however it has barely any heat or air output and will NOT dry my hair.  </li>

            <li> Wow is this big!</li>
            <li> It fits on the dryer, however it has barely any heat or air output and will NOT dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> I thought this might cause less overheating than other diffusers I had seen or used because of the adapters and fit and the fact that it covers less of the dryer to work.  </li>
            <li> Only older dryers have nozzles small enough for this diffuser, they sell a dryer from the same brand, but I didn&#x27;t want to purchase another dryer.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to get a consistent look all over, but this diffuser does the job because of the size and fingers.  </li>
            <li> I even tried just holding it to the end of my dryer, it has lots of tiny holes and long fingers</li>
            <li> so the diffuser stays on as I dry.</li>
            <li> I bought this because a lot of the fingers had broken off of the diffuser that came with my hot tools hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> My drer is just a more expensive, small niche dryer</li>
            <li> when it arrived, it looks alot like the diffuser I had from the 80&#x27;s and threw away a few years back.  </li>
            <li> The advantage of this diffuser is that is is wide</li>
            <li> This did not fit my standard size hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> It will shoot off if you hold it upright like all other universals have a tendency to do.</li>
            <li> Getting a little more disappointed because it falls out of my dryer a lot now.</li>
            <li> (falls off) and is so big and clumsy.</li>
            <li> I recently had to purchase another one only because I have broken a few of the fingers during travels.  </li>
            <li> Previously, this diffuser lasted me about 7 years.  </li>

            <li> I bought this because a lot of the fingers had broken off of the diffuser that came with my hot tools hair dryer.  I thought this might cause less overheating than other diffusers I had seen or used because of the adapters and fit and the fact that it covers less of the dryer to work.  Anyway - for about 4 days I was loving it - fit great, worked great.  BUT in the end it caused the hair dryer to completely over heat and now the hair dryer is literally toast.  I waited a full day for it to cool down and still not working.  I am just going back to buying less expensive hair dryers and considering them disposable.</li>
            <li> I have a hot tools hair dryer and the diffuser always comes off because it is partially melted so I am in search of a new diffuser attachment. I thought this one would be great because it has different size adjustments to fit about any dryer, and that is the problem I am having in my search for a diffuser attachment.  It fits on the dryer, however it has barely any heat or air output and will NOT dry my hair.  I do not like what-so-ever and returned.</li>
            <li> The attachments didn&#x27;t really fit my dryer. The diffuser would pop off and either fall to the ground or go shooting away. When my old Conair dryer died (from old age--through no fault of the diffuser), I bought a dryer that came with a diffuser that was made for it. Problem solved. I&#x27;m giving this diffuser set away. Maybe it will fit someone else&#x27;s dryer. I&#x27;m going to save my money in future and buy either dryers that come with their own diffusers, or diffusers that are made to work with a specific dryer.</li>
            <li> I had this Diffuser for fifteen years and it was time for a new one. In the mean time I used the one that came with my store bought blow dryer what  a joke. This diffuser is superior and makes a big difference to curly hair. Curls are bouncy and defined. Attachments should fit any blow-dryer I have used it with a professional dryer and store bought one as well.  I also used this diffuser with great success when I was a hair stylist and clients always inquired about it because their curly hair looked so good.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when it arrived, it looks alot like the diffuser I had from the 80&#x27;s and threw away a few years back.  I&#x27;ve got three blow dryers and the largest fitting is TOO SMALL for any of them  :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband later &#x27;rigged&#x27; the largest attachment for me by permanently attaching a &#x27;ring&#x27; to our hairdryer so the diffuser stays on as I dry.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t fit my Helen of Troy dryer very well (falls off) and is so big and clumsy.</li>
            <li> It would be the best diffuser I&#x27;ve ever used, but the attachment (and the different sized connections too) are incredibly narrow and don&#x27;t fit any hairdryers I&#x27;ve tried it on. I even tried just holding it to the end of my dryer, it has lots of tiny holes and long fingers so there isn&#x27;t much air movement, but plenty of heat, it&#x27;s perfect for great curls, but I almost burned my hand off. Only older dryers have nozzles small enough for this diffuser, they sell a dryer from the same brand, but I didn&#x27;t want to purchase another dryer.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific diffuser.  One of the adapters fit my dryer and the diffuser fit that tightly enough not to fall off.  The advantage of this diffuser is that is is wide so you can \\&quot;cup\\&quot; and push up a lot of hair at once.  The fingers also lift the hair, this is important if you have wavy hair which can have flat spots.  My hair is thick and curwavy, and prone to the dreaded frizzies. It&#x27;s curly in some parts, wavy in others so it&#x27;s hard to get a consistent look all over, but this diffuser does the job because of the size and fingers.  I highly recommend it if you have curly hair.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was needing/looking for.</li>
            <li> I have a Conair 1875 Watt Ionic Conditioning Hair Dryer - and just in case you were wishing/hoping/&amp;#34;well maybe...&amp;#34; that it will fit - It does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diffuser is great otherwise - nicely made and BIG!</li>
            <li> My wife loves using diffusers, and she does like using this one. The only problem is that even though it comes with three attachments, it didn&#x27;t fit a single hair dryer in our house. She basically bends over and holds onto it whilst using it. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this just because you&#x27;re gambling if it will fit.</li>
            <li> at first it took a little maneuvering to figure out a way to hook one of the attachments to my blowdryer but one of them fits perfect on my revlon ionic dryer and i love it!! great diffuser, love the price, thanks.</li>
            <li> It has held up great and fits all of my hair in at the same time drying quickly and perfect.</li>
            <li> The box says fits with &amp;#34;most&amp;#34; Helen of Troy dyers, but it doesn&#x27;t say which ones. I&#x27;m aware that there are probably hundreds of models. For the record, it does not fit model 6037.</li>
            <li> Fits my conair yellow bird dryer perfectly&lt;br /&gt;I read some reviews about theirs melting... It does get hot, but if you follow the instructions; remove when finished and use on low heat setting you will have no problems at all. I&#x27;ve used mine about 30 times now and I get great curls, dries quickly and not having any melting issues ... FYI does not fit my Vidal Sassoon ionic 1875 dryer at all.... Dryer nozzle is way too large.</li>
            <li> Good extra large diffuser. I like the size since I can bunch a lot of hair into this. (Of course this is a downfall if you travel a lot and have to pack this into a suitcase) The fingers are a good length. They don&#x27;t extend much further than the sides of the diffuser and the air flows nicely all around your hair. I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars because the barrel that fits on your hair dryer has a tendency to get pretty hot. Also, it&#x27;s not that great of a fit on my babyliss ceramix, but it works as long as I&#x27;m holding my head upside down, or the dryer upside down.  It will shoot off if you hold it upright like all other universals have a tendency to do. And it definitely won&#x27;t stay on if the dryer is on high.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a Helen of Troy hair dryer and it worked great however, keep in mind it will not fit any other dryers.</li>
            <li> Great for curling hair for an individual who has to perm her hair, this helps to create volume and long curled strands.</li>
            <li> Falls off hair dryer when it gets too hot.</li>
            <li> excellent product!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This diffuser is a good product, it is of professional quality and it the mulpiple adapters made it work with my hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Gives me perfect curls! Shortens the dryingtime of the hair because its so big! Put doesent fit to my hairdryer ðŸ˜Ÿ</li>
            <li> Love this Diffuser and you r able to make it fit to almos any Blow Drier ;-) LOVE IT !!!!!</li>
            <li> More store should carryt this item as it&#x27;s hard to find a diffuser that will fit a different hair dryers. The adaptor works very well and woith the big drying head it covers more area of hair that the smaller ones.</li>
            <li> When I first received this product I didn&#x27;t really like it. Finally figured out how to attach it to my dryer but it&#x27;s melted some of the end off so I have to becareful with it. I use it everyday but still melts some if I&#x27;m not careful or will fall out because it just doesn&#x27;t fit really well. Would give it 5 stars if it fit &amp; didn&#x27;t melt because the size is perfect. (I&#x27;ve tried all the adapters also).&lt;br /&gt; ***Update 6-6-2013***&lt;br /&gt;Still melting with each use and I only use on low setting Never used on high. Getting a little more disappointed because it falls out of my dryer a lot now. Really wanted to Love this product and I&#x27;m still trying to.....</li>
            <li> I have been using this product fro some time now and love it. I have curly hair and have tried just about it all. This is the first defuser that really does do a good job with my hair.</li>
            <li> This is the best diffuser I have ever used.  Previously, this diffuser lasted me about 7 years.  I recently had to purchase another one only because I have broken a few of the fingers during travels.  I highly recommend this diffuser for women with curly hair looking for more volume and definition of their curls.</li>
            <li> Originally bought for easier travel but will be using thus regularly.  Magic hairdrying w no frizz.  Combo with kosher kurls product!</li>
            <li> I got this because I have a hot tools dyer. My dyer has a diffuser that snaps on and I hate it. It&#x27;s always falling off. I thought that this one would be better because it fits over the dyer. Maybe I haven&#x27;t used it enough, but this one wants to come off a lot too. I might be able to get to hang of it soon. It does seem to heat more than my diffuser that came with my hot tools dyer.&lt;br /&gt;Update on this diffuser it is now melting. I have gotten used to using it and it no longer is falling off the top of the dyer. But I don&#x27;t think that I can use it much longer because it&#x27;s melting. So I recommend not getting it.</li>
            <li> This diffuser didn&#x27;t fit on my blow dryer, even when I attempted to use the size adjuster things. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> We tried every adapter that came with this diffuser but it would fall off the blow dryer until we used duct tape to attach it.</li>
            <li> I have used this diffuser for over ten years.  It was originally put out by hot tools.  They discontinued it so I had to search frantically when my old one broke into pieces after years of heat and use.  Cheap and works great my sister and I both are curlies and we love it!</li>
            <li> I thought this would fit my blow dryer but the attachments.  I understood that it fits most dryers.  Mine is a Conair which is very common.  The tool itself is fine but I&#x27;ll have to wait until I need a new dryer.</li>
            <li> This is the only diffuser to use.  The shape is the key.</li>
            <li> Wow is this big! I have to diffuse my hair to get it to curl decently, and it cut my drying time in half. I can get so much of my hair into the bowl, and its really deep, so it coils nicely. I have a Conair Ionic Ceramic Cord Keeper 1875, and the diffuser that came with it wasn&#x27;t great. This Hot Tools diffuser didn&#x27;t fit the dryer very well, even with the included adapters (and there are lots of them) as the dryer nozzle is too wide. I ended up using packaging tape to secure the biggest adapter, so in that respect I should probably give this four stars, but I love this diffuser so much, I&#x27;m willing to look past that one issue.</li>
            <li> I really, really wish this set had worked for my dryer. But it wasnt the manafucaturers fault so i cant give it a bad rating. My drer is just a more expensive, small niche dryer \\&quot;j&#x27;bere\\&quot;; nothing really fits it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But i believe it could work for more common dryers. It had the biggest \\&quot;bowl\\&quot; of the three diffusers i purchased and the plastic felt stronger and of better quality. I really liked the attachments because they seemed to provide a better attachment than other diffusers. Unfortanetly, none of them attached to my dryer so i had to return.</li>
            <li> This did not fit my standard size hair dryer.  Make sure to measure the dimensions of your dryer nozzle, before you buy this item.</li>
            <li> This type of deep dish diffusercreates the best curls. Very sturdy. Make sure to take off blow dryer when finished, if left on it may melt the plastic that leads to over heating because venting holes may melt closed.</li>
            <li> The difusser head is large and great for thick hair, I love mine!&lt;br /&gt;There were sever attachments to make it fit properly on your hair drying however I couldn not get to fit on either of my dryers so I had to duct tape it, which works fine it just looks a little tacky.</li>
