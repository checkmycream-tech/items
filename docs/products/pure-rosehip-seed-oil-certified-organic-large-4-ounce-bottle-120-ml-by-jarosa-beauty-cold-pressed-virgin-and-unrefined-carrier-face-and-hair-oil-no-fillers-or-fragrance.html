            <li>smell is not so nice</li>
            <li>I did receive this product at a reduced rate to give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>Our oil is extracted from the seeds of the rose bush.</li>
            <li>I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>All thoughts are my own and have not been influenced.</li>
            <li>My skin looks great, this is the perfect facial moisturizer with added benefits.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used rose hip seed oil before now</li>
            <li>Nice for my hair,too.</li>
            <li>It kind of reminds me of grape seed oil.</li>
            <li>Used on it&#x27;s own or as an ingredient in a DIY skin preparation, rosehip seed oil is a multi-use mini-miracle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I received a sample of the product from the manufacturer for purpose of trial and honest review.</li>
            <li>I was not compensated for this review: all conclusions are my own responsibility.</li>
            <li>I did not know what to expect from a rose oil.</li>
            <li>rose</li>
            <li>This oil does not smell like olive oil, but it does have its own smell.</li>
            <li>It is made from rose hip seeds, so don&#x27;t expect it to smell like roses.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This particular oil is quite wonderful.</li>
            <li>I tested it, and loved it, which is why I left a great review!</li>
            <li>The pump is convenient and good for easy application.</li>
            <li>so, since it is a natural oil with no preservatives, it&#x27;s probably best to keep the bottle refrigerated.  </li>
            <li>I can get the perfect amount this way and not waste any.  </li>
            <li>hip oil is by far the best I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>This is better than coconut oil and rose oil for the face.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also the best price so far for certified organic rosehip oil.</li>
            <li>The pump works great and lets out just the right amount</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling so nice!  </li>
            <li>To be honest I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to be able to continue using the product</li>
            <li>have tried so many creams on her and this by far has worked the quickest and the best.</li>
            <li>and it sounded too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>It is very light and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy at all</li>
            <li>It does not leave my hands feeling greasy, which is very important to me.</li>
            <li>It is very light and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy at all</li>
            <li>The pump lid is easy to use &amp; dispenses a nice amount of oil.</li>
            <li>Consistency is nice and goes on easily.</li>
            <li>Make me face sooooooo smooth and healthy looking !</li>
            <li>love every thing about it including the cost/value but not fond of the smell.</li>
            <li>I woke up with my skin moisturized more than it has ever been</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>My face has cleared up drastically and my skin is smooth and my pores aren&#x27;t as noticeable as they used to be!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d swear that even the hands and nails look better now</li>
            <li>Because of that you may not want to use it too generously before going out; perhaps it&#x27;s better as your nightly moisturizing beauty treatment.  </li>

            <li>And so many uses -</li>

            <li>I Love the Rosehip seed oil.</li>
            <li>The palms of my hands look better and are no longer itchy anymore.  </li>
            <li>Love this oil.  </li>
            <li>but I think I like this bottle better because of the pump.  </li>
            <li>I love saving steps.</li>
            <li>Product as described, I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li>I personally used it on my face and was really impressed.</li>
            <li>At this point, I&#x27;m impressed with its basic moisturizing properties.</li>
            <li>I will report more after another week or two.</li>
            <li>I love to use this oil on my hands and cuticles.</li>
            <li>I love the simplicity of it and how well it has made my skin feel.  </li>
            <li>pleased with the quality of this rosehip seed oil I was given to test.</li>
            <li>Love this oil and so glad that I purchased it.</li>
            <li>My skin tone is more even and it stays hydrated all day.</li>
            <li>Love the Omegas.  </li>
            <li>and my skin stays moisturized, so I am sure it helps.  </li>
            <li>the issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product came in a amber glass bottle with a &#x27;squirt&#x27; dispenser top.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for about a week now, and I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing in another week you will not even be able to tell I had a burn there.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more....</li>
            <li>I am pleased with their customer service.</li>
            <li>This is lovely.</li>
            <li>Absolutely wonderful, I put it on my face twice daily after cleaning!</li>
            <li>The box this came in also included a business card to contact the owner directly, and the bottle was designed very beautifully with a unique, and quality</li>
            <li>A great product I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The pump system works great as you can easily control how much you get at one time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty good quality oil.</li>
            <li>However, I do enjoy using the oil and have found it to be of very fine quality.</li>
            <li>but this is worth the switch!!  </li>
            <li>I also use it on my dry frizzy hair and it works so awesome on my hair too!</li>
            <li>I also use it on my dry frizzy hair and it works so awesome on my hair too!</li>
            <li>I also use it on my dry frizzy hair and it works so awesome on my hair too!  </li>
            <li>Happy that there is a natural option!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell super pleasant, but the smell fades quickly and it&#x27;s totally worth it for the way this amazing stuff works.</li>
            <li>hip oil is light, silky smooth, goes on easily, smells nice, and is non-greasy.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I was able to test this oil for my honest review because I have the softest skin now thanks to it also.</li>
            <li>So I get Rosehip oil and find that the price is right and the benefits are amazing.</li>
            <li>It also comes with a pump for easy access.</li>
            <li>oil has a slightly strong scent, but it is not unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s scent is strongly of vitamins and earthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is great for my skin and great on my pocketbook, replacing many more expensive moisturizers I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The vitamin C helps stimulate collagen production and helps reduce fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Rosehips are loaded with Vitamin C, and this quickly absorbed oil is an excellent healing tonic for winter drab skin, bruises, dry patches, and all around skin health.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving my Pure Rosehip Seed Oil.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a huge improvement with hydration for both.</li>
            <li>It goes on like an oil, rather shiny, giving your skin a healthy glow, and is absorbed into your skin leaving a smooth texture not an oily one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>From asking various friends I&#x27;ve learned this is also really great for the postpartum period</li>
            <li>received this product free for review purposes.</li>
            <li>It rejuvenates hair, skin and nails and is relatively cheap compared to all of the benefits it has.  </li>
            <li>Though the smell is not my favorite the results are so worth it.</li>
            <li>I keep it refrigerated and it seems to stay fresh and potent.</li>
            <li>I use it every night as my moisturizer and have had such great results.</li>
            <li>Because of all the amazing benefits I&#x27;ve ready about rosehip seed oil, I decided I&#x27;d give this a shot.</li>
            <li>After I thoroughly wash my face, I dab a light amount of the oil on face and rub it in.</li>
            <li>Silky smooth is how my skin feels after using this oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even started using the oil left on my hands to rub into my cuticles and they look great.  </li>
            <li>It is such a great moisturizer</li>
            <li>The bottle arrived securely and well packaged.</li>
            <li>Also great as a carrier for blending with almost any essential oil.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>That way it&#x27;s easier to rub in and more easily absorbed.</li>

            <li>I had high hopes in ordering this rosehip seed oil; however, it is more odor is more pungent than any other brands I have tried (or sniffed at the store) -- and my daughter agrees.  </li>
            <li>Now when I first used the oil I was quite grossed out by the smell.</li>
            <li>First let me say....</li>
            <li>&quot; (aka rosehip seed oil) for years, even living for many years in South America next door to Chile, where this oil became a skin treatment sensation in the 1980s.  </li>
            <li>I could be looking \\&quot;younger than springtime\\&quot; rather than just OK for my age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I first opened it</li>
            <li>but I had run out and never went running back to the store for more until l got this bottle.</li>
            <li>I love this oil especially because it is certified organic.</li>
            <li>It seems thicker and more concentrated than my last bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>At the rate I&#x27;m going the bottle should last me a year or more, so it is also a grea value.</li>
            <li>I have also put several drops in my hair conditioner making my hair more softer.</li>

            <li>I was worried at first that it would leave an oily residue</li>
            <li>This even had a better effect than the topical steroids or the vitamin E</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty neutral, maybe a bit.. earthy?</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to see what else its capable of!</li>
            <li>It feels so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I am very please with the results!</li>

            <li>Like all skin care products, it is recommended to test a small area of your skin to make sure there is no sensitivity.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this product a 3 (neutral) stars, but uncertain if I&#x27;m willing to give it another try in the future.</li>
            <li>My hair is long, fine and dry thanks to the cold here in Wisconsin and this oil helps with my fly away hair also.</li>
            <li>It also held the moisture so my skin did not dry out as fast..</li>
            <li>True organic cold pressed rose hip seed oil does not smell like roses.</li>
            <li>When I first used it, I was a little concerned, because it comes out a golden color, but when you rub it in, the color completely disappears.</li>
            <li>This particular oil I like because it&#x27;s a lightweight oil with no other ingredients.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not into chemicals and love to stick to natural oils, but I&#x27;ve tried natural oils in the past and found they just clogged my pores and broke me out.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no strong fragrance and it absorbs easily into the skin.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no strong fragrance and it absorbs easily into the skin.</li>
            <li>but it wouldn&#x27;t be pure roseship oil if it smelt any different.</li>
            <li>Because it is cold pressed and pure, it is rich in vitamins A &amp; C and essential fatty acids needed to maintain beautiful skin.</li>
            <li>It has a very minimal smell which dissipates quickly.  </li>
            <li>This is one great oil, organic, unrefined, cold pressed.  </li>
            <li>no harsh chemicals!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So smoothing and soft  </li>
            <li>My hands are staying soft in the freezing weather, and I will continue to use this throughout the year.</li>
            <li>I put it on my face at night and in the morning my skin feels so soft and</li>
            <li>After I wash this out, my hair is really soft and not fried and frizzy looking anymore.  </li>
            <li>I like that it is all natural</li>

            <li>This product has exceeded my expectations thus far.</li>
            <li>I also use it at night on my feet and cover them with socks to awaken to soft, moisturized feet in the morning.</li>

            <li>If you would like an all natural product to help with anti-aging, sun damaged skin and help with scars</li>
            <li>I knew going into this that it would have a nutty smell, as opposed to a rosy smell, so I was pleasantly surprised that it is tolerable.</li>
            <li>But I am saving the old dropper bottle to travel with since it was a 1 oz bottle.  </li>
            <li>soft, silky feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any oil can go rancid, so keep it in the fridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also just made a homemade lotion using this oil and some shea and cocoa butters and have been using it on my toddler&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I mention these two, because that is my only real basis for comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any direct results with wrinkles or stretch marks, but I will say an application makes me feel like I am glowing</li>
            <li>She is 16 months old.</li>
            <li>let you know once my project get complete.</li>
            <li>and I must say that I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>before i had to remove the bottle, unscrew the top, drop a few drops, put it on, then put the bottle back in the fridge.  </li>
            <li>I was happy to read that its only ingredient is 100% pure Rosehip Oil and Certified Organic, compared to all those other expensive creams that contain so much additives.</li>
            <li>not only was my face vibrant and clear, but the flaky skin was GONE!</li>
            <li>Quick to absorb and long lasting</li>
            <li>I put a little rosehip oil and it fixed her right up!</li>

            <li>This bottle will last a very long time as you don&#x27;t need much to moisturize a large area.  </li>
            <li>found this particular brand (Jarosa) to be quite soothing for my facial skin.</li>
            <li>It soaks in quickly and continues to moisturize for longer than a typical lotion.  </li>

            <li>I have to start this review with a big WOW!</li>
            <li>I like because it&#x27;s a lightweight oil with no other ingredients.</li>
            <li>Rose hip oil used as a facial moisturizer has anti-aging benefits due to the antioxidants and nutrients, which include essential fatty acids, vitamin E, vitamin C and B-carotene, a precursor to vitamin A.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that in the long run it&#x27;s cheaper because oils last SO much longer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it daily for nearly a month now and the bottle barely looks used.  </li>
            <li>No burning sensation and by the next morning it was nearly gone.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve barely put a dent in it.</li>
            <li>and I have barely made a dent in the amount in the bottle.  </li>
            <li>Mixed it with my normal facial oil</li>
            <li>I have smelled things that smell better and worse.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s less oily than other oils, so it doesn&#x27;t spread over your skin as easily.</li>
            <li>It is a great product to use during winter time since the cold tends to dry out skin.</li>
            <li>No greasy residue is left behind, just healthy skin.  </li>
            <li>Just after few times bites started to heal and less visible, obviously oil does work :)</li>
            <li>Some of the smaller spots have disappeared completely, the flaky skin is gone, the smaller scabs are gone and the larger ones are healing.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t feel like my pores are clogging up with use, and even when using it in my hair it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down as much as coconut oil did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I should note that my hair comes down to the small of my back and is  super fine, I only needed a few pumps of oil to do my scalp and all of my hair.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Pure Rosehip Seed Oil for a few days now as part of nightly routine.</li>

            <li> I haven&#x27;t used rose hip seed oil before now</li>
            <li> Nice for my hair,too.</li>
            <li> It kind of reminds me of grape seed oil.</li>
            <li> Used on it&#x27;s own or as an ingredient in a DIY skin preparation, rosehip seed oil is a multi-use mini-miracle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I received a sample of the product from the manufacturer for purpose of trial and honest review.</li>
            <li> I was not compensated for this review: all conclusions are my own responsibility.</li>
            <li> I did not know what to expect from a rose oil.</li>
            <li> rose</li>
            <li> This oil does not smell like olive oil, but it does have its own smell.</li>

            <li> I tested it, and loved it, which is why I left a great review!</li>
            <li> The pump is convenient and good for easy application.</li>
            <li> so, since it is a natural oil with no preservatives, it&#x27;s probably best to keep the bottle refrigerated.  </li>
            <li> I can get the perfect amount this way and not waste any.  </li>
            <li> hip oil is by far the best I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> This is better than coconut oil and rose oil for the face.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also the best price so far for certified organic rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> The pump works great and lets out just the right amount</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling so nice!  </li>
            <li> To be honest I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to be able to continue using the product</li>
            <li> have tried so many creams on her and this by far has worked the quickest and the best.</li>
            <li> and it sounded too good to be true.  </li>

            <li> It does not leave my hands feeling greasy, which is very important to me.</li>
            <li> It is very light and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy at all</li>
            <li> The pump lid is easy to use &amp; dispenses a nice amount of oil.</li>
            <li> Consistency is nice and goes on easily.</li>
            <li> Make me face sooooooo smooth and healthy looking !</li>
            <li> love every thing about it including the cost/value but not fond of the smell.</li>
            <li> I woke up with my skin moisturized more than it has ever been</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!&lt;br /&gt;When</li>

            <li> I&#x27;d swear that even the hands and nails look better now</li>
            <li> Because of that you may not want to use it too generously before going out; perhaps it&#x27;s better as your nightly moisturizing beauty treatment.  </li>

            <li> The palms of my hands look better and are no longer itchy anymore.  </li>
            <li> Love this oil.  </li>

            <li> I love saving steps.</li>
            <li> Product as described, I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li> I personally used it on my face and was really impressed.</li>
            <li> At this point, I&#x27;m impressed with its basic moisturizing properties.</li>
            <li> I will report more after another week or two.</li>
            <li> I love to use this oil on my hands and cuticles.</li>
            <li> I love the simplicity of it and how well it has made my skin feel.  </li>

            <li> My skin tone is more even and it stays hydrated all day.</li>
            <li> Love the Omegas.  </li>
            <li> and my skin stays moisturized, so I am sure it helps.  </li>
            <li> the issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product came in a amber glass bottle with a &#x27;squirt&#x27; dispenser top.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for about a week now, and I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing in another week you will not even be able to tell I had a burn there.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more....</li>
            <li> I am pleased with their customer service.</li>
            <li> This is lovely.</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful, I put it on my face twice daily after cleaning!</li>
            <li> The box this came in also included a business card to contact the owner directly, and the bottle was designed very beautifully with a unique, and quality</li>
            <li> A great product I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The pump system works great as you can easily control how much you get at one time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good quality oil.</li>
            <li> However, I do enjoy using the oil and have found it to be of very fine quality.</li>
            <li> but this is worth the switch!!  </li>
            <li> I also use it on my dry frizzy hair and it works so awesome on my hair too!</li>
            <li> I also use it on my dry frizzy hair and it works so awesome on my hair too!</li>
            <li> I also use it on my dry frizzy hair and it works so awesome on my hair too!  </li>
            <li> Happy that there is a natural option!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell super pleasant, but the smell fades quickly and it&#x27;s totally worth it for the way this amazing stuff works.</li>
            <li> hip oil is light, silky smooth, goes on easily, smells nice, and is non-greasy.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I was able to test this oil for my honest review because I have the softest skin now thanks to it also.</li>
            <li> So I get Rosehip oil and find that the price is right and the benefits are amazing.</li>
            <li> It also comes with a pump for easy access.</li>
            <li> oil has a slightly strong scent, but it is not unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s scent is strongly of vitamins and earthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is great for my skin and great on my pocketbook, replacing many more expensive moisturizers I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The vitamin C helps stimulate collagen production and helps reduce fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Rosehips are loaded with Vitamin C, and this quickly absorbed oil is an excellent healing tonic for winter drab skin, bruises, dry patches, and all around skin health.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving my Pure Rosehip Seed Oil.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a huge improvement with hydration for both.</li>
            <li> It goes on like an oil, rather shiny, giving your skin a healthy glow, and is absorbed into your skin leaving a smooth texture not an oily one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> From asking various friends I&#x27;ve learned this is also really great for the postpartum period</li>
            <li> received this product free for review purposes.</li>
            <li> It rejuvenates hair, skin and nails and is relatively cheap compared to all of the benefits it has.  </li>
            <li> Though the smell is not my favorite the results are so worth it.</li>
            <li> I keep it refrigerated and it seems to stay fresh and potent.</li>
            <li> I use it every night as my moisturizer and have had such great results.</li>
            <li> Because of all the amazing benefits I&#x27;ve ready about rosehip seed oil, I decided I&#x27;d give this a shot.</li>
            <li> After I thoroughly wash my face, I dab a light amount of the oil on face and rub it in.</li>
            <li> Silky smooth is how my skin feels after using this oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even started using the oil left on my hands to rub into my cuticles and they look great.  </li>
            <li> It is such a great moisturizer</li>
            <li> The bottle arrived securely and well packaged.</li>
            <li> Also great as a carrier for blending with almost any essential oil.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> That way it&#x27;s easier to rub in and more easily absorbed.</li>
            <li> I love that this oil is certified organic, cold pressed, virgin  and unrefined because when I&#x27;m using something on my skin, I want to make sure it&#x27;s the best quality I can get and this product is definitely the best!</li>
            <li> It soaks right in and my damaged skin feels so much better.  </li>
            <li> It came right away, and I love the product.</li>
            <li> There is a very light, natural scent - it kind of reminds me of a mild olive oil.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this effective product.</li>
            <li> My reason for purchasing it originally though was format stretch marks.</li>
            <li> two different ways - and have seen a remarkable difference in my skin&#x27;s ability to retain moisture.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love how they suggest you try in an area first to test for allergies - no allergies here.  </li>
            <li> This is also a great product to use on cuticles and dry heels.</li>
            <li> It also works great for dry flaky skin.</li>
            <li> This is great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for helping with dry skin, diminishing scars and stretch marks, and has helped me regain control of the eczema on the palms of my hands.  </li>
            <li> , I have extremely sensitive skin so the fact that there was no irritation makes this product even better!</li>
            <li> It absorbs pretty quickly, which I love.</li>
            <li> It has a soft scent that is kind of earthy or rich not a perfume type smell at all .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not unpleasant, but it does have a very distinct smell to it.</li>
            <li> , it is amazing how soft and silky my skin is and there is no residue or a feeling like I am lathering up with oil</li>
            <li> Most sites I&#x27;ve researched do not recommend it for acne or for very oily skin.  </li>

            <li> BTW, I keep it in the fridge for the soothing cool to the itch of the psoriasis.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but really orange.</li>
            <li> My face feels nice, soft &amp; moisturized.</li>

            <li> and should last you a good while unless you plan to slather it all over your body (which is not really a bad idea),</li>
            <li> I have been using it for over a month now and my super dry skin has never looked and felt better!!</li>
            <li> had to come up with my own routine for this to work effectively for me, but once I got it down, it has been</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and any perfumed or chemical laden lotions I use will leave me with bumps and rashes, but this oil is great and does not upset my sensitive skin at all.</li>
            <li> I first tested the product on my hand, but the &#x27;fishy&#x27; odor was so strong that I had to wash it off.  </li>
            <li> Since I started using this oil on my face my skin has developed a healthy glow, feels silky and fine lines seem to be disappearing before my eyes.</li>
            <li> Works great after showering and slathering it on my dry feet, followed by a pair of warm socks and left on overnight!</li>
            <li> Most important to me, this is all natural...</li>
            <li> But, the odor dissipates quickly so to me</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and was well wrapped.</li>
            <li> Love that this is all natural and synthetic free.</li>
            <li> I love that this oil is so versatile and can be used all over for so many different reasons.</li>
            <li> I have noticed my face feels much more moisturized and overall more radiant.</li>
            <li> I will for sure be back for more of this when my bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> I use this in the evening after a shower and it soaks into my skin quickly.  </li>
            <li> It has an earthy scent - not flowery that dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> now I give this oil four stars, to be upgraded in the future if I experience any exceptional results after continued use.</li>
            <li> This rosehip oil soaks right in though and leaves me feeling nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> I have used this natural oil for awhile now and find it to be a very nice natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li> To me it is not unpleasant...</li>

            <li> Although it is a \\&quot;dry\\&quot; oil (unlike those such as coconut, jojoba, or shea butter) and absorbs more easily into your skin, it is still an oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I feel so truly blessed to have discovered such a fine, affordable product!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes in ordering this rosehip seed oil; however, it is more odor is more pungent than any other brands I have tried (or sniffed at the store) -- and my daughter agrees.  </li>
            <li> Now when I first used the oil I was quite grossed out by the smell.</li>
            <li> First let me say....</li>
            <li> &quot; (aka rosehip seed oil) for years, even living for many years in South America next door to Chile, where this oil became a skin treatment sensation in the 1980s.  </li>
            <li> I could be looking \\&quot;younger than springtime\\&quot; rather than just OK for my age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I first opened it</li>
            <li> but I had run out and never went running back to the store for more until l got this bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this oil especially because it is certified organic.</li>
            <li> It seems thicker and more concentrated than my last bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> At the rate I&#x27;m going the bottle should last me a year or more, so it is also a grea value.</li>
            <li> I have also put several drops in my hair conditioner making my hair more softer.</li>
            <li> You may cup in your hand and add a drop of your favorite essential oil.</li>
            <li> I like this product make my skin soft n smooth</li>
            <li> I have been using it consistently for almost a month</li>
            <li> and I really like it!</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel soft and smooth without leaving it oily.</li>
            <li> I was worried at first that it would leave an oily residue</li>
            <li> This even had a better effect than the topical steroids or the vitamin E</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty neutral, maybe a bit.. earthy?</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see what else its capable of!</li>
            <li> It feels so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I am very please with the results!</li>
            <li> I never thought I would enjoy using a natural product over the face lotion I have used for years</li>

            <li> It absorbed into my skin quickly, made my skin feel baby soft.</li>

            <li> What I really like about this oil is that if I use it after a shower in the evening, my face still feels smooth and soft when I wake up in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Perfect for stretchmarks, excessive dry areas and use as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have no affiliation with the company at all, and I am not required to leave a positive review.</li>
            <li> Without my usual chemical exfoliation, my face became very dry and flakey, but after a good scrub and brush and a nice thick coating of this oil, I&#x27;m all good.  </li>
            <li> as long as you don&#x27;t put your hands to your face you are ok</li>
            <li> in the morning this grandma of 63 yrs, feels rejuvenated 😊😊😊, my skin feels soft and full of moisture.</li>

            <li> It does not leave a thick film after applying and leaves hair and skin nice and silky!</li>
            <li> As a positive side effect, my hair was damaged and kind of fried looking from other products I had been using and this Rosehip Seed Oil has repaired that!  </li>
            <li> I use a little in my hair to fight static!</li>
            <li> The reason for this is because I have SUPER sensitive, acne-prone skin.  </li>
            <li> I also was never able to use a moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;I was able to try this product for free, so I took up the offer.  </li>
            <li> The skin around my scar is super soft.  </li>

            <li> I have skin that is highly sensitized to weather changes - while it is better living in the southeast with higher humidity, I still have issues with flaky / dry skin that if not treated, will disintegrate into bleeding.  </li>

            <li> Goes on nicely with little to no oily feel.</li>

            <li> I plan to continue use of this product based on only a few days use and successful results.</li>
            <li> My hands are so dry from washing them so often this season and one pump of this oil after each hand washing has kept them soft and healthy.</li>

            <li> Im always looking for pure and natural skin care.</li>
            <li> I am amazed how soft my skin is after two weeks using this pure rosehip seed oil.</li>
            <li> After using this oil for a little over a month, I LOVE what it has done for my skin.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re familiar with other rich, cold-pressed botanical oils such as extra-virgin olive oil, you know they have a distinctive smell.</li>
            <li> only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell of the oil.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous products, spending more money than I care to count for a cure for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> , My oldest daughter (13) has extremely dry skin, I had put some on the affected areas and when she woke up the next morning the spots were noticeably better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only noticeable when I hold my arm right under my nose.</li>
            <li> After trying so many very expensive department store creams like, Clinique, Ester Lauder, Lancome, and never really felt like anything great happened to my skin, I decided to try Rosehip Seed Oil.</li>
            <li> I can&amp;#34;t live without this now.  </li>
            <li> , this is my new</li>
            <li> When I received the new bottle, I was eager to try it, but I didn&#x27;t have any lavender oil, so I tried a couple drops with my Olay cucumber body lotion and rubbed onto my hands.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This product is true to description and meets all the criteria of being a true cold pressed organic single source rose hip seed oil.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I used to use on my face was water with my microfiber cloth (brand I won&#x27;t mention), most other cleaners either made my face break out</li>
            <li> There is no particular odor, it absorbs quickly into the skin so there is no leftover oily residue.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my face, hands and stretch marks consistently for the last week.  </li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li> when I get many small bumps on my face</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Comes in a dark amber glass bottle to protect the integrity of the oil from light exposure.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling soft and supple!</li>
            <li> Like all skin care products, it is recommended to test a small area of your skin to make sure there is no sensitivity.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this product a 3 (neutral) stars, but uncertain if I&#x27;m willing to give it another try in the future.</li>
            <li> My hair is long, fine and dry thanks to the cold here in Wisconsin and this oil helps with my fly away hair also.</li>
            <li> It also held the moisture so my skin did not dry out as fast..</li>
            <li> True organic cold pressed rose hip seed oil does not smell like roses.</li>
            <li> When I first used it, I was a little concerned, because it comes out a golden color, but when you rub it in, the color completely disappears.</li>
            <li> This particular oil I like because it&#x27;s a lightweight oil with no other ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not into chemicals and love to stick to natural oils, but I&#x27;ve tried natural oils in the past and found they just clogged my pores and broke me out.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no strong fragrance and it absorbs easily into the skin.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no strong fragrance and it absorbs easily into the skin.</li>
            <li> but it wouldn&#x27;t be pure roseship oil if it smelt any different.</li>
            <li> Because it is cold pressed and pure, it is rich in vitamins A &amp; C and essential fatty acids needed to maintain beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> It has a very minimal smell which dissipates quickly.  </li>
            <li> This is one great oil, organic, unrefined, cold pressed.  </li>
            <li> no harsh chemicals!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So smoothing and soft  </li>
            <li> My hands are staying soft in the freezing weather, and I will continue to use this throughout the year.</li>
            <li> I put it on my face at night and in the morning my skin feels so soft and</li>
            <li> After I wash this out, my hair is really soft and not fried and frizzy looking anymore.  </li>
            <li> I like that it is all natural</li>

            <li> But I am saving the old dropper bottle to travel with since it was a 1 oz bottle.  </li>

            <li> before i had to remove the bottle, unscrew the top, drop a few drops, put it on, then put the bottle back in the fridge.  </li>
            <li> I was happy to read that its only ingredient is 100% pure Rosehip Oil and Certified Organic, compared to all those other expensive creams that contain so much additives.</li>

            <li> I have smelled things that smell better and worse.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less oily than other oils, so it doesn&#x27;t spread over your skin as easily.</li>
            <li> It is a great product to use during winter time since the cold tends to dry out skin.</li>
            <li> No greasy residue is left behind, just healthy skin.  </li>

            <li> I should note that my hair comes down to the small of my back and is  super fine, I only needed a few pumps of oil to do my scalp and all of my hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Pure Rosehip Seed Oil for a few days now as part of nightly routine.</li>
            <li> Schenck, award-winning author of The Live Food Factor and several other books</li>
            <li> Very, very little is needed for an application, so I&#x27;m certain the 4 ounces will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> and I am a pretty die hard coconut oil user.</li>
            <li> I was having a problem with dry skin on my forehead and eyebrows and this definitely helped that.</li>
            <li> Because my skin is so dry and flaky, especially my arms and legs, I also apply a generous amount on my arms, elbows, legs, knees and feet.</li>
            <li> I only need to use one pump, my skin drinks it up in this dry desert LA winter weather.</li>
            <li> To deeply moisturize dry, damaged skin and problem areas like feet, heels, elbows, and hands.</li>
            <li> I also use this on my cuticles and it has done wonders especially in this dry weather.</li>
            <li> I took equal parts of this oil and emu oil, and rubbed it on my feet after dry buffing.</li>
            <li> The only other lotion I use regularly is heat-based to tingle and stimulate the nerves in my foot, which was injured while fighting a structure fire.  </li>
            <li> have very dry skin and having tested this oil daily for a week on my hands, feet and elbows</li>
            <li> It feels like we&#x27;ve tried every moisturizer on the market with only so-so results at preventing an eczema attack, and no luck with using a moisturizer to actually treat active eczema.  </li>
            <li> This oil, I love the results, however it does have a awkward smell</li>
            <li> When I received the oil I was pleased to see that it is cold pressed, so no chemical extraction processes are used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have horrid dark under eye circles and they were actually lighter by the following morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done this with coconut oil in the past and it left my hair soft</li>
            <li> I have horrid dark under eye circles and they were actually lighter by the following morning.</li>
            <li> A squirt goes a long way.</li>
            <li> daughter is just a few months old and had a dry scalp.</li>
            <li> A little oil goes a long way, even for larger areas, so it will definitely last quite a while.</li>
            <li> Mixed with other oils for a pre-shave.</li>
            <li> I got my bottle of rosehip oil just as I turned on my furnace and braced myself for a dry flaky face all winter.</li>
            <li> She has dry skin and brittle, dry hair</li>
            <li> It has helped a lot with the dry skin on my face and hands.</li>
            <li> I also use it on my elbows where I have severe dry patches (eczema)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it on the ends of my hair where it tends to be dry.</li>
            <li> It soothed my dry skin on my legs.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who has scars or that has chronic dry skin..</li>
            <li> If you have dry hair, you might want to soak it in this oil and wrap it in a towel overnight, then wash.</li>
            <li> She had said that the areas where her dry skin is didn&#x27;t hurt or itch that morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have been using on an area of my face that I had dry flaky skin from seasonal allergies, lets just say I was ecstatic when within a week</li>
            <li> /&gt;It can be used on the skin or hair, it even works wonders on dry, ragged cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;Rough cracked heels and/or scaly feet?</li>
            <li> 4 drops added to a &#x27;dry spray oil&#x27; that I use after a shower and bath, and the moisturizing effect lasts longer as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin was way too dry.</li>
            <li> For his dry scalp,  skin and feet.</li>
            <li> I use this oil on my husband&#x27;s dry, cracked feet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s packed with vitamins, antioxidants and essential fatty acids (especially linoleic and linolenic).  </li>
            <li> and so I have transferred a small amount into a small bottle to keep in the bathroom for use and the remainder stays fresh in the fridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I haven&#x27;t even had a single break out.  </li>
            <li> I use a small amount to remove makeup around the sensitive parts of my eyes.</li>
            <li> Had a really weird, but not bad smell.</li>
            <li> Now, I just open the fridge, press down and its on.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so a 4-ounce bottle will last a bit.</li>

            <li> I have also started using this on my daughter that has very dry skin.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I received a bad bottle or they all have that \\&quot;distinct scent\\&quot; but I returned it right away.    </li>
            <li> Apply to wrinkles and aged skin and to prevent the onset of symptoms for aging skin.</li>
            <li> and the rough skin is gone.</li>

            <li> OTHER USES:</li>
            <li> Add a boost of 3-6 pumps to your lotion, shampoo, conditioner, or other skin care product to improve the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It only takes one or two small squirts to cover them all.  </li>
            <li> I did get some little bumps on my skin in the forehead area, so I cut back from using it everyday.</li>
            <li> it comes to facial products I am usually very skeptical and do not like to try new things!!</li>
            <li> Hard to tell individual characteristics.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that some of the oils I&#x27;ve tried seem to not rub in all the way and leave me feeling greasy for a while.  </li>
            <li> It has helped lighten my age spots, and dark circles around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a small ( minor) skin pigmentation</li>
            <li> but yet it is thick enough that it stays where I apply it..</li>
            <li> I just delivered my third baby a few weeks ago and needed to work on getting rid of those lines!!</li>
            <li> My skin is softer and it has helped to diminish stretch marks on my stomach after having 3 babies in less than 5 years.  </li>
            <li> The oil color is typical rosehips seed oil, which has a orange-golden hue.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not necessarily true.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not necessarily true.  </li>
            <li> It also helps you use less oil, and thus save a little money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> few drops directly on serious problem areas (elbows, knees and heels) daily-</li>
            <li> This oil can also be used for the hair: for dull, dry hair, or for dandruff in the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The dry winter air is not kind to my face and hands but this rosehip seed oil has worked wonders.  </li>
            <li> I did a little research and a bit of eye rolling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still there, but it has faded a little bit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil on him for a little over a week now.  </li>
            <li> It not only helps prevent flare ups in her when used regularly, if she comes into contact with someone like a chlorinated pool which always makes her eczema get all crazy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that adding a few drops of lavender oil essence (12 drops to 1 oz.</li>

            <li> I had done some online reading and found a few tips that said to massage the oil into your scalp and then through your hair anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hrs before a shower so I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> Just massage warmed oil into your scalp and hair, leave in for a few minutes, and wash with shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this rosehip seed oil since I got it a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> I have a scar from a visit to the dermatologist a few months ago, and I&#x27;ve been applying the oil to the scar once a day.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t waste anything.</li>
            <li> I have been using for a few weeks now and have noticed some clearing of some blemishes in my skin.</li>
            <li> It leaves it silky with no sign of dead ends.</li>
            <li> It made my hair a bit heavy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the oil for about 2 weeks now and it has made a difference that I have not experienced without massive quantities of heavily-applied, greasy creams and lotions.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> It does have an earthy smell, but you get used to it in a few days.</li>
            <li> It has a very slight smell to it when it comes out of the bottle, but the smell doesn&#x27;t linger.  </li>
            <li> I agree with some of review, smell is a bit fishy, but  it is raw product, without any perfume added to it, but it is does the job.</li>
            <li> I have varicose veins on my legs and after a few weeks of using this oil on them they have lightened up and are hardly noticeably.</li>
            <li> After washing my face, I apply a small amount of this over the face and neck, massaging it in.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lazy about running to the fridge to get my beauty treatment</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used rosehip seed oil in the past for my stretch marks</li>
            <li> The amber colored bottle is 4 ounces with a convenient spray pump, which doesn&#x27;t mist the oil, but yields as small an amount as you need by adjusting your pressure on the pump.  </li>
            <li> &#x27;go to&#x27; booster for my usual</li>
            <li> We have used prescription cream in the past for this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is softer and the lines aren&#x27;t as dark!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie, I was a bit skeptical because I&#x27;d never really heard about it</li>
            <li> I use it on the face as a moisturizer and it works well for that purpose, especially in the cold winter climate.</li>
            <li> The smell is bad, but it does not last and is a small price for the silky feeling that lasts forever or until you wash.</li>
            <li> but if you do it is not pleasant.</li>
            <li> In an effort to rid myself of unnecessary chemicals, I switched to moisturizing with oils after my shower instead of lotion.  </li>
            <li> This is for people serious about their moisture!</li>
            <li> Seriously thank you Jarosa!</li>
            <li> Does have a slight oily residue, not as bad as coconut oil.</li>
            <li> and I have seen a dramatic difference.</li>
            <li> and I even think this oil has helped with my random acne breakouts.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like roses, unfortunately, but it does work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This oil is also cold pressed and unrefined to retain its goodness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it is a bit cold when applying.</li>

            <li> Worst thing would be a few days with a breakout.</li>

            <li> Has nothing bad for your skin to absorb.  </li>
            <li> Also, when I opened it and took a whiff, it smelled SOOOOOOOOOO BAD</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> product is as stated.. would order it again.</li>
            <li> love every thing about it including the cost/value but not fond of the smell.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous products, spending more money than I care to count for a cure for my dry skin. I applied this at night before going to bed. I woke up with my skin moisturized more than it has ever been, I have extremely sensitive skin so the fact that there was no irritation makes this product even better! I highly recommend Pure Rosehip Seed Oil!! I received to review or received at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Now when I first used the oil I was quite grossed out by the smell. To be honest I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to be able to continue using the product the smell was so bad. But within a matter of seconds the smell had subsided, and I was left with an odorless oil. And let me tell you I am glad I kept using it! It is wonderful my skin appears so much brighter and fresher and I even think this oil has helped with my random acne breakouts. Really and truly a great product!</li>
            <li> First let me say....I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to facial products I am usually very skeptical and do not like to try new things!! The reason for this is because I have SUPER sensitive, acne-prone skin.  The only thing that I used to use on my face was water with my microfiber cloth (brand I won&#x27;t mention), most other cleaners either made my face break out or my eye lids get super red, dry, and itchy...I also was never able to use a moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;I was able to try this product for free, so I took up the offer.  I am so glad I did!  I WILL NEVER USE ANOTHER PRODUCT ON MY FACE! Even after 2 days of use, I could tell a difference.  I have now been using this product for almost 2 weeks and I wish I would have taken before and after pictures!  My face has cleared up drastically and my skin is smooth and my pores aren&#x27;t as noticeable as they used to be! My husband even noticed a difference and told me my skin looked really clear!&lt;br /&gt;I apply this product at night, after I wash my face.  I LOVE IT!! I just recently started using it all over (legs and arms) for a moisturizer when I get out of the shower!</li>
            <li> This oil deserves its 5 stars and I deserve a kick in the pants.  Why the kick?  Because I&#x27;ve known about \\&quot;rosa mosqueta\\&quot; (aka rosehip seed oil) for years, even living for many years in South America next door to Chile, where this oil became a skin treatment sensation in the 1980s.  Younger then and definitely not wiser, I just ignored the product.  Now I wish I had started using this years ago, instead of just weeks ago.  I could be looking \\&quot;younger than springtime\\&quot; rather than just OK for my age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip seed oil comes from a plant found in the Andes and in southern Chile.  It&#x27;s packed with vitamins, antioxidants and essential fatty acids (especially linoleic and linolenic).  It&#x27;s said to be good for age spots, dermatitis, brittle nails, psoriasis, eczema, scars, hyperpigmentation, stretch marks, burns, and dry and damaged hair, and I think I just may believe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do know for certain is that life just got simpler for me.  This oil is almost a one-stop beauty treatment.  After washing my face, I apply a small amount of this over the face and neck, massaging it in.  If there&#x27;s any excess, I&#x27;ll rub that into my hands and nails.  I&#x27;d swear that even the hands and nails look better now and my skin definitely loves this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to this particular brand of rosehip seed oil.  It&#x27;s USDA certified organic by Ecocert ICO, a company established in France which has 23 office and subsidiaries (one in Greenwood, Indiana) and is found in over 80 countries and seems to have an excellent reputation.  This oil is also cold pressed and unrefined to retain its goodness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a large bottle (4 oz.) and should last you a good while unless you plan to slather it all over your body (which is not really a bad idea), so, since it is a natural oil with no preservatives, it&#x27;s probably best to keep the bottle refrigerated.  I&#x27;m lazy about running to the fridge to get my beauty treatment and so I have transferred a small amount into a small bottle to keep in the bathroom for use and the remainder stays fresh in the fridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing you will notice about this is, of course, that it has a nutty, earthy, oily smell since there are no additives. Because of that you may not want to use it too generously before going out; perhaps it&#x27;s better as your nightly moisturizing beauty treatment.  I&#x27;ve found that adding a few drops of lavender oil essence (12 drops to 1 oz. of rosehip oil) makes for a pleasant smell that I don&#x27;t mind using during the day.  And that&#x27;s a win-win because lavender oil is also good for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, some people say that rosehip seed oil is a good treatment for acne.  That&#x27;s not necessarily true.  Most sites I&#x27;ve researched do not recommend it for acne or for very oily skin.  Although it is a \\&quot;dry\\&quot; oil (unlike those such as coconut, jojoba, or shea butter) and absorbs more easily into your skin, it is still an oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  This is great for my skin and great on my pocketbook, replacing many more expensive moisturizers I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Product supplied by Jarosa Beauty.)for use and the remainder stays fresh in the fridge.

            <li> this stuff does wonders! give it a lil time and u will shine better than before</li>
            <li> Last week I received a (huge) bottle of Jarosa Rosehip Seed oil to review. I&#x27;m not going to lie, I was a bit skeptical because I&#x27;d never really heard about it and I am a pretty die hard coconut oil user. I did a little research and a bit of eye rolling. Then I used it. This stuff is amazing!!! It is very light and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy at all, I don&#x27;t feel like my pores are clogging up with use, and even when using it in my hair it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down as much as coconut oil did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first opened it I tried a bit on my arm to test for allergies, after no reaction I went straight to a spot of eczema. No burning sensation and by the next morning it was nearly gone. That same night I put a squirt (just one!) in my hands and used it on my face, focusing on my under eye area. I have horrid dark under eye circles and they were actually lighter by the following morning. I decided before doing my review I would try some in my hair as well. I had done some online reading and found a few tips that said to massage the oil into your scalp and then through your hair anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hrs before a shower so I gave it a try. I&#x27;ve done this with coconut oil in the past and it left my hair soft but I had to do a lot of washing to get it out of my hair. I didn&#x27;t have that problem with the Jarosa Rosehip Seed Oil at all!! I used my regular amount of shampoo and I was able to completely skip the conditioner. My hair was soft, shiny but not oily looking, and had very few tangles! I should note that my hair comes down to the small of my back and is  super fine, I only needed a few pumps of oil to do my scalp and all of my hair. From asking various friends I&#x27;ve learned this is also really great for the postpartum period, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be trying that one out again myself but I do plan on (attempting to remember) using this on my stretch marks and seeing if it helps those as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product free for review purposes. No other compensation was given.compensation was given.</li>
            <li> Jarosa Rosehip oil is useful in a variety of ways.  It rejuvenates hair, skin and nails and is relatively cheap compared to all of the benefits it has.  Most important to me, this is all natural...no Parabens, no harsh chemicals!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the oil especially beneficial during the driest months of the year, it rubs in nicely on my elbows and knee pads to restore moisture.  No greasy residue is left behind, just healthy skin.  This product is also great to add a little shine to your hair.  Just massage warmed oil into your scalp and hair, leave in for a few minutes, and wash with shampoo.  Great results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil has a slightly strong scent, but it is not unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Received sample for testing.</li>
            <li> This oil is great! Admittedly I&#x27;ve never used an oil for moisturizing before, but I&#x27;m a total convert. My hands are so dry from washing them so often this season and one pump of this oil after each hand washing has kept them soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> In an effort to rid myself of unnecessary chemicals, I switched to moisturizing with oils after my shower instead of lotion.  I&#x27;ve found that in the long run it&#x27;s cheaper because oils last SO much longer.  My only complaint is that some of the oils I&#x27;ve tried seem to not rub in all the way and leave me feeling greasy for a while.  This rosehip oil soaks right in though and leaves me feeling nice and soft.  It has an.... interesting... earthy smell that I&#x27;ve actually come to love after using it for a few weeks.  It does disappear as soon as my skin dries though.  My favorite part about this product is that it has a PUMP.  OMG.  I can get the perfect amount this way and not waste any.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used rosehip seed oil in the past for my stretch marks but I had run out and never went running back to the store for more until l got this bottle. I&#x27;ve recently lost some weight so my stretch mark prevention has kicked in. I love this oil especially because it is certified organic. My last bottle was not and I can tell an immediate difference in the quality. It seems thicker and more concentrated than my last bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil provides moisture as well as healing capabilities. Perfect for stretchmarks, excessive dry areas and use as a moisturizer. I use it on my face, knees, and elbows.</li>
            <li> After researching and reading reviews I decided to order this pure ridership seed oil. I am so glad I did. I have been using it for over a month now and my super dry skin has never looked and felt better!! Smell isn&#x27;t the best but it wouldn&#x27;t be pure roseship oil if it smelt any different. It applies great and rubs in easily.</li>
            <li> I got my bottle of rosehip oil just as I turned on my furnace and braced myself for a dry flaky face all winter. This oil has turned it all around. It absorbs quickly, doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, and leaves my skin looking fresh and moisturized all day. I&#x27;ve been using it daily for nearly a month now and the bottle barely looks used.  At the rate I&#x27;m going the bottle should last me a year or more, so it is also a grea value.</li>
            <li> First of all, this is a generous amount of rosehip oil! I&#x27;ve been using it daily for about 2 weeks and I&#x27;ve barely put a dent in it. I&#x27;ve been using it on a burn scar that I have on my arm. The pump lid is easy to use &amp; dispenses a nice amount of oil. One pump is enough for my scar. When I first used it, I was a little concerned, because it comes out a golden color, but when you rub it in, the color completely disappears. It does not leave my hands feeling greasy, which is very important to me. I&#x27;ve been keeping it on my nightstand and applying it at bedtime. If it left my hands feeling sticky or greasy, I would have to get up &amp; wash them. There is a very light, natural scent - it kind of reminds me of a mild olive oil. It&#x27;s only noticeable when I hold my arm right under my nose. My scar is beginning to diminish. It&#x27;s still there, but it has faded a little bit. I&#x27;m excited to see what happens after more use! The skin around my scar is super soft.  I may start using this to moisturize this winter.</li>
            <li> Returned asap. The smell was horrendous and did not dissipate!&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip does not smell like roses, but the smell should subside within minutes of use or it is spoiled.</li>
            <li> I used this product at night, after washing my face. I was having a problem with dry skin on my forehead and eyebrows and this definitely helped that. I did get some little bumps on my skin in the forehead area, so I cut back from using it everyday. I do keep it in the fridge to preserve it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used it in my hair. I used to no poo (not use shampoo/conditioner) and I loved my hair while I did it. But after I had a surgery, I didn&#x27;t want to spend the time on it so I went back to shampoo and conditioner. My hair turned so frizzy, dry, and for the first time in my life, I have been having dandruff problems!! So I put this in my hair and scalp, because I don&#x27;t want to go through the process of transferring to no poo again. I used a boar bristle brush to spread it through my hair. Then I used shampoo, and the conditioner is what helped get the oil out. It helped a lot, it helped with the dandruff, and it helped my frizziness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to come up with my own routine for this to work effectively for me, but once I got it down, it has been perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for instructional purposes in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. I tested it, and loved it, which is why I left a great review!</li>
            <li> So smoothing and soft  this rose hip oil is by far the best I have ever used.  I have been using this as a moisturizer for 2 weeks now, it is amazing how soft and silky my skin is and there is no residue or a feeling like I am lathering up with oil it soaks in very nicely.  I have also been using this and only this as a styling aid for my super super naturally curly hair.  It has done wonders for my very dry and brittle hair, it has never been so soft and shiny and healthy looking.  It has a soft scent that is kind of earthy or rich not a perfume type smell at all . I have very sensitive skin and any perfumed or chemical laden lotions I use will leave me with bumps and rashes, but this oil is great and does not upset my sensitive skin at all. I would very highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have to start this review with a big WOW! Thank you for a speedy delivery. I had heard about the benefits of Rosehip but really had never used it before. After trying so many very expensive department store creams like, Clinique, Ester Lauder, Lancome, and never really felt like anything great happened to my skin, I decided to try Rosehip Seed Oil. I went to jarosabeauty.com to learn more about this product and how to use it. This website was really helpful to me. I use it at night as a moisturizer. I apply just a few drops on my face and really massage it gently into my skin. Because my skin is so dry and flaky, especially my arms and legs, I also apply a generous amount on my arms, elbows, legs, knees and feet. As I apply it I also massage my hands. You can use a cotton ball or tissue to remove any excess, but actually I did not have any oily or greasy residues on my skin like for example, coconut oil and shea butter leaves on your skin. I just let this wonderful Rosehip Seed Oil work its miracle powers while I sleep. in the morning this grandma of 63 yrs, feels rejuvenated 😊😊😊, my skin feels soft and full of moisture. I have been using the Pure Rosehip Seed Oil now for two weeks and can see a difference in my skin. It has helped lighten my age spots, and dark circles around my eyes. Speaking of my eyes. I use a small amount to remove makeup around the sensitive parts of my eyes. Besides gently removing makeup, it gently nourishes my skin. I have also put several drops in my hair conditioner making my hair more softer. I was happy to read that its only ingredient is 100% pure Rosehip Oil and Certified Organic, compared to all those other expensive creams that contain so much additives. No wonder they never worked! Thanks for a miracle beauty product. love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that I forgot to order the soap with this.... but the rosehip oil is great!  My hands are staying soft in the freezing weather, and I will continue to use this throughout the year. The other people in the office have all been using it as well, and I will need to purchase more soon  LOL... I know what they will be getting as presents this year.... a great product and great for anyone in the family :)</li>
            <li> I have used this for 2 weeks now. Goes on nicely with little to no oily feel. Face felt hydrated. I keep it in the refrigerator so it is a bit cold when applying. Not quite sure I like the smell, it isn&#x27;t offensive, just oily smelling. A large amount for the price. A squirt goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, thick, rich oil. I use it alone or add it to other lotions to enhance them. It soaks right in and really moisturizes. I have been using it on my skin, hair and nails. It protects my nails so they are not breaking and splitting as much. I also add it to my leave-in conditioner for my hair. This is a good value because you get a huge 4 ounce bottle for about the same price that other brands are selling 2 ounce bottles. I like that it has a pump dispenser rather than a dropper bottle because it is much more sanitary and protects against spilling. It is a great ingredient to add to your homemade beauty products. Has really helped with my post op surgery, really helps keep everything moisturized.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff. Im always looking for pure and natural skin care. I have very sensitive skin so this is perfect for me. I put it on my face at night and in the morning my skin feels so soft and smooth!&lt;br /&gt;My daughter is just a few months old and had a dry scalp. I put a little rosehip oil and it fixed her right up!</li>
            <li> I love love love this product. Rose oil has amazing benefits but is EXTREMELY expensive. So I get Rosehip oil and find that the price is right and the benefits are amazing. I have varicose veins on my legs and after a few weeks of using this oil on them they have lightened up and are hardly noticeably. I use it on my face and my hands. Even on fly aways when my hair is done up. There is no particular odor, it absorbs quickly into the skin so there is no leftover oily residue. The packaging &amp; design are great. The company seems very reputable and sustainable. I am happy with my purchase of this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my face, hands and stretch marks consistently for the last week.  I have very sensitive skin and was worried if it would be worth trying a new product.  I am pleasantly surprised!  The dry winter air is not kind to my face and hands but this rosehip seed oil has worked wonders.  I am a believer and will continue to use daily.  I can&#x27;t wait to see what it does for my stretch marks!</li>
            <li> I was very cautious about purchasing oils online but I&#x27;m very glad I have this one a try. Though the smell is not my favorite the results are so worth it. My face and hands are softer. I&#x27;ve also started adding it into my hair to make it shiny. My reason for purchasing it originally though was format stretch marks. I just delivered my third baby a few weeks ago and needed to work on getting rid of those lines!! I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is softer and the lines aren&#x27;t as dark!!! Yay!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!!! It is very light and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy at all, I don&#x27;t feel like my pores are clogging up with use. I use this on my hands and used it on my face, focusing on my under eye area. I have horrid dark under eye circles and they were actually lighter by the following morning. I used my regular amount of shampoo and I was able to completely skip the conditioner when used in my hair. My hair was soft, shiny but not oily looking, and had very few tangles! I also use this on my hands and cuticles as well to keep moisture on them this time of year.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and thought I would take a chance on this Rosehip Seed Oil since nothing else seems to be helping the psoriasis on my scalp.  I won&#x27;t say that it has been a miracle, but it does stop the itching for a short time and definitely helps with the scaling and redness.&lt;br /&gt;Now it does leave my hair oily, but I have days that I do not have to appear in public, so I put it on then and leave it, reapplying when necessary.  As a positive side effect, my hair was damaged and kind of fried looking from other products I had been using and this Rosehip Seed Oil has repaired that!  After I wash this out, my hair is really soft and not fried and frizzy looking anymore.  I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with that development!&lt;br /&gt;I am also using this on my forearms which are very dry and easily bruised/abraided due to medication that I take.  It soaks right in and my damaged skin feels so much better.  It seems to promote healing of the abrasions, too.&lt;br /&gt;Multiple reviewers have mentioned the way it smells.  This must be a completely personal response.  To me it is not unpleasant...I have smelled things that smell better and worse.  However, my husband thinks it smells bad.  But, the odor dissipates quickly so to me there is no problem with that.&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product so far and will order more.  BTW, I keep it in the fridge for the soothing cool to the itch of the psoriasis.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but really orange. I prefer other brands</li>
            <li> I have been using this rosehip seed oil since I got it a few weeks ago. I have a scar from a visit to the dermatologist a few months ago, and I&#x27;ve been applying the oil to the scar once a day. To my surprise the redness of the scar started to fade after just a few days, and it looks so much better now! I&#x27;ve also used the oil on my hair a few times, and the oil has left my hair feeling silky and smooth. I definitely recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell of the oil. It&#x27;s not unpleasant, but it does have a very distinct smell to it.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate the quality of this product. I researched the different regions, varieties and benefits of rose hip seeds. This product is true to description and meets all the criteria of being a true cold pressed organic single source rose hip seed oil. It arrived quickly and was well wrapped. I only need to use one pump, my skin drinks it up in this dry desert LA winter weather. So happy I chose this company. Thank you!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps. True organic cold pressed rose hip seed oil does not smell like roses. It&#x27;s not supposed to. If yours does look for added scents.</li>
            <li> I love it! Make me face sooooooo smooth and healthy looking !</li>
            <li> Love it! Mixed it with my normal facial oil and it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> It came right away, and I love the product.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. now I use it every night. when I get many small bumps on my face I put this before I go to sleep and next morning bumps are so much smaller.  I can&amp;#34;t live without this now.  smell is not so nice but I don&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li> awesome product, makes my skin feel so good.  A little goes a long way, so a 4-ounce bottle will last a bit.</li>
            <li> Love this product already and I just got it! Works great after showering and slathering it on my dry feet, followed by a pair of warm socks and left on overnight! Too soon to tell if its done much for the stretch marks, but ive been applying it regularly, as I have a ton of them! Next up, to try on my daughters eczema!  I did receive this product at a reduced rate to give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my mom and we are both really impressed by this rosehip seed oil. She has dry skin and brittle, dry hair so I wanted to find a multi purpose moisturizer for her and I found one! It really moisturizes her face and neck and helps to smooth out her hair. She says she likes the feel of it and is looking forward to using it every day! I like that it is all natural and she&#x27;s not subjecting her skin to a bunch of chemicals</li>
            <li> my name is Linda and I&lt;br /&gt;love the rosehip seed oil, it has made my skin smoother, and&lt;br /&gt;evened out blotchy skin discolorations, People have&lt;br /&gt;commented on how much brighter my skin is. I don&#x27;t even&lt;br /&gt;wear foundation any more . I don&#x27;t need it. Rosehip seed&lt;br /&gt;oil has become a part of my daily routine and I love it.</li>

            <li> Mixed with other oils for a pre-shave. Hard to tell individual characteristics.</li>
            <li> Rose hip oil used as a facial moisturizer has anti-aging benefits due to the antioxidants and nutrients, which include essential fatty acids, vitamin E, vitamin C and B-carotene, a precursor to vitamin A. The vitamin C helps stimulate collagen production and helps reduce fine lines and wrinkles. This oil is also good for treating sunburn and for diminishing scars. This oil can also be used for the hair: for dull, dry hair, or for dandruff in the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this particular brand (Jarosa) to be quite soothing for my facial skin. It is organic, cold-pressed and unrefined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan Schenck, award-winning author of The Live Food Factor and several other books</li>
            <li> I like this product make my skin soft n smooth ,I&#x27;m glad I purchase this ,I do recommend if see this.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Soaks right into the skin. I have been using this products for about 3 months and the dry patches are gone and my face looks smooth and glowing.  My mom tried it and she loves it also.  Gave a bottle to my daughter and her breakouts disappeared.  I just bought another bottl for myself.  I recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> Great product! I use it for my face with hemp oil. I also use it in my homemade face cream.</li>
            <li> This product has exceeded my expectations thus far. I keep it refrigerated and it seems to stay fresh and potent. It works wonders on scars.</li>
            <li> this oil is great....make your skin fell like &amp;#34;baby skin&amp;#34;....I will buy again</li>
            <li> Great stuff!! High quality.</li>
            <li> Love that this is all natural and synthetic free. And so many uses - I use it on my face, chapped lips, cuticles, and ends of my hair.  I also use it at night on my feet and cover them with socks to awaken to soft, moisturized feet in the morning. My daughter uses it for her acne scars and can see a difference. A great product I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> So glad I found this! It has helped a lot with the dry skin on my face and hands. I also use it on my elbows where I have severe dry patches (eczema) and I have seen a dramatic difference. My skin is softer and significantly less dry. I just started using it on my feet yesterday so no real results yet, but based on my experience so far I think it will make a big difference. I have very dry feet and callouses. I love that this oil is so versatile and can be used all over for so many different reasons. I think it&#x27;s even making my nails stronger. The pump works great and lets out just the right amount so I don&#x27;t waste anything. A little oil goes a long way, even for larger areas, so it will definitely last quite a while. I also appreciate that it&#x27;s not greasy on my skin. It rubs in well and I haven&#x27;t experienced any acne or oily looking skin.

            <li> Really good rosehip seed oil.</li>
            <li> I agree with some of review, smell is a bit fishy, but  it is raw product, without any perfume added to it, but it is does the job. I had bites on my legs from working in the yard and it very visible, so I started to put oil every night. Just after few times bites started to heal and less visible, obviously oil does work :)</li>
            <li> Good price, good size, good quality!  I use it for bath and I love it!</li>
            <li> I have used thr Jaroas rosehip seed oil for about three weeks now.  I am writing to review because I am amazed at how soft and creamy my skin has become.  I use it every night as my moisturizer and have had such great results. It is not heavy on my skin but yet it is thick enough that it stays where I apply it.. It seems the age or sun spots on my hands are lighter.  It will take more time to verify that for sure. I just know that my skin is definately softer.</li>
            <li> I love this! My skin is prone to be VERY dry in the winter. As we&#x27;re coming up on winter again, I decided I needed something to moisturize my face. I&#x27;m not into chemicals and love to stick to natural oils, but I&#x27;ve tried natural oils in the past and found they just clogged my pores and broke me out. Because of all the amazing benefits I&#x27;ve ready about rosehip seed oil, I decided I&#x27;d give this a shot. Worst thing would be a few days with a breakout. I&#x27;m happy to report no breakout! My skin looks great, this is the perfect facial moisturizer with added benefits. It doesn&#x27;t smell super pleasant, but the smell fades quickly and it&#x27;s totally worth it for the way this amazing stuff works. My skin has NEVER, EVER been this moisturized in the winter. It&#x27;s been a game-changer!</li>
            <li> This is a great all purpose moisturizer.  I have used it on my legs, hands, arms and face with no troubles.  It soaks in quickly and continues to moisturize for longer than a typical lotion.  It has a very minimal smell which dissipates quickly.  This bottle will last a very long time as you don&#x27;t need much to moisturize a large area.  I have been using it consistently for almost a month and I have barely made a dent in the amount in the bottle.  The pump system works great as you can easily control how much you get at one time.</li>
            <li> After usin this product for a while now I am in love. I even got my mom to get some for her b/c she asked what I have been using on my face. I use this on my face and hair daily. I have noticed a huge improvement with hydration for both. My face feels and looks soft and radiant. My hair looks so much nicer after I straighten it now also. There are so many other uses for this other then hair and face. I also use this on my cuticles and it has done wonders especially in this dry weather. I also noticed a difference in my stretch marks on my stomach. I have had 3 boys all via C-Section and have many stretch marks. All of them on my breasts and belly have greatly diminished. I just love this Rosehip seed oil.</li>
            <li> This the most luxurious oil!  Rosehips are loaded with Vitamin C, and this quickly absorbed oil is an excellent healing tonic for winter drab skin, bruises, dry patches, and all around skin health.  It doesn&#x27;t smell like roses, unfortunately, but it does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for review.</li>
            <li> Rosehip seed oil is an amazing product.  I have been using for a few weeks now and have noticed some clearing of some blemishes in my skin. I&#x27;ve also used this oil in my hair with great results.  Thanks for the product.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Pure Rosehip Seed Oil for a few days now as part of nightly routine. After I thoroughly wash my face, I dab a light amount of the oil on face and rub it in. I have noticed my face feels much more moisturized and overall more radiant. It is a great product to use during winter time since the cold tends to dry out skin. I put my bottle in the fridge to prolong its integrity. This is also a great product to use on cuticles and dry heels. Very happy with this product and its results.</li>
            <li> I actually like this product a lot. I&#x27;ve been using it for a small ( minor) skin pigmentation discolor with quite successes so far. I&#x27;ve also been using on my face and it&#x27;s great. Will buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I like it. The smell is bad, but it does not last and is a small price for the silky feeling that lasts forever or until you wash. Does have a slight oily residue, not as bad as coconut oil. One or two squirts rub into hands then on face. Or mix with your favorite face cream.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used rose hip seed oil before now and I really like it! The bottle is big with</li>
            <li> Silky smooth is how my skin feels after using this oil. Consistency is nice and goes on easily. Nice for my hair,too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving my Pure Rosehip Seed Oil. It makes my skin feel soft and smooth without leaving it oily. I&#x27;ve been using it on the ends of my hair where it tends to be dry. I was worried at first that it would leave an oily residue but it does not. It leaves it silky with no sign of dead ends. It also works great for dry flaky skin. Also diminishes the appearance of scars and stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I use this rosehip oil on my face ever day. Really is great.  Has nothing bad for your skin to absorb.  This particular oil is quite wonderful.</li>
            <li> I have using Jarosa Pure Rosehip Seed Oil for three weeks. I have used it on my face and also as a moisturizer on my legs. It worked amazing on my face, taking care of impurities and evening out my skin. It soothed my dry skin on my legs. It also held the moisture so my skin did not dry out as fast.. I would recommend this product to anyone who has scars or that has chronic dry skin..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a licensed skin esthetician and I cannot tell you enough how much I love this product! I&#x27;ve known for many years how beneficial rosehip oil is and I am always recommending this to all my friends. Rosehip oil has been used for centuries by the Indians of the Chilean Andes to treat burned and damaged skin. The benefits of this oil are really great and can be used on almost all skin conditions to help balance and restore the skin&#x27;s acid mantle. This particular oil I like because it&#x27;s a lightweight oil with no other ingredients. There&#x27;s no strong fragrance and it absorbs easily into the skin. I also use it on my dry frizzy hair and it works so awesome on my hair too!  If you would like an all natural product to help with anti-aging, sun damaged skin and help with scars then I highly recommend you use this oil. Your skin will thank you!</li>
            <li> I knew going into this that it would have a nutty smell, as opposed to a rosy smell, so I was pleasantly surprised that it is tolerable. It kind of reminds me of grape seed oil. The good thing is that none of the smell lingers anyway. It&#x27;s a bright, thicker oil. It&#x27;s AWESOME for dry skin, but be careful about putting it in your hair. If you have dry hair, you might want to soak it in this oil and wrap it in a towel overnight, then wash. I made the mistake of putting a glob of it in and living my life. It made my hair a bit heavy. I have pretty damaged hair, so it soaked it up pretty well, but it isn&#x27;t a light product. This is for people serious about their moisture!</li>
            <li> I Love the Rosehip seed oil. I used it on the ends of my hair. It makes my hair soft and more manageable. My skin also gets very dry in the fall and winter seasons. This is great for dry skin. I will continue buying this product.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed and happy with this product, My oldest daughter (13) has extremely dry skin, I had put some on the affected areas and when she woke up the next morning the spots were noticeably better. She had said that the areas where her dry skin is didn&#x27;t hurt or itch that morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried so many creams on her and this by far has worked the quickest and the best. Even my husband tried some on his dry hands and liked it. I will for sure be back for more of this when my bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> Love this oil! It does not leave a thick film after applying and leaves hair and skin nice and silky!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for helping with dry skin, diminishing scars and stretch marks, and has helped me regain control of the eczema on the palms of my hands.  My skin is softer and it has helped to diminish stretch marks on my stomach after having 3 babies in less than 5 years.  The palms of my hands look better and are no longer itchy anymore.  I am happy to have the eczema under control again on my hands.  My son recently had surgery and after only 4 days the scar has faded on his stomach.  I recommend this product for anyone to try if they have dry skin or just want to have healthy skin that is soft.</li>
            <li> I feel so truly blessed to have discovered such a fine, affordable product! It does what it claims to do! WOW! Seriously thank you Jarosa! I am impressed!</li>
            <li> Love this!! It great for everything from head to toe. I use a little in my hair to fight static! My hair is so soft. :)</li>
            <li> Love this oil.  Initially bought it from someone else but I think I like this bottle better because of the pump.  The other bottle was a dropper which involved a couple more steps.  Now, I just open the fridge, press down and its on.  before i had to remove the bottle, unscrew the top, drop a few drops, put it on, then put the bottle back in the fridge.  I love saving steps. But I am saving the old dropper bottle to travel with since it was a 1 oz bottle.  This way I don&#x27;t have to be without my oil on vacation.  This is better than coconut oil and rose oil for the face.  Can tell the difference.</li>
            <li> I love the product! The pump is convenient and good for easy application. My dry skin welcomes this oil! It leaves my skin feeling soft and supple!</li>
            <li> Product as described, I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li> Have been using on an area of my face that I had dry flaky skin from seasonal allergies, lets just say I was ecstatic when within a week not only was my face vibrant and clear, but the flaky skin was GONE! This even had a better effect than the topical steroids or the vitamin E I was using for this issue, I will definitely be ordering more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, there&#x27;s peace of mind using a totally certified organic product knowing there&#x27;s no added chemicals. The box this came in also included a business card to contact the owner directly, and the bottle was designed very beautifully with a unique, and quality dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a great multi-use product for anything you might need to moisturized. I personally used it on my face and was really impressed. After nearly a week of use, I&#x27;ve found my face to have improved levels of hydration, and has more of a glow. The smell is pretty neutral, maybe a bit.. earthy? That is the best way that I can describe it. It absorbs pretty quickly, which I love. I have eczema on my face, and I&#x27;m waiting to see if it improves that over time. At this point, I&#x27;m impressed with its basic moisturizing properties. Can&#x27;t wait to see what else its capable of!</li>
            <li> I have been using for 1 week. it goes on like oil but does not leave your  face oily. I think it is helping my flakey spots on my face. I will report more after another week or two. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Months ago, the doctor froze several precancerous spots from my husband&#x27;s face.  He believed they were caused by spending so much time in the sun.  These left numerous spots on his face, neck and hairline that were red, deeply scabbed or flaking.  I&#x27;ve been using this oil on him for a little over a week now.  Some of the smaller spots have disappeared completely, the flaky skin is gone, the smaller scabs are gone and the larger ones are healing. We&#x27;ve been using it twice a day.  It only takes one or two small squirts to cover them all.  It has a very slight smell to it when it comes out of the bottle, but the smell doesn&#x27;t linger.  I&#x27;ve even started using the oil left on my hands to rub into my cuticles and they look great.  For kicks, I rubbed a couple of drops into the bottoms of my damp, just-washed hair and combed it through.  It left my hair so very soft.  This is great oil!</li>
            <li> I had never even heard of Rosehip Seed Oil, so I did some research and it sounded too good to be true.  I was offered a sample of Jarosa Beauty Rosehip Oil to review and jumped at the opportunity.  Jarosa&#x27;s oil is certified organic which is always a plus, as I don&#x27;t like to use chemicals on my skin.  The amber colored bottle is 4 ounces with a convenient spray pump, which doesn&#x27;t mist the oil, but yields as small an amount as you need by adjusting your pressure on the pump.  Very, very little is needed for an application, so I&#x27;m certain the 4 ounces will last a long time.  It is recommended to keep the bottle refrigerated to extend the shelf life of the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jarosa&#x27;s Rosehip Seed Oil is not only organic, but also unrefined which is the purest form of the oil.  The oil has a somewhat earthy smell, with no floral scent at all. Once on the skin, there is no residual odor.  It goes on like an oil, rather shiny, giving your skin a healthy glow, and is absorbed into your skin leaving a smooth texture not an oily one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very dry skin and having tested this oil daily for a week on my hands, feet and elbows, I must say there is a definite improvement.  Next I plan to try it on my husband&#x27;s recent surgery scars to see if it will lessen the redness.  He also has a slight case of psoriasis, which will be a good test.  Like all skin care products, it is recommended to test a small area of your skin to make sure there is no sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;m really happy with this oil and would highly recommend it, certainly for those who like to try new skin products.  There is a lot of information online about the benefits and uses of Rosehip Seed Oil, and from what I read, it certainly is worth the investment in giving an organic, unrefined oil like Jarosa&#x27;s a try.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Rosehip oil! I have several surgical scars and this oil is one of the only products that helps to soften and fade them! This oil is so mild and wonderful. It is such a great moisturizer and I am so in love with it! It also makes a great carrier oil for aromatherapy and massage!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with Jarosa, Inc&#x27;s Rosehip Seed Oil. The bottle arrived securely and well packaged. I love to use this oil on my hands and cuticles. In the winter my hands get so dry and crack because I wash my hands so much at my job. The oil pumps out in the perfect portion size for my hands, and it keeps my hands silky and hydrated without being oily or greasy. This oil truly deserves 5 stars! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love this oil!! I use this in the evening after a shower and it soaks into my skin quickly.  I never feel too oily and I have not broken out with continued use.  This is a great deal for the amount you get and it is organic which makes it even better.  I love the simplicity of it and how well it has made my skin feel.  I highly recommend this oil to anyone who wants great benefits with a natural product!</li>
            <li> Used on it&#x27;s own or as an ingredient in a DIY skin preparation, rosehip seed oil is a multi-use mini-miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can be used on the skin or hair, it even works wonders on dry, ragged cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;Rough cracked heels and/or scaly feet? I took equal parts of this oil and emu oil, and rubbed it on my feet after dry buffing. Socks go on, and like me, you will wake up to soft, silky feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any oil can go rancid, so keep it in the fridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with the quality of this rosehip seed oil I was given to test.</li>
            <li> Love this oil and so glad that I purchased it. I use it 1X in the morning and then again at night combined with 2 drops of the Jojoba. The best results that I have from using any product.</li>
            <li> I have skin that is highly sensitized to weather changes - while it is better living in the southeast with higher humidity, I still have issues with flaky / dry skin that if not treated, will disintegrate into bleeding.  I&#x27;ve been using this oil two different ways - and have seen a remarkable difference in my skin&#x27;s ability to retain moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few drops directly on serious problem areas (elbows, knees and heels) daily- and the rough skin is gone. 4 drops added to a &#x27;dry spray oil&#x27; that I use after a shower and bath, and the moisturizing effect lasts longer as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Facially, I&#x27;ve used a drop or two before bed and notice a reduction in puffiness around my eyes the next morning, and a smoother and brighter complexion.  Light earthy scent that dissipates quickly and leaves no &#x27;conflict of scent&#x27; with other oils or perfumes, this is my new &#x27;go to&#x27; booster for my usual routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the oil for about 2 weeks now and it has made a difference that I have not experienced without massive quantities of heavily-applied, greasy creams and lotions.  Quick to absorb and long lasting, this is a wonderful option or addition to a moisturizing routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of the product from the manufacturer for purpose of trial and honest review. I was not compensated for this review: all conclusions are my own responsibility.</li>
            <li> Had a really weird, but not bad smell. Went away immediately when I rubbed it in. Used on my skin, after a shower. It felt great. My skin was way too dry. Left is feeling hydrated and NOT oily.</li>
            <li> After using this oil for a little over a month, I LOVE what it has done for my skin. My skin tone is more even and it stays hydrated all day. I love that this oil is certified organic, cold pressed, virgin  and unrefined because when I&#x27;m using something on my skin, I want to make sure it&#x27;s the best quality I can get and this product is definitely the best! I also just made a homemade lotion using this oil and some shea and cocoa butters and have been using it on my toddler&#x27;s sensitive skin. It&#x27;s been awesome for his eczema!</li>
            <li> I have used this natural oil for awhile now and find it to be a very nice natural moisturizer. It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling so nice!  It has an earthy scent - not flowery that dissipates quickly. I think you will be happy too!</li>
            <li> I did not know what to expect from a rose oil. I purchased one from Marshalls, however, it did have a scent that made it smell so amazing... This oil, I love the results, however it does have a awkward smell but the results are amazing. I will order again. It does show it is pure... The one I purchased prior had fragrance added...Therefore, I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I really like the way my skin feels while i use this oil. It feels so soft and smooth. I don&#x27;t like however the smell. as long as you don&#x27;t put your hands to your face you are ok but if you do it is not pleasant.</li>
            <li> I sort of tripped into coconut oil, like another reviewer, and have been using that for a while.  The only other lotion I use regularly is heat-based to tingle and stimulate the nerves in my foot, which was injured while fighting a structure fire.  I mention these two, because that is my only real basis for comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This rose hip oil is light, silky smooth, goes on easily, smells nice, and is non-greasy.  It absorbs quickly.  This is one great oil, organic, unrefined, cold pressed.  I love how they suggest you try in an area first to test for allergies - no allergies here.  Love the Omegas.  I haven&#x27;t had any direct results with wrinkles or stretch marks, but I will say an application makes me feel like I am glowing and my skin stays moisturized, so I am sure it helps.  All in all, a very happy customer!</li>
            <li> Very nice ...good quality...fast shipping...will buy again...thank you....</li>
            <li> I needed additional moisture for my face. This oil is great! My face feels nice, soft &amp; moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now. I am very please with the results! I use it on my face, hair and hands. It leaves my hair so silky! I like to use it on my face and neck before bed so that it has a chance to really soak in over night. I would highly recommend this product. I never thought I would enjoy using a natural product over the face lotion I have used for years but this is worth the switch!!  I have also started using this on my daughter that has very dry skin. She is 16 months old. I put a few drops on my hands and massaged her back and legs before putting her pajamas on for the night. I was amazed at how the oil had improved her skin after only one application. We have used prescription cream in the past for this. Happy that there is a natural option!</li>
            <li> I mixed Rose essential oil in this, just a tiny bit, and it really improved te smell of the product! Good quality!</li>
            <li> My daughter has terrible eczema that flares up at the slightest provocation.  It feels like we&#x27;ve tried every moisturizer on the market with only so-so results at preventing an eczema attack, and no luck with using a moisturizer to actually treat active eczema.  Rosehip seed oil was recommended to me by a hippie Momma friend and it has been an absolute savior!  It not only helps prevent flare ups in her when used regularly, if she comes into contact with someone like a chlorinated pool which always makes her eczema get all crazy this oil helps her skin calm down quickly.  She has had such good luck I&#x27;ve started using it, too.  My skin tends to be somewhat acne prone, but I&#x27;ve recently had to give up retinoids in anticipation of getting pregnant.  Without my usual chemical exfoliation, my face became very dry and flakey, but after a good scrub and brush and a nice thick coating of this oil, I&#x27;m all good.  And I haven&#x27;t even had a single break out.  It&#x27;s a nice big bottle, too.  Great value. I&#x27;ve re-purchased multiple times and I will continue to.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes in ordering this rosehip seed oil; however, it is more odor is more pungent than any other brands I have tried (or sniffed at the store) -- and my daughter agrees.  I first tested the product on my hand, but the &#x27;fishy&#x27; odor was so strong that I had to wash it off.  For that reason, I asked to return the product.  The great news is that I lost nothing in ordering and trying it out as Amazon customer service is top-notch, and the manufacturer of this product was as considerate -- she was very kind and understanding about the issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product came in a amber glass bottle with a &#x27;squirt&#x27; dispenser top.  The one I received had an expiration date sticker of 12/16.  The oil color is typical rosehips seed oil, which has a orange-golden hue.  I&#x27;m giving this product a 3 (neutral) stars, but uncertain if I&#x27;m willing to give it another try in the future.</li>
            <li> the shipment is fast. it came in good package.&lt;br /&gt;it doesnt smell like rose but its smell good. big bottle. I have not use it yet.&lt;br /&gt;will let you know once my project get complete.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 days now and I must say that I am pleasantly surprised. This oil is amazing!!!! My skin is usually dry and after using this oil as a moisturizer it feels so much softer. It does not feel greasy on the skin, it is very light and there is no heavy scent. It also comes with a pump for easy access. I&#x27;ve also used this oil as a nighttime moisturizer on my face and my complexion looks clearer and vibrant.  I am so content with this organic pure rosehip seed oil and I highly recommend this effective product.</li>
            <li> A+++ Seller! Product was just as promised. I have been using it for about a week now, and I love it. My skin is so soft, and looks better than ever, and I am almost 60. It does have an earthy smell, but you get used to it in a few days.</li>
            <li> I am really amazed at what this Rosehip Oil does. I have a motorcycle burn on the back of my leg that has been there for 30 years. I have been applying this oil to it for about two weeks and it has faded a lot. I&#x27;m guessing in another week you will not even be able to tell I had a burn there. I am so glad I was able to test this oil for my honest review because I have the softest skin now thanks to it also. This oil does wonders for so many different things from scars, acne, skin to helping your hair out. My hair is long, fine and dry thanks to the cold here in Wisconsin and this oil helps with my fly away hair also. I recommend this Rosehip Oil to anyone because it has so many different uses and I&#x27;m sure I haven&#x27;t even dented the surface of all the great things it can do. Thank You..</li>
            <li> I am amazed how soft my skin is after two weeks using this pure rosehip seed oil. This product makes my skin soft and my face is lovely. I can see how my lines has gotten smaller. My eyes look great. I will be buying more....</li>
            <li> Received the item super fast. But there appeared to be some leakage - oil stains on the cardboard container it was shipped in. Also, when I opened it and took a whiff, it smelled SOOOOOOOOOO BAD it made me gag! It smelled like rancid fish oil. Not sure if I received a bad bottle or they all have that \\&quot;distinct scent\\&quot; but I returned it right away.    *Edit    I was contacted by Jodi via email. She offered to send me a new bottle to try out, since the last bottle might&#x27;ve been spoiled. She suggested infusing some lavender essential oil to hide some of the pungent earthy smell of the rosehip seed oil. When I received the new bottle, I was eager to try it, but I didn&#x27;t have any lavender oil, so I tried a couple drops with my Olay cucumber body lotion and rubbed onto my hands. It absorbed into my skin quickly, made my skin feel baby soft. Although there&#x27;s still a lingering fishy smell, it didn&#x27;t bother me nearly as much. Definitely not a product I could use on its own though. Overall a good product, worth trying if you are not sensitive to smells. I am pleased with their customer service.</li>
            <li> This is lovely. I use it at nights. It is non greasy and goes on very uickly.</li>
            <li> works great and smells great</li>
            <li> I was told about this oil  by friend. I use it all over this winter.  Now my husband has taken over my bottle.  For his dry scalp,  skin and feet. Can&#x27;t praise it enough.</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful, I put it on my face twice daily after cleaning!</li>
            <li> This oil is great for skin care.  Also great as a carrier for blending with almost any essential oil.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and in good condition. No leaking. I really enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> This product has shown almost immediate results in fading acne marks on my skin, and it provides a supple texture to my skin I didn&#x27;t have before. I plan to continue use of this product based on only a few days use and successful results. I mix with jojoba oil and essential oils. The product is high quality and a great size bottle that will last a while. Great organic product too!</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my Mom to help her with her problem skin and I can&#x27;t wait to give it to her!  It is a beautiful glass bottle and I love how you can put it in the fridge to make it last longer.  The quality appears to be better than other rosehip seed oils I have seen.</li>
            <li> I use this oil on my husband&#x27;s dry, cracked feet. I apply it at night and then he sleeps in socks to lock in the moisture!  Great moisturizer and has helped so much already and we&#x27;ve only been using for a short time! Happy to have come across this product!</li>
            <li> I have only been using this oil for about three weeks, so I don&#x27;t yet have any long-term or miraculous results to report. However, I do enjoy using the oil and have found it to be of very fine quality. When I received the oil I was pleased to see that it is cold pressed, so no chemical extraction processes are used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil is quite rich in texture compared to other oils you may be using on your body such as jojoba or sesame. It&#x27;s less oily than other oils, so it doesn&#x27;t spread over your skin as easily. The best way to use it is to dampen your skin before use. That way it&#x27;s easier to rub in and more easily absorbed. It also helps you use less oil, and thus save a little money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;ve been primarily using the oil on my face, as middle-age dryness calls for rich moisture. What I really like about this oil is that if I use it after a shower in the evening, my face still feels smooth and soft when I wake up in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re familiar with other rich, cold-pressed botanical oils such as extra-virgin olive oil, you know they have a distinctive smell. Not unpleasant, just very rich is the only way I can describe it. This oil does not smell like olive oil, but it does have its own smell. It is made from rose hip seeds, so don&#x27;t expect it to smell like roses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now I give this oil four stars, to be upgraded in the future if I experience any exceptional results after continued use. A sample bottle was provided to me for review.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good thing this comes in a good size bottle because I am using it from the tips of my toes to the hair on my head! I am so glad to find such a high quality, certified organic, synthetic free oil! Since I started using this oil on my face my skin has developed a healthy glow, feels silky and fine lines seem to be disappearing before my eyes. It makes a great hair product and my hair is more manageable. I even add a couple of pumps to my bathwater for a luxurious soak!</li>
            <li> It has a terrible smell. I can not stand it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good quality oil. I use it on the face as a moisturizer and it works well for that purpose, especially in the cold winter climate. It&#x27;s also the best price so far for certified organic rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> Smell is not so good but I don&#x27;t, mine. Make skin is bright and smooths.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality product!</li>
