            <li>I love the way it makes the bath smell after a shower- good for men, as I believe it has more of a masculine scent to it, but not too overpowering, so I can use it too.      </li>

            <li>I used it and absolutely loved the way it has a rich luxurious lather, a deep invigorating smell, and a silky smooth feeling it leaves on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this Canus soap for several months now and it is by far the best soap you could use.</li>
            <li>It smells good and clean, and does not dry out the skin.  </li>

            <li>I no longer use a special cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my skin soft and nice smelling as well as clean.</li>
            <li>Hope that kinda comes true...</li>
            <li>any they made my skin nice an soft .</li>
            <li>I initially bought this Canus goat milk soap from Wholefoods, and I loved it and kept buying every time we ran out of it.  </li>
            <li>It is good , solid soap</li>
            <li>I love this soap, as the scent reminds me of the Maja soaps from Spain, but this is much creamier.</li>
            <li>The soap is mild and gentle; it is quite possibly my favorite soap that I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li>Also, It lathers very well and leaves you feeling very clean.</li>
            <li>However, the scent is fresh, unique, and once its on your skin isn&#x27;t overpowering at all.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is so fresh and clean smelling.</li>
            <li>This \\&quot;Goat Milk\\&quot; soap leaves your skin feeling clean, fresh &amp; hydrated.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure anyone would love it, forget all those brands You found in Your local walgreens, this is it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll see how my skin holds up this winter with the switch, but overall I&#x27;m more than satisfied.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>I sent some to my mom, too (mostly because of the cute goat on the label) and she likes it a lot, especially the bottle of bath soap)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that this soap would better serve as a hand soap, mainly because I don&#x27;t have the wherewithal to scrub my bathtub every day.</li>
            <li>I will have to share this with my daughter, her family uses this quickly.  </li>
            <li>Luckily I caught it or I would have been out the money.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this one for those that want a great, lasting, moisturizing soap!</li>
            <li>Thanks Canus!!</li>
            <li>but I could feel the difference since the first day!</li>
            <li>Will never use any other kind of soap!</li>
            <li>I bought the 20 bar deal - which is a great deal at a little over a buck a bar.</li>
            <li>a quality product for the price, perfect for sensitive skin, lovely fragrance and long lasting large bar of goat&#x27;s milk soap; shipping was prompt; well done!</li>
            <li>Ugh, I&#x27;ve been happily using this soap for a few years until it was pointed out to me that Canus soaps contain a formaldehyde-releaser: DMDM Hydantoin.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell, which I like and leaves your skin smooth.</li>
            <li>But something you should try for yourself cause it really is a nice soap overall.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is also really nice and is totally gender neutral.</li>
            <li>Since discovering this soap, my skin now feels soft and more moist.  </li>
            <li>Worth a try.</li>
            <li>but i guess it just wasn&#x27;t the golden soap.</li>
            <li>You get a product that doesn&#x27;t test on animals, has quality, gentle ingredients for a more than reasonable price.</li>
            <li>fresh moose mints.&lt;br /&gt;--D. Mikels, Esq.</li>
            <li>My husband and I both have sensitive skin and never buy any type of glycerin soap so we buy fragrance free, perfume free, etc.</li>
            <li>I wish they made one which smelled like apples or oranges, or something more natural.</li>
            <li>This is not a lightly-scented soap; it has a distinct smell.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it also but not crazy about the smell.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is fresh and not too feminine that the husband won&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than others that claim to be for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Having sensitive skin is so enjoyable with this soap.</li>
            <li>and we now use this soap and will continue using it.[[ASIN:B001E763NQ Canus Goat&#x27;s Milk Rich Moisturizing Pure Vegetable Oil Soap, 3-Count Boxes (Pack of 4)]]</li>
            <li>We love it, especially the smell, leaves skin so fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>The price seems quite fair in comparison to some other triple-milled soaps I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li>This is now one of my new favorite soaps and I will continue to buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>This is the first \\&quot;special\\&quot; soap that I tried after looking for better moisturizing and natural alternative.</li>
            <li>It lathers nicely and unlike most bar soaps that make the claim but do not deliver, Canus actually does not dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>The slight fragrance is pleasant.</li>
            <li>smells wonderfully clean and is gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>When the store ran out and were not going to order more I found it on Amazon, and at a much better price than we had paid for it previously.   </li>
            <li>Some have overly sensitive skin while others, like me, are fortunate enough that we can use this kind soap and not get a reaction to it.    </li>
            <li>The soap is good but not worth that price.</li>
            <li>While I prefer the Orchid Oil scent, I couldn&#x27;t turn down this bargain price on the original, which still smells really nice.  </li>
            <li>This soap is amazing, I have dry skin</li>
            <li>It felt so soft and easy to comb through.</li>
            <li>The good Sir Rosis has just finished his fourth pint of wee Scottish brandy, and tells his young maid:  </li>
            <li>I personally use the liquid body wash and it is just as nice, but the rest of my family uses the bars and we are never without it, thanks to Amazon</li>
            <li>lucky and Whole Foods Mkt has it on sale.  </li>
            <li>; nice to the skin - doesn&#x27;t dry it out,</li>
            <li>Lathers well, smells fantastic without being too strong, and a bar lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>It is also very gentle to skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>We can&#x27;t find it in our area and the price is very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>I like this soap very much and have recommended to my friends.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle and has no smell.</li>
            <li>(if I don&#x27;t moisturize) it doesn&#x27;t irritate it in any way, and by morning I wake up with clean, fresh, soft skin.  </li>
            <li>i had a huge problem with dry/itchy skin, it has completely stopped once i stared using this soap.   </li>
            <li>The best alternative to my expensive bath soap and still with no itchiness and redness.</li>
            <li>So many people raved about the smell of this soap that I couldnt wait to rip it open when it arrived!</li>
            <li>Even after the first time I used it, I could feel a difference.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for;</li>
            <li>It smells very feminine, which I don&#x27;t mind, but I know my husband and sons probably will!  </li>
            <li>A friend brought me the first Canus goat&#x27;s milk soap I used.  </li>
            <li>Leaving skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I really hope they start selling the lavender one on subscribe &amp; save soon!</li>
            <li>But overall I like it and will buy more when I finish this lot.</li>
            <li>REAL soap, not like what they sell in the stores today!.</li>
            <li>would love to have amazon refund me back</li>
            <li>I am allergic to most soaps and finally found canus about 5 years ago.</li>
            <li>I WILL be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are pretty innocuous too.</li>
            <li>My daughter gave me my first bar about 9 months ago</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different ones and had just about given up.</li>
            <li>First, this item is not returnable.</li>
            <li>The only soap I&#x27;ve been able to use that does not throw my feminine ph off or irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>Amazon is amazing because this soap has become more harder to find else where over the last year...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only soap we both love.</li>
            <li>Pine tar soap, Grandmas lye, Dead Sea salt soap, etc, etc, this one&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>It is great it makes you very dry hands not dry and cracked</li>
            <li>This so is a great product to use anytime but especially in the winter when your skin tends to get quite dry and itchy.</li>
            <li>I used the bar on my hair and wow!!!!</li>
            <li>Loved not only because it is so gentle on the skin, we also love it because of its very delicate fragrance and the fact that each bar is easy to hold.</li>
            <li>It has a rich creamy lather that soothes as it cleans leaving your skin dewy soft.</li>
            <li>Clean Smelling, this soap has replaced my previous preference of many years, Lever2000.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin feeling clean, soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>I find the smell refreshing, but it does remain in the shower long after using it.  </li>
            <li>It has such a fresh, clean smell</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t flowery or overpowering or baby powder fresh, it smells clean, the scent is similar to \\&quot;fragrance free\\&quot; hand lotion with a hint of powdered milk?</li>
            <li>You get such a clean fresh feeling after showering with this soap.</li>
            <li>I have tried several different soaps over the years but this one has been by far the best Goats milk soap that I have used next to homemade.</li>
            <li>The price was very reasonable at $12.74 for 12 bars, free shipping with Prime, for a total of $1.06 each.</li>
            <li>Always a terrific soap  ..  not always easy to find so stock up when you can</li>
            <li>But this one smells actually too strong...</li>
            <li>Will almost certainly reorder.</li>
            <li>It is fine milled and lasts longer than a regular bar of soap because it doesn&#x27;t just melt away.</li>
            <li>These soaps are of very high quality.</li>
            <li>It lathers just right and leaves you fresh and clean unlike other soaps.</li>
            <li>It gives a real nice SOFT LATHER and doesn&#x27;t leave this skin dry unlike other soaps we have tried.      </li>
            <li>, it just smells clean and fresh (think linens hung on the line).&lt;br /&gt;-5 stars for how long one bar of this soap lasts!  </li>
            <li>This is the real deal:  naturally homogenized farm fresh goat milk.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for listening.</li>
            <li>My skin now feels very nourished and moist.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>They are also very dense, and it does not take much to get a generous lather.</li>
            <li>We like it so much I have put it on a scheduled reorder account.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think the smell was too much, not like another that I tried.  </li>
            <li>I still wanted to use it though since it is more natural but what I really don&#x27;t like is the overpowering smell (compared to varieties of mainstream brands that I used before e.g. Irish Spring, Dial, etc.)</li>
            <li>she thinks the smell is just too much too).</li>
            <li>I really think it has made a difference with my skin</li>
            <li>Next time I order, I will get the fragrance free version.</li>
            <li>the smell reminds me of \\&quot;Eucerin\\&quot; body cr&amp;egrave;me/lotion, but the soap smells much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a diehard Dove fan since I was a kid (thanks Mom).</li>
            <li>The fragrance is divine..smells so clean and does not dry your skin.  </li>
            <li>Since there&#x27;s been so much conversation about the scent:</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Yes, I highly recommend this soap to everyone!</li>
            <li>Found it at Whole Foods</li>
            <li>Buying by the case is so much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Different fragrance options available, I prefer not so string smells.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely \\&quot;LOVE\\&quot;</li>
            <li>the fact that this soap is natural and have this fresh herbal scent.</li>
            <li>Have used the soap in the past but moved to Texas and couldn&#x27;t find; very glad when i located it again on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Real soap is made from fat and lye-</li>
            <li>so I assumed it would be a real soap.</li>
            <li>I gave this to my Mother, and she really likes it.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how much I like it.</li>
            <li>I was given a full refund on the product that was not received, but now I have to place a second order to get what I should have gotten the first time around.</li>
            <li>I absolutely \\&quot;LOVE\\&quot;  natural &amp; organic products!!!</li>
            <li>This soap boasts a light, clean, mild fragrance (in other words, thank goodness it doesn&#x27;t smell like actual goat milk).  </li>
            <li>First saw this product at the Live Expo.  </li>
            <li>It is so rich that I use it for shaving, and gentle enough to use it to wash my face.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling clean but not dried out, and soft but not greasy.</li>
            <li>I originally found it at a local landscape company where gardeners bought it for their hands.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell and it lasts a lot longer than other kinds of soaps.</li>
            <li>The scent is a pleasant one, can be a little heavy, but it&#x27;s one you will enjoy.  </li>
            <li>I like the brand, clean smelling scent and each bar lasts longer than any commercial brand I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>The soap has a clean smell and last forever.</li>
            <li>Goat milk soap is really gentle on the skin, and this particular soup has met all my expectations.</li>
            <li>in short, I had to use my soap to clean up whatever this product is.</li>
            <li>love the fragrant and stays firm all the way, until it is paper-thin, unlike those popular commercial brands soaps, this soap last longer so it justifies the cost.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your skin so soft and smooth, not dry at all.</li>
            <li>Most soaps that are free from perfumes and irritants for sensitive skin, overly dry my skin to where I get dry patches, this soap does not!</li>
            <li>It does leave your skin very soft, but many other soaps that have gender-neutral smells will, also.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this soap after reading many glowing reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve previously ordered Alpen&#x27;s Goatsmilk soap and decided to try Canus after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li>be buying this soaps because i know they are way better than regular soaps and because of the goats milk if they actually have any,</li>
            <li>Not only does it leave skin soft and smooth</li>
            <li>I even tried to melt the soap over a double boiler to combine it with some better smelling essential oils, but it caked and didn&#x27;t melt well.</li>
            <li>it is here quick if ever I run short.</li>
            <li>I gave this to my husband after reading other reviews on a different site, and absolutely love this soap!  </li>
            <li>I have such sensitive skin and this soap helps by skin feel smooth.  </li>
            <li>I have allergies and this soap is gentle, smells wonderfully clean and does not irritate or dry out the skin.  </li>
            <li>I used this soap ten years ago and have only been able to find it at specialty stores and then the price is way to high to purchase.  </li>
            <li>It is a strong bar, last a long time and WORKS even on a big strong man&#x27;s odor - my husband loves it.</li>
            <li>I have super dry skin and live in a cold climate and this is the best soap I&#x27;ve ever come across.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly reccommend the Canus line of products.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a goat&#x27;s milk soap that wasn&#x27;t high priced.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>the soap doesnt get a high non toxic rating.</li>
            <li>We highly recommend it&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this soap.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a high moisture soap of course</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>Amazon offers a better bulk bargain than any of the other drugstore companies.</li>
            <li>Not harsh like so many other soaps I have tried.</li>
            <li>It may be a little more costly than what you buy in the store</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it a few times myself and have been complimented on the clean fresh scent and asked what I was wearing.</li>
            <li>Originally purchased it five years ago for itchy dry skin during the winter.  </li>
            <li>The aroma is a clean, fresh smell and long lasting.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a built in washcloth, and when the soap is all completely used, it leaves  a little sack or pouch, old fashioned, but nice.  </li>
            <li>Gentle soap product for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this soap is gentle while moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>the normal soaps</li>
            <li>This is quickly becoming the only soap I am starting to use.</li>
            <li>I am used to it now, but when I first got it, I could barely stand it.  </li>
            <li>It does not have all the harsh chemicals that most soaps have.</li>
            <li>I would call it my second favorite soap, but my first is, 5-10 times more expensive</li>
            <li>Try it and you will come back for more if you suffer from dry skin.</li>
            <li>The smell is fresh and this product isn&#x27;t so tough on my skin as most soaps are.  </li>
            <li>this is a quality soap that is quite creamy lathers well and works in hard and soft water environments, nice fragrance</li>
            <li>We were paying $3.25 a bar locally, and it is important to buy locally, but at the price we paid Amazon we can afford to continue using it.  </li>
            <li>Bought this soap for both myself and my daughter who has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I thought it smelled very masculine</li>
            <li>Highly recommended to anyone conscious about skin care.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend that anyone who has sensitive skin, give Canus Goat&#x27;s Milk Soap a try...</li>
            <li>My husband has very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hands very soft even in the winter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used more expensive,name brand, dry skin soaks with not near the satisfaction achieved with \\&quot;Canus\\&quot;.          </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t melt away quickly like some other natural soaps, it really lasts.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin very clean and clear some brown spots after a few days of use.</li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t, I&#x27;d be surprised!  </li>
            <li>Even my 10 year old granddaughter loves it!</li>
            <li>Eventually the package was delivered a complete week after it was supposedly delivered to me!</li>
            <li>; I found myself having to scrub out the bathtub nearly every day!    </li>
            <li>I would test it out with only one bar if it is your first use.</li>
            <li>It cost me $25.30 and that included shipping for the exact same soap you are now selling for $62.97 plus shipping.</li>
            <li>The smell of the soap is quite awesome and hard to describe - slightly herbal, very clean, classic, unique - never heard a bad comment on it.</li>
            <li>It really moisturizes and it&#x27;s free of all the chemicals you usually find in soaps.  </li>
            <li>soap does not dry out your skin and lathers very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I read several of the positive reviews and decided to try itr for myself.</li>
            <li>This soap is very soft, the perfume is not too overpowering plus it is gentle enough to be used on babies.</li>
            <li>a clean, fresh and a little bit powdery scent that stays with you all day long.    </li>
            <li>The bars are quite large and it smells terrific.</li>
            <li>It is simple and pure.  </li>
            <li>If you have not experienced this soap yet in your life and you appreciate quality soap and fantastic clean, fresh and slightly spicy scents, then order some now.</li>
            <li>It rinses off cleanly and is slightly moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I wear my hair natural so that is vital.</li>
            <li>Its not going to make ur skin soft overnight</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin soft and radiant.</li>
            <li>Affordable, natural soap.</li>
            <li>I recently bought the marigold lotion and found that while I can tolerate the marigold fragrance, I really didn&#x27;t care for it and prefer the unscented.</li>
            <li>Goat&#x27;s milk soap has been our family soap for nearly 10 years.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to shampoo as frequently.</li>
            <li>This has definitely helped, has a minimal if any scent, and leaves me feeling clean, fresh, and not so dry.</li>
            <li>for 12 pieces that last much longer than others, it&#x27;s heck of a deal.   </li>
            <li>My husband has really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Wow what a savings</li>
            <li>it keeps our skin soft</li>
            <li>I have sensitive (aging) skin that requires TLC.  </li>
            <li>Gentle enough for babies, comes scented and unscentewd.</li>
            <li>the labeling fraudulently stating all natural base&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is not all natural</li>
            <li>/&gt;It leaves your skin feeling soft and smelling like perfume.</li>
            <li>He can actually use this instead of the much costlier Aveeno.</li>
            <li>This soap makes my skin so soft and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with razor burn with it.</li>
            <li>lather  -Leaves skin soft, but without residue  -All</li>
            <li>natural ingredients    </li>
            <li>It is far from that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recommend this for anyone with sensitive skin or roseacea.</li>
            <li>(Lush)</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it does not irritate me.</li>
            <li>My wife has extemely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>, It helped my dry skin so much!</li>
            <li>My skin is less dry and seems to look a bit better.  </li>
            <li>Smell is decent for female and males.</li>
            <li>Most soaps (Dove, Irish Spring, etc) are not much more than detergent crystals pressed into a bar, with varying levels of glycerin and fragrances to tell them apart.</li>
            <li>priced right and long lasting .</li>
            <li>however the smell can easily be showered out if you spend a few extra minutes in the shower if you don&#x27;t intend to smell</li>
            <li>This soap really helps with dry skin.  </li>
            <li>and that is a half a century worth.</li>
            <li>it is expensive but it is has good fragrance and does last longer than avg.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast, this goat soap is great, will never use the liquid crap that we use to purchase.</li>
            <li>However, I had major problems with the shipping as the tracking code indicated the package had been delivered, which was untrue.</li>
            <li>and it lathers up like no other soap I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>The fact that this soap gets such glowing reviews, to my mind, says much about how little people expect from modern soap.</li>
            <li>I am not sure of the essential oils in this soap, but I seem to smell a light fragrance of cloves and patchouli.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my skin soft and is not fragranced enough to interfere with my cologne.</li>
            <li>The bars themselves smell quite loudly and can perfume my entire bathroom.</li>
            <li>Have yet to see how soft it keeps the skin I have only used for a week.</li>
            <li>reminiscent of Old Spice  </li>
            <li>away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Real soap has an obvious trait- it dissolves completely in water.</li>
            <li>I bought my first few bars from Amazon, but found that a natural grocery store in my city  is now selling it as well - Sunflower in ABQ, NM.</li>
            <li>I bought it and it was kind of expensive for five dollars on one bar</li>
            <li>Lasts much longer that any other soap I have used in my life</li>
            <li>I have used other soaps that claim to make your skin softer for one reason or another, bar of soap and or body wash, but they don&#x27;t really work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goat&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Canus Goat&#x27;s Milk Soap promises something other, the goodness of a real bar soap.</li>
            <li>I have eczema and it does not dry my skin out at all.</li>
            <li>and it does not dry up my skin</li>
            <li>It does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is not dry and itchy after a shower.</li>
            <li>my skin is not dry.</li>
            <li>The cost is similar to major brand soaps that don&#x27;t deliver what this does.</li>
            <li>but it smells a little funny.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, rinses off easily so no scum left in your body.  </li>
            <li>It tends to be awfully pricy though, so we have been happy to be able to buy it in larger quantities for less through Amazon.</li>
            <li>They clearly last a very long time (I bathe everyday, sometimes even 2x a day, so they last long on a daily use). :)&lt;</li>
            <li>We live in Colorado where the air is very dry</li>
            <li>I live in New England and ran out of this soap a few weeks ago and had to make do with a glycerin soap that was supposed to moisturize.</li>
            <li>A friend told me to try this particular brand and ever since I did, I cannot use any other soap.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong; I like my soap to have a smell, but this soap&#x27;s fragrance is so strong, it smells like perfume!  </li>
            <li>It helps keep my dry skin as soft as a soap can.</li>
            <li>In these difficult economic times, many of us are doing without some of the little luxuries.</li>
            <li>it really doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like other soap does but</li>

            <li> any they made my skin nice an soft .</li>
            <li> I initially bought this Canus goat milk soap from Wholefoods, and I loved it and kept buying every time we ran out of it.  </li>
            <li> It is good , solid soap</li>
            <li> I love this soap, as the scent reminds me of the Maja soaps from Spain, but this is much creamier.</li>
            <li> The soap is mild and gentle; it is quite possibly my favorite soap that I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li> Also, It lathers very well and leaves you feeling very clean.</li>
            <li> However, the scent is fresh, unique, and once its on your skin isn&#x27;t overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is so fresh and clean smelling.</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;Goat Milk\\&quot; soap leaves your skin feeling clean, fresh &amp; hydrated.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure anyone would love it, forget all those brands You found in Your local walgreens, this is it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll see how my skin holds up this winter with the switch, but overall I&#x27;m more than satisfied.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> I sent some to my mom, too (mostly because of the cute goat on the label) and she likes it a lot, especially the bottle of bath soap)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that this soap would better serve as a hand soap, mainly because I don&#x27;t have the wherewithal to scrub my bathtub every day.</li>
            <li> I will have to share this with my daughter, her family uses this quickly.  </li>
            <li> Luckily I caught it or I would have been out the money.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this one for those that want a great, lasting, moisturizing soap!</li>
            <li> Thanks Canus!!</li>
            <li> but I could feel the difference since the first day!</li>
            <li> Will never use any other kind of soap!</li>
            <li> I bought the 20 bar deal - which is a great deal at a little over a buck a bar.</li>
            <li> a quality product for the price, perfect for sensitive skin, lovely fragrance and long lasting large bar of goat&#x27;s milk soap; shipping was prompt; well done!</li>
            <li> Ugh, I&#x27;ve been happily using this soap for a few years until it was pointed out to me that Canus soaps contain a formaldehyde-releaser: DMDM Hydantoin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell, which I like and leaves your skin smooth.</li>
            <li> But something you should try for yourself cause it really is a nice soap overall.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is also really nice and is totally gender neutral.</li>
            <li> Since discovering this soap, my skin now feels soft and more moist.  </li>
            <li> Worth a try.</li>
            <li> but i guess it just wasn&#x27;t the golden soap.</li>
            <li> You get a product that doesn&#x27;t test on animals, has quality, gentle ingredients for a more than reasonable price.</li>
            <li> fresh moose mints.&lt;br /&gt;--D. Mikels, Esq.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both have sensitive skin and never buy any type of glycerin soap so we buy fragrance free, perfume free, etc.</li>
            <li> I wish they made one which smelled like apples or oranges, or something more natural.</li>
            <li> This is not a lightly-scented soap; it has a distinct smell.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it also but not crazy about the smell.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is fresh and not too feminine that the husband won&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than others that claim to be for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Having sensitive skin is so enjoyable with this soap.</li>
            <li> and we now use this soap and will continue using it.[[ASIN:B001E763NQ Canus Goat&#x27;s Milk Rich Moisturizing Pure Vegetable Oil Soap, 3-Count Boxes (Pack of 4)]]</li>
            <li> We love it, especially the smell, leaves skin so fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> The price seems quite fair in comparison to some other triple-milled soaps I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> This is now one of my new favorite soaps and I will continue to buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> This is the first \\&quot;special\\&quot; soap that I tried after looking for better moisturizing and natural alternative.</li>
            <li> It lathers nicely and unlike most bar soaps that make the claim but do not deliver, Canus actually does not dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> The slight fragrance is pleasant.</li>
            <li> smells wonderfully clean and is gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> When the store ran out and were not going to order more I found it on Amazon, and at a much better price than we had paid for it previously.   </li>
            <li> Some have overly sensitive skin while others, like me, are fortunate enough that we can use this kind soap and not get a reaction to it.    </li>
            <li> The soap is good but not worth that price.</li>
            <li> While I prefer the Orchid Oil scent, I couldn&#x27;t turn down this bargain price on the original, which still smells really nice.  </li>
            <li> This soap is amazing, I have dry skin</li>
            <li> It felt so soft and easy to comb through.</li>
            <li> The good Sir Rosis has just finished his fourth pint of wee Scottish brandy, and tells his young maid:  </li>
            <li> I personally use the liquid body wash and it is just as nice, but the rest of my family uses the bars and we are never without it, thanks to Amazon</li>
            <li> lucky and Whole Foods Mkt has it on sale.  </li>
            <li> ; nice to the skin - doesn&#x27;t dry it out,</li>
            <li> Lathers well, smells fantastic without being too strong, and a bar lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It is also very gentle to skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We can&#x27;t find it in our area and the price is very reasonable.  </li>
            <li> I like this soap very much and have recommended to my friends.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle and has no smell.</li>
            <li> (if I don&#x27;t moisturize) it doesn&#x27;t irritate it in any way, and by morning I wake up with clean, fresh, soft skin.  </li>
            <li> i had a huge problem with dry/itchy skin, it has completely stopped once i stared using this soap.   </li>
            <li> The best alternative to my expensive bath soap and still with no itchiness and redness.</li>
            <li> So many people raved about the smell of this soap that I couldnt wait to rip it open when it arrived!</li>
            <li> Even after the first time I used it, I could feel a difference.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for;</li>
            <li> It smells very feminine, which I don&#x27;t mind, but I know my husband and sons probably will!  </li>
            <li> A friend brought me the first Canus goat&#x27;s milk soap I used.  </li>
            <li> Leaving skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I really hope they start selling the lavender one on subscribe &amp; save soon!</li>
            <li> But overall I like it and will buy more when I finish this lot.</li>
            <li> REAL soap, not like what they sell in the stores today!.</li>
            <li> would love to have amazon refund me back</li>
            <li> I am allergic to most soaps and finally found canus about 5 years ago.</li>
            <li> I WILL be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are pretty innocuous too.</li>
            <li> My daughter gave me my first bar about 9 months ago</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different ones and had just about given up.</li>
            <li> First, this item is not returnable.</li>
            <li> The only soap I&#x27;ve been able to use that does not throw my feminine ph off or irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Amazon is amazing because this soap has become more harder to find else where over the last year...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only soap we both love.</li>
            <li> Pine tar soap, Grandmas lye, Dead Sea salt soap, etc, etc, this one&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> It is great it makes you very dry hands not dry and cracked</li>
            <li> This so is a great product to use anytime but especially in the winter when your skin tends to get quite dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> I used the bar on my hair and wow!!!!</li>
            <li> Loved not only because it is so gentle on the skin, we also love it because of its very delicate fragrance and the fact that each bar is easy to hold.</li>
            <li> It has a rich creamy lather that soothes as it cleans leaving your skin dewy soft.</li>
            <li> Clean Smelling, this soap has replaced my previous preference of many years, Lever2000.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling clean, soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> I find the smell refreshing, but it does remain in the shower long after using it.  </li>
            <li> It has such a fresh, clean smell</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t flowery or overpowering or baby powder fresh, it smells clean, the scent is similar to \\&quot;fragrance free\\&quot; hand lotion with a hint of powdered milk?</li>
            <li> You get such a clean fresh feeling after showering with this soap.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different soaps over the years but this one has been by far the best Goats milk soap that I have used next to homemade.</li>
            <li> The price was very reasonable at $12.74 for 12 bars, free shipping with Prime, for a total of $1.06 each.</li>
            <li> Always a terrific soap  ..  not always easy to find so stock up when you can</li>
            <li> But this one smells actually too strong...</li>
            <li> Will almost certainly reorder.</li>
            <li> It is fine milled and lasts longer than a regular bar of soap because it doesn&#x27;t just melt away.</li>
            <li> These soaps are of very high quality.</li>
            <li> It lathers just right and leaves you fresh and clean unlike other soaps.</li>
            <li> It gives a real nice SOFT LATHER and doesn&#x27;t leave this skin dry unlike other soaps we have tried.      </li>
            <li> , it just smells clean and fresh (think linens hung on the line).&lt;br /&gt;-5 stars for how long one bar of this soap lasts!  </li>
            <li> This is the real deal:  naturally homogenized farm fresh goat milk.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for listening.</li>
            <li> My skin now feels very nourished and moist.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> They are also very dense, and it does not take much to get a generous lather.</li>
            <li> We like it so much I have put it on a scheduled reorder account.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think the smell was too much, not like another that I tried.  </li>
            <li> I still wanted to use it though since it is more natural but what I really don&#x27;t like is the overpowering smell (compared to varieties of mainstream brands that I used before e.g. Irish Spring, Dial, etc.)</li>
            <li> she thinks the smell is just too much too).</li>
            <li> I really think it has made a difference with my skin</li>
            <li> Next time I order, I will get the fragrance free version.</li>
            <li> the smell reminds me of \\&quot;Eucerin\\&quot; body cr&amp;egrave;me/lotion, but the soap smells much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a diehard Dove fan since I was a kid (thanks Mom).</li>
            <li> The fragrance is divine..smells so clean and does not dry your skin.  </li>
            <li> Since there&#x27;s been so much conversation about the scent:</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Yes, I highly recommend this soap to everyone!</li>
            <li> Found it at Whole Foods</li>
            <li> Buying by the case is so much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Different fragrance options available, I prefer not so string smells.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely \\&quot;LOVE\\&quot;</li>
            <li> the fact that this soap is natural and have this fresh herbal scent.</li>
            <li> Have used the soap in the past but moved to Texas and couldn&#x27;t find; very glad when i located it again on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Real soap is made from fat and lye-</li>
            <li> so I assumed it would be a real soap.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my Mother, and she really likes it.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how much I like it.</li>
            <li> I was given a full refund on the product that was not received, but now I have to place a second order to get what I should have gotten the first time around.</li>
            <li> I absolutely \\&quot;LOVE\\&quot;  natural &amp; organic products!!!</li>
            <li> This soap boasts a light, clean, mild fragrance (in other words, thank goodness it doesn&#x27;t smell like actual goat milk).  </li>
            <li> First saw this product at the Live Expo.  </li>
            <li> It is so rich that I use it for shaving, and gentle enough to use it to wash my face.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling clean but not dried out, and soft but not greasy.</li>
            <li> I originally found it at a local landscape company where gardeners bought it for their hands.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell and it lasts a lot longer than other kinds of soaps.</li>
            <li> The scent is a pleasant one, can be a little heavy, but it&#x27;s one you will enjoy.  </li>
            <li> I like the brand, clean smelling scent and each bar lasts longer than any commercial brand I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The soap has a clean smell and last forever.</li>
            <li> Goat milk soap is really gentle on the skin, and this particular soup has met all my expectations.</li>
            <li> in short, I had to use my soap to clean up whatever this product is.</li>
            <li> love the fragrant and stays firm all the way, until it is paper-thin, unlike those popular commercial brands soaps, this soap last longer so it justifies the cost.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your skin so soft and smooth, not dry at all.</li>
            <li> Most soaps that are free from perfumes and irritants for sensitive skin, overly dry my skin to where I get dry patches, this soap does not!</li>
            <li> It does leave your skin very soft, but many other soaps that have gender-neutral smells will, also.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this soap after reading many glowing reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve previously ordered Alpen&#x27;s Goatsmilk soap and decided to try Canus after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li> be buying this soaps because i know they are way better than regular soaps and because of the goats milk if they actually have any,</li>
            <li> Not only does it leave skin soft and smooth</li>
            <li> I even tried to melt the soap over a double boiler to combine it with some better smelling essential oils, but it caked and didn&#x27;t melt well.</li>
            <li> it is here quick if ever I run short.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my husband after reading other reviews on a different site, and absolutely love this soap!  </li>
            <li> I have such sensitive skin and this soap helps by skin feel smooth.  </li>
            <li> I have allergies and this soap is gentle, smells wonderfully clean and does not irritate or dry out the skin.  </li>
            <li> I used this soap ten years ago and have only been able to find it at specialty stores and then the price is way to high to purchase.  </li>
            <li> It is a strong bar, last a long time and WORKS even on a big strong man&#x27;s odor - my husband loves it.</li>
            <li> I have super dry skin and live in a cold climate and this is the best soap I&#x27;ve ever come across.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly reccommend the Canus line of products.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a goat&#x27;s milk soap that wasn&#x27;t high priced.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> the soap doesnt get a high non toxic rating.</li>
            <li> We highly recommend it&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this soap.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a high moisture soap of course</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Amazon offers a better bulk bargain than any of the other drugstore companies.</li>
            <li> Not harsh like so many other soaps I have tried.</li>
            <li> It may be a little more costly than what you buy in the store</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times myself and have been complimented on the clean fresh scent and asked what I was wearing.</li>
            <li> Originally purchased it five years ago for itchy dry skin during the winter.  </li>
            <li> The aroma is a clean, fresh smell and long lasting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a built in washcloth, and when the soap is all completely used, it leaves  a little sack or pouch, old fashioned, but nice.  </li>
            <li> Gentle soap product for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this soap is gentle while moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> the normal soaps</li>
            <li> This is quickly becoming the only soap I am starting to use.</li>
            <li> I am used to it now, but when I first got it, I could barely stand it.  </li>
            <li> It does not have all the harsh chemicals that most soaps have.</li>
            <li> I would call it my second favorite soap, but my first is, 5-10 times more expensive</li>
            <li> Try it and you will come back for more if you suffer from dry skin.</li>
            <li> The smell is fresh and this product isn&#x27;t so tough on my skin as most soaps are.  </li>
            <li> this is a quality soap that is quite creamy lathers well and works in hard and soft water environments, nice fragrance</li>
            <li> We were paying $3.25 a bar locally, and it is important to buy locally, but at the price we paid Amazon we can afford to continue using it.  </li>
            <li> Bought this soap for both myself and my daughter who has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I thought it smelled very masculine</li>
            <li> Highly recommended to anyone conscious about skin care.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend that anyone who has sensitive skin, give Canus Goat&#x27;s Milk Soap a try...</li>
            <li> My husband has very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hands very soft even in the winter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used more expensive,name brand, dry skin soaks with not near the satisfaction achieved with \\&quot;Canus\\&quot;.          </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t melt away quickly like some other natural soaps, it really lasts.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin very clean and clear some brown spots after a few days of use.</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t, I&#x27;d be surprised!  </li>
            <li> Even my 10 year old granddaughter loves it!</li>
            <li> Eventually the package was delivered a complete week after it was supposedly delivered to me!</li>
            <li> ; I found myself having to scrub out the bathtub nearly every day!    </li>
            <li> I would test it out with only one bar if it is your first use.</li>
            <li> It cost me $25.30 and that included shipping for the exact same soap you are now selling for $62.97 plus shipping.</li>
            <li> The smell of the soap is quite awesome and hard to describe - slightly herbal, very clean, classic, unique - never heard a bad comment on it.</li>
            <li> It really moisturizes and it&#x27;s free of all the chemicals you usually find in soaps.  </li>
            <li> soap does not dry out your skin and lathers very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I read several of the positive reviews and decided to try itr for myself.</li>
            <li> This soap is very soft, the perfume is not too overpowering plus it is gentle enough to be used on babies.</li>
            <li> a clean, fresh and a little bit powdery scent that stays with you all day long.    </li>
            <li> The bars are quite large and it smells terrific.</li>
            <li> It is simple and pure.  </li>
            <li> If you have not experienced this soap yet in your life and you appreciate quality soap and fantastic clean, fresh and slightly spicy scents, then order some now.</li>
            <li> It rinses off cleanly and is slightly moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I wear my hair natural so that is vital.</li>
            <li> Its not going to make ur skin soft overnight</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin soft and radiant.</li>
            <li> Affordable, natural soap.</li>
            <li> I recently bought the marigold lotion and found that while I can tolerate the marigold fragrance, I really didn&#x27;t care for it and prefer the unscented.</li>
            <li> Goat&#x27;s milk soap has been our family soap for nearly 10 years.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to shampoo as frequently.</li>
            <li> This has definitely helped, has a minimal if any scent, and leaves me feeling clean, fresh, and not so dry.</li>
            <li> for 12 pieces that last much longer than others, it&#x27;s heck of a deal.   </li>
            <li> My husband has really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Wow what a savings</li>
            <li> it keeps our skin soft</li>
            <li> I have sensitive (aging) skin that requires TLC.  </li>
            <li> Gentle enough for babies, comes scented and unscentewd.</li>
            <li> the labeling fraudulently stating all natural base&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is not all natural</li>
            <li> /&gt;It leaves your skin feeling soft and smelling like perfume.</li>
            <li> He can actually use this instead of the much costlier Aveeno.</li>
            <li> This soap makes my skin so soft and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with razor burn with it.</li>
            <li> lather  -Leaves skin soft, but without residue  -All</li>
            <li> natural ingredients    </li>
            <li> It is far from that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recommend this for anyone with sensitive skin or roseacea.</li>
            <li> (Lush)</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it does not irritate me.</li>
            <li> My wife has extemely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> , It helped my dry skin so much!</li>
            <li> My skin is less dry and seems to look a bit better.  </li>
            <li> Smell is decent for female and males.</li>
            <li> Most soaps (Dove, Irish Spring, etc) are not much more than detergent crystals pressed into a bar, with varying levels of glycerin and fragrances to tell them apart.</li>
            <li> priced right and long lasting .</li>
            <li> however the smell can easily be showered out if you spend a few extra minutes in the shower if you don&#x27;t intend to smell</li>
            <li> This soap really helps with dry skin.  </li>
            <li> and that is a half a century worth.</li>
            <li> it is expensive but it is has good fragrance and does last longer than avg.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast, this goat soap is great, will never use the liquid crap that we use to purchase.</li>
            <li> However, I had major problems with the shipping as the tracking code indicated the package had been delivered, which was untrue.</li>
            <li> and it lathers up like no other soap I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li> The fact that this soap gets such glowing reviews, to my mind, says much about how little people expect from modern soap.</li>
            <li> I am not sure of the essential oils in this soap, but I seem to smell a light fragrance of cloves and patchouli.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my skin soft and is not fragranced enough to interfere with my cologne.</li>
            <li> The bars themselves smell quite loudly and can perfume my entire bathroom.</li>
            <li> Have yet to see how soft it keeps the skin I have only used for a week.</li>
            <li> reminiscent of Old Spice  </li>
            <li> away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Real soap has an obvious trait- it dissolves completely in water.</li>
            <li> I bought my first few bars from Amazon, but found that a natural grocery store in my city  is now selling it as well - Sunflower in ABQ, NM.</li>
            <li> I bought it and it was kind of expensive for five dollars on one bar</li>
            <li> Lasts much longer that any other soap I have used in my life</li>
            <li> I have used other soaps that claim to make your skin softer for one reason or another, bar of soap and or body wash, but they don&#x27;t really work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goat&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Canus Goat&#x27;s Milk Soap promises something other, the goodness of a real bar soap.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and it does not dry my skin out at all.</li>
            <li> and it does not dry up my skin</li>
            <li> It does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is not dry and itchy after a shower.</li>
            <li> my skin is not dry.</li>
            <li> The cost is similar to major brand soaps that don&#x27;t deliver what this does.</li>
            <li> but it smells a little funny.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, rinses off easily so no scum left in your body.  </li>
            <li> It tends to be awfully pricy though, so we have been happy to be able to buy it in larger quantities for less through Amazon.</li>
            <li> They clearly last a very long time (I bathe everyday, sometimes even 2x a day, so they last long on a daily use). :)&lt;</li>
            <li> We live in Colorado where the air is very dry</li>
            <li> I live in New England and ran out of this soap a few weeks ago and had to make do with a glycerin soap that was supposed to moisturize.</li>
            <li> A friend told me to try this particular brand and ever since I did, I cannot use any other soap.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong; I like my soap to have a smell, but this soap&#x27;s fragrance is so strong, it smells like perfume!  </li>
            <li> It helps keep my dry skin as soft as a soap can.</li>
            <li> In these difficult economic times, many of us are doing without some of the little luxuries.</li>
            <li> it really doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like other soap does but</li>
            <li> This is the only soap I have ever used long term that does not dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and dove is about the only other soap I can use.</li>
            <li> I find it to be moisturizing and long lasting.</li>
            <li> The bars are long lasting as well.</li>
            <li> This soap used to last a long time.</li>
            <li> The bars last a long time.</li>
            <li> long lasting bar - would buy again  </li>
            <li> And, the bars last a very long time.</li>
            <li> It is the only soap I have found that doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li> It has moisturizer in it and prevents dry skin, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> The bar of soap lasts a long time so when I saw Amazon had 12 bars for $17.27, I decided I&#x27;m splurging and getting them</li>
            <li> Try it it you have never experienced a real soap and only the store bought stuff from the giant corporations!</li>
            <li> Hydantoin, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Titanium Dioxide  is not natural</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this soap for a long time and she loves it.</li>
            <li> Also lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> These bars will keep me going a long time.  </li>
            <li> One bar of soap lasts as long as 6 bars of the brand&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is one product that I will continue using for a long, long time.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Shared</li>
            <li> However, I only received half of my order and was billed for the entire amount.  </li>
            <li> We live in a small town and the price was inflated because of the lack of demand for this soap.</li>
            <li> Depending on how bad you skind tends to dry up you may still need a moisturizer, but you will see far better results that using any other soap.</li>
            <li> Once you use it for a while you will never go back to other soaps.</li>
            <li> Only thing I&#x27;ve noticed while using this is that I get a little back acne around shoulder blade area</li>
            <li> It lasts very long for a family of four.</li>
            <li> My skin is now the dryest it&#x27;s been in a very long time.     </li>
            <li> I have dry skin and this soap helps.</li>
            <li> Every winter, I fought with terribly dry skin.</li>
            <li> Living in an arid area, my skin was always dry.  </li>
            <li> Still, my skin is extremely dry after using this one as well.  </li>
            <li> Lathers well, doesn&#x27;t dry out skin.&lt;br /&gt;Our</li>
            <li> Moisturizes - We all get dry skin in the winter</li>
            <li> but my husband, being a man, refuses to use lotion on his itchy dry skin.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t get dry skin with it.</li>
            <li> Lathers well and does not seem to dry the skin.  </li>
            <li> When I am tired or too lazy to use facial cleanser on my delicate, easily irritated, possibly roseaceaous, skin I will actually wash my face with this bar and though it dries it a wee bit</li>
            <li> They are even better than some of the very expensive specialty soaps sold in boutique stores.</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry and not using soap without lotion or any, so I&#x27;m not a fan of any soap, but this one is what I&#x27;m going to use, probably very very long time.</li>
            <li> I purchased these based upon a previous recommendation from a friend and online was the only place I could find them.</li>
            <li> I have Psoriais and very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and also eczema and have been at wits</li>
            <li> I dislike scents, and this soap has a very subtle scent that is pretty unnoticeable.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just a little different</li>
            <li> I started using this soap several years ago when my friend spotted it in a little out-of-the-way store in Colorado.  </li>
            <li> It also lasts for a very long time...much longer than other bar soaps.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out skin like other soaps can.</li>
            <li> It does leave your tub dull looking,but your skin is soft and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I am in my late fifties and this soap has made my skin soft as a baby.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;please take a look at the customers review total graph and analyze the negative reviews before you buy.&lt;br /&gt;the obvious is sometimes buried.</li>
            <li> I began using this a few months ago and cannot get over the dramatic change in my dry sensitive skin to soft and supple skin.</li>
            <li> The sack felts and shrinks as the soap gets wet and soapy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lifelong sufferer of atopic dermatitis.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the strength of the reviews here, but this soap dried my skin out every time I used it, and that was over the course of several months.  </li>
            <li> I was given this soap a few years back</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I only have brand loyalty for a few things</li>
            <li> They leave it in the tub area and it gets wet.</li>
            <li> Soap is gentle and non irritating to the skin.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong and the price is right as well.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out like the average soap you buy in the store</li>
            <li> And because it&#x27;s triple-milled these soap bars are hard and long lasting (be prepared to scrub that carcass for awhile).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My sister-in-law&#x27;s aunt suggested I try this as I typically struggle with dry skin all winter.</li>
            <li> Regular soap is just not good enough people; this is what you need!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only soap I have used for the past 6 years now.</li>
            <li> and I would not consider using any other.  </li>
            <li> My skin breaks out when I use any other soap.  </li>
            <li> Other reviewers have stated that the fragrance stays with you throughout the day, but I haven&#x27;t found that to be the case.</li>
            <li> The vendor was not much help, insisting that it had been delivered, and instructed me to track it down, which took a lot of calling and waiting on the USPS line.</li>
            <li> If there was one thing I would change, it would be to have a &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; variety, being very careful of each and every ingredient that goes into the soap making process.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used bar soap for several years as I hate having to clean a bathtub ring.</li>
            <li> Less chemicals you can&#x27;t pronounce unlike other leading brands.</li>
            <li> It was hard to find locally in Atlanta area.  </li>
            <li> Each bar is 5 oz., which may be hard to picture, but let me tell you that they are BIG bars.</li>
            <li> now after trying this soap, it will be really hard to go back to anything else!</li>
            <li> My only complaint -the smell</li>
            <li> whatever benefit you get out of goat&#x27;s milk (at least you are helping a goat farmer somewhere instead of giving your money to a giant multi-national like P&amp;G)</li>
            <li> When rubbed into a pouf, it produces thick, dense, creamy bubbles that feel terrific on your skin.</li>
            <li> Keeps the itching down in the winter.  </li>
            <li> I would not use any other soap!</li>
            <li> No more dry itchy skin.</li>
            <li> It smells slightly of bergamot</li>
            <li> I would prefer a bit less scent.</li>
            <li> , I am even using less oils, lotions etc.</li>
            <li> Had half my order turn moldy in the sealed packages.  </li>
            <li> No soap mess.  </li>
            <li> My husband likes the smell but says it dries out his skin a little.    </li>
            <li> I can smell it a little if I get heated up throughout the day.</li>
            <li> A little spicy.  </li>
            <li> Have a very oily face that is dry after I wash it and would flake really bad.  </li>
            <li> Not very appealing</li>
            <li> (unfortunately, my other half is not thrilled...</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this soap at the Green Festival in D.C. a few years ago.</li>
            <li> I started giving a few bars as hostess gifts.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t get that dried out feeling</li>
            <li> I LIVE IN COLD WEATHER, WHICH DRIES MY SKIN OUT, AND THIS HELPS WITH THAT.</li>
            <li> I had bad acne on my back, and after switching from irish spring to this soap, the acne went away.  </li>
            <li> This soap moisturizes not much better than the Lever 2000</li>
            <li> This soap won&#x27;t leave you dried out, and the lather and scent are a plus!  </li>
            <li> No better soap.  </li>
            <li> Stick with the small Mom and Pop soap makers.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t suds excessively, which may bother some, but I like this too.</li>
            <li> It stinks to high heaven like old lady or bad cologne.</li>
            <li> Its smell is hard to describe, but two of my friends seem to think it smells like dog shampoo, so we&#x27;ll go with that..</li>
            <li> My husband and I are hooked on Canus goat&#x27;s milk soap, and we try hard not to run out of it.  </li>
            <li> My skin is so tempermental, and it hasn&#x27;t complained once since I started using the Canus line of products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this feels like any common soap:</li>
            <li> a ring of stubborn soap scum in the tub</li>
            <li> Noticeable difference...softer and smoother skin, especially during the cold weather season.  </li>
            <li> It also is non drying to my skin which is necessary in cold, winter months.</li>
            <li> No irritation or any sort of negative feeling.</li>
            <li> No more words that I can conceive or whatever!</li>
            <li> Well this winter was brutal with the heat on constantly, and my husband didn&#x27;t have dry skin using this soap.  </li>
            <li> I live in maine where the winter months can be brutal on my skin..</li>
            <li> This is the way soap is supposed to feel, not the commercially made stuff that dried my skin out terribly.</li>
            <li> What poor business practices.</li>
            <li> But I guess I&#x27;m doing something wrong though</li>
            <li> so i guess they are alright ill</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> This soap is missing something-maybe it&#x27;s the vegetable oil base.</li>
            <li> dirty&lt;br /&gt;most of the reviews are just wrong and or misled&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe I am wrong, but I swear it smells yummy.  </li>
            <li> but you won&#x27;t be sorry you bought it and will probably never use anything else again.  </li>
            <li> Just received another wrong order of soap</li>
            <li> Expensive for a bar of soap.</li>
            <li> Buy it and try it yourself, you won&#x27;t be disappointed and it&#x27;ll make a believer out of you.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when I got the package and realized it has some un-natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> This product has very bad and dangerous ingredients in it.</li>
            <li> hate it.</li>
            <li> which creates a lot of bubbles and does not have any nasty or annoying perfume.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell awful</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I have Psoriais and very dry skin. I was told that goat&#x27;s milk helps with Psoriais and it does. Doesn&#x27;t eliminate it but controls it to a point where I don&#x27;t mind wearing short sleeve shirts now. My skin is wonderful and smooth and hasn&#x27;t looked good for years but does now. In fact, I have handed out bars to many of  my friends and family telling them what a difference. My mom was just here visiting and she asked if she could get another bar..so I gave her one of my 3-packs. Will be ordering more when I run out. Thanks Canus!!</li>
            <li> it is expensive but it is has good fragrance and does last longer than avg. soap. If you are looking for a moisturizing soap, this is the way to go!</li>
            <li> I have tried several different soaps over the years but this one has been by far the best Goats milk soap that I have used next to homemade.</li>
            <li> Love this soap. It smells wonderful and leaves your skin feeling soft.  It doesn&#x27;t leave any kind of film on your skin.</li>
            <li> Gentle soap product for those with sensitive skin. Doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out skin like other soaps can. Moisturizes well.</li>
            <li> Just love them. Love the smell and the price. The best alternative to my expensive bath soap and still with no itchiness and redness.</li>
            <li> Bought this soap for both myself and my daughter who has very sensitive skin and we both love it! I bought one box that was scented and the unscented for her. She has eczema and this soap has a very calming effect and does not irritate her skin, it is wonderful. Don&#x27;t hesitate to use this soap it is everything all the reviewers have said positively the best product it makes your skin so soft and the scented has a wonderful smell.</li>
            <li> I will add my praises for this soap.  I am in my late fifties and this soap has made my skin soft as a baby. My husband even noticed the difference. I have a request for the company.  Please consider making a shampoo and conditioner. I used the bar on my hair and wow!!!! It felt so soft and easy to comb through. I wear my hair natural so that is vital. I am purchasing your body wash product to use as a shampoo but a conditioner would be nice to go along with it.</li>
            <li> great soap helps your skin during the fall and winter months</li>
            <li> I would def buy this soap again and for friends. I gave a pack to my mom and she loves the smell of it. Its not going to make ur skin soft overnight but it does make it feel good if ur skin is already soft. I use it twice a day it really doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like other soap does but its not a miracle soap like most people are saying it is. But something you should try for yourself cause it really is a nice soap overall.</li>
            <li> So many people raved about the smell of this soap that I couldnt wait to rip it open when it arrived! I have to agree with one review I read which described it as a manly scent. Its not overpowering for a woman to the point that she cant use it, but its definitely not a feminine or even neutral scent. In fact, I finally pinpointed what I think it smells like: Men&#x27;s shaving cream. The standard, no frill, white, can shaving cream.     I find it to be moisturizing and long lasting. My husband likes the smell but says it dries out his skin a little.    The price was very reasonable at $12.74 for 12 bars, free shipping with Prime, for a total of $1.06 each.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and this soap helps. I can find nothing about it that I don&#x27;t like. I intend to buy more of their products.</li>
            <li> Like the lather, the scent is pleasant and the soap bar lasts a good while.</li>
            <li> These soaps are of very high quality. They are even better than some of the very expensive specialty soaps sold in boutique stores. Very good for dry skin and leaves a very light weight feel. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> A friend gave this to me at Christmastime.  I used it and absolutely loved the way it has a rich luxurious lather, a deep invigorating smell, and a silky smooth feeling it leaves on my skin.  But I guess I&#x27;m doing something wrong though because once I&#x27;m out of the shower, I don&#x27;t smell it on me at all.  The bar of soap lasts a long time so when I saw Amazon had 12 bars for $17.27, I decided I&#x27;m splurging and getting them (Merry Christmas to me!).  My husband won&#x27;t use it but it&#x27;s his loss and my gain.          You can&#x27;t make a soap that will please everyone.  Not everyone has the same type of skin.  Some have overly sensitive skin while others, like me, are fortunate enough that we can use this kind soap and not get a reaction to it.    I bought 2 of the travel sets but had to buy 2 more because I gave them away as gifts.  I can&#x27;t say enough about this soap but I guess I already did so I&#x27;ll close for now.  Thanks for listening.</li>
            <li> Try it and you will come back for more if you suffer from dry skin. I&#x27;ve used more expensive,name brand, dry skin soaks with not near the satisfaction achieved with \\&quot;Canus\\&quot;.          [[ASIN:B001E763NQ Canus Goat&#x27;s Milk Bar Soap, 3-Count Boxes (Pack of 4)]]</li>
            <li> I have used both the scented and unscented variety of this soap.  Lather is great, as you might expect, and I find this to be a high quality soap.  For me, the scent is most akin to Colgate shaving cream.  I find the smell refreshing, but it does remain in the shower long after using it.  My wife doesn&#x27;t mind the smell, but she doesn&#x27;t use the bar.  If you have any doubts, go for the unscented bar.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Canus soap for several months now and it is by far the best soap you could use. It lathers nicely and the fragrance is wonderful. I have been on the monthly delivery and have given away the last 4 deliveries~ Everyone loves it. Try it, I think you&#x27;ll like it....if you don&#x27;t, I&#x27;d be surprised!  PS........disappointed I haven&#x27;t received Dec. shipment yet......must be holiday package mailings~</li>
            <li> This soap is fantastic. Leaves your skin soft and radiant. I recommend it to anybody looking for a good mosturizing soap.</li>
            <li> I totally love this soap. Smells good and it does not dry my skin out. I ran out of it and was using dove and it just didnt cut it. Amazon is the cheapest place I have found it. You have to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I received a sample bar of this soap at the \\&quot;Race For The Cure Walk\\&quot; last year.  Mu husband &amp; I both tried it and WE LOVE IT..IT&#x27;S THE BEST SOAP EVER!!!!!  We use to use Dial or Ivory and we now use this soap and will continue using it.[[ASIN:B001E763NQ Canus Goat&#x27;s Milk Rich Moisturizing Pure Vegetable Oil Soap, 3-Count Boxes (Pack of 4)]]</li>
            <li> I love using Canus Goats Milk soap. It&#x27;s the only soap on the market I will buy from now no.</li>
            <li> First saw this product at the Live Expo.  Tried it and loved it.  It was hard to find locally in Atlanta area.  When I saw the price, I had to jump on it.</li>
            <li> My family has used Cannus Goats Milk Soap for several years.  We live in Colorado where the air is very dry and we find the soap helps moisturize our skin.  It tends to be awfully pricy though, so we have been happy to be able to buy it in larger quantities for less through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great price for a quality product. Lathers beautifully and lasts a long time. You feel very clean and fresh. My only complaint -the smell, it does take some getting used to. It doesn&#x27;t smell awful, it&#x27;s just a little different and it takes some adjustment. Now that I have been using it for a while the smell is refreshing. I have been a Crabtree &amp; Evelyn user for years and the goat&#x27;s milk soap from that company has a softer scent with lavender. I highly reccommend the Canus line of products.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I even got my mother and mother-in-law hooked on it.  It makes your skin so soft and smells great.  It doesn&#x27;t melt away quickly like some other natural soaps, it really lasts.</li>
            <li> Affordable, natural soap. I try and stay away from perfumed products, but I really love the way this soap smells! It is so rich that I use it for shaving, and gentle enough to use it to wash my face. Awesome soap and long-lasting (if you don&#x27;t leave it on the shower floor!).</li>
            <li> Every winter, I fought with terribly dry skin. Then I found Camus goats milk soap. Now I don&#x27;t even have to use moisturizers! Excellent product.</li>
            <li> I first used this soap many, many years ago and loved it.  Couldn&#x27;t believe it when I realized I could purchase 12 bars at a time from Amazon.  It has such a fresh, clean smell I can&#x27;t imagine anyone not liking it.  Even my 10 year old granddaughter loves it!</li>
            <li> This is the only soap I have ever used long term that does not dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> I began using this a few months ago and cannot get over the dramatic change in my dry sensitive skin to soft and supple skin. Even after the first time I used it, I could feel a difference. I have very dry skin and also eczema and have been at wits end to find something that helps and doesn&#x27;t add to the problems I have and this soap is it. It has a very creamy texture, lathers up beautifully and feels wonderful on my problem skin. My skin now feels very nourished and moist. What a difference! This is the way soap is supposed to feel, not the commercially made stuff that dried my skin out terribly. I bought my first few bars from Amazon, but found that a natural grocery store in my city  is now selling it as well - Sunflower in ABQ, NM. Goat milk softens and smooths your skin like nothing I have ever tried before and I feel like I&#x27;ve tried them all. Regular commercially made soaps can&#x27;t come close to this. Someone mentioned the smell and I think the smell is just fine. It has a very light scent. You can get it unscented if fragrances bother you. I recently bought the marigold lotion and found that while I can tolerate the marigold fragrance, I really didn&#x27;t care for it and prefer the unscented. Either way my skin feels divine and I&#x27;m giving bars of this soap to my family for Christmas to turn them on to it as well. Buy it and try it yourself, you won&#x27;t be disappointed and it&#x27;ll make a believer out of you. They have a customer for life in me. Bless those wonderful mama goats!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for some time now - having received it as a gift.  It keeps my skin soft and is not fragranced enough to interfere with my cologne.</li>
            <li> I recently recieved this soap and have used it several times and I really like it. I have been looking for a goat&#x27;s milk soap that wasn&#x27;t high priced. This stuff is the ticket. First, the ammount of product you get for the price is amazing. The cost is similar to major brand soaps that don&#x27;t deliver what this does. Each bar is 5 oz., which may be hard to picture, but let me tell you that they are BIG bars. They are also very dense, and it does not take much to get a generous lather. The lather is unlike regular soap. When rubbed into a pouf, it produces thick, dense, creamy bubbles that feel terrific on your skin. The fragrance is also really nice and is totally gender neutral. It smells \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; and \\&quot;clean\\&quot;, not perfumy or musky. It leaves your skin feeling clean but not dried out, and soft but not greasy. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Goat&#x27;s milk soap has been our family soap for nearly 10 years.  We love it, especially the smell, leaves skin so fresh and clean.  It lasts very long for a family of four.</li>
            <li> I have been using Canus&#x27;s Goat Milk soap for more than 5 years. This soap is very soft, the perfume is not too overpowering plus it is gentle enough to be used on babies. Add to that whatever benefit you get out of goat&#x27;s milk (at least you are helping a goat farmer somewhere instead of giving your money to a giant multi-national like P&amp;G) and it becomes a very compelling deal. I also recommend [[ASIN:B001ET7KKO Canus Goat&#x27;s Milk Orchid Oil Foaming Milk Bath, 33.6-Ounces (Pack of 2)]] which creates a lot of bubbles and does not have any nasty or annoying perfume.</li>
            <li> this goat soap is excellent and I will continue to use it. I have eczema and it does not dry my skin out at all. I just love it</li>
            <li> My daughter with sensative skin recommended this. I bought it as a gift for her, but kept one to try myself. I haven&#x27;t used bar soap for several years as I hate having to clean a bathtub ring. But this is worth doing the cleaning! It leaves your skin so soft and smooth, not dry at all. The scent is light and very nice to be near.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  It really moisturizes and it&#x27;s free of all the chemicals you usually find in soaps.  It smells great and leaves your skin feeling smooth and soft when you rinse it off.  I especially love using it on my face.  I no longer use a special cleanser.  This soap is perfect.</li>
            <li> Living in an arid area, my skin was always dry.  Since discovering this soap, my skin now feels soft and more moist.  I love the light scent; it&#x27;s very clean smelling.  An added plus is I use this soap as shampoo for my very fine hair. It gives my hair more body and it stays clean longer so I don&#x27;t have to shampoo as frequently.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for; a quality product for the price, perfect for sensitive skin, lovely fragrance and long lasting large bar of goat&#x27;s milk soap; shipping was prompt; well done!</li>
            <li> My sister-in-law&#x27;s aunt suggested I try this as I typically struggle with dry skin all winter. This has definitely helped, has a minimal if any scent, and leaves me feeling clean, fresh, and not so dry. Worth a try.</li>
            <li> This soap is absolutely wonderful.  It makes one&#x27;s skin so soft, emollient, and leaves a heavenly scent on one&#x27;s skin that smells so good.</li>
            <li> After surgery my wife purchased several bars of this soap at a local grocery store. We live in a small town and the price was inflated because of the lack of demand for this soap. When the store ran out and were not going to order more I found it on Amazon, and at a much better price than we had paid for it previously.   We like it so much I have put it on a scheduled reorder account. We have no intention of going back to regular soap.</li>
            <li> I just bought this Canus goat milk soaps because ive seen many reviews of how good they are but i guess it just wasn&#x27;t the golden soap. before ive use this soap i had use Pre de provence milk soap which i thing they are way superior than this. but this canus soaps they pretty much better then the normal soaps so i guess they are alright ill be buying this soaps because i know they are way better than regular soaps and because of the goats milk if they actually have any, but anyways i like this product but not like Pre de provence.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when I got the package and realized it has some un-natural ingredients.  I didn&#x27;t think the smell was too much, not like another that I tried.  Still, my skin is extremely dry after using this one as well.  This is apparently a big issue - I dreamt I was at an outlet mall &amp; found piles of wonderful, all-natural soaps!  Hope that kinda comes true...</li>
            <li> I always have used this soap. The macho men in my life,  my husband and grown men sons use it as well and I&#x27;ve given these bars of soap away to friends. It smells good and clean, and does not dry out the skin.  It is long lasting and a great value, but best  yet, it  is enjoyable to use.  For holiday gifts, I put this bar of soap inside a hand knitted wool pouch and give them away for holiday treats.  The sack felts and shrinks as the soap gets wet and soapy.  No soap mess.  It&#x27;s a built in washcloth, and when the soap is all completely used, it leaves  a little sack or pouch, old fashioned, but nice.  Simple pleasure.</li>
            <li> Not only does it leave skin soft and smooth it smells great too! Lasts much longer that any other soap I have used in my life and that is a half a century worth. Great for both men and women.</li>
            <li> This milk soap is very nicely milled and lasts a long time.  The smell is fresh and this product isn&#x27;t so tough on my skin as most soaps are.  The price seems quite fair in comparison to some other triple-milled soaps I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap since 2007 ( 3 years as of now). It moisturizes my skin without leaving \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; feeling on it.  Especially in the winter time with sub zero temperatures outside and heat working constantly i had a huge problem with dry/itchy skin, it has completely stopped once i stared using this soap.   I would definitely recommend it to anyone to give it a try and I&#x27;m sure anyone would love it, forget all those brands You found in Your local walgreens, this is it. ~$20 for 12 pieces that last much longer than others, it&#x27;s heck of a deal.   Regards</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lifelong sufferer of atopic dermatitis. I recently switched to using Canus after using Dove since I was about 10 at the request of my dermatologist. I have to say, this product is really great. The lather is really impressive and its sulfate free. My skin is so tempermental, and it hasn&#x27;t complained once since I started using the Canus line of products. Many people have commented on the smell. The bars themselves smell quite loudly and can perfume my entire bathroom. However, the scent is fresh, unique, and once its on your skin isn&#x27;t overpowering at all. In fact, I use both Canus soap and Canus body washes and don&#x27;t find the smell overpowering. It smells slightly of bergamot but that&#x27;s the only thing I can place in it. Its a unique and pleasant smell. I&#x27;ll see how my skin holds up this winter with the switch, but overall I&#x27;m more than satisfied. You get a product that doesn&#x27;t test on animals, has quality, gentle ingredients for a more than reasonable price. Its a great product.</li>
            <li> Who figures this stuff out?  Like, you can clean up with goat&#x27;s milk?  I can just see it now:  16th Century Edinburgh; Sir Rosis of Cleaves is about to take his semi-annual bath when his maid servant grimly announces the castle is out of soap.  The good Sir Rosis has just finished his fourth pint of wee Scottish brandy, and tells his young maid:  \\&quot;Well, I gots to have sumpin&#x27; to wash me carcass with, Lassie; how&#x27;s &#x27;bout fetchin&#x27; that bucket of goat&#x27;s milk in the barrn?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the rest, as they say, is histoire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter CANUS GOAT&#x27;S MILK BAR SOAP (4 boxes each, mind you, containing 3 five-ounce bars of soap).  This is the real deal:  naturally homogenized farm fresh goat milk.  Not powdered, by golly.  This soap boasts a light, clean, mild fragrance (in other words, thank goodness it doesn&#x27;t smell like actual goat milk).  And because it&#x27;s triple-milled these soap bars are hard and long lasting (be prepared to scrub that carcass for awhile).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CANUS GOAT&#x27;S MILK BAR SOAP (4 boxes each, containing 3 five-ounce bars of soap) is one of the more innovative products manufactured by our Canadian neighbors.  Coming soon. . .farm fresh moose mints.&lt;br /&gt;--D. Mikels, Esq.</li>
            <li> We order this product regularly from Amazon.  For two people, 12 bars last over 3 months. My husband has really sensitive skin and it&#x27;s great for him. Amazon always has the best price.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a healthy soap this is a great choice. It is a strong bar, last a long time and WORKS even on a big strong man&#x27;s odor - my husband loves it. The scent is perfect for both us. Great soap and can&#x27;t beat the price on Amazon.    I still love this soap but had to edit my review a bit after checking [...] the soap doesnt get a high non toxic rating. Rate&#x27;s somewhere in the middle like regular soaps.</li>
            <li> This is the only soap we use because nothing else can compare! I&#x27;ve used it for 16 yrs and counting.  For starters this soap has beautiful ingredients and a clean fresh scent that is suitable for men, women and children. It is fine milled and lasts longer than a regular bar of soap because it doesn&#x27;t just melt away. It has a rich creamy lather that soothes as it cleans leaving your skin dewy soft. This soap is great for sensitive skin! I enjoy shower time every time because of this delicious soap.</li>
            <li> This soap is so good to my skin. I bought it and it was kind of expensive for five dollars on one bar so I went on amazon and got 12 for 20.00. Wow what a savings but this soap is good for you and your skin.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong; I like my soap to have a smell, but this soap&#x27;s fragrance is so strong, it smells like perfume!  It smells very feminine, which I don&#x27;t mind, but I know my husband and sons probably will!  It does leave your skin very soft, but many other soaps that have gender-neutral smells will, also.  I even tried to melt the soap over a double boiler to combine it with some better smelling essential oils, but it caked and didn&#x27;t melt well.</li>
            <li> My only issue with this soap is the smell.  It is very strong.  Great if you like the smell but I did not.  I thought it smelled very masculine so I was hesitant to even use it.  I think I will give away the rest of the unopened soap and try the unscented next time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this soap while traveling a couple of years ago.  I could not find it locally.  This the second time I have purchased it on line.  I love it and so does my husband.</li>
            <li> This is the best soap. No more dry itchy skin. I gave this scent 4 stars because I like the Lavender scent better, but it is great soap!</li>
            <li> This is the first \\&quot;special\\&quot; soap that I tried after looking for better moisturizing and natural alternative. This soap moisturizes not much better than the Lever 2000 I last used. I still wanted to use it though since it is more natural but what I really don&#x27;t like is the overpowering smell (compared to varieties of mainstream brands that I used before e.g. Irish Spring, Dial, etc.) and the smell is definitely feminine (coming from a guy). Like some of the reviewers here, I might try the unscented version after I get rid of the remaining 11 bars (unfortunately, my other half is not thrilled... she thinks the smell is just too much too).</li>
            <li> Smell is decent for female and males. My husband and I both have sensitive skin and never buy any type of glycerin soap so we buy fragrance free, perfume free, etc. But this one does not bother us at all it keeps our skin soft I definitely like it. Have yet to see how soft it keeps the skin I have only used for a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for over 15 years. I can&#x27;t think of using anything else!  I just love the smell!</li>
            <li> Quite possibly the best soap on the market.  I have been using this since I switched from all the French triple-milled soaps.  It is inexpensive and never drys the skin.</li>
            <li> Great Soap - I use it daily. It is very effective for people who develop rashes using the mass produced junk.</li>
            <li> I ordered this soap after reading many glowing reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve previously ordered Alpen&#x27;s Goatsmilk soap and decided to try Canus after reading the reviews. Not impressed. This soap is missing something-maybe it&#x27;s the vegetable oil base. In any case, won&#x27;t be ordering again.  I&#x27;ll be going back to Alpen.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive (aging) skin that requires TLC.  Originally purchased it five years ago for itchy dry skin during the winter.  Would not use anything else now.  My beauty treatment always starts with it and I swear my skin looks better at age 59 than it did at 49.</li>
            <li> The fragrance reminds me of my mom...any they made my skin nice an soft . I enjoy these soaps very much!</li>
            <li> A friend brought me the first Canus goat&#x27;s milk soap I used.  Liked it so much, decided to see what I could find on-line.  I really think it has made a difference with my skin and I even use it on my face.</li>
            <li> I have fallen in love with this soap.  It smells great and is perfect for any skin type.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. This is quickly becoming the only soap I am starting to use. I have gotten my friends hooked on it as well. Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> We only use this stuff.  Leaves skin clean and nourished.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel great.  We have given to others and then they too become users.We highly recommend it&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> Best soap I&#x27;ve bought hands down. Less chemicals you can&#x27;t pronounce unlike other leading brands. Highly recommended to anyone conscious about skin care.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the strength of the reviews here, but this soap dried my skin out every time I used it, and that was over the course of several months.  Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> My family has been using this soap for a couple years now. We love the smell of the soap. It is very clean and fresh. The bars last a good while and lather very nice. Leaving skin soft and smooth. I personally use the liquid body wash and it is just as nice, but the rest of my family uses the bars and we are never without it, thanks to Amazon it is here quick if ever I run short.</li>
            <li> This soap is great.  I had bad acne on my back, and after switching from irish spring to this soap, the acne went away.  My skin is less dry and seems to look a bit better.  This soap doesn&#x27;t get \\&quot;soggy\\&quot; and fall apart, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of this soap is somewhat undesirable.  I am used to it now, but when I first got it, I could barely stand it.  Its smell is hard to describe, but two of my friends seem to think it smells like dog shampoo, so we&#x27;ll go with that..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap still gets 4 stars because it has helped my skin quite a bit.  Next time I order, I will get the fragrance free version.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this soap at the Green Festival in D.C. a few years ago. Now I&#x27;m hooked on it.  It has a very clean smell that lingers for a while and it lathers great.  Sometimes I&#x27;m lucky and Whole Foods Mkt has it on sale.  It has inspired me to make my own goat milk soap. Can&#x27;t say I have been as successful as Canus.</li>
            <li> I like the brand, clean smelling scent and each bar lasts longer than any commercial brand I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;This soap does not dry out your skin and lathers very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dollar for dollar, this is priced better than the bar soap I see at stores.</li>
            <li> All of our family members have skin issues originating from inside the body. This soap is perfect for our family!!</li>
            <li> I initially bought this Canus goat milk soap from Wholefoods, and I loved it and kept buying every time we ran out of it.  That canus goat milk soap from Wholefoods is a lavender scent and smells beautiful.  I thought this one is also the lavender.  But this one smells actually too strong...I really hope they start selling the lavender one on subscribe &amp; save soon!</li>
            <li> Love the soap and the way my skin feels after use.  The aroma is a clean, fresh smell and long lasting.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap because of the reviews.  It is good , solid soap but it smells a little funny. Its good for the skin and is not drying nor is it greasy.</li>
            <li> I have been using Canus Goat&#x27;s Milk Soap for the last 14 years.  A friend told me to try this particular brand and ever since I did, I cannot use any other soap.  I have recommended Canus to friends and relatives.  Once they tried this product, they continued to purchase it as well.  Great fragrance that leaves your skin feeling silky and soft.  I highly recommend that anyone who has sensitive skin, give Canus Goat&#x27;s Milk Soap a try... You will be glad you did!</li>
            <li> Excellent product that my entire family loves!  Lathers well, smells fantastic without being too strong, and a bar lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Canus Goat&#x27;s Milk Soap is absolutely the best soap there is.  The fragrance is so fresh and clean smelling. This soap leaves the skin moisturized and clean feeling....not oily.</li>
            <li> We love this stuff!  We were paying $3.25 a bar locally, and it is important to buy locally, but at the price we paid Amazon we can afford to continue using it.  At around $20.00 including tax and shipping for 12 bars we are saving big bucks!</li>
            <li> I love this soap also.  I don&#x27;t feel drawn and shriveled when I get out of the shower.  It works good for my skin.  Keeps the itching down in the winter.  Then with the lotion of the same kind, it is great!</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for years and love the way it makes my skin feel and smell so clean!</li>
            <li> I was given this soap a few years back and I was pleased with it&#x27;s results. Amazon offers a better bulk bargain than any of the other drugstore companies. So I purchased a box.  Gentle enough for babies, comes scented and unscentewd. I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Buy this soap all the time and use nothing else on my skin but this and a prescription body lotion from my dermy.  This soap washes clean and doesn&#x27;t leave a film on your skin.  I originally found it at a local landscape company where gardeners bought it for their hands.  Once you use it for a while you will never go back to other soaps.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of this some years ago and have been using it ever since. I find the scent very appealing but not over powering and it makes a nice lather when bathing. Leaves my skin soft and nice smelling as well as clean.</li>
            <li> This soap is the answer to having beautiful skin.  It leaves your skin smooth, moisturized and smelling clean!  I love it.  I have given it as gifts and each recipient LOVES it!  It&#x27;s the best of the best!</li>
            <li> This is great value for goat&#x27;s milk soap. It lathers up very easily and the soap is nice and smooth, no gritty bits in it to scratch the skin. I would prefer a bit less scent. I wish they made one which smelled like apples or oranges, or something more natural. But overall I like it and will buy more when I finish this lot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only soap I have used for the past 6 years now. It&#x27;s like the soap I remember as a kid back in the 60s. REAL soap, not like what they sell in the stores today!. The Goat&#x27;s milk is a nice plus. Very mild and not drying at all! Try it it you have never experienced a real soap and only the store bought stuff from the giant corporations!</li>
            <li> I gave this to my husband after reading other reviews on a different site, and absolutely love this soap!  It gives a real nice SOFT LATHER and doesn&#x27;t leave this skin dry unlike other soaps we have tried.      The scent is a pleasant one, can be a little heavy, but it&#x27;s one you will enjoy.  In case you&#x27;re wondering...  It doesn&#x27;t smell like goats or goat milk!  (:o) More on the scent...I love the way it makes the bath smell after a shower- good for men, as I believe it has more of a masculine scent to it, but not too overpowering, so I can use it too.      Each bar lasts a real good amount of time, which makes our pocket books happy.  Thank goodness for the free shipping!  I have also given it as gifts in a beauty basket.</li>
            <li> I originally received this product in a gift set about five years ago and immediately fell in love with the scent. It&#x27;s a clean, fresh and a little bit powdery scent that stays with you all day long.    It lathers nicely and unlike most bar soaps that make the claim but do not deliver, Canus actually does not dry out your skin. I live in New England and ran out of this soap a few weeks ago and had to make do with a glycerin soap that was supposed to moisturize. My skin is now the dryest it&#x27;s been in a very long time.     In these difficult economic times, many of us are doing without some of the little luxuries. I&#x27;ve decided this soap is one I cannot do without.</li>
            <li> When I am tired or too lazy to use facial cleanser on my delicate, easily irritated, possibly roseaceaous, skin I will actually wash my face with this bar and though it dries it a wee bit (if I don&#x27;t moisturize) it doesn&#x27;t irritate it in any way, and by morning I wake up with clean, fresh, soft skin.  It&#x27;s supposed to be triple-milled soap, but it seems softer.  It has a kind of nice, old-time fragrance.  I sent some to my mom, too (mostly because of the cute goat on the label) and she likes it a lot, especially the bottle of bath soap)</li>
            <li> I have used other soaps that claim to make your skin softer for one reason or another, bar of soap and or body wash, but they don&#x27;t really work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goat&#x27;s milk soap is amazing, you will notice a difference from the first time you use it. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks but I could feel the difference since the first day! Depending on how bad you skind tends to dry up you may still need a moisturizer, but you will see far better results that using any other soap. Your skin however will feel softer and it also be more responsive. (IMO)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m guy, I like the way the soap smells. It isn&#x27;t flowery or overpowering or baby powder fresh, it smells clean, the scent is similar to \\&quot;fragrance free\\&quot; hand lotion with a hint of powdered milk? the smell reminds me of \\&quot;Eucerin\\&quot; body cr&amp;egrave;me/lotion, but the soap smells much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cant believe soap alone could make my skin feel this good, and with a moisturizer my skin feels great .... now after trying this soap, it will be really hard to go back to anything else!</li>
            <li> Shipped fast, this goat soap is great, will never use the liquid crap that we use to purchase. This really is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> I was tricked into buying this&lt;br /&gt;1. too many good reviews not stating the obvious&lt;br /&gt;I fell for it&lt;br /&gt;2. this was a tricky choice being so many bars of soap&lt;br /&gt;with the labeling fraudulently stating all natural base&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this feels like any common soap: dirty&lt;br /&gt;most of the reviews are just wrong and or misled&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t buy this&lt;br /&gt;DMDM Hydantoin, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Titanium Dioxide  is not natural&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t fall for the offer&lt;br /&gt;I would love to have amazon refund me back, please&lt;br /&gt;amazon should place an caution in the description: this is not all natural&lt;br /&gt;please take a look at the customers review total graph and analyze the negative reviews before you buy.&lt;br /&gt;the obvious is sometimes buried. hate it.</li>
            <li> Great soap; nice to the skin - doesn&#x27;t dry it out,</li>
            <li> Ugh, I&#x27;ve been happily using this soap for a few years until it was pointed out to me that Canus soaps contain a formaldehyde-releaser: DMDM Hydantoin. My father (a chemist who develops products) says he would never use it in a product, and that there are safer alternatives. I do not recommend Canus products and urge you to do your research.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic deal.  I used to pay much more for this soap.  It lasts a long time, has a great scent, and is a great value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a diehard Dove fan since I was a kid (thanks Mom). However, this has replaced Dove now. It doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell, which I like and leaves your skin smooth. Their lip balm is also awesome! Give this brand a try, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Very nice soap , great smell and feels very good on the skin . The aroma is wonderful and makes the room smell good also . priced right and long lasting .</li>
            <li> I have used this soap for years. Love what it does for my skin! I like the different scents. They stopped making the Marigold scent which was great!! It does leave your tub dull looking,but your skin is soft and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for over 10 years and I still love it.  I have such sensitive skin and this soap helps by skin feel smooth.  Not harsh like so many other soaps I have tried.</li>
            <li> Very happy to see this soap is available in th U S. We go to Canada mist summers and buy about 2 dozen bars to bring back to Calif. Of course we always run out. The soap has a wonderful light fragrance and keeps skin very nice. No residue in the shower as there is from some soaps.Very happy customer and the price is great too!!!</li>
            <li> I am allergic to most soaps and finally found canus about 5 years ago. I have had no skin problems using this brand of goats milk soap. It smells really good and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on my skin after I rinse off.</li>
            <li> Sometimes you do get what you pay for and I will never (hopefully have to) use another &#x27;soap&#x27;.  I LOVE the scent of clean without chemicals!</li>
            <li> this is the best soap!  smells good and makes your skin so soft.  I&#x27;ve used it now for ten years and I will never go back to regular soap.&lt;br /&gt;It will not disappoint!</li>
            <li> The Goat soap is Wonderful. Unless you have ever used it, you could never image the clean feeling if experiencing this kind if soap. It lathers just right and leaves you fresh and clean unlike other soaps. I purchased fragrance free and scented. Both are superior.</li>
            <li> This soap is very mild on skin. The slight fragrance is pleasant. Lathers well, doesn&#x27;t dry out skin.&lt;br /&gt;Our family likes it.</li>
            <li> This soap really helps with dry skin.  I love it!!  I highly recommend it.  It is vey smooth and helps tremendously.</li>
            <li> love the fragrant and stays firm all the way, until it is paper-thin, unlike those popular commercial brands soaps, this soap last longer so it justifies the cost.  and it does not dry up my skin, feels great after my shower, i would recommend to everyone, and it could make a good gift to friends.</li>
            <li> What a wonderful rich soap!  The fragrance is divine..smells so clean and does not dry your skin.  It also lasts for a very long time...much longer than other bar soaps.  You can&#x27;t go wrong and the price is right as well.</li>
            <li> I love this soap, as the scent reminds me of the Maja soaps from Spain, but this is much creamier. However, I had major problems with the shipping as the tracking code indicated the package had been delivered, which was untrue. The vendor was not much help, insisting that it had been delivered, and instructed me to track it down, which took a lot of calling and waiting on the USPS line. Eventually the package was delivered a complete week after it was supposedly delivered to me!</li>
            <li> This is absolutely my FAVORITE soap of life. Ever. I am on my last bar and I ordered this pack about 1 year ago. They clearly last a very long time (I bathe everyday, sometimes even 2x a day, so they last long on a daily use). :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soaps are so creamy and moisturizing and they smell fantastic. Ordering more right now!</li>
            <li> There is something about the texture of this soap that is so incredibly luxurious. Your skin will feel wonderful afterwards. I would highly recommend this soap.  The only reason that I give it 4 stars is because of price.</li>
            <li> 1.  Moisturizes - We all get dry skin in the winter but my husband, being a man, refuses to use lotion on his itchy dry skin.  Well this winter was brutal with the heat on constantly, and my husband didn&#x27;t have dry skin using this soap.  Impressive.    2.  Smell - Since there&#x27;s been so much conversation about the scent: This is not a lightly-scented soap; it has a distinct smell.  I really love the smell for my husband but it&#x27;s not so manly or strong that I can&#x27;t use it.    3.  Cleans - Yep, this is a soap, not a wimpy body wash.  Gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Family uses this soap. Great for skin.</li>
            <li> The best natural soap on the market. Great smooth and lathering soap! So great! My mom came to visit and discovered this product, I had to order her a bunch and sent it to her house.</li>
            <li> My Mom loved it! and had me try it. Leaves your skin very clean and clear some brown spots after a few days of use.</li>
            <li> I love this soap!!  It lasts, really moisturizes your skin and has a wonderful scent.  I made my own Goat&#x27;s milk soap for years which was time consuming.  Now having been recommended this one by a friend I won&#x27;t have to make anymore!  I highly recommend this one for those that want a great, lasting, moisturizing soap!</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this soap for a long time and she loves it. I&#x27;ve used it also but not crazy about the smell.</li>
            <li> At just over $20 for four bars, you can&#x27;t miss!  Amazon&#x27;s price is better than any I&#x27;ve found on the internet.  This soap won&#x27;t leave you dried out, and the lather and scent are a plus!  While I prefer the Orchid Oil scent, I couldn&#x27;t turn down this bargain price on the original, which still smells really nice.  My husband and I are hooked on Canus goat&#x27;s milk soap, and we try hard not to run out of it.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I gave these out as Christmas gifts and have had good feedback.  the bulk price was quite good. So glad I discovered goat milk soap, It helped my dry skin so much!</li>
            <li> The softness of the soap and the smell is astounding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves your skin feeling soft and smelling like perfume. You don&#x27;t need to put on cologne/ body spray if you use this soap.. however the smell can easily be showered out if you spend a few extra minutes in the shower if you don&#x27;t intend to smell strongly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is clean and sort of lavender like.</li>
            <li> This stuff is nice and leaves me and my daughter with a fresh clean scent that never cloys.  I am not sure of the essential oils in this soap, but I seem to smell a light fragrance of cloves and patchouli.  Maybe I am wrong, but I swear it smells yummy.  The soap also lathers very nicely.  Great soap from a great company. Since I have been using it, my skin just glows.</li>
            <li> My husband has very sensitive skin. He can actually use this instead of the much costlier Aveeno. I was introduced to the soap by someone who bought it at a health food store. The price is considerably better here. I&#x27;ve used it a few times myself and have been complimented on the clean fresh scent and asked what I was wearing.</li>
            <li> This soap makes my skin so soft and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with razor burn with it. HOWEVER. It stinks to high heaven like old lady or bad cologne. It is so overpowering! I recommend the unscented variety.</li>
            <li> Good lather; good smell; good product. Keep up the good work! No more words that I can conceive or whatever!</li>
            <li> it smell soft and sweet,i use it bath,the experience is very well,the price is also very nice at that time</li>
            <li> I purchased Canus Goats Milk Soap several years ago in Lancaster, PA and have been hooked ever since.  It doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out like the average soap you buy in the store and it lathers up like no other soap I have ever tried.  It may be a little more costly than what you buy in the store but you won&#x27;t be sorry you bought it and will probably never use anything else again.  I just wish I could find it locally.  They used to sell it at the Weis grocery store but no longer do so I have to order it online.  Try it, you&#x27;ll love it!!!</li>
            <li> I used this soap ten years ago and have only been able to find it at specialty stores and then the price is way to high to purchase.  The value was great and I have my favorite soap ago.  Thank you thank you.</li>
            <li> I love this soap, and this is a good price for a whole lot of it.</li>
            <li> Every time I bathe or shower, I inhale the fragrance of this soap before I immerse myself in its lather.  I even offer the bar to my Border Collie so that he, too, can have a sniff, though he&#x27;s not as impressed as I.  He&#x27;d rather herd the goats.  The soap is mild and gentle; it is quite possibly my favorite soap that I&#x27;ve ever tried.  I plan on giving it as gifts to my friends, so that they, too, can enjoy it.  I recommend this soap without reservation.</li>
            <li> Fragrance reminds me of a grandmother&#x27;s perfume. Love the goat&#x27;s milk but dislike the fragrance. Try the lavender or fragrance-free version instead.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance of this soap and the great lather it makes.&lt;br /&gt; It is also very gentle to skin.&lt;br /&gt; Yes, I highly recommend this soap to everyone!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many many years and I would not consider using any other.  It is Perfect for my skin which tends to be dry.  I have now got my friend and her husband hooked on this product.</li>
            <li> Pros:  -Light scent...reminiscent of Old Spice  -Perfect lather  -Leaves skin soft, but without residue  -All natural ingredients    Con:  -Leaves a ring of stubborn soap scum in the tub; I found myself having to scrub out the bathtub nearly every day!    I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that this soap would better serve as a hand soap, mainly because I don&#x27;t have the wherewithal to scrub my bathtub every day.</li>
            <li> If you have not experienced this soap yet in your life and you appreciate quality soap and fantastic clean, fresh and slightly spicy scents, then order some now. I bought the 20 bar deal - which is a great deal at a little over a buck a bar. I have sensitive skin and dove is about the only other soap I can use. Canus Goat Soap lathers like a summa ma gun too.The smell of the soap is quite awesome and hard to describe - slightly herbal, very clean, classic, unique - never heard a bad comment on it. It stays close to your skin throughout the day. I can smell it a little if I get heated up throughout the day. I&#x27;m big into nice smells and keeping my skin non-dry, so I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love this soap.  Been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t try out my skin nearly as much as regular soap does, lathers wonderfully and lasts a while in our household. Won&#x27;t go back to regular soap!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this bar soap and the lotion for about 5 years now and love it. I love the original fragrance although I can&#x27;t really describe it (thankfully not flowery). It helps keep my dry skin as soft as a soap can. The bars are long lasting as well. I only have brand loyalty for a few things and this is one of them.</li>
            <li> No better soap.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Clean Smelling, this soap has replaced my previous preference of many years, Lever2000. Both leave you with a clean scent. Bars of Lever2000 soap seems to disappear get used up faster than prior years.</li>
            <li> I  absolutely love this soap and have been using it for over a decade.  I have allergies and this soap is gentle, smells wonderfully clean and does not irritate or dry out the skin.  And, the bars last a very long time.</li>
            <li> good value - The soap moisturizes and clears my skin. I recommend this product without reservation. I tried but could not find an equivalent in stores in my area.</li>
            <li> Smells so good an herbal and clean scent that  both men and women can appreciate.  I bought a case of this soap and passed it around to friends!</li>
            <li> 5* TkU - excellent product, most bang for your buck. I have tried the rest - I think this is the best.</li>
            <li> Great scent and leaves you feeling really clean.  Some of the best soap I have used.  Will almost certainly reorder.</li>
            <li> Just received another wrong order of soap can&#x27;t they read the correct order</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  A little spicy.  Found it at Whole Foods and then it wasn&#x27;t there.  So, guess what?  Amazon&#x27;s got it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years. It does not dry out my skin. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this soap!</li>
            <li> Smells unbelievably good. Leaves my skin feeling smooth. Expensive for a bar of soap.</li>
            <li> I love this soap, so smooth, gentle and nice smell too, it&#x27;s worth it for the price.</li>
            <li> After discovering Canus&#x27; goat milk soap a couple of years ago, our entire family has never looked back. The smell is pleasant, the lather is rich and it leaves your skin feeling smooth. What more can you ask for in a soap? Give it a shot and you&#x27;ll see for yourself.</li>
            <li> This soap is GREAT it smells sooooooooooooooooo good and for my morning shower i LOVE IT - and the scent is light and very pleasant and its nice on the skin -- makes for a very relaxing shower...</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PRODUCT. I HAVE BEEN USING IT NOW FOR ABOUT 3 YEARS. I LIVE IN COLD WEATHER, WHICH DRIES MY SKIN OUT, AND THIS HELPS WITH THAT. I TRAVEL ALOT, SO I TAKE IT WITH ME EVERYWHERE.</li>
            <li> smells wonderfully clean and is gentle on the skin., best price is on amazon!!!!!  give it a try you&#x27;ll love it if you have problem skin</li>
            <li> As many reviewers have stated before, I don&#x27;t think there is a better goat milk soap product.  I haven&#x27;t used them all but many.</li>
            <li> I started using this soap several years ago when my friend spotted it in a little out-of-the-way store in Colorado.  It smelled so good - light and fresh, no perfume scent.  I started giving a few bars as hostess gifts.  I also gave some to my mother.  We all love it.  Buying by the case is so much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have used this bar soap for quiet awhile.  I enjoy the light smell as well as making my skin feel hydrated.</li>
            <li> This brand makes good products. Love Ganus lotion too.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this soap.</li>
            <li> My husband and I love this soap: non-drying, clean feel, and lovely scent.  We have enjoyed it for many years.</li>
            <li> I have always ordered the product shown in this questionair......Again, Please to advise what can be done about this.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love this soap, I couldn&#x27;t find it at any stores so I went to Amazon.  The soap has a clean smell and last forever. The price was great and if you haven&#x27;t tried it I suggest you do.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Goat milk soap is really gentle on the skin, and this particular soup has met all my expectations.</li>
            <li> Noticeable difference...softer and smoother skin, especially during the cold weather season.  Soap doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;blob&amp;#34; up either, just maintains its form.</li>
            <li> I love using this soap and will continue to do so. I have also used the scented one with olive oil</li>
            <li> Do your research. Canus products contain formaldehyde aka DMDM Hydantoin as printed on their ingredient list. Stick with the small Mom and Pop soap makers. Canus has sold out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now on subscription for this product and LOVE IT!  We can&#x27;t find it in our area and the price is very reasonable.  The fragrance is fresh and not too feminine that the husband won&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I love this! Bought this once years ago and was thrilled when Amazon started carrying.  I buy in bulk now.  Doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, rinses off easily so no scum left in your body.  Different fragrance options available, I prefer not so string smells.  You should care what you put on your skin !</li>
            <li> Have used this for years and still love it. It is like filling the bathtub with silk and the smell is not overpowering at all. I have lots of allergies and this has never bothered me. Will continue to buy it on Amazon because the price is good too.</li>
            <li> this is a quality soap that is quite creamy lathers well and works in hard and soft water environments, nice fragrance</li>
            <li> This so is a great product to use anytime but especially in the winter when your skin tends to get quite dry and itchy. It helps to relive the ichy and dryness and also smells good. I recommend this soap to everyone.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product! This \\&quot;Goat Milk\\&quot; soap leaves your skin feeling clean, fresh &amp; hydrated. I absolutely \\&quot;LOVE\\&quot; the fact that this soap is natural and have this fresh herbal scent. I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product! (Oh! by the way, the soap lather is marvelous). Plus, delivery was faster than I anticipated. I WILL be buying more in the future. Also, the matching lotion is nice and feels great, not tacky. I absolutely \\&quot;LOVE\\&quot;  natural &amp; organic products!!!</li>
            <li> Great price, fast service.</li>
            <li> It keeps me nice and moisturized. It is sustainable and made from goats milk. I would test it out with only one bar if it is your first use. You just never know what of if you will have a reaction to anything. I don&#x27;t so I love it</li>
            <li> I like this soap very much and have recommended to my friends. It&#x27;s moist and comfortable after using.</li>
            <li> This soap used to last a long time. I&#x27;ve noticed it seems softer and lasts no time, Does not give a moisturized feeling as before and the price has risen of course and the bars seem smaller. I now rate it a 3 and declining. Only buy it because my wife still likes it somewhat.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent, hard-working, long-lasting soap. I dislike scents, and this soap has a very subtle scent that is pretty unnoticeable. It doesn&#x27;t suds excessively, which may bother some, but I like this too. This price is also the best around by far. The ingredients are pretty innocuous too.</li>
            <li> Have used the soap in the past but moved to Texas and couldn&#x27;t find; very glad when i located it again on Amazon.  Great smell, lathers up nicely and wonderful on my skin.  Also lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Canus Goat Milk soap for years. It does not have all the harsh chemicals that most soaps have. My skin is not dry and itchy after a shower. It&#x27;s better than others that claim to be for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased these based upon a previous recommendation from a friend and online was the only place I could find them. The product feels great leaving the skin feeling soft and refreshed. Will definitely buy again as anyone else should. Great product BUY BUY BUY</li>
            <li> I started using this as a face cleanser as I was allergic to most make up remover products..I love it. This is the only soap bar I allow at my house.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this soap for years and love it.  It doesn&#x27;t contain any petroleum products.&lt;br /&gt;Rumor has it that the manufacturer has sold out to a Canadian company and that the ingredients will change.  What a shame.</li>
            <li> Use it on my face and it work great.  Have a very oily face that is dry after I wash it and would flake really bad.  Now when I use this soap I don&#x27;t have flaky skin anymore.  Also the soap last for every.  My daughter gave me my first bar about 9 months ago and I still am using it.  These bars will keep me going a long time.  I will have to share this with my daughter, her family uses this quickly.  They leave it in the tub area and it gets wet.</li>
            <li> It smells good!  Not too overpowering and very clean smell.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know that I feel any softer, but I have never felt so clean!&lt;br /&gt;The lather is simply amazing and feels fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;A excellent quality soap!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shower soap. I love the smell and smoothness of this soap, and have bought it repeatedly over the years. If there was one thing I would change, it would be to have a &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; variety, being very careful of each and every ingredient that goes into the soap making process. Otherwise, no complaints. Foams well, lasts well, smells WONDERFUL and leaves me feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Love this soap! Have been using it for years and was thrilled when I found this deal - so much cheaper than buying one at a time at the store. Have tried a lot of different goat milk soaps, and this is the best one. Nice lather, gentle and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> The fact that this soap gets such glowing reviews, to my mind, says much about how little people expect from modern soap. Most soaps (Dove, Irish Spring, etc) are not much more than detergent crystals pressed into a bar, with varying levels of glycerin and fragrances to tell them apart. Canus Goat&#x27;s Milk Soap promises something other, the goodness of a real bar soap. Real soap is made from fat and lye- goat&#x27;s milk would be a great source of fat so I assumed it would be a real soap. It is far from that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a solid scrub my body felt like I had a sunburn. This isn&#x27;t exfoliating, it&#x27;s abrasive. My skin felt so terrible I used my favorite craft soap (Savor, found on etsy) to re-moisturize my skin. This soap would be great for cleaning cast-iron pans, but for human use I would say stay away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Real soap has an obvious trait- it dissolves completely in water. When I tried the Canus soap, the water in my shower started backing up immediately. I checked the hair trap, and it was filled with what looks like a crystalline powder. Given how abrasive this soap is on my skin, this residue is indistinguishable from a finely powdered salt. I had to again use my craft soap to rinse off the hair trap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in short, I had to use my soap to clean up whatever this product is. I do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this product,have been buying it for 2yrs or so. The smell and moisturizing properties are so good.Had a house guest to try it and they fall in love with it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s our family&#x27;s favorite shower soap.  Great natural scent!!</li>
            <li> My skin breaks out when I use any other soap.  I recommend this for anyone with sensitive skin or roseacea.</li>
            <li> I love the creamy lather and the scent of this soap.  It also is non drying to my skin which is necessary in cold, winter months.</li>
            <li> It is the only soap I have found that doesn&#x27;t dry my skin. I have tried so many different ones and had just about given up. It is the best,</li>
            <li> The best soap.  It keeps my hands very soft even in the winter. I love the fragrance and the purity of the soap.</li>
            <li> This is the best bath soap my wife and I have ever used.  We love the fragrance and the way our skin feels after using it.  I definitely would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> -5 stars for the wonderful clean smell!  Not perfumey, it just smells clean and fresh (think linens hung on the line).&lt;br /&gt;-5 stars for how long one bar of this soap lasts!  It is not all puffed up with air. One bar of soap lasts as long as 6 bars of the brand&lt;br /&gt;name soaps at the drug and grocery stores.&lt;br /&gt;-5 stars for leaving your skin feeling smooth and silky.  I have super dry skin and live in a cold climate and this is the best soap I&#x27;ve ever come across.</li>
            <li> I just love this soap it is like having a skin softener in the bath and it keeps your skin that way</li>
            <li> First, this item is not returnable. It contains perfume. I am allergic to perfume and must throw it away. What poor business practices.</li>
            <li> The creamiest, cleanest smelling soap ever.  Leaves your skin feeling clean, soft and hydrated.  Used by both me and my husband, love it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for 10 years now. It smells fresh and it leaves my skin soft.its great</li>
            <li> Best hand and body soap ever.  Love the fragrance.</li>
            <li> In our house, this has to be the &#x27;Rolls Royce&#x27; of soaps! Whilst some soaps come and go, Canus Goats Milk Soap is the MUST HAVE! Loved not only because it is so gentle on the skin, we also love it because of its very delicate fragrance and the fact that each bar is easy to hold.</li>
            <li> Product is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sent package with incorrect quantity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Difficult to communicate with vendor to correct quantity ......frustrating to follow up with emails.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very refreshing, very good for women who are conscious of taking care of themselves.  Regular soap is just not good enough people; this is what you need!</li>
            <li> I gave this to my Mother, and she really likes it. It has a good fragrance and is gentle with your skin</li>
            <li> Love love love this soap! Have been using for years! Having sensitive skin is so enjoyable with this soap. The only soap I&#x27;ve been able to use that does not throw my feminine ph off or irritate my skin. Most soaps that are free from perfumes and irritants for sensitive skin, overly dry my skin to where I get dry patches, this soap does not! I always get compliments on the scent! Amazon is amazing because this soap has become more harder to find else where over the last year...price is unbeatable....PLEASE CONTINUE TO SELL!!! Only thing I&#x27;ve noticed while using this is that I get a little back acne around shoulder blade area but I can deal with that.</li>
            <li> Love love love this soap! You get such a clean fresh feeling after showering with this soap. Will never use any other kind of soap!</li>
            <li> Love the soap.  However, I only received half of my order and was billed for the entire amount.  Luckily I caught it or I would have been out the money.  I was given a full refund on the product that was not received, but now I have to place a second order to get what I should have gotten the first time around.</li>
            <li> This product has very bad and dangerous ingredients in it. Sent it back, don&#x27;t want anybody I care about using it.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap in May of 2012. It cost me $25.30 and that included shipping for the exact same soap you are now selling for $62.97 plus shipping. What is the deal on that? The soap is good but not worth that price. I will be going elsewhere to buy the soap.</li>
            <li> Best soap I&#x27;ve ever tried. My skin is very dry and not using soap without lotion or any, so I&#x27;m not a fan of any soap, but this one is what I&#x27;m going to use, probably very very long time. No irritation or any sort of negative feeling. Simply right and soft and perfect after rinse.</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing, I have dry skin and my skin has improved immensely since starting using, canus goat milk soap, I am even using less oils, lotions etc. This is one product that I will continue using for a long, long time.</li>
            <li> I like the soap, but dislike this scent. What I wanted was the unscented, which ironically actually has a very pleasant scent. This makes me smell like an old lady who has goats, lol. It&#x27;s a high moisture soap of course and I don&#x27;t get dry skin with it. I would call it my second favorite soap, but my first is, 5-10 times more expensive (Lush) so Canus is the better bang for the buck. Go unscented though, or lavender, better choices for sure. Unscented if you&#x27;re a guy like me. I&#x27;ve actually tried many soaps too, almost as sort of a hobby trying to find the perfect soap, so you can believe it. Pine tar soap, Grandmas lye, Dead Sea salt soap, etc, etc, this one&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> This soap is great,  always excellent</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for several years.  I love the smell and it lasts a lot longer than other kinds of soaps.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this for a while now.  Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> We love this soap. The fragrance is suitable for a man or woman. I have sensitive skin and it does not irritate me. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle and has no smell. Love to use it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only soap we both love. Moisturizes, low scent. When my grocery store quit selling it, I was happy to find we could order it on line! We even take it with us on vacation.</li>
            <li> Will only use this soap the rest of my life!  Excellent and mild fragrance!</li>
            <li> It has a mild and pleasant sandal wood fragrance. Other reviewers have stated that the fragrance stays with you throughout the day, but I haven&#x27;t found that to be the case. Maybe they&#x27;ve changed the formula. It rinses off cleanly and is slightly moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Discovered this on a trip to visit family in Canada, started using it and have family memebers send me supplies, so very glad to be able to purchase on Amazon and now have friends using it as well.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for over 10 years now, my wife loves it.</li>
            <li> I GIVEN A BAR OF THIS SOAP AS A GIFT. I LOVED IT. HAD TO ORDER SOME.  WOULD RECOMEND IT TO OTHERS.</li>
            <li> This is the best soap I have ever used!  It has a clean light smell and I don&#x27;t get that dried out feeling, price is great too!</li>
            <li> Always a terrific soap  ..  not always easy to find so stock up when you can</li>
            <li> I bought this soap because I always wanted to try a goat&#x27;s milk soap. After searching the health and beauty section of amazon.com, I found this soap. I read several of the positive reviews and decided to try itr for myself. It arrived today and I immediately used it to bath this evening. The scent is wonderful. The bars are quite large and it smells terrific. Also, It lathers very well and leaves you feeling very clean. This is now one of my new favorite soaps and I will continue to buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> This soap has pleased my very picky wife, so happy wife, happy life.  Very pleased</li>
            <li> I found this soap in the grpcery store. I live in maine where the winter months can be brutal on my skin..I have used the soap all wintersnd my skin is not dry.I would not use any other soap! I love it!</li>
            <li> It is great it makes you very dry hands not dry and cracked</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS SOAP... HAVE BEEN USING THIS FOR YEARS. GREAT FOR MY SON WHO HAS DERMATITIS.</li>
            <li> I love this soap!  It is simple and pure.  The bars last a long time.</li>
            <li> I gave some of this as a Christmas gift.  That&#x27;s how much I like it.</li>
            <li> Was given a bar of this soap by a friend about four years ago and have used it exclusively at home since. It has moisturizer in it and prevents dry skin, especially in the winter. It&#x27;s simply wonderful and I would highly recommend it to anyone. My wife has extemely sensitive skin and she takes a bar with her on trips.</li>
            <li> For two years now we have been using Canus.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the only soap in our home. The best.&lt;br /&gt;From a country boy, horseman... to You.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s this good.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy&lt;br /&gt;JR</li>
            <li> Lathers well and does not seem to dry the skin.  long lasting bar - would buy again  Now it is a bit later and have changed the review.  Probably would buy again, just not so many.  Had half my order turn moldy in the sealed packages.  Not very appealing</li>
            <li> This product, without a doubt, meets and exceeds all expectations. I have sensitive skin and this soap is gentle while moisturizing.  It lathers well and one bar lasts for several weeks. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Product has lovely fresh fragrance. Soap is gentle and non irritating to the skin. Lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Shared it with friends.</li>
