            <li>Love it.....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
            <li>I do wish I worked better to lighten marks on my skin.</li>
            <li>but I am sure with PATIENCE and continuous use I would see results.</li>
            <li>Most of all I did not notice any breakouts or reactions from it.</li>
            <li>also a pretty nice sized bar!</li>
            <li>Great soap cleans  the skin very well.</li>
            <li>....make sure you use a good moisturizer with SPF 15 or higher.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of the soap, it makes my skin look amazing, definitely worth it&lt;</li>
            <li>so I tend to break out easily</li>
            <li>but I was fine when I used this soap.</li>
            <li>excited!i hope the results are accurate.</li>
            <li>This product is really effective of exfoliating the outer layers of the skin, brightening the skin tone and giving the skin a healthy natural glow.</li>
            <li>However, I have noticed that if I use it on my face as a daily cleanser, I experienced scaly skin, as this is an Alpha Hydroxy Acid  soap, and AHA are used for exfoliating, so</li>
            <li>sure its the real deal, there are some imposters out there, make sure the box has the illuminating seal and the soap is enclosed in a cellophane wrapper.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this just for the face</li>
            <li>It smells so nice and makes my skin super supple and soft.</li>
            <li>African American btw, and i have a medium brown skin tone,so if it can make my face bright and lovely, it should make the rest of my body</li>
            <li>I gave 3 stars because it is a bit too early to evaluate this soap accurately,but while using soap,it continues to be a lovely experience.</li>
            <li>But it is worth both.</li>
            <li>So you&#x27;re getting you&#x27;re money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>I received the soap in a timely manner and began to use it right away.</li>
            <li>Exfoliates very well and leaves your skin feeling clean.</li>
            <li>The bar is huge to so lasts for some time, overall, i am satisfied thus far.</li>
            <li>Saw changes in 2-3 days ;)</li>
            <li>GOT THE REGULAR FAIR &amp; WHITE...</li>
            <li>The first time i bought this soap,it worked very faster,when it is done</li>
            <li>so i could lighten up some minor pimple scars, and im glad I did.</li>
            <li>Overall I give this product a 5 because I really like how smooth my skin is</li>
            <li>and it is really working.</li>
            <li>Lathery (lathers up really well</li>
            <li>This product works very well.</li>
            <li>The exfoliators come  in the soap and it is gentle and not abrasive to the skin.</li>
            <li>This soap really works.</li>
            <li>I was not expecting to see the changes I did see as fast as I did.</li>
            <li>so have patience because you may not see results as fast as others</li>
            <li>the works very well for my face</li>
            <li>but it has really worked for my face.</li>
            <li>I sitll have a little more to go</li>

            <li>I have been looking for products for years to clear my complexion.</li>

            <li> A bit early,but loving this soap!My experience so far,is great.I gave 3 stars because it is a bit too early to evaluate this soap accurately,but while using soap,it continues to be a lovely experience.I love the smell and the way it feels on my skin.I am excited!i hope the results are accurate.I will update later on about my overall thought and opinion after giving it some time to show results.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for a while now and it is really working. I sitll have a little more to go but it is really working where other soaps failed. It is a gradual process but you will see resulting within weeks.</li>
            <li> NOT WHAT I ORDER. GOT THE REGULAR FAIR &amp; WHITE...NOT THE ONE WITH  AHA-2 EXFOLIATING. DON&#x27;T THINK I&#x27;LL ORDER THIS AGAIN...</li>
            <li> Best soap for exfoliating skin. I use this soap on my body and once a month on my face and it works extremely well. However, I have noticed that if I use it on my face as a daily cleanser, I experienced scaly skin, as this is an Alpha Hydroxy Acid  soap, and AHA are used for exfoliating, so skin starts to look scaly before peeling and exposing the clearer and brighter complexion. So use weekly or monthly depending on your reaction to this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell &#x3D; Great (Fragranced my entire bathroom)&lt;br /&gt;Usage &#x3D; Long lasting (usage for 30 days, and bar is still large)&lt;br /&gt;Lather &#x3D; Lathery (lathers up really well, little goes a long way on face and body)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure its the real deal, there are some imposters out there, make sure the box has the illuminating seal and the soap is enclosed in a cellophane wrapper.</li>
            <li> Love it..... Saw changes in 2-3 days ;)</li>
            <li> This product is really effective of exfoliating the outer layers of the skin, brightening the skin tone and giving the skin a healthy natural glow. Also I noticed it made my skin feel smoother. I noticed the fading of discolorations and imperfections and overall felt like I had a new, healthy coat of skin after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> His grandfather and his grandfather conduction velocity they are great&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very amazing to me with all your dealings with the speed and ease</li>
            <li> This product works very well. The exfoliators come  in the soap and it is gentle and not abrasive to the skin.</li>
            <li> The first time i bought this soap,it worked very faster,when it is done i ordered it is not  the same color is different and smell really different,i would like that CBS express verify  the quality of products,</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the soap, it makes my skin look amazing, definitely worth it&lt;br /&gt;It does lighten the skin a little bit</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing! It smells so nice and makes my skin super supple and soft. I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as I expect.</li>
            <li> This soap really works. It&#x27;s clearing up my spots/discoloration.....I love it! Heads up tho....make sure you use a good moisturizer with SPF 15 or higher.</li>
            <li> This product definitely exfoliates and brightens the skin. I will recommend it for anyone looking for some radiance in their skin.</li>
            <li> Exfoliates very well and leaves your skin feeling clean. The bar is huge to so lasts for some time, overall, i am satisfied thus far.</li>
            <li> Works very well as an exfoliator and smells wonderful. I do wish I worked better to lighten marks on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for products for years to clear my complexion. I  have marks from acne, or just scars and my face is darker than the rest of my body. So I read about this soap and decided to try it. I received the soap in a timely manner and began to use it right away. When I used it I noticed a smooth clean feeling unlike some products where you still feel as if some of the residue was left behind. I use the soap at least twice a day. My face has been getting lighter and I noticed results within a week. It is not where I want it to be but I am sure with PATIENCE and continuous use I would see results. I was not expecting to see the changes I did see as fast as I did. Overall I give this product a 5 because I really like how smooth my skin is and it has a healthy bright glow to it. Most of all I did not notice any breakouts or reactions from it. I have sensitive skin so I tend to break out easily but I was fine when I used this soap. I do wish my local beauty supply store sold this because the extra shipping costs and the wait does make you hesitate a bit. But it is worth both. All I can say is everyone&#x27;s skin is different so have patience because you may not see results as fast as others but then you may see results faster. So just be patient.</li>
            <li> This soap works wonders for you&#x27;re face! I originally bought this just for the face so i could lighten up some minor pimple scars, and im glad I did. This soap made my face so light, bright and beautiful. My skin is glowing! My scars are lightening up nicley.my face is  a little bit lighter then the rest of my body so I&#x27;m starting to use it all over now. Im  African American btw, and i have a medium brown skin tone,so if it can make my face bright and lovely, it should make the rest of my body glow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its also a pretty nice sized bar! I&#x27;ve only had it for about 2 or 3 weeks and still have maybe another 2 , even 3 weeks before I have to order another.  So you&#x27;re getting you&#x27;re money&#x27;s worth. As apposed to other ligtening soaps that run out within 2weeks -__- .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sooooo, YES. Try this(:</li>
            <li> This soap is very good.</li>
            <li> Great soap cleans  the skin very well.</li>
            <li> the works very well for my face and I have given it four stars because it does not work for the other parts of my body.&lt;br /&gt;I hope it clears the dark spots on my body too...but it has really worked for my face.</li>
