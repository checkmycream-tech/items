            <li>This is a great oil - feels wonderful as it is spread on skin, and dries as if you had never put oil on your skin yet your skin definitely feels softer.</li>
            <li>and it works in nice without you having to wash your hands after use.  </li>
            <li>Arrived in good condition and very quickly after it was ordered.</li>

            <li>Love it, feels so nice on the skin.</li>
            <li>For us this oil is more effective than coconut, avocado, baby oil, ceteaphil, or aveeno.  </li>
            <li>Great body oil to use right after you turn the shower off.</li>
            <li>i LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I really love the smell.</li>
            <li>So much better than trying to purchase at a spa.</li>
            <li>I decided to try Life-Flo&#x27;s apricot oil after using their avocado oil, which I love.</li>
            <li>Love -</li>
            <li>It is a lighter oil but it feels nice and smooth going on and does not have a strong smell.  </li>
            <li>Excellent oil for excema, rashes and dry skin.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>It does make your tub slippery if you add it to your bath water, I always clean the tub after his bath to be on the safe side.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve never had a cleanser i&#x27;ve particularly loved, and i&#x27;ve never been good about washing my face other than in the shower.</li>
            <li>What can I say, this product is just fine.  </li>
            <li>therefore it was too light for me on my driest areas but</li>
            <li>This oil is light and smooth.</li>
            <li>I gave it a four because of the light smell...</li>
            <li>It came in very good condition, however if it had opened, my other items would have been protected well.</li>
            <li>I put a cap full in his bath and apply it all over after his bath while he is still damp.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product and it works, but I&#x27;ll be returning to the avocado oil next time.</li>
            <li>Cheaper than in a store, very well packed, arrived on time, doesn&#x60;t make stain and very good for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Compared to other ones on the market, it&#x27;s a great price as well.</li>
            <li>Does not feel super oily.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, and I do apply it throughout the day when I change his diaper.</li>
            <li>I tried some of this in a health food store and loved the way it moisturized my dry hands.</li>
            <li>I bought fractionated coconut oil previously and it looked really good.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have purchased apricot oil.</li>
            <li>So i was interested in using it in this oil form.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>and I feel like we finally found a product that I know is safe to use</li>
            <li>but if you google it you&#x27;ll find multiple benefits. :)</li>
            <li>I bought several oils from them and was never disappointed, so def recommend!</li>
            <li>in general it is a nice sheer oil.</li>
            <li>Now I use the pure apricot oil,day and night.  </li>
            <li>i use it on my face and body all over, a few drops applied to the clarisonic, and my skin feels and looks amazing.</li>
            <li>Smells great too and only have to use a few drops.</li>
            <li>I have skin problems and need to moisturize often with very emollient moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>Does not have much of a smell either.</li>
            <li>I really like.</li>
            <li>Was packed very well too.</li>
            <li>Make-up melts off and my skin is soft, pores reduced, eyelashes are long and healthy again.</li>
            <li>We both are extra smooth and soft after using this!</li>
            <li>As a massage therapist apricot oil is my choice, particularly for Face I mix with lavender oil.</li>
            <li>It looks and feel like high quality oil.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s high quality.</li>
            <li>and I follow it put by shampooing his hair like normal.</li>
            <li>because it&#x27;s not messy, smelly, or splashy all over the bathroom, i actually use it pretty much every day, too.</li>
            <li>and I have soft - soft skin!</li>
            <li>And this and other oils hold my babys curls better and her hair looks hydrated throughout the day and none frizzy where as other products i used held her curls and her hair looked hydrated til it dried than it would get frizzy and need more moisture.</li>
            <li>The oil is light weight and my hair absorbs it well, but it does have a little smell to it.</li>
            <li>too light, not too heavy oil for inclusion in handmade skin lotions.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s had eczema since he was 3 months old</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s all natural, no chemicals, and it&#x27;s within budget.</li>
            <li>I use this on my baby every day and his skin is silky soft.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d end up smudging oil on things frequently, not a problem I had with avocado oil after the first 10-15 mins or so.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because it does keep my skin very soft and healthy despite my dislikes with it in other areas (my skin is dry and itchy which the oil helps immensely).</li>
            <li>Apricot oil is one of my favorites to use in them because it isn&#x27;t super thick and greasy and leaves just the right amount of moisture after you dry yourself off after using it in a scrub.  </li>
            <li>His skin is soft and his eczema spots are softer, not as rough, but I still have to apply a layer of Vaseline to his rough patches to keep him from scratching and to keep his spots super moisturized.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a scent to it really, which is a plus since I have to be careful with perfumes with him.</li>
            <li>You will see other brands or offers that are priced lower but the quality of this product is high</li>

            <li> The smell is extremely faint and light so not to worry about any perfume smells.  </li>
            <li> I have severely dry skin</li>
            <li> Received shipment in less than 2 weeks (Dec. in middle of xmas postage rush).  </li>
            <li> I have tried various oils, not many but several.</li>
            <li> It is what I expected.</li>
            <li> I have not much to compare to.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> my skin is finally starting to show its age and my lazy lack of care for the past 47 years.</li>
            <li> This oil used in conjunction with Vaseline and his prescription meds helps keeps his eczema in check, and I have discovered that we are using his prescription med less since we swapped over to this oil.</li>
            <li> It felt so much less oily and lighter.</li>
            <li> A few drops</li>
            <li> a few days ago I figured out that I have to pat all the excess oil off my body after letting my skin absorb it for a bit.</li>
            <li> It has very little smell so it will serve well as carrier oil</li>
            <li> We usually go through a 12 oz bottle every six months</li>
            <li> While I have done much with this oil, yet; I was disappointed to find that it has no smell.  </li>
            <li> I had to return this product twice because the safety seal was broken both times.</li>
            <li> I use it alone as a body moisturizer and as a base oil for facial moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I used to use an expensive moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> This oil is food grade, cold pressed.</li>
            <li> It had no smell out of the bottle however, after being on your skin it started to have a noticeable unpleasant odor.</li>
            <li> If there is one it is very faint if any.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> What can I say, this product is just fine.  Yes, I would order this again.</li>

            <li> Great ingredient with mango butter!</li>
            <li> I have skin problems and need to moisturize often with very emollient moisturizers.  The only thing I have a problem finding is a moisturizer for my scalp.  This makes a great moisturizer for that.  I put it on my scalp and hair before I go to sleep twice a week and shampoo it off in the morning.  It is not a cure but it does help a lot.</li>
            <li> Received shipment in less than 2 weeks (Dec. in middle of xmas postage rush).  Happy with purchase, works well as a nice &amp;#34;not too light, not too heavy oil for inclusion in handmade skin lotions.</li>
            <li> I used this oil as a cuticle treatment and it worked great. Compared to other ones on the market, it&#x27;s a great price as well.</li>
            <li> While I have done much with this oil, yet; I was disappointed to find that it has no smell.  However, it is supposed to be good for the skin, so I will give it a shot.</li>
            <li> I have tried various oils, not many but several. I bought fractionated coconut oil previously and it looked really good. It had no smell out of the bottle however, after being on your skin it started to have a noticeable unpleasant odor. I just bought this Apricot oil and I am so happy with this product. It looks and feel like high quality oil. I don&#x27;t notice any smell to this oil. If there is one it is very faint if any. I had something like eczema around my nose. No lotions worked from Aquaphor to Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion. After one application this stuff worked. It is amazing.</li>
            <li> I tried out Avocado oil before..but this is a bit lighter.  I like it.  I use it for my hair a bit, and skin.</li>
            <li> my skin is finally starting to show its age and my lazy lack of care for the past 47 years. i&#x27;ve never had a cleanser i&#x27;ve particularly loved, and i&#x27;ve never been good about washing my face other than in the shower. i decided to try the oil cleansing method and a clarisonic, and i got this oil after seeing this type recommended on crunchy betty. i LOVE it. i use it on my face and body all over, a few drops applied to the clarisonic, and my skin feels and looks amazing. because it&#x27;s not messy, smelly, or splashy all over the bathroom, i actually use it pretty much every day, too. never going back to commercial cleansers or body washes again.</li>
            <li> It is what I expected. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> It is a lighter oil but it feels nice and smooth going on and does not have a strong smell.  I have severely dry skin therefore it was too light for me on my driest areas but in general it is a nice sheer oil.</li>
            <li> Gr8 I will use this seller again.</li>
            <li> Love it, feels so nice on the skin.</li>
            <li> Great additive to my massage oil. Smells great too and only have to use a few drops. Will order again!</li>
            <li> Great body oil to use right after you turn the shower off. A few drops and I have soft - soft skin!</li>
            <li> As a massage therapist apricot oil is my choice, particularly for Face I mix with lavender oil. This brand i have ordered several times</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have purchased apricot oil. I have not much to compare to. I have been placing on my body and face. It is very nice. I switch between this product and coconut oil. Does not have much of a smell either. Does not feel super oily. I really like. Was packed very well too. It came in very good condition, however if it had opened, my other items would have been protected well.</li>
            <li> This oil can be drying compared to olive oil.  I know how good apricot seed kernels are for your body---vitamin b17 and cancer fighting.  So i was interested in using it in this oil form. It has very little smell so it will serve well as carrier oil but it is a lighter oil.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted. Not pore clogging. Hubby uses it daily and has issues with acne and this has not caused a flare up.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil after using their avocado oil. Life-Flo is a great brand. I&#x27;ve never had issues with any of their products. This oil is food grade, cold pressed. It is a lighter weight than their avocado oil, but it works just as well. I use this on my son who is two to help his skin retain moisture (he has severe eczema). I put a cap full in his bath and apply it all over after his bath while he is still damp. His skin is soft and his eczema spots are softer, not as rough, but I still have to apply a layer of Vaseline to his rough patches to keep him from scratching and to keep his spots super moisturized. I use it on his scalp also once a week. I massage it through his hair and let it soak in while he&#x27;s playing in the tub and I follow it put by shampooing his hair like normal. It absorbs quickly, and I do apply it throughout the day when I change his diaper. It doesn&#x27;t have a scent to it really, which is a plus since I have to be careful with perfumes with him. It does make your tub slippery if you add it to your bath water, I always clean the tub after his bath to be on the safe side. We usually go through a 12 oz bottle every six months so it lasts a while compared to a gel baby oil (we go through one of them a month if we use it).  A little bit goes a long way. This oil used in conjunction with Vaseline and his prescription meds helps keeps his eczema in check, and I have discovered that we are using his prescription med less since we swapped over to this oil. For us this oil is more effective than coconut, avocado, baby oil, ceteaphil, or aveeno.  If it&#x27;s for eczema we have tried it. He&#x27;s had eczema since he was 3 months old and I feel like we finally found a product that I know is safe to use, it&#x27;s all natural, no chemicals, and it&#x27;s within budget.</li>
            <li> I had to return this product twice because the safety seal was broken both times.</li>
            <li> I use this on me and my babys hair and skin. We both are extra smooth and soft after using this! And this and other oils hold my babys curls better and her hair looks hydrated throughout the day and none frizzy where as other products i used held her curls and her hair looked hydrated til it dried than it would get frizzy and need more moisture.</li>
            <li> One word to describe this &amp;#34; Excellent&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Although it did leak in the box. . . fortunately, it only lost about a .25 C; and it miraculously did not damage the book that was in the same box.</li>
            <li> Great as a carrier oil. Use it with Doterra oils. Also use it for my massages.</li>
            <li> Great price for a great light oil that I often have difficulty finding.  Is great for a skin oil.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than in a store, very well packed, arrived on time, doesn&#x60;t make stain and very good for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I really love the smell. Works good with oils. Arrived in good condition and very quickly after it was ordered.</li>
            <li> Really good, I&#x27;ve mixed it with my coconut oil for skin and hair, very nice!</li>
            <li> This oil is light and smooth. It works perfectly for infant massage without clogging pores. I don&#x27;t have to worry that my baby is ingesting/absorbing something harmful, because this oil is plant-based and food-grade!</li>
            <li> I use this on my baby every day and his skin is silky soft.  The smell is extremely faint and light so not to worry about any perfume smells.  Excellent oil for excema, rashes and dry skin.</li>
            <li> Using for my hair and I can see great results already! Softer and has more life! I will order again.</li>
            <li> This company is great I bought several oils from them and was never disappointed, so def recommend! Apricot oil doesn&#x27;t smell like anything but if you google it you&#x27;ll find multiple benefits. :)</li>
            <li> LOVE this oil!!  I use it alone as a body moisturizer and as a base oil for facial moisturizer.  It absorbs quickly and makes my skin feel and look great!</li>
            <li> So much better than trying to purchase at a spa. This has a pleasant order and does not&lt;br /&gt;stain bedding or clothing.</li>
            <li> I purchased this apricot oil specifically to use for salt scrubs I make with essential oils for use on hands or during a shower or bath.  Apricot oil is one of my favorites to use in them because it isn&#x27;t super thick and greasy and leaves just the right amount of moisture after you dry yourself off after using it in a scrub.  Additionally, it also makes a great massage oil.  Not a lot of fragrance to it and it works in nice without you having to wash your hands after use.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I decided to try Life-Flo&#x27;s apricot oil after using their avocado oil, which I love. I use it as I had read that apricot oil was supposed to be thinner than avo oil, but it felt way heavier (almost greasy) on my skin and took a lot longer to fully absorb! I&#x27;d end up smudging oil on things frequently, not a problem I had with avocado oil after the first 10-15 mins or so. I also prefer the smell of the avocado oil and the way my skin feels with it to the apricot oil. I&#x27;m a litte disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a few days ago I figured out that I have to pat all the excess oil off my body after letting my skin absorb it for a bit. It felt so much less oily and lighter. If you&#x27;re having issues with oiliness, definitely pat off any excess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because it does keep my skin very soft and healthy despite my dislikes with it in other areas (my skin is dry and itchy which the oil helps immensely). It&#x27;s a good product and it works, but I&#x27;ll be returning to the avocado oil next time.</li>
            <li> I ordered this oil because the reviews said it was non-grease and didn&#x27;t have a smell. The oil is light weight and my hair absorbs it well, but it does have a little smell to it. I gave it a four because of the light smell...I wish it was orderless.</li>
            <li> Love - it&#x27;s high quality. I use it for OCM (Oil Cleansing Method) to wash my face. Make-up melts off and my skin is soft, pores reduced, eyelashes are long and healthy again.</li>
            <li> I tried some of this in a health food store and loved the way it moisturized my dry hands. The smell is nice and it absorbs quickly. You will see other brands or offers that are priced lower but the quality of this product is high and I don&#x27;t think you will be dissapointed.</li>
            <li> I used to use an expensive moisturizer.  Now I use the pure apricot oil,day and night.  I love the way my skin feels!</li>
