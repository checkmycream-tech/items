            <li>Only day two and even if I don&#x27;t get miracle lifting and firming, it is still a beautiful moisturizer that is non-greasy.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the online trial and didn&#x27;t realize in the fine print that if you don&#x27;t cancel within 14 days you get put on an automatic autoship.</li>
            <li>It reduces fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I will absolutely be ordering more!</li>
            <li>Ordered the face cream after 3 days of use saw immediate  results my skin is clear, bright, smooth, supple.</li>
            <li>My skin is hydrated, smooth, and glowing.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I very rarely leave feedback but this product showed such great results, I felt compelled to do so.</li>
            <li>My face stays hydrated &amp; always looks fresh!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Directions:  Apply to clean face and neck in the morning and evening.  </li>
            <li>They should have made that much more clear and easy to see when ordering the trial.  </li>
            <li>I am now on my second jar and a true believer!!!  </li>
            <li>First off - my skin has never been so smooth, then after about two weeks of using this and the eye cream I started getting compliments from friends who have known me all my life.</li>
            <li>Also, it is the FIRST product I have found that I am not allergic to!</li>
            <li>The jar and packaging is exactly like the picture!</li>
            <li>I have spent more for similar products at stores like Ulta and Macy&#x27;s, so I would say it&#x27;s a really GREAT value for my dollar.</li>
            <li>It plumps tired skin and makes it look fresh, dewy, and beautiful!  </li>
            <li>so I can put makeup on right after.</li>
            <li>far as shipment and packaging goes, when I ordered this I received the product very quickly as they promised.</li>
            <li>I do like it very much and would recommend it to anyone who asked.  </li>
            <li>I am overall satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t have to use much to see some results!</li>
            <li>this is the first product I&#x27;ve used that has caused any change at&lt;br /&gt;all.</li>
            <li>still on my first jar</li>
            <li>It was definitely not greasy feeling, and I was really pleased at how my skin felt to the touch throughout the day after applying it.</li>
            <li>Try Neutratone first.  </li>
            <li>so much i want to glob it on and have to remind myself it takes just a small amount for a grand result!!</li>
            <li>but I learned a good lesson, &amp;#34;don&#x27;t believe all the false advertisements.&amp;#34;  The cream goes on smoothly but is not producing the results.  </li>
            <li>That is pretty much a miracle.</li>
            <li>I am 45, with olive-tone skin, early signs of crows feet, just a bit of darkening under the eyes, and spots from mild sun damage on my cheeks and forehead.</li>
            <li>My eye area has improved greatly, and the &amp;#34;crow&#x27;s feet&amp;#34; are much less obvious!</li>
            <li>but love the  results will definitely get more something  that finally really works it even lightened  the dark circles  under my eyes</li>
            <li>and I have seen such amazing results in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>Had high hopes for this, however, I guess I used it to close to my eyes and after the severe itching, all my eyelashes fell out!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Really improves the appearance of your skin -- wrinkles are smoother, and brown spots are lighter.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I was looking for an overall better appearance, especially in skin tone, and a reduction in wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Many people have noticed less wrinkles particularly around my mouth and my eyes.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised at how little I needed to use to gain good coverage on my entire face.</li>
            <li>Unlike most other skin creams, it does not contain harsh chemicals or strong perfumes.</li>
            <li>but I must say Neutratone did wonders for my eighty plus year old skin it really works..</li>
            <li>I am looking forward to the results in a few more weeks of using this product.</li>
            <li>Looking forward to trying the new eye cream.</li>
            <li>Neutratone is a fabulous product and will be part of my daily facial skin care.</li>
            <li>Guess I should give it another try and stay far from the eyes, but so far I haven&#x27;t found the nerve!!</li>
            <li>The container that it arrived in was only one fourth full</li>
            <li>I am 68 years old and after years of smoking  my face showed it.</li>
            <li>But WOW.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels so smooth and firm since the day I started using it.</li>
            <li>I am 79 years old</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not oily or heavy and goes on so smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your skin feeling hydrated and soft all day.  </li>
            <li>I have a deep wrinkle between my eyes that is improving as well, and I didn&#x27;t think I would ever be able to make is less definite.</li>
            <li>However, after a few weeks of using it twice daily, I did notice a significant difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>My seventeen year old son told me that I am looking younger!!</li>
            <li>After just one week of switching my old cream out for Neuratone my skin is looking younger and healthier than it has in years..</li>
            <li>In the first few weeks I saw that my age/sunspots were fading.</li>

            <li> In the first few weeks I saw that my age/sunspots were fading.</li>
            <li> As far as getting rid of lines, I feel like lines are less noticeable after I put it on, but by the end of the day, I can&#x27;t tell a difference anymore.</li>
            <li> I even think wrinkles are less apparent!  </li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s only been a week or so, dark spots appear to be lightening and the skin under my neck looks smoother.</li>
            <li> Crepey, tired, dry, dull skin with fine wrinkles?  </li>
            <li> I have to say, I was skeptical, but I am really liking this!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had somewhat splotchy, uneven skin tone for as long as I can remember, unless I had a tan.</li>
            <li> I saw less wrinkles and tighter brighter skin almost overnight.</li>
            <li> Plus I saw a reduction in the slight lines on my forehead.</li>
            <li> No good results I went back to Clinique</li>
            <li> a little does a lot😃.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use a lot of this product; a little dab will do ya.  </li>
            <li> I have used other products in the past that did not work as well.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting to see a reduction in the dark patches on my face, but I also received that benefit from this product as well!</li>
            <li> Not excited about this product at all.</li>
            <li> It just caused those little pimples here and there.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed drastic changes in my face or eyes, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t work for other people.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be the usual cream and beyond that</li>
            <li> The cream goes on dull.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a big disappointment</li>
            <li> /&gt;a difference in my skin, even on my neck, albeit subtle, but</li>
            <li> I was sick of buying products that had a million different steps.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this is not the one.  </li>
            <li> This had been recommended and while I was a bit skeptical that it would do what she said for my complexion, I tried it.  </li>
            <li> Sorry .</li>
            <li> Very disappointing</li>
            <li> and I won&#x27;t need another jar - wrong!!!</li>
            <li> The lines around my mouth were awful.  </li>

            <li> I ordered the online trial and didn&#x27;t realize in the fine print that if you don&#x27;t cancel within 14 days you get put on an automatic autoship. They should have made that much more clear and easy to see when ordering the trial.  By the time I realized it, they had already withdrawn $98.  I called and they said I couldn&#x27;t get out of the charge but they agreed to cancel the autoship. I haven&#x27;t noticed drastic changes in my face or eyes, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t work for other people.  Just want to warn others about the online trial through Neutratone&#x27;s website.  Don&#x27;t know if when you order through Amazon if that is a one time order with no future commitments.</li>
            <li> I was expecting more changes in my skin when started using this product.  Not worth the money!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I would love to tell you it was great but, I can&#x27;t get the jar open!!!</li>
            <li> Did not meet expectations as described in description . Very disappointing</li>
            <li> Ok this by far is the best product I have ever purchased! I love the feeling of it on my skin so much i want to glob it on and have to remind myself it takes just a small amount for a grand result!! I have thought ok maybe I just on good roll with my skin and I won&#x27;t need another jar - wrong!!! This is a revolutionary product! Try it!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen the miracle under eye bag help but will give it more time cause I do like it as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer, but no miracle worker.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products but have not seen a difference until I started using Neutratone. My wrinkles are diminishing and my face is softer, smoother, and more radiant. My seventeen year old son told me that I am looking younger!!</li>
            <li> At first, I wasn&#x27;t impressed with Neutratone. However, after a few weeks of using it twice daily, I did notice a significant difference in my skin. My eye area has improved greatly, and the &amp;#34;crow&#x27;s feet&amp;#34; are much less obvious! I have a deep wrinkle between my eyes that is improving as well, and I didn&#x27;t think I would ever be able to make is less definite. I am now on my third or fourth jar, and will continue to use Neutratone forever! Also, it is the FIRST product I have found that I am not allergic to!</li>
            <li> I have to say, I was skeptical, but I am really liking this!  Only day two and even if I don&#x27;t get miracle lifting and firming, it is still a beautiful moisturizer that is non-greasy.  Nice!</li>
            <li> Best cream so far that I have used.</li>
            <li> I love using Neutratone! I saw less wrinkles and tighter brighter skin almost overnight. It is perfect to use under my makeup. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results!</li>
            <li> Ordered the face cream after 3 days of use saw immediate  results my skin is clear, bright, smooth, supple. I&#x27;m  trying not to use more than I supposed  to but love the  results will definitely get more something  that finally really works it even lightened  the dark circles  under my eyes a little does a lot😃. Yvette</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had somewhat splotchy, uneven skin tone for as long as I can remember, unless I had a tan. After using this product for a couple of weeks, I noticed that my face was a lot smoother with even skin tone. That is pretty much a miracle. As far as getting rid of lines, I feel like lines are less noticeable after I put it on, but by the end of the day, I can&#x27;t tell a difference anymore. I haven&#x27;t found anything that I like better, so I keep buying it.</li>
            <li> I noticed no change or improvement in my skin. I used it for a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> Had high hopes for this, however, I guess I used it to close to my eyes and after the severe itching, all my eyelashes fell out!  Guess I should give it another try and stay far from the eyes, but so far I haven&#x27;t found the nerve!!</li>
            <li> Well...I got suckered into trying this product and I&#x27;m glad I did. I needed to replace my Jan Marini transformation cream so I tried this. I also have the 6 step Obagi skin brightner set. In the first few weeks I saw that my age/sunspots were fading.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several weeks now and I don&#x27;t see any difference whatsoever.  It&#x27;s a big disappointment but I learned a good lesson, &amp;#34;don&#x27;t believe all the false advertisements.&amp;#34;  The cream goes on smoothly but is not producing the results.  Beware Buyer!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it at all!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Since I started using it a month ago, I have gotten so many compliments on the youthful appearance of my skin.  You don&#x27;t need to use a lot of this product; a little dab will do ya.  I also apply it on my chest &amp; neck as well.</li>
            <li> The container that it arrived in was only one fourth full</li>
            <li> I am 68 years old and after years of smoking  my face showed it. The lines around my mouth were awful.  This is the most  expensive face cream I have ever bought.  But WOW.  Just three weeks and friends are asking me if I have had botox!  My appearence is so good which makes me feel good. Can&#x27;t stop looking in the mirror.  Please don&#x27;t ever change this product.  Sincerely, jean mckimmey</li>
            <li> I love this product!  The results were amazing.  My best friend noticed and subsequently ordered the product as well.  It is light weight and feels wonderful on my skin.</li>
            <li> I am overall satisfied with this product. I have used other products in the past that did not work as well. It seems like it is easy on the skin and you don&#x27;t have to use much to see some results! I would recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> I do like it very much and would recommend it to anyone who asked.  But I think when you have wrinkles, you just have wrinkles and I have not found the &amp;#34;Fountain of Youth&amp;#34; yet!  But it goes on very nice.</li>
            <li> Seems to be the usual cream and beyond that I cannot comment</li>
            <li> I really love this product. Not greasy, absorbs well so I can put makeup on right after. After 2 months of use I started seeing&lt;br /&gt;a difference in my skin, even on my neck, albeit subtle, but this is the first product I&#x27;ve used that has caused any change at&lt;br /&gt;all. Over all my skin is just better.  I would definitely recommend and will buy again.  It also lasted even longer than promised&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still on my first jar</li>
            <li> I am 45, with olive-tone skin, early signs of crows feet, just a bit of darkening under the eyes, and spots from mild sun damage on my cheeks and forehead. I was looking for an overall better appearance, especially in skin tone, and a reduction in wrinkles. I definitely got the results I was looking for with this product. I was not expecting to see a reduction in the dark patches on my face, but I also received that benefit from this product as well! I was really surprised at how little I needed to use to gain good coverage on my entire face. It was definitely not greasy feeling, and I was really pleased at how my skin felt to the touch throughout the day after applying it. I started to see wrinkle reduction results and skin improvement in just about 3 weeks. The price is good for the quality and quantity of the cream! I have spent more for similar products at stores like Ulta and Macy&#x27;s, so I would say it&#x27;s a really GREAT value for my dollar. I would DEFINITELY recommend Neutratone to a friend.</li>
            <li> I am super impressed with this moisturizer it went above and beyond my expectations. First off - my skin has never been so smooth, then after about two weeks of using this and the eye cream I started getting compliments from friends who have known me all my life. I hope they never change this product it&#x27;s perfect</li>
            <li> I love this cream I&#x27;m on my second month</li>
            <li> My grandson gave me a gift of Neutratone all in one all in one anti aging skin care and what a gift it turned out to be..I was never a believer in all the creams and lotions that are promoted to make you look twenty years younger..but I must say Neutratone did wonders for my eighty plus year old skin it really works..I&#x27;m on Amazon now to buy it the price is good for a great product..try it you&#x27;ll be so glad you did.</li>
            <li> After just one week of switching my old cream out for Neuratone my skin is looking younger and healthier than it has in years.. I will absolutely be ordering more! What ever you&#x27;re doing, keep it up! Excellent product.</li>
            <li> BUH-BYE twenty jars of cream on the bathroom counter! This lightweight moisturizer and skin treatment HAS IT ALL!&lt;br /&gt;Neutratone is EVERYTHING you need in ONE JAR!  It has all four of the known anti-aging properties AND two ground-breaking ingredients that do everything we want for our skin!  It reduces fine lines and wrinkles. It stimulates collagen. It plumps tired skin and makes it look fresh, dewy, and beautiful!  Neutratone DIMINISHES skin damage and fine lines! It also protects skin from future damage.  Neutratone also helps our skin turn over faster so we look great. Crepey, tired, dry, dull skin with fine wrinkles?  TRY NEUTRATONE!  Since I have been using this cream, I get CONSTANT questions from friends!  &amp;#34;Have you had work done?  What are you using?

I love Neutratone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:  Apply to clean face and neck in the morning and evening.  I go to sleep with my face feeling damp from this.  And wake up fabulous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;October 10, 2017:  UPDATE:  I still use NEUTRATONE every day - once in the morning and once at bedtime. I swear by it. I tell my friends to buy it. It is my one-stop, do-all, end-all beauty and skincare cream. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I very rarely leave feedback but this product showed such great results, I felt compelled to do so. I have been using Neutratone Anti-Aging treatment for about three months now and I have seen such amazing results in a short amount of time. My skin feels so smooth and firm since the day I started using it. Many people have noticed less wrinkles particularly around my mouth and my eyes. My favorite part about this product is how easy the application is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as shipment and packaging goes, when I ordered this I received the product very quickly as they promised. The jar and packaging is exactly like the picture! I am so impressed with this product and seller over all, I will be making many many purchases in the future as it is my new morning and night time regiment.</li>
            <li> The cream goes on dull.  Not excited about this product at all.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waist your money. No good results I went back to Clinique</li>
            <li> Pores seem smaller.  Skin is softer</li>
            <li> I am 79 years old and I have been using this cream for two weeks. I am extremely impressed with the texture and feel of my skin. It has taken on a wonderful youthful glow. The wrinkles are not so predominant. I am looking forward to the results in a few more weeks of using this product. Neutratone is a fabulous product and will be part of my daily facial skin care.</li>
            <li> I see no difference with use</li>
            <li> It does moisturize, but I&#x27;m not looking any younger hence anti-aging dadda.</li>
            <li> Wow, what an incredible cream. I have been using the product consistently and my skin looks amazing. My skin is hydrated, smooth, and glowing. Plus I saw a reduction in the slight lines on my forehead. The absolute best part of using Neutratone is that all these amazing ingredients come in one container. I was sick of buying products that had a million different steps. Thank you Neutratone for developing a simple product that works.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely wonderful!!  I have been using it now for 3 months &amp; my skin looks 10 years younger!  My face stays hydrated &amp; always looks fresh!  I will continue to use this as it has all the ingredients in one jar &amp; I&#x27;m not using 3-4 jars at once!</li>
            <li> I have always struggled to find a night anti-aging moisturizer that wouldn&#x27;t break my face out.  Unfortunately this is not the one.  I think it would do well on most faces, just not mine.  It&#x27;s not oily or heavy and goes on so smoothly.  And I do think it improved the look of my skin while I used it.  It just caused those little pimples here and there.  I am able to use it on my neck area.  If break-outs aren&#x27;t a problem for you, I think you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> Dr. Oz said try it. So far so good.</li>
            <li> OMG. This stuff is amazing.  A You Tuber I follow recommended and I am on my second one. Love love love it.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so good.  Although it&#x27;s only been a week or so, dark spots appear to be lightening and the skin under my neck looks smoother.</li>
            <li> Great anti-aging skin cream -- 7 powerful ingredients into one jar!  Leaves your skin feeling hydrated and soft all day.  Really improves the appearance of your skin -- wrinkles are smoother, and brown spots are lighter.  Looking forward to trying the new eye cream. Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Neutratone Anti-Aging is a God send!! I have tried numerous misturizures but none compare to neutratone!  My skin feels so refreshed and renewed!  I will never use another product again!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you neutratone! You&#x27;re the greatest!!</li>
            <li> Neutratone is a very unique product. Unlike most other skin creams, it does not contain harsh chemicals or strong perfumes. When applied, it makes your face feel supple and renewed. My skin has been looking younger since using Neutratone. I love it and will use it always!!</li>
            <li> This had been recommended and while I was a bit skeptical that it would do what she said for my complexion, I tried it.  I am now on my second jar and a true believer!!!  My skin tone is more even and appears brighter.  I even think wrinkles are less apparent!  My neck looks firmer too!  Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> Does not do what it claims to. Sorry .</li>
