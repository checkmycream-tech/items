    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Works great!!</li>
            <li>It may be best to think of it as an adjunct to shaving.</li>
            <li>So happy I got this machine!</li>
            <li>After all the research and reviews I read, I chose this as the best buy for my dollar.  </li>
            <li>and I am very pleased to see the reduced and slower hair growth!</li>
            <li>I have a refurbished machine and it works just great.</li>
            <li>Great machine works great</li>
            <li>Does not work in Canada, but the product is good.</li>
            <li>The fact that it works at all is somewhat surprising.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is still a really good device it came on time when it was supposed to&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The flash of light is VERY bright.</li>
            <li>I was expecting it to work better.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>but since I had no reaction, I decided to do more often.  </li>
            <li>I have used three times in two weeks and am pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>Again, I am pleased with my purchase!&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>I fall under the fair skin, since I am not tan right now, and darker hair.  </li>
            <li>for as for how it works, I&#x27;ve been having pretty good results.</li>
            <li>I did order a replacement when I ordered the unit, so it wasn&#x27;t a huge deal, but if I hadn&#x27;t, I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to do the 2 weeks schedule.</li>
            <li>And the light cartridge did not work for more than like 30 zaps.</li>
            <li>Was expecting a bit more light life</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely make sure your hair is shaved clean.</li>
            <li>sure you do your homework and research what is right for you!  </li>
            <li>works great except on gray or white hair</li>
            <li>but it came with a used ipl light...</li>
            <li>I have a medium light complexion and have to shave twice a day.</li>
            <li>This is not a toy, nor is the price cheap.  </li>
            <li>Got a fantastic deal from the Seller.</li>
            <li>I have had no worries of the original cartridge needing replaced as of yet.  </li>
            <li>instructions also said to be clean shaven and to do once, then wait for two weeks.  </li>
            <li>They were so nice and professional!</li>
            <li>only got about 150 zaps of light, but it came fast and machine works great and clean</li>
            <li>, the &#x27;sting&#x27; is much more intense, but bearable.  </li>
            <li>If you use this without shaving the areas, the pain itch more intense and your hair will burn on the lense , take the time to prep, it does help.</li>
            <li>I would anticipate more like 20 uses before you see much difference.  </li>
            <li>It looks good but didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>I just did my first treatment, I can say that it was easy to use, but I don&#x27;t have results yet.</li>
            <li>I got this item and if I didn&#x27;t know any better, I&#x27;d think it was brand new.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I think this is a pretty good buy, especially of the price.</li>
            <li>Either way, you&#x27;ll have some hair regrowth, but this is NOT as powerful - not even close- as what you get in the office.</li>
            <li>I did my research and decided that this unit was worth a try.</li>
            <li>isn&#x27;t AS effective as a professional treatment because even the highest setting isn&#x27;t as intense as what they have.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The unit appeared to be &#x27;New&#x27; as described and it was easy to setup and begin using.  </li>
            <li>The concern there is that facial hair is thicker, more dense, and the skin is more sensitive, which may result in burning.</li>
            <li>nice things are that the cord is long and it is plug in, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about charging it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so far its easy to use  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely worth it to not have wax my husband&#x27;s back alone :).</li>
            <li>I was able to use it several times before replacing the cartridge.  </li>
            <li>Did this on my legs first as a test.  </li>
            <li>I did on all areas that first day.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this for just over a month and my hair is growing back slower and more patchy.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;d try to use the highest setting as much as possible in order to get the most out of your bulbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>First thing first.  </li>
            <li>Most of the time, no big deal</li>
            <li>Overall it has removed most hair...</li>
            <li>Our first bulb lasted us through all these treatments-</li>
            <li>I anticipate having to use this at least another 30 times before we are satisfied with the results, so you should realize this will take many months.  </li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this unit and will update after my second and third  treatment.</li>
            <li>But with a week&#x27;s growth, I started to notice that I had been working over an area that wasn&#x27;t nearly large</li>
            <li>I realize that there will be some people that this will not work on, but for me being a man with very coarse dark hair I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, I bought the red eye protection glasses because my eyes are super light sensitive.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really have to shave much...</li>
            <li>and it would take over a year to notice much difference.</li>
            <li>works very well</li>
            <li>my legs weren&#x27;t really hairy to start out with.</li>
            <li>however, that I do have dark hair and very light skin.</li>
            <li>what-so-ever except I could not withstand as high intensity as I did on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>I kind of want to give it less stars, because it didn&#x27;t do anything besides cost me money and waste my time, but it DID shoot light at my face like it is supposed to.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it is FAR BETTER than any of those other air-removal-systems</li>
            <li>guess I should&#x27;ve done a little bit more research on it</li>
            <li>The power is much lower than the professional ones, about 4-5 times.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend buying more than one, especially if you&#x27;re starting out and want to clear your arms and legs.</li>
            <li>I was horrified at first because that was the whole reason for my purchase - to get rid of unwanted facial hair</li>
            <li>Like new</li>
            <li>(I should clarify I did not get the refurb but the new one)</li>
            <li>This unit for me works and I have always been a believer and purchaser of refurbished goods - they are usually inspected more than a brand new unit anyway.</li>
            <li>I do have light skin and dark hair, so that&#x27;s not the problem.</li>
            <li>my husband&#x27;s back/shoulders and my bikini line and underarms, which have light skin and thick black hair, the product has removed more than 80% of hair and</li>
            <li>I expect that I&#x27;ll need to keep using it for another month or so before I&#x27;m completely clear of hair on my arms and legs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had professional treatments and this does not even come close.</li>
            <li>Maybe if I hadn&#x27;t already had professional treatments, it may have gotten something?</li>
            <li>got it an it didnt even last threw underarms bikinni an one whole leg</li>
            <li>What I&#x27;d recommend is to start at the lowest setting and work up as far as you can tolerate.</li>
            <li>But you have to change to frequently the flash..</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t nearly powerful enough to need that long</li>
            <li>Used for one month so far and the hair barely grows!</li>
            <li>Not sure of the normal duration of a cartridge, but I feel I have received my moneys worth thus far.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hair grows back finer, thinner, and more slowly, so she can get away with shaving once a week now, instead of every day.</li>
            <li>Their goal is also to make money by selling the bulbs, they actually could last much longer thatn 1500 flashes, but it has an internal counter that prevents it, so you buy another bulb</li>
            <li>*** ton of tattoos I can barely use this device except for areas that nobody will ever see</li>
            <li>The only complaint I have is that I haven&#x27;t had enough time to do more treatments.  </li>
            <li>Not sure how true that is,</li>
            <li>my legs (knees down) are about 50 each so that makes me think we are doing pretty well on these.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used consistently for a year and saw little results.  </li>
            <li>To speed up the process I went through the extreme measure of plucking out my whole beard and flashing it as it grew back, which allows me to use the highest setting on my face without getting burned.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I checked skin, waited two days and again could tell it was working, my face was much smoother and there was less stubble.&lt;br</li>
            <li>if its going to work as far as permanent hair removal because I haven&#x27;t had it long enough</li>
            <li>If you have some patience, use it weekly, go over the treatment area at least twice per session, and stay at it you can get adequate results.  </li>

            <li> I am a 53 year old polish man covered with dark coarse hair and have tried shaving to waxing my entire life.</li>
            <li> you use the high setting, it can hurt like a little pinch.</li>
            <li> On my legs, which have slightly lighter hair, the impact has not been as dramatic but I&#x27;d say I have about 60% less hair and to be fair</li>
            <li> Didnt have the patience to use it long enough to know if it actually works</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cost nearly as much as a single treatment, and does not deliver similar results.  </li>
            <li> Two days later, I could tell it was working to eliminate smaller less coarse hairs , so I repeated shaving and did all areas again.  </li>
            <li> The second day there was a little hair growth about 25% and the third day about the same 25%.</li>
            <li> Treatment doesn&#x27;t take that long, about 10 minutes for my wife&#x27;s bikini area and arm-pits, and I don&#x27;t mind the work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It would take that long for hair to fall out.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re thinking &amp;#34;Why pay to get the professional treatments when I can do more at home?&amp;#34; you will be disappointed, because you can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The following morning I noticed that all of the entire areas that were treated had little to no hair growth.</li>
            <li> The light window is very small 1x2 cm, which makes it hard to control and also time consuming.</li>
            <li> I tested and waited to see if any adverse reaction, none, so I actually decided to increase to strength 2, as my hair is medium and dark, hardest to get rid of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have black asian hair</li>
            <li> A bad thing is that as you continue use, you start to notice more hair that you didn&#x27;t see before, because shaving becomes much less necessary.  </li>
            <li> No adverse reaction on face or private areas, there was a little on the legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but not now!</li>
            <li> I tried it on my legs 2x and the 2nd time I was itchy but nothing that a little cream didn&#x27;t fix.  </li>
            <li> If you leave any length of hair it will burn and be more painful when you use it.</li>
            <li> thing will deliver absolutely no result in three uses.  </li>
            <li> Use if for a few facial chin hairs, works as well as going to the salon!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased the reconditioned model just due to cost and varying reviews.  </li>
            <li> I was endlessly plucking.  </li>
            <li> The other areas were just a bonus.  </li>
            <li> an almost over half other leg</li>
            <li> and she says it is nothing like getting waxed down there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> what little is there grows back extremely slowly.</li>
            <li> I did the preliminary test and decided that I could tolerate the slight snapping sensation on my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Initial setting was 1, which I felt a slight sting.  </li>
            <li> my research, a lot of people complained about how long the cartridges lasted, so I bought a back-up just in case.  </li>
            <li> It takes a lot of work to get little results.</li>
            <li> Also, if you are doing this to yourself wear dark sunglasses as the flash can be hard on the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> of the problems is that the bulbs need to be replaced every 1,500 flashes, and the flash window is small.</li>

            <li> are a little hard to believe and it makes me wonder if they&#x27;re from electrologists mad that this product is cutting into their business.</li>
            <li> very expensive, not very effective</li>
            <li> /&gt;After going through the instructions before even opening the box I was struck in with a little bit of anger to find out that I cannot use this on the areas that I desire to use it on</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was expecting it to work better. Hoping, anyway. I&#x27;ve had professional treatments and this does not even come close. I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes. Maybe if I hadn&#x27;t already had professional treatments, it may have gotten something? And the light cartridge did not work for more than like 30 zaps. I did order a replacement when I ordered the unit, so it wasn&#x27;t a huge deal, but if I hadn&#x27;t, I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to do the 2 weeks schedule. So keep that in mind. If you&#x27;re thinking &amp;#34;Why pay to get the professional treatments when I can do more at home?&amp;#34; you will be disappointed, because you can&#x27;t. Either way, you&#x27;ll have some hair regrowth, but this is NOT as powerful - not even close- as what you get in the office. I don&#x27;t know what qualifies this unit as &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34;- it&#x27;s not because it does it&#x27;s job. I do have light skin and dark hair, so that&#x27;s not the problem. Also, I bought the red eye protection glasses because my eyes are super light sensitive. You don&#x27;t need them. At all. I kind of want to give it less stars, because it didn&#x27;t do anything besides cost me money and waste my time, but it DID shoot light at my face like it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> I have used consistently for a year and saw little results.  It takes a lot of work to get little results.</li>
            <li> Does not work in Canada, but the product is good. Like new</li>
            <li> The power is much lower than the professional ones, about 4-5 times. You have to use it multiple times to achieve results and the results are not quite as stated in the manual.  The light window is very small 1x2 cm, which makes it hard to control and also time consuming. Consider using it only as a touch up.  I only went to the salon twice, but in between I used this 3 times at 2 weeks interval as they mention in the manual, and the result after the salon is uncomparable to this.  Their goal is also to make money by selling the bulbs, they actually could last much longer thatn 1500 flashes, but it has an internal counter that prevents it, so you buy another bulb</li>
            <li> Awful... Doesn&#x27;t work at all</li>
            <li> I have owned this for a couple months now and It is working for me.  I was able to use it several times before replacing the cartridge.  I suppose with anything you could get a bad cartridge now and again but I have no complaints.  I am pleased with this product.  I have a refurbished machine and it works just great.</li>
            <li> got it an it didnt even last threw underarms bikinni an one whole leg an just the lower part too an almost over half other leg now i have to get another lamp damnnnnnn dont think i can afford it</li>
            <li> works great except on gray or white hair</li>
            <li> Great machine works great but it came with a used ipl light... only got about 150 zaps of light, but it came fast and machine works great and clean</li>
            <li> I bought this refurbished unit for myself as a birthday present. I did my research and decided that this unit was worth a try. I am a 53 year old polish man covered with dark coarse hair and have tried shaving to waxing my entire life. I have a medium light complexion and have to shave twice a day. I did the preliminary test and decided that I could tolerate the slight snapping sensation on my skin. After completing my entire chest and abdomen and lower neck area I waited to see if it worked. The following morning I noticed that all of the entire areas that were treated had little to no hair growth. The second day there was a little hair growth about 25% and the third day about the same 25%. It has been about 1 week since treatment and I am very pleased to see the reduced and slower hair growth! This unit for me works and I have always been a believer and purchaser of refurbished goods - they are usually inspected more than a brand new unit anyway. I am very satisfied with this unit and will update after my second and third  treatment. I realize that there will be some people that this will not work on, but for me being a man with very coarse dark hair I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with the results.&lt;br /&gt;  Mike,</li>
            <li> Was expecting a bit more light life but the affect is...awesome.  will b buying a replct  part.</li>
            <li> I purchased the reconditioned model just due to cost and varying reviews.  I was hopeful, but skeptical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit appeared to be &#x27;New&#x27; as described and it was easy to setup and begin using.  I read the instructions a few times and followed then very diligently.  Which meant shaving everywhere I planned to use this, face, neck, private and legs.  I have black asian hair and I&#x27;m male.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initial setting was 1, which I felt a slight sting.  Did this on my legs first as a test.  I tested and waited to see if any adverse reaction, none, so I actually decided to increase to strength 2, as my hair is medium and dark, hardest to get rid of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This I did on all areas that first day.  No adverse skin reaction.  Two days later, I could tell it was working to eliminate smaller less coarse hairs , so I repeated shaving and did all areas again.  I checked skin, waited two days and again could tell it was working, my face was much smoother and there was less stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I reshaved and increased setting to 3, the &#x27;sting&#x27; is much more intense, but bearable.  No adverse reaction on face or private areas, there was a little on the legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve repeated the process after taking a week off to see what hair does on my face... I didn&#x27;t really have to shave much..., now there appears to be about 30% of the hair I started with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ine very key note.  If you use this without shaving the areas, the pain itch more intense and your hair will burn on the lense , take the time to prep, it does help.</li>
            <li> I got this item and if I didn&#x27;t know any better, I&#x27;d think it was brand new. So no problems there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for as for how it works, I&#x27;ve been having pretty good results. I&#x27;ve had this for just over a month and my hair is growing back slower and more patchy. I expect that I&#x27;ll need to keep using it for another month or so before I&#x27;m completely clear of hair on my arms and legs. I&#x27;m a guy too, so in my opinion, it&#x27;s working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, yes I do use it on my face, despite warnings everywhere saying that I shouldn&#x27;t. The concern there is that facial hair is thicker, more dense, and the skin is more sensitive, which may result in burning. What I&#x27;d recommend is to start at the lowest setting and work up as far as you can tolerate. To speed up the process I went through the extreme measure of plucking out my whole beard and flashing it as it grew back, which allows me to use the highest setting on my face without getting burned.&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t AS effective as a professional treatment because even the highest setting isn&#x27;t as intense as what they have. So I&#x27;d try to use the highest setting as much as possible in order to get the most out of your bulbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note however, that I do have dark hair and very light skin. Also my facial hair was only dense on my chin and neck. That&#x27;s probably factored into how well I&#x27;ve been doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the problems is that the bulbs need to be replaced every 1,500 flashes, and the flash window is small. I&#x27;d recommend buying more than one, especially if you&#x27;re starting out and want to clear your arms and legs. That will help with shipping costs and multiple orders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other nice things are that the cord is long and it is plug in, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about charging it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this is a pretty good buy, especially of the price. Some of the reviews I&#x27;ve read where the bulb blew up on them or that it simple quit working on them are a little hard to believe and it makes me wonder if they&#x27;re from electrologists mad that this product is cutting into their business.</li>
            <li> Works great!! Used for one month so far and the hair barely grows! I was skeptical at first, but not now!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this thing on my wife for about a year.  First thing first.  Don&#x27;t bother with any of the low power settings.  Nothing will happen.  Don&#x27;t bother to wait three weeks between treatments.  It isn&#x27;t nearly powerful enough to need that long and it would take over a year to notice much difference. This thing does work, but slowly.  It hurts some, but that depends on where you are zapping.  As I have been doing my wife&#x27;s bikini area, it causes her to jump occasionally.  Most of the time, no big deal and she says it is nothing like getting waxed down there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing will deliver absolutely no result in three uses.  Nothing.  I would anticipate more like 20 uses before you see much difference.  I have been going at it weekly for almost a year with my wife, and she has probably lost about 75% of the hair in her bikini area.  A bad thing is that as you continue use, you start to notice more hair that you didn&#x27;t see before, because shaving becomes much less necessary.  Hair grows back finer, thinner, and more slowly, so she can get away with shaving once a week now, instead of every day. But with a week&#x27;s growth, I started to notice that I had been working over an area that wasn&#x27;t nearly large enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not laser hair removal.  It doesn&#x27;t cost nearly as much as a single treatment, and does not deliver similar results.  The fact that it works at all is somewhat surprising.  If you have some patience, use it weekly, go over the treatment area at least twice per session, and stay at it you can get adequate results.  I anticipate having to use this at least another 30 times before we are satisfied with the results, so you should realize this will take many months.  Treatment doesn&#x27;t take that long, about 10 minutes for my wife&#x27;s bikini area and arm-pits, and I don&#x27;t mind the work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend you pay no attention to the advertising claims of this product.  It may be best to think of it as an adjunct to shaving.</li>
            <li> I just did my first treatment, I can say that it was easy to use, but I don&#x27;t have results yet.</li>
            <li> If you read the directions, this machine works!  I have used it on my face as well and have no compliants.  I tried it on my legs 2x and the 2nd time I was itchy but nothing that a little cream didn&#x27;t fix.  I haven&#x27;t had to shave my underarm in days.  The only reason I have had to shave is because I have only done 2 treatments. Still need to do the 3rd.  So happy I got this machine!</li>
            <li> It looks good but didn&#x27;t last. It stopped working after third use. My wife was very unhappy.</li>
            <li> If you are thinking of buying this device there are some things to keep in mind&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you happen to have tattoos are wanting to remove the facial hair if you are a woman or a transgendered woman or man that is just looking to remove his facial hair for any reason you cannot use this on facial hair on tattoos&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a transgender woman myself and one interment facial hair and hopping over a s*** ton of tattoos I can barely use this device except for areas that nobody will ever see&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After going through the instructions before even opening the box I was struck in with a little bit of anger to find out that I cannot use this on the areas that I desire to use it on&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I should&#x27;ve done a little bit more research on it but otherwise it will be used&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is still a really good device it came on time when it was supposed to&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And works very well</li>
            <li> Didnt have the patience to use it long enough to know if it actually works</li>
            <li> so far its easy to use  but I just don&#x27;t know yet if its going to work as far as permanent hair removal because I haven&#x27;t had it long enough</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say that it does what advertises...Helps a lot, but not necessarily gets rid of all hair like it claims</li>
            <li> Use if for a few facial chin hairs, works as well as going to the salon!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this at all.  very expensive, not very effective</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions to the letter, it does not work at all. I 39, strawberry blond hair, used highest setting ever 2 weeks. No sign of any reduction in hair.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my legs and I feel it works</li>
            <li> After all the research and reviews I read, I chose this as the best buy for my dollar.  I think I was right.&lt;br /&gt;Note 1&lt;br /&gt;It scared me when I read the instructions and it said NOT to use above the neck.  I was horrified at first because that was the whole reason for my purchase - to get rid of unwanted facial hair I was endlessly plucking.  The other areas were just a bonus.  But, after reading reviews again, I decided to go for it!  I think it is just a safety precaution.  I had no problem what-so-ever except I could not withstand as high intensity as I did on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;Note 2&lt;br /&gt;The instructions also said to be clean shaven and to do once, then wait for two weeks.  It would take that long for hair to fall out.  Not sure how true that is, but since I had no reaction, I decided to do more often.  I have used three times in two weeks and am pleased with the results.  The hair seems either gone or growth has slowed dramatically and I did not have the &amp;#34;itching&amp;#34; that a lot of reviewers had experienced..&lt;br /&gt;Note 3&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you do your homework and research what is right for you!  I fall under the fair skin, since I am not tan right now, and darker hair.  This is not a toy, nor is the price cheap.  I was looking at buying the &amp;#34;No-No&amp;#34; and decided on the Remington I-Light Pro because of the ratings/reviews and saved myself $100-200.  I was hesitant since it was refurbished but researched the seller.  The only complaint I have is that I haven&#x27;t had enough time to do more treatments.  Again, I am pleased with my purchase!&lt;br /&gt;Note 4&lt;br /&gt;In my research, a lot of people complained about how long the cartridges lasted, so I bought a back-up just in case.  I have had no worries of the original cartridge needing replaced as of yet.  I have done my chin 3x, my underarms 2x and my legs 2x.  Not sure of the normal duration of a cartridge, but I feel I have received my moneys worth thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give this product a big thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Got a fantastic deal from the Seller. They were so nice and professional! My son is a body builder. He has used the Product over his body twice now. I purchased an additional cartridge because I knew we would all use it often.&lt;br /&gt;If you use the high setting, it can hurt like a little pinch. Be careful on sensitive skin areas.&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is FAR BETTER than any of those other air-removal-systems</li>
            <li> (I should clarify I did not get the refurb but the new one) We&#x27;ve used the remington as described in the manual- 3x set two weeks apart- on four areas on the highest setting. Overall it has removed most hair...see description below as the effect varies based on the hair type and coarseness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my husband&#x27;s back/shoulders and my bikini line and underarms, which have light skin and thick black hair, the product has removed more than 80% of hair and what little is there grows back extremely slowly. On my legs, which have slightly lighter hair, the impact has not been as dramatic but I&#x27;d say I have about 60% less hair and to be fair my legs weren&#x27;t really hairy to start out with. Our first bulb lasted us through all these treatments- my husbands back alone is 300 flashes and my legs (knees down) are about 50 each so that makes me think we are doing pretty well on these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely make sure your hair is shaved clean. If you leave any length of hair it will burn and be more painful when you use it. Also, if you are doing this to yourself wear dark sunglasses as the flash can be hard on the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth it to not have wax my husband&#x27;s back alone :).</li>
            <li> This thing terrifies me. The flash of light is VERY bright. The people who use this machine without goggles are taking a terrific risk with their vision.</li>
            <li> This works!!! But you have to change to frequently the flash..</li>
