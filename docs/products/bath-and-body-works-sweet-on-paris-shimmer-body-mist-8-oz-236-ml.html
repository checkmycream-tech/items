            <li> This is by far my favorite scent from b&amp;bw. I wish they would bring it back! If I could buy a case of it I would, my friends keep trying to take it.</li>
            <li> Bath and Body Works stopped selling this and I found it on here! I love this scent. I wish they still made it.</li>
            <li> This is a great scent that has been discontinued by Bath &amp; Body Works. I really love it wish they&#x27;d bring it back.</li>
            <li> Great smell, it shows the sparkles on your skin,  perfect to wear to go dancing, for performances, school recitals,  for  any event.</li>
            <li> Bath and body discontinued this item. So glad I found it on Amazon!  I should have  bought more. This is a great fragrance! !!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and she loves it because of the shimmer, and I love it because of the smell</li>
            <li> Love it.... glad you have it online! Purchased for my niece. She was grateful since it was discontinued in stores. ;)</li>
            <li> Basically I bought this thinking it would smell as strong as the lotion from the store. It is weak and doesn&#x27;t smell as good. I think it&#x27;s fake, all I know is that it smells a little like arm pits eww.</li>
            <li> I simply love this fragrance it&#x27;s sweet tasty and make a man wanna sop u up wit a biscuit! :) it&#x27;s def a must buy.</li>
            <li> So I popped by Bath and Body Works and just had to try this out. I love the bottle and the glitter. I found this to be sweet smelling but not as sweet as a cotton candy body spray. This has light sweet scent that is not overpowering. I give this four stars for the scent and five for the look of the product.</li>
            <li> people say this smells like &amp;#34;cake&amp;#34; &amp;#34;candy&amp;#34; &amp;#34;marshmallows&amp;#34; &amp;#34;treacle&amp;#34; &amp;#34;clouds&amp;#34;... i love it only downside is it make your clothes glittery. v prompt postage as well (even though it&#x27;s a US company)</li>
            <li> I was missing this piece to my fragrance collection. Was able to order easily and now my set is complete.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girlfriend for her birthday and couldn&#x27;t have expected more! May need to buy it again soon she uses a lot</li>
            <li> It took a really long time for one of these 2 bottles to arrive, while the other one arrived within a week.  I love the fragrance though and I can&#x27;t get this scent at the store anymore.  Smells like Angel Food Cake.</li>
