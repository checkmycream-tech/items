            <li>Good buy.  </li>
            <li>Nice brush Good price.</li>
            <li>I was on a weekend trip and forgot my makeup brushes (emergency situation at best, right?</li>
            <li>This brush is amazing it spreads your make up on so easily.</li>
            <li>Maybe I just got a dud, because others seem to love it.</li>
            <li>I use a darker face powder and apply it under my cheekbones and on my temples and jawline as a contour, then blend a bit more onto the parts of my face that the sun would hit as a bronzer.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this brush to anyone, save your $4 and purchase something worthwhile.</li>
            <li>I love elf products but this one is a pass for me.</li>
            <li>The only not so great thing is that the brush does shed sometimes!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you all how much I love the shape.</li>
            <li>so I just run it horizontally across my cheek and get the perfect contour with no extra blending.</li>
            <li>Even though I LOVE LOVE LOVE my RT brushes, the contouring brush couldn&#x27;t compete.</li>
            <li>Okay so I just got this brush in the mail today.</li>
            <li>And for this price it&#x27;s even better(:</li>
            <li>I have used &amp; washed it more than once and have not had any shedding.  </li>
            <li>I love ELF brushes.</li>
            <li>which is exactly what I need to contour my fair skin.</li>
            <li>Pretty good brush.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive this brush and in so glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>The angle makes it easy to control where the product is going.</li>
            <li>It is also easy to build up coverage for those who want darker lines.</li>
            <li>It holds powders well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>A good price for a decent brush.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, for what I paid for it it served its purpose just fine.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really complain much since the price is great.</li>
            <li>It is cheap and does not work well.</li>
            <li>This product serves it&#x27;s purpose, but is cheaply made.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so cheap but works well.</li>
            <li>That being said, you need a light hand when applying bronzer as it can pick up quite a bit of product.</li>
            <li>This brush is made really cheap because it is so cheap.</li>
            <li>This blush brush is great for personal</li>
            <li>Its pretty on par with the shape of most bronzing brushes.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to get the bronzing brush, because it looks like a angled brush.</li>
            <li>I think it has the right density as it applies just a light dusting (with a light hand)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not painful</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d be better off buying a different brush of better quality.</li>
            <li>One of the best products out there for such a low price.</li>
            <li>but when I used it for the first time I was blown away!</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a countouring brush, the Real Techniques stipple brush is fabulous.</li>
            <li>Nice shape for bronzing especially.</li>
            <li>The handle is sturdy enough and has a nice design.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny</li>
            <li>I found that this brush, and some other face brushes from the $1 e.l.f collection (the eye brushes are excellent) are a bit coarse.</li>
            <li>This brush shed the very first time I used it, and it doesn&#x27;t hold or apply makeup consistently.</li>
            <li>right where I need it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first elf brush.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even bother opening it at the store and feeling it first, which was my mistake.</li>
            <li>It did shed a bit the first time I used it and the first time I washed it.</li>
            <li>It would be a 5 star brush if only it were a bit more plush.</li>
            <li>overall the brush is ok.</li>
            <li>Purchased this in an ELF set of brushes and the head fell off the first use.</li>
            <li>brushes that I love (kabuki, eye-defining), but this brush&#x27;s bristles a quite course, so not only</li>
            <li>And I used for the first time.</li>
            <li>First off this brush isn&#x27;t $4.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>If you are really looking for a cheap blush brush spend 2 more dollars to get the black one from studio line.</li>
            <li>I am sure with continued use it won&#x27;t take long, but as of now-ZERO.</li>
            <li>certain death was a possibility)</li>
            <li>Id much rather that than something that looks</li>
            <li>It makes it so much easier to apply the products.</li>
            <li>but the angle makes application much easier.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and made well.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t pick up the powders really well.</li>
            <li>I originally wasn&#x27;t sure about using an angles brush, but this brush is firm, yet soft on your skin.</li>
            <li>Yes mine was kind of stiff but nowhere like a broom..</li>
            <li>I have used them in the past, and they are a great value and do just as good a job as expensive brushes.</li>
            <li>use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is by no means a high end product, but for the price it works better than expected.</li>
            <li>I find it pretty soft.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s not a bad brush for being a dollar.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this brush--5 stars hands down.</li>
            <li>I chose the wedge shape because a good brush with this design can apply less blush at the base and more at the top - giving a sweep of color in just the right density with one pass.</li>
            <li>it does shed a bit, particularly after washing the brush.</li>
            <li>I would not purchase this brush here, I actually purchase this brush at a local store called DOLLAR TREE for just $1.00 much better price.</li>
            <li>I can say it&#x27;s worth a dollar only if you use as a disposable one time brush and toss in the trash</li>
            <li>The bristles feel very cheap and rough and they aren&#x27;t dense enough for my liking.</li>
            <li>Very soft, so does not irritate skin.</li>
            <li>I have always been so pleasantly surprised with the quality and value of Elf brushes</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t soft at all</li>
            <li>and it irritates my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>As far as shedding goes, I haven&#x27;t noticed any at all.</li>
            <li>But the brush is soft but remember to wash brush, hairs might fall out \\&quot;might\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as soft as the ELF face brush</li>
            <li>I bought this brush as a stocking stuffer for one of my adult children.</li>
            <li>No complaints so far.</li>
            <li>I own several elf brushes with the soft black hairs and I&#x27;m finding that the ones (like this one) with the red hairs are very coarse.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend going to your local Target or Big Lots and opening the package first to feel it.</li>
            <li>It was loose since the very beginning now</li>
            <li>The price is modest, but this brush is only so-so.</li>
            <li>heavy handed first go &#x27;round.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have owned this brush for a few years and it&#x27;s still like the first day I got it.</li>

            <li> heavy handed first go &#x27;round.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have owned this brush for a few years and it&#x27;s still like the first day I got it.</li>
            <li> When I tried to apply it, there was almost nothing on the brush…those stiff bristles really had simply swept the bronzer onto the makeup table instead of loading the brush.  </li>
            <li> This brush is flat and tapered</li>
            <li> My RT is round which makes it hard for precise application.</li>
            <li> The brush looks cheap and the bristles are stiff and somewhat hard.</li>
            <li> I have No major problems or issues with this bronzer/blush brush except for the chemical stench!</li>
            <li> It picks up the product and applies it like it&#x27;s supposed to, but it&#x27;s not a fun time when you&#x27;re trying to blend out a blush and rubbing your face over and over with such a coarse brush.</li>
            <li> This one is not soft at all.</li>
            <li> For less than $5 (sometimes as low as $1 some places) you cant have $50 expectations.</li>
            <li> I should have expected to get what I paid for.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Bristles are uneven and not sturdy enough for my taste.</li>
            <li> It Doesn&#x27;t work, feels rough on face.</li>
            <li> It is so stiff and coarse</li>
            <li> not much shedding, its a little on the small side and its not so soft</li>
            <li> I have plenty other brands.</li>
            <li> no matter what other brush I try, I ALWAYS reach for this one to apply my bronzer and contour.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too big to be a contour brush, maybe a blush brush, but it&#x27;s almost too small for that.</li>
            <li> so I ran into a 7/11 and grabbed this and a couple other E.L.F. brushes.</li>
            <li> I have other e.l.f.</li>
            <li> I have two other e.l.f brushes one for blending eyeshadow and it works well</li>
            <li> and the other is a kabuki brush for powder</li>
            <li> But not as well as other products.</li>
            <li> but i usually have to make a few passes before it gets enough down.</li>
            <li> They put down product like they&#x27;re supposed to, but every time I use it</li>
            <li> As long as you treat these little guys with some respect they will usually hold up for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super dense</li>
            <li> Not worth it!</li>
            <li> I searched foreverrrr for a brush that would give me the contour I wanted and now use this brush everyday.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday to apply bronzer and blush.</li>
            <li> Brush felt kinda harsh</li>
            <li> Here is my brush after just a few weeks.</li>
            <li> The bristles are stiff and did not pick up bronzer or blush…I could see it just sweep the product from the compact onto my makeup table.  </li>
            <li> The bristles really arent too bad in the scratchy department.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not enjoyable.</li>
            <li> Usually one or two each</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel crazy soft or anything.</li>
            <li> simple uncomfortable to work with...</li>
            <li> On the small side, but that&#x27;s what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> actually can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m saying this after re-reading my old review and remembering how much I hated this brush.</li>
            <li> Not very good bristle material.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s also not super thin.</li>
            <li> The bristles stick out all over the place, so it&#x27;s hard to get any precision.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to blend.</li>
            <li> It does t pick up product , omg , it doesn&#x27;t work at anything , I mean maybe liquid products , but for powder nahh</li>
            <li> I use this as a travel back up brush,So if i lose it,i won&#x27;t be mad.</li>
            <li> I am just going to have to find the brush I want from a different company. :(</li>
            <li> DUH!</li>
            <li> This product is so far the worst online buy I&#x27;ve ever made...</li>
            <li> Useless - basically threw it away without even using.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this brush didn&#x27;t deliver.</li>
            <li> The bristles fall out so bad that I cannot use it at all.</li>
            <li> that would be painful?</li>
            <li> I hate this brush.</li>
            <li> i hate this, would not recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I took a chance buying this brush for blush and I am very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have bought elf brushes before for eye makeup and I am still using them after years. I took a chance buying this brush for blush and I am very disappointed. It is cheap and does not work well.</li>
            <li> Useless - basically threw it away without even using. Hairs were falling out all over the place. Not worth it!</li>
            <li> I found that this brush, and some other face brushes from the $1 e.l.f collection (the eye brushes are excellent) are a bit coarse. I purchased this for bronzer, but I ended up just using it to blend my highlight. It also has been shedding a bit since I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Nice shape for bronzing especially.</li>
            <li> Fair price? It&#x27;s my first elf brush. I have plenty other brands. This one came with a lot of hairs falling out. The brush is also rather coarse.</li>
            <li> I got this for $0.90 at Big Lots. I have always been so pleasantly surprised with the quality and value of Elf brushes, I figured this would be no exception. I didn&#x27;t even bother opening it at the store and feeling it first, which was my mistake. It is so stiff and coarse it literally reminds me of a broom. It&#x27;s not painful but it&#x27;s not enjoyable. It picks up the product and applies it like it&#x27;s supposed to, but it&#x27;s not a fun time when you&#x27;re trying to blend out a blush and rubbing your face over and over with such a coarse brush. It did shed a bit the first time I used it and the first time I washed it. Maybe I just got a dud, because others seem to love it. I would recommend going to your local Target or Big Lots and opening the package first to feel it. Don&#x27;t order it from on here and be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I actually can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m saying this after re-reading my old review and remembering how much I hated this brush. So, I have to admit, I&#x27;ve been using this brush daily for months now and no matter what other brush I try, I ALWAYS reach for this one to apply my bronzer and contour. I use a darker face powder and apply it under my cheekbones and on my temples and jawline as a contour, then blend a bit more onto the parts of my face that the sun would hit as a bronzer. This brush is PERFECT for it. The angle makes it easy to control where the product is going. I changed my stars from 1 to 4. It would be a 5 star brush if only it were a bit more plush.</li>
            <li> Nice brush Good price., good quality for the price, that was I am looking for it . Get it girls.</li>
            <li> the shipping was good... overall the brush is ok. not much shedding, its a little on the small side and its not so soft</li>
            <li> Purchased this in an ELF set of brushes and the head fell off the first use. Superglued it back, but now it&#x27;s crooked. It&#x27;s too big to be a contour brush, maybe a blush brush, but it&#x27;s almost too small for that. I would not recommend this brush to anyone, save your $4 and purchase something worthwhile.</li>
            <li> This product serves it&#x27;s purpose, but is cheaply made. The brush itself is flimsy and doesn&#x27;t apply makeup well. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I should have expected to get what I paid for. This brush shed the very first time I used it, and it doesn&#x27;t hold or apply makeup consistently.</li>
            <li> The handle is sturdy enough and has a nice design. When I opened my elf brush packaging, a couple of the bristles were bent out of shape and they won&#x27;t go back. The bristles feel very cheap and rough and they aren&#x27;t dense enough for my liking. I bought this to replace a different contour brush that lost its handle, but this wasn&#x27;t an acceptable replacement. It isn&#x27;t soft at all and it irritates my sensitive skin. You&#x27;d be better off buying a different brush of better quality. Very disappointed in elf.</li>
            <li> I was on a weekend trip and forgot my makeup brushes (emergency situation at best, right? certain death was a possibility) so I ran into a 7/11 and grabbed this and a couple other E.L.F. brushes. Life. Savers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so lets talk price point. For less than $5 (sometimes as low as $1 some places) you cant have $50 expectations. As long as you treat these little guys with some respect they will usually hold up for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality: its a basic brush- no frills. It seems like painted &amp;#34;wood&amp;#34; on the handle. Ive had the wooden brushes come detached from the metal but Ive stuck it back together with eyelash glue. Didnt even have to get up. The bristles really arent too bad in the scratchy department. I find it pretty soft. The bristles do shed though and quite a bit from what Ive noticed. Usually one or two each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I make it work: Its pretty on par with the shape of most bronzing brushes. It applies fairly evenly but i usually have to make a few passes before it gets enough down. Id much rather that than something that looks heavy handed first go &#x27;round.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, for what I paid for it it served its purpose just fine. I even still keep it with the nicer brushes and while it might not be a starter, it gets some play.</li>
            <li> I hate this brush. It&#x27;s terrible. The bristles fall out so bad that I cannot use it at all. Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I love elf products but this one is a pass for me. Bristles are uneven and not sturdy enough for my taste.</li>
            <li> Good makeup brush. does not shed and excellent brush for contouring. it does shed a bit, particularly after washing the brush. Very soft, so does not irritate skin.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get the bronzing brush, because it looks like a angled brush. I wouldn&#x27;t tell any of my friends to get it because the makeup falls of the brush ..</li>
            <li> I have other e.l.f. brushes that I love (kabuki, eye-defining), but this brush&#x27;s bristles a quite course, so not only do they irritate my skin, but I find that the pigment is not evenly distributed, and I end up looking clownish.  If you are looking for a countouring brush, the Real Techniques stipple brush is fabulous.</li>
            <li> This brush is great! It&#x27;s so cheap but works well. It doesn&#x27;t shed and has really good coverage. I would recommend this brush to anyone who is looking for a good inexpensive brush!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a blush/bronzing brush before and I finally decided that it was time to buy one! It makes it so much easier to apply the products. The only not so great thing is that the brush does shed sometimes! I would definitely buy this product again!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this brush--5 stars hands down. I ordered the RT core collection specifically for the buffing and bronzing brushes and while I was waiting for them to arrive, I happened to see this brush at my local dollar tree. I decided to give it a try and now I actually prefer it over my RT brush. Yes mine was kind of stiff but nowhere like a broom.. that would be painful? That being said, you need a light hand when applying bronzer as it can pick up quite a bit of product. It&#x27;s not super dense but it&#x27;s also not super thin. I think it has the right density as it applies just a light dusting (with a light hand) which is exactly what I need to contour my fair skin. It is also easy to build up coverage for those who want darker lines. I can&#x27;t tell you all how much I love the shape. My RT is round which makes it hard for precise application. This brush is flat and tapered so I just run it horizontally across my cheek and get the perfect contour with no extra blending. As far as shedding goes, I haven&#x27;t noticed any at all. I am sure with continued use it won&#x27;t take long, but as of now-ZERO. For $1, what do you expect? Buy it in-store!! This also allows you to feel them for yourself. Anyone who has ever bought E.L.F. products knows they can be hit or miss. For me, this is a definite hit and I actually have two of these brushes now. I searched foreverrrr for a brush that would give me the contour I wanted and now use this brush everyday. Even though I LOVE LOVE LOVE my RT brushes, the contouring brush couldn&#x27;t compete.</li>
            <li> I would not purchase this brush here, I actually purchase this brush at a local store called DOLLAR TREE for just $1.00 much better price. Hope this helped. But the brush is soft but remember to wash brush, hairs might fall out \\&quot;might\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Okay so I just got this brush in the mail today. And I used for the first time. I was expecting the brush to a bit bigger but when I used it for the first time I was blown away! I was so excited to receive this brush and in so glad I bought it. Worth every penny it&#x27;s great for the price. This brush I would recommend for every beginner with makeup and contouring. It&#x27;s not like the best brush in the world of its kind but like I said it gets the job done!! And for this price it&#x27;s even better(:</li>
            <li> First off this brush isn&#x27;t $4. On eyeslipsface.com it&#x27;s a buck. This brush is made really cheap because it is so cheap. The brisels tend to fall out and over time they begin to lose their softness. Overall it&#x27;s not a bad brush for being a dollar. It&#x27;s a great brush for beginners in makeup!</li>
            <li> Great value. Use it everyday to apply bronzer and blush. I would like it just a tiny bit bigger.</li>
            <li> very coarse bristles with not enough bulk, small slippery handle, bristles did not hold together well after the first wash and does not blend well at all nor does it pick up product efficiently and evenly. I am just going to have to find the brush I want from a different company. :(</li>
            <li> The price is modest, but this brush is only so-so. The bristles stick out all over the place, so it&#x27;s hard to get any precision. I chose the wedge shape because a good brush with this design can apply less blush at the base and more at the top - giving a sweep of color in just the right density with one pass. Unfortunately this brush didn&#x27;t deliver.</li>
            <li> Check their website - this brush is $1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush is good for beginners to contour. Doesn&#x27;t feel crazy soft or anything. Just iight.</li>
            <li> Not very good bristle material.  It is coarse and I&#x27;m just going to toss this one out.</li>
            <li> Pretty good brush. Use it on its side for contouring. Brush felt kinda harsh but after I gave it a good wash it was better...WASH YOUR BRUSHES WEEKLY!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This brush has met all my expectations.  I have used &amp; washed it more than once and have not had any shedding.  I use it for contouring and it applies coverage right where I need it.  Great buy!!!</li>
            <li> This blush brush is great for personal use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is by no means a high end product, but for the price it works better than expected. The hair falls out once in a while. I have owned this brush for a few years and it&#x27;s still like the first day I got it.</li>
            <li> Perfect for contour but there&#x27;s a bit of shedding. Can&#x27;t really complain much since the price is great. It&#x27;s not as soft as the ELF face brush but the angle makes application much easier.</li>
            <li> It does t pick up product , omg , it doesn&#x27;t work at anything , I mean maybe liquid products , but for powder nahh</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing it spreads your make up on so easily. One of the best products out there for such a low price. I would definitely recommend it</li>
            <li> It does a wonderful job! Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my purchase! I originally wasn&#x27;t sure about using an angles brush, but this brush is firm, yet soft on your skin. It holds powders well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush as a stocking stuffer for one of my adult children. No complaints so far. Fast shipping and made well.</li>
            <li> I bought it for $1.00 at Target YAY!. The brush looks cheap and the bristles are stiff and somewhat hard. But hey it&#x27;s a buck. I have two other e.l.f brushes one for blending eyeshadow and it works well and the other is a kabuki brush for powder and it works great too. I have No major problems or issues with this bronzer/blush brush except for the chemical stench! I washed it 3 times and it still STINKS !!! YUK! It&#x27;s made in CHINA!!! DUH! It does NOT shed and it picks up color from my bronzer great. I use this as a travel back up brush,So if i lose it,i won&#x27;t be mad. Try It cosmetic brushes,they are the BEST!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love ELF brushes. I have used them in the past, and they are a great value and do just as good a job as expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> It works. But not as well as other products. Works best for what you pay I suppose.</li>
            <li> Bought for blush application. I&#x27;m still figuring out how to use an angled brush, but it&#x27;s holding up well and applies well.</li>
            <li> This product is so far the worst online buy I&#x27;ve ever made... Hairs falling of, unevenness... simple uncomfortable to work with...</li>
            <li> I love it, perfect for the angles of your cheekbones</li>
            <li> i hate this, would not recommend to anyone. It Doesn&#x27;t work, feels rough on face. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I own several elf brushes with the soft black hairs and I&#x27;m finding that the ones (like this one) with the red hairs are very coarse.  They&#x27;re not even necessarily any stiffer, but they just feel kinda like sandpaper on your face.  They put down product like they&#x27;re supposed to, but every time I use it I say &amp;#34;DANG, that&#x27;s coarse!&amp;#34;  I switched brushes so I can stop saying that every morning.  I might pitch this one.</li>
            <li> I had heard good things about E.l.f. and found this brush for a bargain price, so I bought it.  It is terrible.  The bristles are stiff and did not pick up bronzer or blush…I could see it just sweep the product from the compact onto my makeup table.  When I tried to apply it, there was almost nothing on the brush…those stiff bristles really had simply swept the bronzer onto the makeup table instead of loading the brush.  This was high-quality bronzer that I had never had any problem with before.  I do NOT recommend this brush…I recommend you SAVE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li> Here is my brush after just a few weeks. It was loose since the very beginning now it just fell apart. If you are really looking for a cheap blush brush spend 2 more dollars to get the black one from studio line. This one is not soft at all. It&#x27;s hard to blend. It also doesn&#x27;t pick up the powders really well. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone. I can say it&#x27;s worth a dollar only if you use as a disposable one time brush and toss in the trash</li>
            <li> A good price for a decent brush.  Good buy.  On the small side, but that&#x27;s what I was looking for.</li>
