            <li>This is great henna.  </li>
            <li>It worked great in my hair.</li>
            <li>When I rinsed it out I used conditioner as another reviewer had suggested rather than shampoo and it worked great.</li>
            <li>It worked great.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!!</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>A good trick is to rub vasoline on your forehead/ears/neck to avoid getting dyed there, and then wash it off after you&#x27;re done dying your hair.</li>
            <li>it looked GORGEOUS.</li>
            <li>, it did a nice job of turning the grays into a golden/strawberry blond, which I&#x27;m happy with.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this product!</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions exactly and it came out perfect!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with it!</li>
            <li>Oh well - it makes you hair look and feel spectacular without ANY chemicals (and much more successfully than any chemical dye I&#x27;ve ever tried)</li>
            <li>&quot; I guess all mother-in-laws have to make snarky comments about their amazing attention to minute details.</li>
            <li>Also the shine is amazing.  </li>
            <li>- it was so nice to dye my hair and not have my eyes burning from the chemical</li>
            <li>well worth it!!!  </li>
            <li>Enlist the help of a very good friend or some one who loves you very much and wouldn&#x27;t mind slathering paste all over your head.</li>
            <li>This Avigal brand is the best yet for two main reasons: the color lasts longer and the conditioning effect is more pronounced.</li>
            <li>Love this product and color.  </li>
            <li>and I enjoy playing in mud!</li>
            <li>Then I shampooed and conditioned once more</li>
            <li>Would love to be able to review this item.</li>
            <li>It was convincing.  </li>
            <li>Oh, washing it out is an interesting spectacle as well.  </li>
            <li>I have received many, many compliments :)</li>
            <li>I would recommend doing a practice strand to determine the appropriate amount of time for your hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Henna is not for everyone, but I have been using it for about 20 years and like it so much better than chemical alternatives.</li>
            <li>Make sure to but vaseline around hairline and ears</li>
            <li>I personally love it</li>
            <li>it was the deep, bright ginger that it used to be!!!</li>
            <li>I love this color.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife who has beautiful natural honey blond hair.</li>
            <li>Over the years, I have tried many other \\&quot;unnatural\\&quot; products  and nothing gave me these superb results!  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s exactly right!!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t stain anything and it wiped off easily.  </li>
            <li>Color is brilliant and strong, even for very long hair</li>
            <li>I love that this doesn&#x27;t have that super strong chemical smell that burns your nose.</li>
            <li>but it worked fine</li>
            <li>I have frosted hair- bleached and light brown.</li>
            <li>It is very close to my own and not a bleach.  </li>
            <li>Since it is no longer available, I&#x27;ve been struggling to find a replacement.</li>
            <li>Well worth the $14 :)</li>
            <li>The best part is that it covers the gray for about 2 months whereas the chemical and professional last about two weeks on me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I certainly wasn&#x27;t able to tell the difference even though I knew she put it in.</li>
            <li>but so far I&#x27;m very excited with the result!</li>
            <li>This product produces amazing color if you are a natural strawberry</li>
            <li>I frightened my husband with the bowl full of it and said \\&quot;look, honey.  </li>
            <li>never let the dye mixture rest or cure for any length of time longer than just what is needed to cool it</li>
            <li>The photo was taken out in full sun - it looks darker indoors.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER - it left my hair feeling healthy, thicker and most of all</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t fade like dye and wash out and it leaves a very pretty color.</li>
            <li>If you follow the directions it works perfect and actually seems to cover the grey longer than color from a salon.  </li>
            <li>Great color - but messy.</li>
            <li>love the fact that it has no harsh chemicles.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>The greyest of my hair takes the henna differently, causing nice highlights.  </li>
            <li>Looks like it did when I was 10 years old :)  </li>
            <li>Also I&#x27;m impressed with the consistency, the last product I had used was not a good paste, this one is very smooth, def.</li>
            <li>but other then that I loved it.</li>
            <li>This colored my previously salon colored, faded red hair,with about an inch of mousy brown grow out, beautifully and evenly!</li>
            <li>Chemical dyes always seemed to lose the red shades very quickly, but this henna lasts!</li>
            <li>So it is very mild and my hair is still soft and not altered.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very much like a mud bath/mask for your hair.</li>
            <li>First time to try henna.</li>
            <li>The color is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Love it but definitely follow the instructions and</li>
            <li>a fantastic job at matching my natural auburn hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The only person that could notice was my mother-in-law who made sure to comment,</li>
            <li>This product did exactly what I wanted it to.</li>
            <li>But since it was my first time was being cautious.</li>
            <li>But outside in daytime can see more highlights.  </li>
            <li>I get so many compliments from total strangers after I use it.  </li>
            <li>I used it for the first time this weekend and gave it a test by just trying it on the grays at my temples</li>
            <li>/&gt;-To rinse, I set the shower nozzle to the highest pressure setting and rinse thoroughly; I don&#x27;t shampoo with the first rinse</li>
            <li>You have to mix it yourself, and be sure you get it soupy enough, it dries up fast.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-I start at my part and my temples and using an old spatula dedicated to the job, I work out from there; I have shoulder length wavy hair and eventually will have a full mud pack on my head</li>
            <li>The color is very vibrant.  </li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>it feels like you&#x27;re rubbing mud in your hair, and your hair will smell very earthy (like henna)</li>
            <li>And it REALLY is.  </li>
            <li>You really have to pack it on your head</li>
            <li>Haha...</li>
            <li>Results were better than expected.</li>
            <li>and it looks shinny and healthy and natural unlike some of the box reds that are bright and fake</li>
            <li>The final straw came the other week when someone asked me which side of the family my 3 year old daughter&#x27;s deep, bright, ginger hair came from!!</li>
            <li>The first time with conditioner and hot water the second with olive oil and hot water.  </li>
            <li>I was very cautious about dying my hair because my shade of ginger (i.e., orange) is hard to match and most chemical dyes are more red than orange.</li>
            <li>I recommend buying the bigger size to make sure you have enough or have some for touch ups.</li>
            <li>So in short, if you want to show off a bold color choice for your mother, and nobody else, buy this product.</li>
            <li>Had high hopes.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this henna.</li>
            <li>I have been using forms of henna on my hair since high school when I would use the neutral color to condition and add shine.</li>
            <li>I made it a little more watery</li>
            <li>(it also helps if your natural shade is close to the color you&#x27;re using haha).  </li>
            <li>I dyed my hair golden blonde and once my roots started to show, I used the henna to give it a reddish tint.</li>
            <li>The color was very vibrant and has lasted much longer than the commercial store-bought dyes.</li>
            <li>This henna hair color turned my dark blonde hair bright red.  </li>
            <li>I am trying a new color</li>
            <li>I think Avigal&#x27;s Strawberry Blond has become my new fave.</li>
            <li>Now I only leave it on 5-10 minutes, and I like the effect very much.</li>
            <li>It is my natural color and will use again today!  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I decided to try the Strawberry Blonde mixed with a bit of the Copper to make sure there was enough of the orange tone.</li>
            <li>I have medium dark hair and the dye would only show very lightly.</li>
            <li>only downside to this product is that the color gets very strong very quickly---at least on my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a natural redhead, but my hair has gotten more dull since I hit 30 -</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s been blonde her whole life and has never tried dying her or coloring her hair before.</li>
            <li>And my hair feels soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>The old Hennaluscent Sunset Glo was my go-to color</li>
            <li>I want my hair color to look as natural as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>an old robe specifically to the hair-coloring days</li>
            <li>is about 3 hours, but I am naturally redheaded and not trying to drastically alter my hair color&lt;</li>
            <li>but my hair was naturally darker than hers in my youth</li>
            <li>I was worried that it would fade quickly since it&#x27;s technically semi-permanent, but it actually seems to last longer than the auburn chemical hair dyes.</li>
            <li>I have used three different brands of henna and several different colors, all aiming to give my greying light brown hair a strawberry blonde cast.</li>
            <li>I used my electric hand mixer on low to make sure it was really well mixed to a thick cream consistency.</li>
            <li>but this adds a little more of a deep red to it</li>
            <li>Well worth the MESS to apply!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yes, it is messy to apply, but you get used to it--and with a little practice, you get great effects for less than the cost of shampoo.</li>
            <li>The strawberry blonde color I got looks natural too.  </li>
            <li>I only left the product on for about 2 hours, but sat outside much of the time where it was about 90 degrees.</li>
            <li>, I have a 10 year old red robe in this role&lt;br /&gt;-Put</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally a copper red</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a messy application but worth it for color and shine.</li>
            <li>I have long hair and got the strawberry blond, used to be my natural color</li>
            <li>She swears up and down that there is a very noticeable difference in the appearance of her hair.</li>
            <li>No one warned me that my natural red hair would fade so it came as a huge shock in my late 30s when it slowly changed from a deep, bright ginger to a washed out reddish dirty dishwater color.</li>

            <li> You really have to pack it on your head</li>
            <li> Haha...</li>
            <li> Results were better than expected.</li>
            <li> and it looks shinny and healthy and natural unlike some of the box reds that are bright and fake</li>
            <li> The final straw came the other week when someone asked me which side of the family my 3 year old daughter&#x27;s deep, bright, ginger hair came from!!</li>
            <li> The first time with conditioner and hot water the second with olive oil and hot water.  </li>
            <li> I was very cautious about dying my hair because my shade of ginger (i.e., orange) is hard to match and most chemical dyes are more red than orange.</li>
            <li> I recommend buying the bigger size to make sure you have enough or have some for touch ups.</li>
            <li> So in short, if you want to show off a bold color choice for your mother, and nobody else, buy this product.</li>
            <li> Had high hopes.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this henna.</li>
            <li> I have been using forms of henna on my hair since high school when I would use the neutral color to condition and add shine.</li>
            <li> I made it a little more watery</li>
            <li> (it also helps if your natural shade is close to the color you&#x27;re using haha).  </li>
            <li> I dyed my hair golden blonde and once my roots started to show, I used the henna to give it a reddish tint.</li>
            <li> The color was very vibrant and has lasted much longer than the commercial store-bought dyes.</li>
            <li> This henna hair color turned my dark blonde hair bright red.  </li>
            <li> I am trying a new color</li>
            <li> I think Avigal&#x27;s Strawberry Blond has become my new fave.</li>
            <li> Now I only leave it on 5-10 minutes, and I like the effect very much.</li>
            <li> It is my natural color and will use again today!  </li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I decided to try the Strawberry Blonde mixed with a bit of the Copper to make sure there was enough of the orange tone.</li>
            <li> I have medium dark hair and the dye would only show very lightly.</li>
            <li> only downside to this product is that the color gets very strong very quickly---at least on my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a natural redhead, but my hair has gotten more dull since I hit 30 -</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s been blonde her whole life and has never tried dying her or coloring her hair before.</li>
            <li> And my hair feels soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> The old Hennaluscent Sunset Glo was my go-to color</li>
            <li> I want my hair color to look as natural as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> an old robe specifically to the hair-coloring days</li>
            <li> is about 3 hours, but I am naturally redheaded and not trying to drastically alter my hair color&lt;</li>
            <li> but my hair was naturally darker than hers in my youth</li>
            <li> I was worried that it would fade quickly since it&#x27;s technically semi-permanent, but it actually seems to last longer than the auburn chemical hair dyes.</li>
            <li> I have used three different brands of henna and several different colors, all aiming to give my greying light brown hair a strawberry blonde cast.</li>
            <li> I used my electric hand mixer on low to make sure it was really well mixed to a thick cream consistency.</li>
            <li> but this adds a little more of a deep red to it</li>
            <li> Well worth the MESS to apply!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes, it is messy to apply, but you get used to it--and with a little practice, you get great effects for less than the cost of shampoo.</li>
            <li> The strawberry blonde color I got looks natural too.  </li>
            <li> I only left the product on for about 2 hours, but sat outside much of the time where it was about 90 degrees.</li>
            <li> , I have a 10 year old red robe in this role&lt;br /&gt;-Put</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally a copper red</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a messy application but worth it for color and shine.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and got the strawberry blond, used to be my natural color</li>
            <li> She swears up and down that there is a very noticeable difference in the appearance of her hair.</li>
            <li> No one warned me that my natural red hair would fade so it came as a huge shock in my late 30s when it slowly changed from a deep, bright ginger to a washed out reddish dirty dishwater color.</li>
            <li> - it was so vibrant it was a little too orange.</li>
            <li> , I only condition.&lt;br /&gt;-I purposely have dark color pillow cases in case some of the dye isn&#x27;t completely rinsed out&lt;br /&gt;-Some</li>
            <li> I actually turned my head upside down and coated the back side and ends first and then turned my head over and did the rest and then shoved it all in a heavy duty shower cap for an hour.</li>
            <li> really don&#x27;t think the application is hard and rinsing it out is actually easier for me than chemical coloring.  </li>
            <li> Covers all my grey, yay.  </li>
            <li> this&lt;br /&gt;-I also have red wash cloths which I keep wet during the process to wipe up any spills or splotches that land on my skin</li>
            <li> As I have long hair (</li>
            <li> It does slowly fade, but it kinda works for it because then you can&#x27;t see the roots as much while they grow in.</li>
            <li> I like this color but may try other ones later.</li>
            <li> Yes it smells a bit like dry grass or a hay field or something</li>
            <li> I took off one star because the color is a bit too dark red for me to call it Strawberry blond.</li>
            <li> I put a bunch of red towels down on my bathroom floor and used some of my husband&#x27;s mechanics disposable gloves.</li>
            <li> I usually leave henna on about 15-20 minutes, but when I left this brand on that long, the color was an unnatural orange in some places (I immediately washed my hair again and it softened some).</li>
            <li> anytime you wet your hair, but it isn&#x27;t overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> I only kept it in my hair half the time and used less of product than stated in directions.  </li>
            <li> And I was being careful!  </li>
            <li> It is very messy, and gritty.</li>
            <li> am in my late 50&#x27;s and this product took my dull red hair back to the color</li>

            <li> Notice a slight difference indoors.  </li>
            <li> If mess and mud bother you don&#x27;t henna your hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I add a little amla oil to the dye powder; sometimes I&#x27;ll also add cinnamon&lt;</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little darker than my daughter&#x27;s</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s actually heavy on there.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how it looks in a few days</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s been complaining lately that she feels bored with her hair and wanted to give something new a try.</li>
            <li> It was a little hard to rinse out</li>
            <li> Afterward I found it really hard to get all the grit out.</li>
            <li> but It&#x27;s no more difficult to use than other types of coloring.</li>
            <li> I use this color as a base for covering grey hair.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product, I have used Henna for decades, and this is def. the best. Color is brilliant and strong, even for very long hair the amount is plenty. Also I&#x27;m impressed with the consistency, the last product I had used was not a good paste, this one is very smooth, def. the best henna I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Amazing! This colored my previously salon colored, faded red hair,with about an inch of mousy brown grow out, beautifully and evenly! I am in love with this product! I followed the instructions exactly and it came out perfect!</li>
            <li> First time to try henna. I&#x27;m in love with it! I have frosted hair- bleached and light brown. Of crouse the blonde parts are redder than the brown.</li>
            <li> Love this product and color.  It is very close to my own and not a bleach.  So it is very mild and my hair is still soft and not altered.  I will be getting it all the time.</li>
            <li> If mess and mud bother you don&#x27;t henna your hair. It&#x27;s very much like a mud bath/mask for your hair. The color is exactly what I wanted. Enlist the help of a very good friend or some one who loves you very much and wouldn&#x27;t mind slathering paste all over your head. I recommend buying the bigger size to make sure you have enough or have some for touch ups. I made it a little more watery then I think you&#x27;re suppose to but it worked fine and I enjoy playing in mud!</li>
            <li> Love it but definitely follow the instructions and next time I will rinse it off outside  there is a lot of sediment that goes down the drain</li>
            <li> Great product.&lt;br /&gt;Does a fantastic job at matching my natural auburn hair.&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that it has no harsh chemicles.&lt;br /&gt;Nice even color...with highlights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying this product again and again... Thanks!</li>
            <li> The color was very vibrant and has lasted much longer than the commercial store-bought dyes. I have long hair and got the strawberry blond, used to be my natural color - it was so vibrant it was a little too orange. They suggest mixing it with some Hazel or Champagne to avoid brassiness and I think I would next time. But this doesn&#x27;t come with a squeeze bottle and plastic gloves. It is very messy, and gritty. You have to mix it yourself, and be sure you get it soupy enough, it dries up fast. Afterward I found it really hard to get all the grit out. I applied a big gob of conditioner and that helped a lot. Then I shampooed and conditioned once more before I thought I had it all out. Great color - but messy.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife who has beautiful natural honey blond hair. She&#x27;s been blonde her whole life and has never tried dying her or coloring her hair before. She&#x27;s been complaining lately that she feels bored with her hair and wanted to give something new a try. I bought this as a temporary way for her to see what having strawberry blond hair would be like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now comes the part where my wife and I disagree on the product. She swears up and down that there is a very noticeable difference in the appearance of her hair. I certainly wasn&#x27;t able to tell the difference even though I knew she put it in. Nobody at her work noticed. None of our friends noticed. The only person that could notice was my mother-in-law who made sure to comment, \\&quot;I am the only one who will notice everything about you.\\&quot; I guess all mother-in-laws have to make snarky comments about their amazing attention to minute details. So in short, if you want to show off a bold color choice for your mother, and nobody else, buy this product. If not, maybe try something else.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! I was worried that it would fade quickly since it&#x27;s technically semi-permanent, but it actually seems to last longer than the auburn chemical hair dyes. Chemical dyes always seemed to lose the red shades very quickly, but this henna lasts! It does slowly fade, but it kinda works for it because then you can&#x27;t see the roots as much while they grow in. (it also helps if your natural shade is close to the color you&#x27;re using haha).  Definitely read the directions! don&#x27;t use a metal bowl/metal spoon (can cause a weird reaction and ruin the dye), use gloves!!, don&#x27;t shampoo/condition within 48 hours of application. I used conditioner after rinsing the dye out of my hair and it caused the dye to not stick as well (will have to redo it now).  A good trick is to rub vasoline on your forehead/ears/neck to avoid getting dyed there, and then wash it off after you&#x27;re done dying your hair. I also don&#x27;t want a bunch of henna sticking up my drains, so i rinse my hair outside with the garden hose haha. it feels like you&#x27;re rubbing mud in your hair, and your hair will smell very earthy (like henna) anytime you wet your hair, but it isn&#x27;t overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> Would love to be able to review this item. Unfortunately, the can said, &amp;#34;directions enclosed&amp;#34;, and there were none to be found. No clue how to mix or apply this product. Had high hopes.  So disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is the best I have ever used.  It is my natural color and will use again today!  Covers gray just great.</li>
            <li> This is great henna.  I am trying a new color and it is yummy!  Covers all my grey, yay.  The greyest of my hair takes the henna differently, causing nice highlights.  And my hair feels soft and moisturized.  I highly recommend this henna.</li>
            <li> When I started mixing this up, according to the instructions, of course, I thought to myself - what the hell did i get myself into?  It smelled like mud, and it looked like... well... poop.  I frightened my husband with the bowl full of it and said \\&quot;look, honey.  Poop!\\&quot;  and he was disgusted and ran away.  It was convincing.  HOWEVER - it left my hair feeling healthy, thicker and most of all it looked GORGEOUS. The color is unlike any I&#x27;ve ever gotten from any chemical dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a natural redhead, but my hair has gotten more dull since I hit 30 - so I thought this might be the solution.  And it REALLY is.  It makes my color so brilliant!!  Looks like it did when I was 10 years old :)  It makes it shiny too!!  I haven&#x27;t seen it shine like that in years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One warning: When applying - prepare for one of the biggest messes you&#x27;ll ever make.  I had \\&quot;mud\\&quot; all of the place.  Somehow it even ended up on the walls.... behind things - who knows how it got there!!  And I was being careful!  You really have to pack it on your head and it&#x27;s actually heavy on there.  Like a mud pack on your head - feels like it weighs like 3lbs.  Haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning it off of, well... everything, was rather simple. It didn&#x27;t stain anything and it wiped off easily.  It&#x27;s a bit of a procedure but it&#x27;s well, well worth it!!!  Oh, washing it out is an interesting spectacle as well.  Haha... Oh well - it makes you hair look and feel spectacular without ANY chemicals (and much more successfully than any chemical dye I&#x27;ve ever tried) - it was so nice to dye my hair and not have my eyes burning from the chemical fumes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want gorgeous, shiny, brilliant, permanent (mine is growing out!!  It never wore off!) thicker-feeling hair - get it!!  The strawberry blonde color I got looks natural too.  I have received many, many compliments :)</li>
            <li> I use this color as a base for covering grey hair.  If you follow the directions it works perfect and actually seems to cover the grey longer than color from a salon.  My scalp could no longer handle the chemicals in color dyes.  This is a great alternative to chemical dyes!!!</li>
            <li> I have used three different brands of henna and several different colors, all aiming to give my greying light brown hair a strawberry blonde cast. This Avigal brand is the best yet for two main reasons: the color lasts longer and the conditioning effect is more pronounced. My hair is not only colored but shinier and healthier looking.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to this product is that the color gets very strong very quickly---at least on my hair. I usually leave henna on about 15-20 minutes, but when I left this brand on that long, the color was an unnatural orange in some places (I immediately washed my hair again and it softened some). Now I only leave it on 5-10 minutes, and I like the effect very much. I would recommend doing a practice strand to determine the appropriate amount of time for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Henna is not for everyone, but I have been using it for about 20 years and like it so much better than chemical alternatives. Yes, it is messy to apply, but you get used to it--and with a little practice, you get great effects for less than the cost of shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have been using Avigal Henna for over 30 years. This is the best Henna product out there. It&#x27;s a messy application but worth it for color and shine.</li>
            <li> This product did exactly what I wanted it to. I took off one star because the color is a bit too dark red for me to call it Strawberry blond. However, It becomes strawberry blond over time as you wash it. I did not get the brassy look that I associate with henna coloring. I have purchased this product again and will keep using it. I like this color but may try other ones later. I goes on like mud but It&#x27;s no more difficult to use than other types of coloring.</li>
            <li> It worked great in my hair. I will be continuing to purchase the product.</li>
            <li> This henna hair color turned my dark blonde hair bright red.  I only kept the henna on my head for 20 minutes, so use caution if your hair is blonde.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!!! It doesn&#x27;t fade like dye and wash out and it leaves a very pretty color. I get lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> This product produces amazing color if you are a natural strawberry blonde!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in my late 50&#x27;s and this product took my dull red hair back to the color it was when I was a teenager.  Over the years, I have tried many other \\&quot;unnatural\\&quot; products  and nothing gave me these superb results!  My hair actually has blonde and red highlights - THIS IS AN AMZING PRODUCT! Well worth the MESS to apply!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. My granddaughter LOVES it and I must admit that I think I look 10 years younger! WOW!</li>
            <li> Worked just like it said it would. It was a little hard to rinse out but other then that I loved it.</li>
            <li> Have not used it.  Concerned about using the product.  Also the  beauticians I have asked no next to nothing about how to use this product</li>
            <li> made my skin break out into a rash</li>
            <li> Fairly simple to use. Make sure to but vaseline around hairline and ears so you don&#x27;t stain your skin temporarily. Results were better than expected. I only kept it in my hair half the time and used less of product than stated in directions.  But since it was my first time was being cautious. Notice a slight difference indoors.  But outside in daytime can see more highlights.  I have never colored my hair with anything before.  Hope this helps</li>
            <li> I have naturally red hair but have tried to cover the gray for years.  I have used this product twice. The first time with conditioner and hot water the second with olive oil and hot water.  Both time for 45 minutes.  The color is very vibrant.  I get so many compliments from total strangers after I use it.  Also the shine is amazing.  The best part is that it covers the gray for about 2 months whereas the chemical and professional last about two weeks on me.&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t think the application is hard and rinsing it out is actually easier for me than chemical coloring.  I do have short hair. Condition after you use it and read the instructions.</li>
            <li> I was blessed to be born with dark auburn hair. I&#x27;ve taken the color and thickness of my hair for granted for most of my life and now approaching 40, I&#x27;m sad to see the grays popping up and overall luster diminishing. I have been using forms of henna on my hair since high school when I would use the neutral color to condition and add shine. The old Hennaluscent Sunset Glo was my go-to color and it matched my hair perfectly. Since it is no longer available, I&#x27;ve been struggling to find a replacement. I think Avigal&#x27;s Strawberry Blond has become my new fave. I used it for the first time this weekend and gave it a test by just trying it on the grays at my temples and I have to say, it did a nice job of turning the grays into a golden/strawberry blond, which I&#x27;m happy with. I only left the product on for about 2 hours, but sat outside much of the time where it was about 90 degrees. I chose strawberry blond over their darker reds because I like to put something lighter over my already medium/dark hair. I feel that sometimes a dye called \\&quot;auburn\\&quot; can turn out too purple or maroon for my liking. I want my hair color to look as natural as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My tips for using Henna:&lt;br /&gt;-Invest in a box of medical gloves.&lt;br /&gt;-Dedicate an old robe specifically to the hair-coloring days, I have a 10 year old red robe in this role&lt;br /&gt;-Put a towel on the bathroom floor and over the bathroom counter - I have red towels specifically for this&lt;br /&gt;-I also have red wash cloths which I keep wet during the process to wipe up any spills or splotches that land on my skin (I am acne-prone and will not put vaseline on my skin)&lt;br /&gt;-I add a little amla oil to the dye powder; sometimes I&#x27;ll also add cinnamon&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;ve never let the dye mixture rest or cure for any length of time longer than just what is needed to cool it, I know some people let it sit overnight&lt;br /&gt;-I start at my part and my temples and using an old spatula dedicated to the job, I work out from there; I have shoulder length wavy hair and eventually will have a full mud pack on my head&lt;br /&gt;-I wrap my head in saran wrap and cover with a shower cap; then I go sit in the sun and read for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;-The longest I&#x27;ve ever had to leave henna on my hair is about 3 hours, but I am naturally redheaded and not trying to drastically alter my hair color&lt;br /&gt;-To rinse, I set the shower nozzle to the highest pressure setting and rinse thoroughly; I don&#x27;t shampoo with the first rinse, I only condition.&lt;br /&gt;-I purposely have dark color pillow cases in case some of the dye isn&#x27;t completely rinsed out&lt;br /&gt;-Some people hate the smell of henna. I personally love it and I haven&#x27;t found anything that lessens the smell; just know you&#x27;re likely to be the only one that notices the scent of it.</li>
            <li> No one warned me that my natural red hair would fade so it came as a huge shock in my late 30s when it slowly changed from a deep, bright ginger to a washed out reddish dirty dishwater color. The final straw came the other week when someone asked me which side of the family my 3 year old daughter&#x27;s deep, bright, ginger hair came from!! I was very cautious about dying my hair because my shade of ginger (i.e., orange) is hard to match and most chemical dyes are more red than orange. But my hair has always been my identity and I knew I had to do something so I researched henna and came across this brand. I decided to try the Strawberry Blonde mixed with a bit of the Copper to make sure there was enough of the orange tone. I used 12 heaped tablespoons of the Strawberry Blonde and 4 heaped tablespoons of the Copper plus two tablespoons of olive oil. I used my electric hand mixer on low to make sure it was really well mixed to a thick cream consistency. I put a bunch of red towels down on my bathroom floor and used some of my husband&#x27;s mechanics disposable gloves. It was messy, but not as bad as I thought it would be from all the reviews. As I have long hair (mid back) I actually turned my head upside down and coated the back side and ends first and then turned my head over and did the rest and then shoved it all in a heavy duty shower cap for an hour. When I rinsed it out I used conditioner as another reviewer had suggested rather than shampoo and it worked great. After towel drying I crossed fingers and looked in the mirror and . . . it was the deep, bright ginger that it used to be!!! I almost wept! it&#x27;s a little darker than my daughter&#x27;s but my hair was naturally darker than hers in my youth so it&#x27;s exactly right!! The photo was taken out in full sun - it looks darker indoors. We&#x27;ll see how it looks in a few days but so far I&#x27;m very excited with the result!</li>
            <li> I have medium dark hair and the dye would only show very lightly. I dyed my hair golden blonde and once my roots started to show, I used the henna to give it a reddish tint. It worked great.</li>
            <li> I love this color. My hair is naturally a copper red but this adds a little more of a deep red to it and it looks shinny and healthy and natural unlike some of the box reds that are bright and fake looking not to mention they fade terribly after just one or two washings. I won&#x27;t ever go back to box dyes after using this. I love that this doesn&#x27;t have that super strong chemical smell that burns your nose. Yes it smells a bit like dry grass or a hay field or something but I&#x27;d rather smell like that then chemicals that make it hurt to breath. Well worth the $14 :)</li>
