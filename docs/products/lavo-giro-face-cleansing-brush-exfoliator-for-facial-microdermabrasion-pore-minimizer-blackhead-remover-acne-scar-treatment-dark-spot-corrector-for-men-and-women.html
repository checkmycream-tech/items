            <li>I love everything about this Giro Cleansing System tool.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are a lot of cleansing systems and brushes out on the market right now (with good reason...</li>
            <li>first time I tried this type of product...more than pleasantly surprised...use it 2/3 times a week...</li>
            <li>do it as it will dig into your face if you are to rough with it, the sponge was awesome to remove my makeup and the microderm abrasian brush for just cleaning my skin</li>
            <li>The reviews were good &amp; it really helped to see the video of the 2 women who used this.</li>
            <li>handle is rubberized so it is easy to hold onto and provides a non slip grip.</li>
            <li>Each brush head attachs and detachs easily and stays in place like they should.  </li>
            <li>This makes cleaning and taking care of my face easy.  </li>
            <li>A carry case for this would be nice but is unfortunately not included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My skin has never felt so soft and has a nice glow!</li>
            <li>My skin felt cleaner and more pleasant to do than when I apply a facial cleanser with my hands.  </li>
            <li>seriously love each and every brush head, and its super easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I especially love the body brush because I know it&#x27;s softly exfoliating my deep skin cells which give me very smooth skin.</li>
            <li>The large brush would be great to buff your whole body before you self tan.  </li>
            <li>It comes with a bunch of attachments, which is fantastic.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*I received this product for free in exchange for my unbiased reviewng it feel luxurious as it smoothed in my moisturizer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*I received this product for free in exchange for my unbiased review</li>
            <li>#34;No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation, Licensed Cosmetologist as of 1996 (expired 2013</li>
            <li>I love how my face feels after a good cleaning with the facial brush.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>It cleans the skin way more effective than your bare hands could ever clean.</li>
            <li>I was really excited about this.</li>
            <li>also feel great and gives you a facial massage while it deep cleans your pores for bright and clean skin.</li>
            <li>, so I was thrilled to have the opportunity to test the new LAVO Giro Cleansing</li>
            <li>My skin felt super smooth after one use, and used it as well to apply my night cream.</li>
            <li>I have tried LAVO products in the past (including the cleansing oil, which I absolutely LOVE!!!)</li>
            <li>This brush is perfect for exfoliating and got rid of his stubborn dry patches of skin in a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last, but certainly not least, is the pumice brush.</li>
            <li>This brush is perfect for exfoliating and got rid of his stubborn dry patches of skin in a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last, but certainly not least, is the pumice brush.</li>
            <li>My skin feels super clean and looks clean too.</li>
            <li>and my face was full of torn, irritated skin.</li>
            <li>Cleaning procedure leaves your skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick but the item I received was defective.</li>
            <li>It is an all plastic casing with a section that has soft silicone with a power switch for more comfortable grip.  </li>
            <li>I used the small brush first which is the perfect size and shape for your face.</li>
            <li>There is a small brush that is ideal for the face and neck.</li>
            <li>The sponge is also very fine and soft, making it feel luxurious as it smoothed in my moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This is so easy to use and provides true, deep cleansing of pores and exfoliation (waaaaay more effective than simply cleansing by hand).</li>
            <li>something happens to the first one!</li>
            <li>The face brush is super soft and cleanses great: I can see a big difference in washing my face with this.</li>
            <li>I am discovering that a little pampering is great and I am finding that I like motorized cleansers and beauty implements.</li>
            <li>It is a great little system for cleaning your face and body.</li>
            <li>and I love the soft brushes that do all the work!&lt;br /&gt;A cleaning system like the Giro</li>
            <li>The price is more reasonable compare to others that I encountered and the device seems to be very durable.</li>
            <li>The motor is powerful enough to do all the jobs nicely.  </li>
            <li>Loved it so much I purchased a second one in case</li>
            <li>I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free.</li>
            <li>It helped evenly distribute my moisturizer and it absorbed into my skin even quicker than when I just use my fingertips.</li>
            <li>The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!</li>
            <li>I used pure rose water for my first use but plan on using a cleanser next time but it exfoliated my skin, opened up my pores, and even got rid of my stubborn blackheads on my chin and nose.</li>
            <li>expected, LAVO offers only the best!</li>
            <li>I have also noticed that the handle is larger so you can get a better grip.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, the shipping was incredibly fast!</li>
            <li>It arrived exactly when it said it would</li>
            <li>and it was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product first</li>
            <li>But, this one has super soft bristles and is very gentle.</li>
            <li>I was not required to give a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all).</li>
            <li>The brush rotates pretty fast, so all I do is just move it in circular motion for about 2 min, it foams up my cleanser</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love it based on the reviews posted here since I really could not justify paying over $100 for a facial brush.</li>
            <li>Pumice for calluses and a large bristle brush for your body.  </li>
            <li>This is actually my first cleansing system, I always wanted to get one, but the prices are too high...</li>
            <li>The face brush is good because if you push too hard it will stop spinning, so you can&#x27;t be too aggressive on your face.  </li>
            <li>You pull it straight off the end.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>It really is waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>This has a sealed section that holds the batteries and is securely fastened and some work to actually take off.  </li>
            <li>It has really cleaned my face up since I started using this along with Lavo&#x27;s face cleaner.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t really a brush but is a nice sized pumice stone that really helps get rid of callouses and dead skin on the soles of the feet.</li>
            <li>The system really helps you apply the correct amount of pressure</li>

            <li>The system really helps you apply the correct amount of pressure</li>
            <li>I highly recommend purchase this product!</li>
            <li>Good for thick oily acne</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say how they compare to other similar devices but the Lavo cleaning unit appears to be good quality.  </li>
            <li>a deep clean easier.&lt;br /&gt;I received one of these LAVO Giro Skin Cleansing Systems to review</li>
            <li>I got the brush wet and used some pure rose water and simply let the brush do the rest.</li>
            <li>I got the brush wet and used some pure rose water and simply let the brush do the rest.</li>
            <li>The bristles are extremely soft and gentle, making this brush really relaxing and gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li>After I added new batteries...it didn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li>Inside the package there is a small manual that tells you what each interchangeable parts are meant for which was nice for me since I&#x27;m new to this.</li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY recommend this</li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY recommend this</li>
            <li>Its so soft, and really cleans your skin without being abrasive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe are worth buying.</li>
            <li>When using the small brush it feels very soft and enjoyable as I gently move around the areas of my face.</li>
            <li>I used lavo&#x27;s oil cleanser to wipe off my make up, and put some on the brush, spun it around on my hand, and viola looks brand new.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Maybe make it better, and a little more coarse so it really removes the dead skin!</li>
            <li>Hi, Im Sherri, Just used this with the Lavo microdermabrasion cream after first cleansing with my Lavo facial cleansing oil used</li>
            <li>If your skin is more sensitive you can use the softer pad over the small bristled one.  </li>
            <li>It is really large for bigger areas!</li>
            <li>I used this on my face and was surprised at how soft it felt on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>also really like this system for the upper arms.</li>
            <li>So far so good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>in this case you get so much: not only you get the face brush</li>
            <li>It is gentle on the skin while at the same time clearing off excess dirt from your face.</li>
            <li>( I&#x27;m 51 years old)  </li>
            <li>The brushes are able to aide in deep cleaning to remove make up, dirt, oil and dead skin.</li>
            <li>This left my skin looking vibrant and feeling</li>
            <li>Overall i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>After placing new batteries correctly multiple times, the unit would not power on at all.</li>
            <li>This is the first time ever for me using a cleansing system such as this along with me starting to care for my skin just recently.</li>
            <li>Like the smaller brush, the bristles are soft and don&#x27;t irritate the skin.</li>
            <li>I am already talking about buying replacement brushes and even buying a whole other system for my mother.</li>
            <li>I am already talking about buying replacement brushes and even buying a whole other system for my mother.</li>
            <li>Since spring and summer are just around the corner, this is the perfect way to clear up those nasty bumps that always seem to crop up over the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you get a larger brush for your body, plus a soft sponge brush for applying your daily moisturizer</li>
            <li>so I was a little worried at first</li>
            <li>There was no tear or broken holes for the item to be damaged; everything looks fine.</li>
            <li>A little case would be very convenient.</li>

            <li> first time I tried this type of product...more than pleasantly surprised...use it 2/3 times a week...</li>
            <li> do it as it will dig into your face if you are to rough with it, the sponge was awesome to remove my makeup and the microderm abrasian brush for just cleaning my skin</li>
            <li> The reviews were good &amp; it really helped to see the video of the 2 women who used this.</li>
            <li> handle is rubberized so it is easy to hold onto and provides a non slip grip.</li>
            <li> Each brush head attachs and detachs easily and stays in place like they should.  </li>
            <li> This makes cleaning and taking care of my face easy.  </li>
            <li> A carry case for this would be nice but is unfortunately not included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt so soft and has a nice glow!</li>
            <li> My skin felt cleaner and more pleasant to do than when I apply a facial cleanser with my hands.  </li>
            <li> seriously love each and every brush head, and its super easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I especially love the body brush because I know it&#x27;s softly exfoliating my deep skin cells which give me very smooth skin.</li>
            <li> The large brush would be great to buff your whole body before you self tan.  </li>
            <li> It comes with a bunch of attachments, which is fantastic.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*I received this product for free in exchange for my unbiased reviewng it feel luxurious as it smoothed in my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*I received this product for free in exchange for my unbiased review</li>
            <li> #34;No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation, Licensed Cosmetologist as of 1996 (expired 2013</li>
            <li> I love how my face feels after a good cleaning with the facial brush.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> It cleans the skin way more effective than your bare hands could ever clean.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this.</li>
            <li> also feel great and gives you a facial massage while it deep cleans your pores for bright and clean skin.</li>
            <li> , so I was thrilled to have the opportunity to test the new LAVO Giro Cleansing</li>
            <li> My skin felt super smooth after one use, and used it as well to apply my night cream.</li>
            <li> I have tried LAVO products in the past (including the cleansing oil, which I absolutely LOVE!!!)</li>
            <li> This brush is perfect for exfoliating and got rid of his stubborn dry patches of skin in a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last, but certainly not least, is the pumice brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is perfect for exfoliating and got rid of his stubborn dry patches of skin in a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last, but certainly not least, is the pumice brush.</li>
            <li> My skin feels super clean and looks clean too.</li>
            <li> and my face was full of torn, irritated skin.</li>
            <li> Cleaning procedure leaves your skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick but the item I received was defective.</li>
            <li> It is an all plastic casing with a section that has soft silicone with a power switch for more comfortable grip.  </li>
            <li> I used the small brush first which is the perfect size and shape for your face.</li>
            <li> There is a small brush that is ideal for the face and neck.</li>
            <li> The sponge is also very fine and soft, making it feel luxurious as it smoothed in my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is so easy to use and provides true, deep cleansing of pores and exfoliation (waaaaay more effective than simply cleansing by hand).</li>
            <li> something happens to the first one!</li>
            <li> The face brush is super soft and cleanses great: I can see a big difference in washing my face with this.</li>
            <li> I am discovering that a little pampering is great and I am finding that I like motorized cleansers and beauty implements.</li>
            <li> It is a great little system for cleaning your face and body.</li>
            <li> and I love the soft brushes that do all the work!&lt;br /&gt;A cleaning system like the Giro</li>
            <li> The price is more reasonable compare to others that I encountered and the device seems to be very durable.</li>
            <li> The motor is powerful enough to do all the jobs nicely.  </li>
            <li> Loved it so much I purchased a second one in case</li>
            <li> I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free.</li>
            <li> It helped evenly distribute my moisturizer and it absorbed into my skin even quicker than when I just use my fingertips.</li>
            <li> The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!</li>
            <li> I used pure rose water for my first use but plan on using a cleanser next time but it exfoliated my skin, opened up my pores, and even got rid of my stubborn blackheads on my chin and nose.</li>
            <li> expected, LAVO offers only the best!</li>
            <li> I have also noticed that the handle is larger so you can get a better grip.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, the shipping was incredibly fast!</li>
            <li> It arrived exactly when it said it would</li>
            <li> and it was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product first</li>
            <li> But, this one has super soft bristles and is very gentle.</li>
            <li> I was not required to give a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all).</li>
            <li> The brush rotates pretty fast, so all I do is just move it in circular motion for about 2 min, it foams up my cleanser</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love it based on the reviews posted here since I really could not justify paying over $100 for a facial brush.</li>
            <li> Pumice for calluses and a large bristle brush for your body.  </li>
            <li> This is actually my first cleansing system, I always wanted to get one, but the prices are too high...</li>
            <li> The face brush is good because if you push too hard it will stop spinning, so you can&#x27;t be too aggressive on your face.  </li>
            <li> You pull it straight off the end.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> It really is waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> This has a sealed section that holds the batteries and is securely fastened and some work to actually take off.  </li>
            <li> It has really cleaned my face up since I started using this along with Lavo&#x27;s face cleaner.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t really a brush but is a nice sized pumice stone that really helps get rid of callouses and dead skin on the soles of the feet.</li>
            <li> The system really helps you apply the correct amount of pressure</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t really a brush but is a nice sized pumice stone that really helps get rid of callouses and dead skin on the soles of the feet.</li>
            <li> The system really helps you apply the correct amount of pressure</li>
            <li> I highly recommend purchase this product!</li>
            <li> Good for thick oily acne</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how they compare to other similar devices but the Lavo cleaning unit appears to be good quality.  </li>
            <li> a deep clean easier.&lt;br /&gt;I received one of these LAVO Giro Skin Cleansing Systems to review</li>
            <li> I got the brush wet and used some pure rose water and simply let the brush do the rest.</li>
            <li> I got the brush wet and used some pure rose water and simply let the brush do the rest.</li>
            <li> The bristles are extremely soft and gentle, making this brush really relaxing and gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li> After I added new batteries...it didn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> Inside the package there is a small manual that tells you what each interchangeable parts are meant for which was nice for me since I&#x27;m new to this.</li>
            <li> I would HIGHLY recommend this</li>
            <li> I would HIGHLY recommend this</li>
            <li> Its so soft, and really cleans your skin without being abrasive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe are worth buying.</li>
            <li> When using the small brush it feels very soft and enjoyable as I gently move around the areas of my face.</li>
            <li> I used lavo&#x27;s oil cleanser to wipe off my make up, and put some on the brush, spun it around on my hand, and viola looks brand new.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Maybe make it better, and a little more coarse so it really removes the dead skin!</li>
            <li> Hi, Im Sherri, Just used this with the Lavo microdermabrasion cream after first cleansing with my Lavo facial cleansing oil used</li>
            <li> If your skin is more sensitive you can use the softer pad over the small bristled one.  </li>
            <li> It is really large for bigger areas!</li>
            <li> I used this on my face and was surprised at how soft it felt on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> also really like this system for the upper arms.</li>
            <li> So far so good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> in this case you get so much: not only you get the face brush</li>
            <li> It is gentle on the skin while at the same time clearing off excess dirt from your face.</li>
            <li> ( I&#x27;m 51 years old)  </li>
            <li> The brushes are able to aide in deep cleaning to remove make up, dirt, oil and dead skin.</li>
            <li> This left my skin looking vibrant and feeling</li>
            <li> Overall i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> After placing new batteries correctly multiple times, the unit would not power on at all.</li>
            <li> This is the first time ever for me using a cleansing system such as this along with me starting to care for my skin just recently.</li>
            <li> Like the smaller brush, the bristles are soft and don&#x27;t irritate the skin.</li>
            <li> I am already talking about buying replacement brushes and even buying a whole other system for my mother.</li>
            <li> I am already talking about buying replacement brushes and even buying a whole other system for my mother.</li>
            <li> Since spring and summer are just around the corner, this is the perfect way to clear up those nasty bumps that always seem to crop up over the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you get a larger brush for your body, plus a soft sponge brush for applying your daily moisturizer</li>
            <li> so I was a little worried at first</li>
            <li> There was no tear or broken holes for the item to be damaged; everything looks fine.</li>
            <li> A little case would be very convenient.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:4dcca16c011f2dc45d57262d0921d0ec]] Includes the cleansing unit (4 AA batteries required but not included), large body brush, small facial microdermabrasion brush, sponge brush, pumice stone attachment for the feet and the instructions.  </li>
            <li> This kit includes the giro cleansing system, a small brush, a large brush, pumice, and a sponge.</li>
            <li> It quickly removes dirt, grime, and dead skin cells that can become trapped within pores and cause blemishes and breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What makes this cleansing system different than other is that it comes with different attachments to use on different parts of your body.  </li>
            <li> The other cleansing system I purchased was too rough on my sensitive skin, but I&#x27;ve found that I don&#x27;t get the same irriration and redness with this one.</li>
            <li> i will not renew it due to pricing on the license and renewal classes, major was skincare, haircare and makeup).</li>
            <li> I wasted money on these and a new pack of batteries.</li>
            <li> I used this brush on my boyfriend to do his back as he tends to get really dry skin.</li>
            <li> I used this brush on my boyfriend to do his back as he tends to get really dry skin.</li>
            <li> I use it on dry places like upper arms and also to take sunscreen off that is waterproof and it works well.  </li>
            <li> , i think everyone should have this  as a part of there facial kit, i can not live without it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The foot pumice isn&#x27;t quit rough enough</li>
            <li> but I used it on my feet and it helped, it just takes too long.  </li>
            <li> I noticed when I moved the system in the opposite direction the brush was moving, it opened up his pores quicker and got rid of the black heads on his back.</li>
            <li> I noticed when I moved the system in the opposite direction the brush was moving, it opened up his pores quicker and got rid of the black heads on his back.</li>
            <li> I am usually barefoot when I am at home and it is hard on my feet, but the pumice smoothed my heels really quickly and effortlessly.&lt;br /&gt;You can use the unit in the shower for all over cleaning.</li>
            <li> far I&#x27;ve used the small brush for cleansing and the face sponge for applying creams</li>
            <li> It is very similar to the small brush (in regards to the bristles and softness) but covers a larger surface area.</li>
            <li> It is very similar to the small brush (in regards to the bristles and softness) but covers a larger surface area.</li>
            <li> The battery compartment was a little tricky because I could not get it to open using the instructions.</li>
            <li> I tried this in the tub and after getting wet it worked with no problems.  </li>
            <li> There are plenty of other brush heads for cleaning all the other body parts as well.  </li>
            <li> course, you have to use common sense and not overuse or use on open blemishes.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> and a half stars</li>
            <li> (it can be a bit stubborn as it is tightly fitted for waterproofing), put in 4 AA batteries, replace the battery cap, and choose a brush to use.</li>
            <li> It would make sense to keep all the little brushes in the shower, but there is no way to put it mine.</li>
            <li> After being disappointed with the purchase of a much-pricier cleansing system, I was excited to give this one a try.</li>
            <li> and you get a little pumice stone for your feet.</li>
            <li> be careful not to push to hard or over</li>
            <li> I have tried LAVO&#x27;s products before in the past so when I saw they came out with this product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s never too late to start taking care of your skin.</li>
            <li> Just like using any other pumice stone, you want to let your feet soak to loosen up of the skin to make the skin removal a lot easier and less painful.</li>
            <li> Just like using any other pumice stone, you want to let your feet soak to loosen up of the skin to make the skin removal a lot easier and less painful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of hard products on my face and have never experienced that before.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> Waste!!!</li>
            <li> It seriously wipes the competition out of the waters!  </li>
            <li> So I saw all of these positives reviews for this product, and I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> Oh my... Who needs some expensive, over hyped, name brand cleaner.</li>
            <li> As a guy, I have always hated the face cleaning routine with using my hands to scrub into my face.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> first time I tried this type of product...more than pleasantly surprised...use it 2/3 times a week...&lt;br /&gt;each time my skin feels great...</li>
            <li> I am discovering that a little pampering is great and I am finding that I like motorized cleansers and beauty implements. They make getting a deep clean easier.&lt;br /&gt;I received one of these LAVO Giro Skin Cleansing Systems to review and I love the soft brushes that do all the work!&lt;br /&gt;A cleaning system like the Giro helps exfoliate your skin. The brushes are able to aide in deep cleaning to remove make up, dirt, oil and dead skin. The rotating heads are much more effective at this than just using your hands.&lt;br /&gt;It also feel great and gives you a facial massage while it deep cleans your pores for bright and clean skin. I love how my face feels after a good cleaning with the facial brush.&lt;br /&gt;With this set you get a variety of implements to care for different areas for overall skin treatment. There is a small brush that is ideal for the face and neck. There is also a sponge if you prefer. You get a large body brush that is great for using on your arms, legs and body. Like the smaller brush, the bristles are soft and don&#x27;t irritate the skin. There is also a pumice that is great for feet! I am usually barefoot when I am at home and it is hard on my feet, but the pumice smoothed my heels really quickly and effortlessly.&lt;br /&gt;You can use the unit in the shower for all over cleaning. It is cordless, using four AA batteries. It is also a nice compact unit so you can easily take it with you when on the go or traveling.&lt;br /&gt;The handle is rubberized so it is easy to hold onto and provides a non slip grip. It is a great little system for cleaning your face and body. The battery compartment was a little tricky because I could not get it to open using the instructions. They describe using your thumbs to push it off.... It turned out to be very simple. You pull it straight off the end.&lt;br /&gt;This is a good system and would be a great gift for teens or those just starting out with a skin care system.</li>
            <li> I have tried LAVO products in the past (including the cleansing oil, which I absolutely LOVE!!!), so I was thrilled to have the opportunity to test the new LAVO Giro Cleansing System.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As expected, LAVO offers only the best! This is so easy to use and provides true, deep cleansing of pores and exfoliation (waaaaay more effective than simply cleansing by hand). It quickly removes dirt, grime, and dead skin cells that can become trapped within pores and cause blemishes and breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a lot of cleansing systems and brushes out on the market right now (with good reason... they work). But, this one has super soft bristles and is very gentle. It&#x27;s not overly abrasive. Instead it leaves skin glowing... not red or scratched.(Of course, you have to use common sense and not overuse or use on open blemishes.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really like this system for the upper arms. Since spring and summer are just around the corner, this is the perfect way to clear up those nasty bumps that always seem to crop up over the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, you can&#x27;t beat the price. And, there&#x27;s even a 100% Satisfaction Guarantee, so there&#x27;s no risk. But, you won&#x27;t want to return it. This is really a wonderful tool to keep skin clean and glowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars for sure!</li>
            <li> I use tazorac cream every night. I started using this and my face was full of torn, irritated skin. It left my akin burning. I&#x27;ve used a lot of hard products on my face and have never experienced that before. I was really excited about this. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> So I saw all of these positives reviews for this product, and I was skeptical. But for the price, I thought what would be the harm in purchasing to try? The results were AMAZING. I like to pair this with Eclos Radiance Facial Scrub, and let me tell you... it&#x27;s the perfect microdermabrasion regimen. My skin felt super smooth after one use, and used it as well to apply my night cream. IN LOVE! It&#x27;s never too late to start taking care of your skin. I&#x27;m 25 and plan on aging well. A MUST HAVE!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a product like this before and I really like it.  What makes this cleansing system different than other is that it comes with different attachments to use on different parts of your body.  If your skin is more sensitive you can use the softer pad over the small bristled one.  Pumice for calluses and a large bristle brush for your body.  The large brush would be great to buff your whole body before you self tan.  I have also noticed that the handle is larger so you can get a better grip.  The only thing I would add is a case to hold all the attachments or last have the option to purchase one as an add on.&lt;br /&gt;*Sample Provided*</li>
            <li> I love this cleansing system.  It works great.  The reviews were good &amp; it really helped to see the video of the 2 women who used this. I would tell everyone I know to get it.   Nancy</li>
            <li> Works as described. nice product and good price.</li>
            <li> This review is post one use. So far so good.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Good for thick oily acne prone skin&lt;br /&gt;- Works great in the shower. It really is waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;- Cleaning procedure leaves your skin nice and soft. It also feels great on your back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- It would make sense to keep all the little brushes in the shower, but there is no way to put it mine. A little case would be very convenient.</li>
            <li> This is the first time ever for me using a cleansing system such as this along with me starting to care for my skin just recently. When packaged, it&#x27;s solid. There was no tear or broken holes for the item to be damaged; everything looks fine. Inside the package there is a small manual that tells you what each interchangeable parts are meant for which was nice for me since I&#x27;m new to this. The manual also explains how they are used, cleaned and stored.&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;ve used the small brush for cleansing and the face sponge for applying creams and I actually enjoyed the feel of them. When using the small brush it feels very soft and enjoyable as I gently move around the areas of my face. The face sponge also feels amazing and does feel better when applying cream onto my face than using my hand.&lt;br /&gt;As of now I haven&#x27;t encountered any problems with this cleansing system. It feels great when using it, easy to clean and has four attachments for their own purpose. The price is more reasonable compare to others that I encountered and the device seems to be very durable. I&#x27;m happy that I bought this cleansing system and will continue on using it.</li>
            <li> Amazon did their part delivery was on time but the product would not work ..... at all would not turn on!!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love it based on the reviews posted here since I really could not justify paying over $100 for a facial brush. Shipping was quick but the item I received was defective. After placing new batteries correctly multiple times, the unit would not power on at all.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!!! After I added new batteries...it didn&#x27;t work! I wasted money on these and a new pack of batteries. Waste!!!</li>

A carry case for this would be nice but is unfortunately not included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never used one of these types of devices before, so I can&#x27;t say how they compare to other similar devices but the Lavo cleaning unit appears to be good quality.  It is an all plastic casing with a section that has soft silicone with a power switch for more comfortable grip.  This has a sealed section that holds the batteries and is securely fastened and some work to actually take off.  I used this on my face and was surprised at how soft it felt on my sensitive skin.  It foamed the facial cleanser well and did not irritate my skin.  My skin felt cleaner and more pleasant to do than when I apply a facial cleanser with my hands.  I tried this in the tub and after getting wet it worked with no problems.  There are plenty of other brush heads for cleaning all the other body parts as well.  Each brush head attachs and detachs easily and stays in place like they should.  The motor is powerful enough to do all the jobs nicely.  As a guy, I have always hated the face cleaning routine with using my hands to scrub into my face.  This makes cleaning and taking care of my face easy.  Great for exfoliating, cleaning, and the wife likes this too and she is picky with her face cleaning products.  Of course that means I have to fight for my time to use it. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 and a half stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.

            <li> Hi, Im Sherri, Just used this with the Lavo microdermabrasion cream after first cleansing with my Lavo facial cleansing oil used .the brush on the Giro cleansing  brush feels wonderful. My skin has never felt so soft and has a nice glow! I look healthy! Pleased with all my Lavo products. I will be a return customer! Loved it so much I purchased a second one in case something happens to the first one! I received my second item at a great discount!</li>
            <li> After being disappointed with the purchase of a much-pricier cleansing system, I was excited to give this one a try. It comes with a bunch of attachments, which is fantastic. The other cleansing system I purchased was too rough on my sensitive skin, but I&#x27;ve found that I don&#x27;t get the same irriration and redness with this one. If it had a case, it would be perfect. Product provided for testing and review purposes, but all opinions are honest and my own.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome cleaning system for your face and my face looks great since I have been using this. I like that it came with a variety of brushes so both me and my boyfriend have our own brush head and can both use it. It has really cleaned my face up since I started using this along with Lavo&#x27;s face cleaner. The face cleaner has became so much more effective with the brush cleaning out my pores. It has reduced acne and redness in my face also which Is great. I received this to share my honest thoughts and opinions on this product.</li>
            <li> This is actually my first cleansing system, I always wanted to get one, but the prices are too high...in this case you get so much: not only you get the face brush you get a larger brush for your body, plus a soft sponge brush for applying your daily moisturizer and you get a little pumice stone for your feet. The face brush is super soft and cleanses great: I can see a big difference in washing my face with this. My skin feels super clean and looks clean too. The brush rotates pretty fast, so all I do is just move it in circular motion for about 2 min, it foams up my cleanser great. I am very happy with this cleansing system. You will have to get 4 AA batteries as it does not come in the kit. I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe are worth buying.</li>
            <li> It is a grat product! It cleans the skin way more effective than your bare hands could ever clean. It is gentle on the skin while at the same time clearing off excess dirt from your face. Overall i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Oh my... Who needs some expensive, over hyped, name brand cleaner. When Lavo&#x27;s is better than those! It seriously wipes the competition out of the waters!  seriously love each and every brush head, and its super easy to clean. I used lavo&#x27;s oil cleanser to wipe off my make up, and put some on the brush, spun it around on my hand, and viola looks brand new. My face feels like its way cleaner now, than any traditional method. The  pumice stone, I do feel could use some work. Maybe make it better, and a little more coarse so it really removes the dead skin! The body one is amazing. It is really large for bigger areas! I like using it on my chest, and upper back area. Its so soft, and really cleans your skin without being abrasive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample Provided.</li>
            <li> I have been dying to try a microdermabrasion/ cleansing system but have been putting it off because I just couldn&#x27;t justify spending an arm and a leg to get a system that would work for me. I have tried LAVO&#x27;s products before in the past so when I saw they came out with this product, I couldn&#x27;t wait to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the shipping was incredibly fast! It arrived exactly when it said it would and it was exactly as described. This kit includes the giro cleansing system, a small brush, a large brush, pumice, and a sponge. The giro system itself is compact and fits very nicely in your hand. It is very durable and waterproof which makes it perfect for use in the shower. I love the sleek and stylish design and the fact that it is cordless makes it even better. *Tip: make sure you have 4 AA batteries on hand, I rushed to the store to buy some because I couldn&#x27;t wait to use this system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use this system you simply have to slide off the battery cap (it can be a bit stubborn as it is tightly fitted for waterproofing), put in 4 AA batteries, replace the battery cap, and choose a brush to use. I used the small brush first which is the perfect size and shape for your face. The bristles are extremely soft and gentle, making this brush really relaxing and gentle on your skin. I have very sensitive skin so I was a little worried at first but the system applies just the right amount of pressure at the perfect speed. I used pure rose water for my first use but plan on using a cleanser next time but it exfoliated my skin, opened up my pores, and even got rid of my stubborn blackheads on my chin and nose. This left my skin looking vibrant and feeling smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next brush I used was the sponge. It is just like a makeup sponge and I used it to massage in my facial moisturizer. It helped evenly distribute my moisturizer and it absorbed into my skin even quicker than when I just use my fingertips. The sponge is also very fine and soft, making it feel luxurious as it smoothed in my moisturizer. My skin tone looked a lot clearer, even, and my blotchiness and redness virtually disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The large brush is the perfect size to use on the rest of your body. It is very similar to the small brush (in regards to the bristles and softness) but covers a larger surface area. I used this brush on my boyfriend to do his back as he tends to get really dry skin. I got the brush wet and used some pure rose water and simply let the brush do the rest. I noticed when I moved the system in the opposite direction the brush was moving, it opened up his pores quicker and got rid of the black heads on his back. This brush is perfect for exfoliating and got rid of his stubborn dry patches of skin in a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last, but certainly not least, is the pumice brush. It isn&#x27;t really a brush but is a nice sized pumice stone that really helps get rid of callouses and dead skin on the soles of the feet. Just like using any other pumice stone, you want to let your feet soak to loosen up of the skin to make the skin removal a lot easier and less painful. The system really helps you apply the correct amount of pressure and it got rid of my callouses a lot quicker than using a traditional stone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am very pleased with this system. I am already talking about buying replacement brushes and even buying a whole other system for my mother. I fell in love with this system the moment I saw the system. It is very stylish and easy to use. I feel like I have a spa in my home now and it leaves my skin looking/ feeling healthier and my skin tone looks more even without having redness. I would HIGHLY recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product for free in exchange for my unbiased reviewng it feel luxurious as it smoothed in my moisturizer. My skin tone looked a lot clearer, even, and my blotchiness and redness virtually disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The large brush is the perfect size to use on the rest of your body.

            <li> I have been using this product first i used the pumus stone i have a warning with it be careful not to push to hard or over do it as it will dig into your face if you are to rough with it, the sponge was awesome to remove my makeup and the microderm abrasian brush for just cleaning my skin yes i did it backwards and yes it worked and yes i love it i can not say enough about this kit! I am so glad i was able to try it, i think everyone should have this  as a part of there facial kit, i can not live without it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FTC Disclosure: &amp;#34;No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation, Licensed Cosmetologist as of 1996 (expired 2013 i will not renew it due to pricing on the license and renewal classes, major was skincare, haircare and makeup). I was not required to give a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all). Your experience may differ. The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!

            <li> Pros:  the big cleaning head for body. I use it on dry places like upper arms and also to take sunscreen off that is waterproof and it works well.  The face brush is good because if you push too hard it will stop spinning, so you can&#x27;t be too aggressive on your face.  The foot pumice isn&#x27;t quit rough enough but I used it on my feet and it helped, it just takes too long.  I like that it is waterproof is I can keep it in my shower.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  I don&#x27;t like using batteries I prefer rechargeable units, which this is not. My face is breaking out ( I&#x27;m 51 years old)  but I assume it is just adjusting. I will update later as I have only been using this for a week.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to receive this product to review and report my 100 percent honest experience on it. I love everything about this Giro Cleansing System tool. All of them work perfectly for each of it&#x27;s purpose. It cleans my face and body so well. I especially love the body brush because I know it&#x27;s softly exfoliating my deep skin cells which give me very smooth skin. I highly recommend purchase this product!</li>
