            <li>Wish I could get more!!!!</li>
            <li>Matches my brows perfectly</li>
            <li>This eye &amp; brow pencil is perfect for my eye brows, don&#x27;t use it for my eyes.</li>
            <li>BEST PENCIL EVER-GREAT CONTROL IN DRAWING</li>
            <li>Have been using this product for years, it works beautifully</li>
            <li>very pleased - thank you!</li>
            <li>This pencil works great on my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>The texture is great and it stays on all day.</li>
            <li>Happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>Great pencil</li>
            <li>This has always been a great product.  </li>
            <li>Company that sent it was great.</li>
            <li>I was happy to find the eyeliner I needed since it has been a discontinued product.  </li>
            <li>I have used it for years and got this a great price.</li>
            <li>It work easily and does a great job and lasts and lasts and lasts!</li>
            <li>but as an eyebrow liner this works good.</li>
            <li>Always good.</li>
            <li>I was delighted to find these on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I was so happy to receive it-I WILL ORDER ITY T AGAIN FOR SURE</li>
            <li>It is the best one I have found and really like.</li>
            <li>Sharpening it is never truly effective.</li>
            <li>came quickly and packaged very  nicely.</li>
            <li>This product is okay, but used solely on eyebrows can produce an orangey brown color.</li>
            <li>If you are looking in despair for the Maybelline Expert Wear Brow pencil (that all of us love and can&#x27;t find or afford) check out buying in bulk through Walmart.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t give up! :-)  </li>

            <li>So glad to have found it, cant fine it</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I was able to find two vendors who had the product</li>
            <li>I am going to order more of this product while it is still available.</li>
            <li>I received these in good condition and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>The brown ended up being a shade too light</li>
            <li>I just did that buying 8 pencils @ $4.97 each, for $39.76 plus tax, free shipping over $35, . . .</li>
            <li>Do you by any chance has the light brown color eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>It is a great color for me and the only one I use .</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, nice soft color and stays on all day.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  </li>
            <li>Received it by mail quickly.  </li>
            <li>was not what I expected, color wise.</li>
            <li>right away I thought of Amazon and found it.</li>
            <li>nice pencil, too light for my brow, so need to add black and then fill in with eyeshadow, so will need to take a much darker brown</li>
            <li>but it still worked out pretty well.</li>
            <li>I was willing to pay the elevated price because of the lack of availability otherwise.</li>
            <li>This product is so much better than the regular pencil brow liner.</li>
            <li>I later was able to purchased them for $2.00 each&lt;br /&gt;yes</li>
            <li>It is easy to manage and doesn&#x27;t have to be sharpened like many other similar pencils.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and covers the white hair and those balding area..  </li>
            <li>the seller wants to know where I got them at that price she may email me.</li>
            <li>I really dislike the product they put in it&#x27;s place.</li>
            <li>I bought this in dark brown and the color is more like RUST ORANGE.</li>
            <li>and I use this product that we hope you will make it available for a very long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m older and not into this look.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product because it came highly recommended.</li>
            <li>So I need to purchase a few more</li>
            <li>When it runs out, I&#x27;m not sure what I will do, but I&#x27;m grateful for what I have been able to find on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>It has been discontinued and no longer available in previous cosmetic departments.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to find the maybelline expert eyes dark brown pencil.</li>
            <li>Thanks form continuing to carry this product since none of my local stores carry it.</li>
            <li>I wish I would have ordered at least 2 or 3 more of these.</li>
            <li>The pencil is too soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought this product several times, I lost my eyebrows after chemo, and when they grew back very sparingly and white.  </li>
            <li>Maybelline has apparently discontinued it.</li>
            <li>(BTW, the colors available were black and dark brown which I use with gray hair or not)</li>

            <li> I ordered dark brown</li>
            <li> My only complaint was the delivery charge.</li>
            <li> But wow the price was approximately $38.00</li>
            <li> I mean, if you have red in your brows then</li>
            <li> I purchased three pencils, a little over$3., delivery was $18.</li>

            <li> I am not pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> It could have been placed in a small padded envelope and mailed for maybe $5.</li>
            <li> So sad that they discontinued making this eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li> Unhappy that they quit making it.  </li>
            <li> Was unhappy that it was discontinued.</li>
            <li> Yes I was desperate.  </li>
            <li> I am afraid I won&#x27;t find it soon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and was extremely disappointed when I couldn&#x27;t find it in any store.  </li>

            <li> The product was discontinued in stores and this was the only outlet for purchase of a product I have used for years..</li>
            <li> This product is okay, but used solely on eyebrows can produce an orangey brown color. Works well if you use to darken eyebrows and afterwards brush with an eyebrow powder. That gives you longevity of the pencil, and softness of the powder.</li>
            <li> Wish I could get more!!!!</li>
            <li> Matches my brows perfectly</li>
            <li> This pencil works great on my eyebrows. The texture is great and it stays on all day. The only reason why I didn&#x27;t give this a 5 star rating was because I ordered the dark brown, not wanting to get black because a solid black would be too dark. The brown ended up being a shade too light but it still worked out pretty well. I don&#x27;t use this as an eyeliner but as an eyebrow liner this works good.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for years, it works beautifully</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years. Always good.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for YEARS and all of a sudden, it&#x27;s gone???????????????  What are you all  thinking???????????</li>
            <li> If you are looking in despair for the Maybelline Expert Wear Brow pencil (that all of us love and can&#x27;t find or afford) check out buying in bulk through Walmart.  I just did that buying 8 pencils @ $4.97 each, for $39.76 plus tax, free shipping over $35, . . . .get this. . .total $42.55.  The pencils elsewhere are not cheap.  Why buy one for $15.00..  Check it out.  There&#x27;s always a way.  Don&#x27;t give up! :-)  (BTW, the colors available were black and dark brown which I use with gray hair or not)</li>
            <li> This pencil works well. It is easy to manage and doesn&#x27;t have to be sharpened like many other similar pencils.</li>

            <li> was not what I expected, color wise.</li>
            <li> It was just tooooo red. No bueno. I mean, if you have red in your brows then by all means GO FOR IT. But thia just was not for me at all</li>
            <li> Happy with this product.  Maybelline discontinued this.  So glad I got it here.</li>
            <li> Thanks form continuing to carry this product since none of my local stores carry it.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have ordered at least 2 or 3 more of these. cannot find these now for the price I paid for the 3 I received. So sad that they discontinued making this eyebrow pencil. It is the best one I have found and really like. I received these in good condition and fast delivery. Wish the seller had more of these to sell.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because it came highly recommended. I had to order from two different vendors because they did not have enough in stock. It work easily and does a great job and lasts and lasts and lasts!</li>
            <li> nice pencil, too light for my brow, so need to add black and then fill in with eyeshadow, so will need to take a much darker brown</li>
            <li> Great pencil they way they used to make them.  So glad to find this.</li>
            <li> This has always been a great product.  I wish it was still sold in stores.</li>
            <li> Unhappy that they quit making it.  Maybe they need to rethink their decision and bring it back.  If it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years.  Was unhappy that it was discontinued.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years.  It is truly one product that can&#x27;t be improved upon.  It goes on smoothly/easily and stays on without smearing, unlike a lot of eyeliners today.  Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  I wish they&#x27;d bring it back!</li>
            <li> This is an eyeliner I have used for years.  It has been discontinued and no longer available in previous cosmetic departments.  I was delighted to find these on Amazon.  I was willing to pay the elevated price because of the lack of availability otherwise.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and was extremely disappointed when I couldn&#x27;t find it in any store.  Finding it on Amazon was like a godsend for me.  So many of my friends and I use this product that we hope you will make it available for a very long time.</li>
            <li> WISH Maybelline would keep this line!!!  So disappointed they discontinued :(</li>
            <li> The only place I can find it . It is a great color for me and the only one I use .</li>
            <li> I bought this in dark brown and the color is more like RUST ORANGE. Who has ORANGE EYEBROWS!!!??? Threw out and will never buy again.</li>
            <li> I am not pleased with this product. I ordered dark brown but this pencil is red. Red. Red with a hint of brown.</li>
            <li> It is at the bottom of a drawer.  Where are you, brow and eyeliner?  I want to give you away.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this product daily; I get tired of going from store to store to see if it is in stock.  Amazon has taken the drudgery out of shopping for this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and now it is not available. they have replaced it with some gel type thing that I won&#x27;t use. I&#x27;m older and not into this look. right away I thought of Amazon and found it. Company that sent it was great. came quickly and packaged very  nicely. Thank heaven for amazon</li>
            <li> it is just what i ordered- the stores have discontined selling it-I was so happy to receive it-I WILL ORDER ITY T AGAIN FOR SURE&lt;br /&gt;AGAIN</li>
            <li> This product is so much better than the regular pencil brow liner. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be offered in the stores any longer... What a mistake by Maybelline. After a couple of uses of the regular pencil it is never quite the same . Sharpening it is never truly effective.</li>
            <li> So glad to have found it, cant fine it the stores any more.Wish we were given more notice that it was not going to be carried in stores any longer</li>
            <li> I was happy to find the eyeliner I needed since it has been a discontinued product.  Received it by mail quickly.  very pleased - thank you!</li>
            <li> This eye &amp; brow pencil is perfect for my eye brows, don&#x27;t use it for my eyes. Love it, love it.</li>
            <li> I totally love this product.....I have several put away....(without sharpener). But what I am looking for is this product WITH the sharpener....the only one that I have in my bag has the sharpener.  So I need to purchase a few more but I need current sellers that have this product with the SHARPENER.</li>
            <li> Love the control and coloring of this brow liner. I have used it for years and got this a great price.</li>
            <li> BEST PENCIL EVER-GREAT CONTROL IN DRAWING AND YOU DON&#x27;T NEED A SHARPENER WITH YOU-  CAN&#x27;T UNDERSTAND WHY MAYBELLINE WOULD DISCONTINUE &amp; REPLACE WITH AN INFERIOR PENCIL.&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU AMAZON/ CAPTAIN NAN FOR HAVING THEM IN STOCK!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product several times, I lost my eyebrows after chemo, and when they grew back very sparingly and white.  So I had to remedy this by using a brow liner.  And believe me I have tried numerous liners but this is the best one, I don&#x27;t have to worry about sharpening them.  It goes on smoothly and covers the white hair and those balding area..  Goes on smooth, nice soft color and stays on all day.  So I will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> I chose to rate this 5 stars because this product has been discontinued, yet Maybelline has not come up with a product equivalent to this one. Fortunately, I was able to find two vendors who had the product and I bought all that they had listed. After contacting Maybelline, and finding out that they do not plan to reinstate this product, I have been searching everywhere to find any that are left. Thankfully, Amazon had two listings. When it runs out, I&#x27;m not sure what I will do, but I&#x27;m grateful for what I have been able to find on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for maybe 10 years. Now it&#x27;s been discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;Well I search Amazon and found it. But wow the price was approximately $38.00&lt;br /&gt;for three. Yes I was desperate.  I later was able to purchased them for $2.00 each&lt;br /&gt;yes that&#x27;s correct $2.00 each. I purchased 10 of them and going to purchase more.&lt;br /&gt;If the seller wants to know where I got them at that price she may email me.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find the maybelline expert eyes dark brown pencil. Maybelline has apparently discontinued it. I really dislike the product they put in it&#x27;s place. The pencil is too soft. I am going to order more of this product while it is still available. My only complaint was the delivery charge. I purchased three pencils, a little over$3., delivery was $18. It could have been placed in a small padded envelope and mailed for maybe $5. Doesn&#x27;t matter, if I can get more, I will buy them. I am afraid I won&#x27;t find it soon.</li>
