    <ol>
            <li>This stuff is great!</li>
            <li>I was unsure that it would work when I ordered it, but I am very happy with its performance.  </li>
            <li>This is the best deodorant.</li>
            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any B.O. after wearing, which is great!  </li>
            <li>give this 4 stars because it still doesn&#x27;t work quite as well as store brand aluminum type deodorants, but it&#x27;s been the best performing non-aluminum deodorant I&#x27;ve tried yet.</li>
            <li>The best organic - odor be gone-</li>
            <li>Until now..this product is amazing!!  </li>
            <li>Ozone layer deodorant is great.  </li>
            <li>like I knew it would be great coverage.  </li>
            <li>This is a bargain and it works great.  </li>
            <li>Company was great, but product is no miracle.</li>
            <li>Works great not the most delightful scent at application, but keeps the body odor away.</li>
            <li>I just re-applied and was good to go again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Love this deoderant !</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s better then aluminum in your body !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried making my own</li>
            <li>This one gets me through the day smelling like a rose--</li>
            <li>This is the greatest Natural Deodorant I have found.</li>
            <li>But so far, so good!!</li>
            <li>Mostly I like that it gets good scores on EWG, is cruelty free, and is made in America!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it and will buy it again.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I love love love love love this product.  </li>
            <li>A friend told me about this product and was able to snag me one through a promotion.  </li>
            <li>If I could give this product more than 5 stars I would.  </li>
            <li>This deodorant is okay.</li>
            <li>and please don&#x27;t ever stop making this product:)</li>
            <li>When I came to realize the health risks associated with many others, on top of the fact that they stain clothing, I began to seek out healthier options.</li>
            <li>I found out that the antiperspirant was throwing my body&#x27;s perspiration out of balance and causing me to sweat more.</li>
            <li>It controls sweat in a healthy way (I haven&#x27;t had one issue).</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;d prefer a more floral or fruity scent, this does do the job</li>
            <li>and I feel better knowing there is no aluminum in the product.</li>
            <li>This worked for me better than &amp;</li>
            <li>I mostly just smell the shea butter.  </li>
            <li>I find myself reapplying many times throughout the day but still worrying that I&#x27;m stinky.</li>
            <li>Need something more gentler.</li>
            <li>Bought my first one as a sample and loved it.</li>
            <li>All in all, a good product, and a great replacement for our previous deodorant.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t stink one second, and then WOAH MAMA (not in a good way)!</li>
            <li>Smell is way too strong.</li>
            <li>It only uses two natural ingredients, which are very healthy and good for your skin by themselves, and the ozone treatment makes a huge difference with them; also, it actually cleans, and is anti-bacterial, on top of being a great deodorant!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>Coconut might be the most mild.</li>
            <li>It is aluminum free, triclosan free, chemical free.  </li>
            <li>Excellent delivery, lovely product, would definitely recommend to anyone who is trying to steer clear of all the toxins and poisons in EVERYTHING</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy with this product that not only will I continue to use it</li>
            <li># free of all the junk deorderants......</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used the coconut cream fragrance, and it smells great; not offensive at all.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re still testing, but after a few weeks, these seem to work great!</li>
            <li>The scents are great and they never leave a white mark at all.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>On a warm day I did have to reapply in the afternoon, but it was still more effective than every other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant I have used.  </li>
            <li>I emailed for the flavor change immediately after placing my order, and I&#x27;m glad I acted quickly because this company is quick on the draw.</li>
            <li>I finally decided to do extensive research online and find the best product for my needs once and for all; I am glad</li>
            <li>fragrance is super light.</li>
            <li>The product smells clean...</li>
            <li>It would still stain clothes (not as much) and irritate the skin some (I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t go the prescription route).</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good thingsabout this product.</li>
            <li>I thank you to this company for doing such good work ^-^</li>
            <li>I hope to see many more products like this in the future for all of our needs; because, this one nailed it.</li>
            <li>It seems like body odor goes from 0-60 really quickly.</li>
            <li>In very hot weather, I think I may have an issue.  </li>
            <li>Washed off easily, didn&#x27;t get on my clothes, controlled odor and wetness very well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased countless and even made my own.  </li>
            <li>As I stated earlier, I received this item through a promotion in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>It has a strong smell if you apply too much of it, which I did at first.</li>
            <li>It pretty much gets a perfect rating from them, and they can be tough critics for ingredients.</li>
            <li>so glad I stumbled upon this in the Skin Deep Cosmetics Database (ewg dot org)</li>
            <li>They mostly smell the same.</li>
            <li>I like that it&#x27;s cheaper though, and works fine for my young daughter who does not sweat much.</li>
            <li>Kind of an odd citrus smell.</li>
            <li>Also, the initial after-application scent is a bit strong, but goes away after a while.</li>
            <li>My armpit odor is like pure vinegar and this has worked all damn day.</li>
            <li>I do have to use them more frequently (once a day) than the aluminum-containing deodorant we&#x27;d used just prior, but once a day certainly isn&#x27;t a deal-breaker.</li>
            <li>Much healthier than antiperspirant with all the chemicals.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much Ozone Layer</li>
            <li>really wanted it to</li>
            <li>It works well, but the smell of the oxygen is too much and overpowers my senses.</li>
            <li>Better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>the cost may look like a lot to some, but it is quite reasonable.</li>
            <li>This really works for me the whole day.</li>
            <li>Really pleasant, subtle scents and no odor.</li>
            <li>With having only 3 natural ingredients, I feel safe letting my child use it as well.</li>
            <li>The smell of each one is so fresh and so easy to apply--one stroke up and one stroke down under each arm</li>
            <li>Works better than some other brands I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>I like the ingredients and dispenser and it works fine for a while, but after using a different natural deodorant called &amp;#34;Green Tidings,&amp;#34; this one does not compare.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I ordered despite the odd reviews</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands of &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; deodorant (such as LaVanila) that have more ingredients but are less effective.</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m not exactly a fan of the scents of the deodorant, it works better than some natural ones that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I have not had much luck with natural deodorants working.  </li>
            <li>Does not go on as smooth and not long lasting.</li>
            <li>and my underarm is now very sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I would actually prefer the fragrance to be a little stronger, but it&#x27;s probably better for you to not have so much.</li>
            <li>It smells so fresh, like air, actually exactly like ozone with a slight fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It was two or three dollars more than name brand; however, one stick lasts three times longer than other products, so it is actually cheaper.</li>
            <li>As far as working out and sweating more than usual</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for years for a natural deodorant that works.  </li>
            <li>Finally a natural deodorant that works.</li>
            <li>I have tried every natural deodorant i could find under the sun.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a ton of natural,  organic,  </li>
            <li>I was also under the impression, from using antiperspirant products since I was young, that I had a sweating disorder.</li>
            <li>But less of it still works the whole day and does not smell as much.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to baking soda, which is in the vast majority of natural deodorants, so I gave this a shot.  </li>
            <li>I laughed so hard when I got the card with it that said you can skip a shower, but they are not playing!!!  </li>
            <li>did.&lt;br /&gt;This seemed to be a fairly small business, so there wasn&#x27;t information and reviews all over the place (which I hope will change, because this product should be everywhere), but the information and reviews I could find were very helpful, and 100% positive from everyone.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that this product is made of natural ingredients, but it doesn&#x27;t cover up my BO when I work out or for the entire day.</li>
            <li>Does t keep me fresh but for a few hours</li>
            <li>The deodorant seemed to work pretty well for a few days, but now it seems to only work as well as any other hippy deodorant--not very well.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Does nothing for me. After application I sweated profusely. Note, my body chemistry differs from everyone else. I will not purchase again.....moving on.</li>
            <li> Excellent delivery, lovely product, would definitely recommend to anyone who is trying to steer clear of all the toxins and poisons in EVERYTHING</li>
            <li> This is the greatest Natural Deodorant I have found. It works is all that I can say and doesn&#x27;t break me out. Love it and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I&#x27;ve used it for the past week and it has significantly cut down on the underarm irritation I&#x27;ve been experiencing due to other products. Really pleasant, subtle scents and no odor. I&#x27;ve tried other brands of &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; deodorant (such as LaVanila) that have more ingredients but are less effective. I&#x27;m sold and will be a repeat customer--so glad I stumbled upon this in the Skin Deep Cosmetics Database (ewg dot org). It pretty much gets a perfect rating from them, and they can be tough critics for ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for years for a natural deodorant that works.  I&#x27;ve purchased countless and even made my own.  This product is a MUST have!  Even with the heat and humidity in the South, this deodorant holds up.  With having only 3 natural ingredients, I feel safe letting my child use it as well.</li>
            <li> Finally a natural deodorant that works. Love it</li>
            <li> Too sticky leaves a film on my skin, I smell like an ozone air cleaner. Does t keep me fresh but for a few hours</li>
            <li> Ozone layer deodorant is great.  I was unsure that it would work when I ordered it, but I am very happy with its performance.  My husband has had a few days that he has had to reapply after work, but that does the trick.  It takes a few days for your body to adjust to it, so give it a chance.  I will be ordering again! Much healthier than antiperspirant with all the chemicals.</li>
            <li> I love love love love love this product.  I was using Tom&#x27;s deodorant for a while now. Sometimes it works, sometimes it fails me.  I have tried every natural deodorant i could find under the sun. NOTHING was working at the rate those big brand deodorants used to work for me. I refuse to go back though.  A friend told me about this product and was able to snag me one through a promotion.  I am blown away by how well this deodorant works for me.  I have been using it since Tuesday (about 4 days now), and I have yet to smell anything. I went 2 days without a shower, just reapplied the deodorant.  I laughed so hard when I got the card with it that said you can skip a shower, but they are not playing!!!  I don&#x27;t even think Secret protected me that well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This deodorant feels thick going on, but not in a bad way. It actually felt reassuring, like I knew it would be great coverage.  It didn&#x27;t burn or itch. It did not foam up like Tom&#x27;s does at times (seriously wtheck is that about?!?). It is aluminum free, triclosan free, chemical free.  It does not appear to have ruined any of my shirts either, another added bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have every intention of buying the 3 pack next week on pay day. I&#x27;ve paid more for a single deodorant than what Ozone Layer costs, and have been thoroughly disappointed. This is a bargain and it works great.  If I could give this product more than 5 stars I would.  As I stated earlier, I received this item through a promotion in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is okay. I like the ingredients and dispenser and it works fine for a while, but after using a different natural deodorant called &amp;#34;Green Tidings,&amp;#34; this one does not compare. Does not go on as smooth and not long lasting. I like that it&#x27;s cheaper though, and works fine for my young daughter who does not sweat much. Also, the scents were different than expected. Kind of an odd citrus smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having issues with under arm odor on and off for years.  When I&#x27;m on a stinky streak it&#x27;s so bad that I am ruining shirts!  The bo is just so strong that it will not wash out of my clothes :( I ditched the toxic deodorants awhile ago.  I&#x27;ve tried making my own but I could never get them to smell pleasent.  I have not had much luck with natural deodorants working.  Until now..this product is amazing!!  It smells so fresh, like air, actually exactly like ozone with a slight fragrance.  And the mind blowing part is the ingredient list or I guess the lack of unnecessary ingredients.  I&#x27;m so happy with this product that not only will I continue to use it but my 11yo daughter (she got my sweat glands in the gene exchange) will also be using it!  Thank you so much Ozone Layer and please don&#x27;t ever stop making this product:)</li>
            <li> After using it two weeks I give up.  Beeswax base smells more like tallow. Very difficult to apply and works for about 2 hours.  Got it to use while undergoing radiation treatment and my underarm is now very sensitive.  Feel like I&#x27;d have to melt this thing and apply it with a butter knife to get it to spread</li>
            <li> Works great not the most delightful scent at application, but keeps the body odor away. My son uses it and works construction and he loves this deodorant. I like that it only has 3 ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a ton of natural,  organic,  # free of all the junk deorderants...... this one didn&#x27;t work for me, at all....... disappointing- residual at the price-point.  Won&#x27;t buy again or recommend.</li>
            <li> I actually like this deodorant. As far as working out and sweating more than usual I find it doesn&#x27;t hold up enough but to just run errands and be around the house it&#x27;s perfectly fine. Works better than some other brands I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> This is the best deodorant. I&#x27;ve tried them all. When I came to realize the health risks associated with many others, on top of the fact that they stain clothing, I began to seek out healthier options. I was also under the impression, from using antiperspirant products since I was young, that I had a sweating disorder. I would sweat through the product, and sweat like crazy if i didn&#x27;t use it. I found out that the antiperspirant was throwing my body&#x27;s perspiration out of balance and causing me to sweat more. After a few months, I began to sweat a normal amount with regular deodorant. It would still stain clothes (not as much) and irritate the skin some (I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t go the prescription route). When I found out about the harmful chemicals going into all of our products, I began to do research and altered all the products that I use. Some were expensive and didn&#x27;t work that well. Tom&#x27;s worked and was a tolerable price, but would let odor through, and had to be reapplied. I finally decided to do extensive research online and find the best product for my needs once and for all; I am glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;This seemed to be a fairly small business, so there wasn&#x27;t information and reviews all over the place (which I hope will change, because this product should be everywhere), but the information and reviews I could find were very helpful, and 100% positive from everyone. It was two or three dollars more than name brand; however, one stick lasts three times longer than other products, so it is actually cheaper. You only need a small amount. It controls sweat in a healthy way (I haven&#x27;t had one issue). It lasts all day. I&#x27;ve only used the coconut cream fragrance, and it smells great; not offensive at all. It only uses two natural ingredients, which are very healthy and good for your skin by themselves, and the ozone treatment makes a huge difference with them; also, it actually cleans, and is anti-bacterial, on top of being a great deodorant! I can&#x27;t say enough good thingsabout this product. I hope to see many more products like this in the future for all of our needs; because, this one nailed it. I thank you to this company for doing such good work ^-^</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me...really wanted it to</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re still testing, but after a few weeks, these seem to work great! I do have to use them more frequently (once a day) than the aluminum-containing deodorant we&#x27;d used just prior, but once a day certainly isn&#x27;t a deal-breaker. The deodorant seems a bit dry when you put it on, but there&#x27;s no problem with it. Also, the initial after-application scent is a bit strong, but goes away after a while. All in all, a good product, and a great replacement for our previous deodorant.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;d prefer a more floral or fruity scent, this does do the job and I feel better knowing there is no aluminum in the product.</li>
            <li> Smell is way too strong. They mostly smell the same. Coconut might be the most mild. Feels sticky when on.</li>
            <li> It works well, but the smell of the oxygen is too much and overpowers my senses.</li>
            <li> Love this deoderant ! Yes it has and ozone smell but it&#x27;s better then aluminum in your body ! I will buy it again and again !</li>
            <li> I like the fact that this product is made of natural ingredients, but it doesn&#x27;t cover up my BO when I work out or for the entire day.</li>
            <li> No worth the money, this product smells like Africa Shea Butter, very expensive for something that smells bad. I couldn&#x27;t put it on my body. I can not say that it will or will not make you itchy. I say save your money and pass on this product.</li>
            <li> Better than I expected.  On a warm day I did have to reapply in the afternoon, but it was still more effective than every other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant I have used.  Washed off easily, didn&#x27;t get on my clothes, controlled odor and wetness very well.  I am sensitive to baking soda, which is in the vast majority of natural deodorants, so I gave this a shot.  I will definitely buy  again and again.  It also lasts for a long time, so the cost may look like a lot to some, but it is quite reasonable.</li>
            <li> Works great! Didn&#x27;t irritate my skin either</li>
            <li> This really works for me the whole day. It has a strong smell if you apply too much of it, which I did at first. But less of it still works the whole day and does not smell as much. This worked for me better than &amp;#34;Tom&#x27;s of Maine&amp;#34;, which I still prefer for half a day. Will buy again unless find a competitive product.</li>
            <li> I just started to use this recently and I like it!  The scents are great and they never leave a white mark at all.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any B.O. after wearing, which is great!  In very hot weather, I think I may have an issue.  But so far, so good!!</li>
            <li> There is a weird odor that overwhelms me when I wear any of the scents that I received. Just not a fan.mdoes treat/cover any anaerobic bacteria smell though</li>
            <li> I gave it two stars only based on the smell of the mint eucalyptus. Doesn&#x27;t smell like either. actually i smell like a rancid cookie.&lt;br /&gt;Not for me.</li>
            <li> I got lavender, coconut, and lemongrass. I emailed for the flavor change immediately after placing my order, and I&#x27;m glad I acted quickly because this company is quick on the draw. I got a shipping notice minutes after the order, but everything was received as requested and well ahead of schedule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is super light. I mostly just smell the shea butter.  I would actually prefer the fragrance to be a little stronger, but it&#x27;s probably better for you to not have so much. I have a desk job and other hippy deodorants have stopped working by just after lunchtime. This one gets me through the day smelling like a rose--well, maybe a coconut.  On a few days where I was outside and sweating, it did start to fail a little, but not bad. I just re-applied and was good to go again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this 4 stars because it still doesn&#x27;t work quite as well as store brand aluminum type deodorants, but it&#x27;s been the best performing non-aluminum deodorant I&#x27;ve tried yet. I&#x27;m very pleased with it. Mostly I like that it gets good scores on EWG, is cruelty free, and is made in America!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated to 3 stars: The deodorant seemed to work pretty well for a few days, but now it seems to only work as well as any other hippy deodorant--not very well. It seems like body odor goes from 0-60 really quickly. You don&#x27;t stink one second, and then WOAH MAMA (not in a good way)! I find myself reapplying many times throughout the day but still worrying that I&#x27;m stinky. Company was great, but product is no miracle.</li>
            <li> Organic deodorants with baking soda give me severe itchy rash. I&#x27;m trying organic because i need a deodorant that works on odor. This was the only deodorant without baking soda or coconut oil; both have negatives(rash.stain clothes). I can not believe these reviews!! My armpit odor is like pure vinegar and this has worked all damn day. Maybe they aren&#x27;t applying enough product? Maybe they should apply a few times each day, for a few days? The product smells clean...so again..what is up with the reviews? People want to know if it works on odor and the answer is YES!! The best organic - odor be gone- no rash- deodorant on Amazon. I&#x27;m glad I ordered despite the odd reviews otherwise I would still be looking.</li>
            <li> i dont like the smell</li>
            <li> Bought my first one as a sample and loved it. The smell of each one is so fresh and so easy to apply--one stroke up and one stroke down under each arm and that is all that is needed.</li>
            <li> I like it and it keeps me dry, my mom and sisters are using it to.</li>
            <li> It has a very strong and unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly. Very hard on the armpit. Need something more gentler.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of this product.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m not exactly a fan of the scents of the deodorant, it works better than some natural ones that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
