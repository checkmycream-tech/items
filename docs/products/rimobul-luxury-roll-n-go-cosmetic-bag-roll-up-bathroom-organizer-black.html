    <ol>
            <li>Perfect for travel or gym visits.</li>
            <li>Very happy.</li>
            <li>, it is not the best quality on the world, but you are not paying for it either.</li>
            <li>Perfect for traveling!</li>
            <li>Great for storing all my cables and chargers!</li>
            <li>NOT in ideal condition</li>
            <li>She loved it!  </li>
            <li>Works great for getting everything in one place.</li>
            <li>used for vacation, great storage for 2 people</li>
            <li>love it perfect size for travel</li>
            <li>If you feel like digging, it&#x27;s a good deal...</li>
            <li>But for about 12 bucks, it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>Very cheap!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cute travel bag but the quality isn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li>Great quality, not made cheap.</li>
            <li>Its nice.</li>
            <li>I love that it rolls up</li>
            <li>This is a nice peace but understand it&#x27;s CHEAP in construction and materials.  </li>
            <li>Had the zippers been on top of each section you could hang it and use it instead of mostly laying it on a counter, sink or table.&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;hook&amp;#34; to hang</li>
            <li>Super cute!</li>
            <li>Love the fact that I can easily see everything inside each compartment.</li>
            <li>All my cosmetics fit better than in most travel/cosmetic bags I used.  </li>
            <li>Makes it easy to find and keep track of all your make up and brushes.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and fits well inside suitcase or gym bag.</li>
            <li>I barely filled the pouch and the zipper is already getting misaligned.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made.</li>
            <li>cuz they don&#x27;t fit in here...</li>
            <li>:) I love it so much for my bug out bag that I&#x27;m getting another one for my husband&#x27;s bag.</li>
            <li>Worth it!</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly!!!</li>
            <li>and it is worth it.</li>
            <li>well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Has nice print like more expensive designer travel bags, pleased with that,  </li>
            <li>The zipper broke on my first trip with it.</li>
            <li>Overall am pleased with the bag....</li>
            <li>Had a funny smell upon opening up, like vinyl that had been stored for a while (trip over on shipping container from China)  </li>
            <li>This bag held a lot but one of the zippers broke after the first use</li>
            <li>better for smaller items.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Once I accordion folded it, it fit a whole ton of stuff and still closed just fine.</li>
            <li>It holds a decent amount of makeup if you pack it right, but there&#x27;s no way to close the thing once you have your makeup in it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for a makeup case and to hold small items but not for a toiletry bag.</li>
            <li>I thought the back would be more sturdy to make the square-like shape after rolled-up, but its kind of wonky.</li>
            <li>Be ready to have it</li>
            <li>you ended up with a pile of products on top of each other and no way to separate.  </li>
            <li>so I can have more room in my suitcase for other items.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of those classic by mail cases.  </li>
            <li>better off putting little containers in here like travel bottles.</li>
            <li>The zipper is cheap, but this little thing works really well.</li>
            <li>Looks small, but u can fit soooo much stuff in it!</li>
            <li>Not as large as the measurements say (bought 2 smaller ones for $6 from another Amazon seller and they were the exact size as this $13 one that stated it was larger).</li>
            <li>works as designed but feels a little cheap...</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous little case and</li>
            <li>Okay, I read all kinds of negative reviews on this bag before I bought it, but still gave it a try.</li>
            <li>Way too small and when I got everything to fit, it wouldn&#x27;t roll up.</li>
            <li>The item was recieved as expected, it was fast.</li>
            <li>One week barely using it and the sown on part of one of the zipper is already coming off.</li>
            <li>The bags are small and when filled the item does not roll closed.</li>

            <li> The bags are small and when filled the item does not roll closed.</li>
            <li> Just wanted to put a positive review in here for the skeptical buyers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - for those who are claiming they can&#x27;t roll it up once stuff is inside, I had the same problem too - for about the first 5 minutes I had it.</li>
            <li> I spent the extra money and bought the Mary Kay roll up bag</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just one long compartment.  </li>
            <li> Case was smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> the snaps don&#x27;t snap tight enough , so it may pop open, but I like  it well enough to keep it, even though may have to tie it up with ribbon to keep it closed, not sure yet.  </li>
            <li> Not very roll up-like.</li>
            <li> other issue I have is the zippers are down the CENTER of the plastic see-threw sections, thus it has to be laid flat to get value out of taking things in and out.  </li>
            <li> Plenty of space for my makeup and other stuff.</li>
            <li> The items shown are very small compared to what you can actually put in there.</li>
            <li> Zipper broke,very cheap :( 0 rating</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Too small.</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> Not what was described or at least malfunctioned.  </li>
            <li> , I place some small items in it and one zipper breaks !</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> My zippers aren&#x27;t broken, BUT one of the plastic compartments did come away from one of the seams - to me</li>
            <li> The sewing quality is poor.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE</li>

            <li> Perfect for travel or gym visits. Love the fact that I can easily see everything inside each compartment. Easy to clean and fits well inside suitcase or gym bag. All my cosmetics fit better than in most travel/cosmetic bags I used.  Very happy.</li>
            <li> works as designed but feels a little cheap...</li>
            <li> Flimsy. Seriously. The plastic pieces ripped from the fabric seams the very same day that I bought this bag because I used it immediately. It holds a decent amount of makeup if you pack it right, but there&#x27;s no way to close the thing once you have your makeup in it. The flap just sits there. It&#x27;s not sturdy at all.</li>
            <li> The item was recieved as expected, it was fast. I like the bag, it is not the best quality on the world, but you are not paying for it either. Plenty of space for my makeup and other stuff.</li>
            <li> Very cheap! The zipper broke on my first trip with it. The bags are small and when filled the item does not roll closed. I spent the extra money and bought the Mary Kay roll up bag and it is worth it.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous little case and well worth the money. I recommend it highly!!!</li>
            <li> Works great for getting everything in one place.</li>
            <li> Not what was described or at least malfunctioned.  All the zippers worked but they were not separate compartments....you ended up with a pile of products on top of each other and no way to separate.  If you feel like digging, it&#x27;s a good deal...but it states separate compartments and it&#x27;s just one long compartment.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cute travel bag but the quality isn&#x27;t great. I barely filled the pouch and the zipper is already getting misaligned.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my wife.  She loved it!  Very big and plenty of space to store things.</li>
            <li> used for vacation, great storage for 2 people</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Cheaply made. Too small. Damaged with ripped plastic pocket</li>
            <li> Way too small and when I got everything to fit, it wouldn&#x27;t roll up. Pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> love it perfect size for travel</li>
            <li> Broke in one use! HORRIBLE DO NOT BUY!!&lt;br /&gt;NICE FOLD BUT ZIPPERS FELL OFF</li>
            <li> It was for the wife so no idea</li>
            <li> Okay, I read all kinds of negative reviews on this bag before I bought it, but still gave it a try. My zippers aren&#x27;t broken, BUT one of the plastic compartments did come away from one of the seams - to me it wasn&#x27;t a big deal because I&#x27;m using this for my survival bag, not make-up and stuff. So I just duck-taped it and went on my way :) I love it so much for my bug out bag that I&#x27;m getting another one for my husband&#x27;s bag. Just wanted to put a positive review in here for the skeptical buyers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - for those who are claiming they can&#x27;t roll it up once stuff is inside, I had the same problem too - for about the first 5 minutes I had it. It was because I was trying to &amp;#34;roll&amp;#34; it up instead of &amp;#34;accordion fold&amp;#34; it like it&#x27;s supposed to be. Once I accordion folded it, it fit a whole ton of stuff and still closed just fine.</li>
            <li> Overall am pleased with the bag....the snaps don&#x27;t snap tight enough , so it may pop open, but I like  it well enough to keep it, even though may have to tie it up with ribbon to keep it closed, not sure yet.  Had a funny smell upon opening up, like vinyl that had been stored for a while (trip over on shipping container from China)  Has nice print like more expensive designer travel bags, pleased with that,  overall I think I am going to like it.</li>
            <li> Super cute! Just as described, would buy again</li>
            <li> This bag held a lot but one of the zippers broke after the first use</li>
            <li> Bought this for my traveling friend and she loves it. Looks small, but u can fit soooo much stuff in it! Worth it!</li>
            <li> Perfect for traveling! It&#x27;s everything I&#x27;ve been looking for. I use it everywhere I go! Great quality, not made cheap. I love that it rolls up so I can have more room in my suitcase for other items.</li>
            <li> Case was smaller than I expected. I may end up buying a larger travel case.  I have not had a chance to use it yet but i&#x27;m already worried about the durability.</li>
            <li> Its nice. I might another in the future. Makes it easy to find and keep track of all your make up and brushes.</li>
            <li> Not big enough to put bottles of shampoo or conditioner in... better off putting little containers in here like travel bottles. Not very roll up-like. I thought the back would be more sturdy to make the square-like shape after rolled-up, but its kind of wonky. better for smaller items. I am putting my shampoo and conditioner in another bag cuz they don&#x27;t fit in here...</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t as big as it appears to be online.  The items shown are very small compared to what you can actually put in there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of those classic by mail cases.  I get the package, I open it up, I place some small items in it and one zipper breaks ! The hassle of returning and refunds etc. begins.  This is a nice peace but understand it&#x27;s CHEAP in construction and materials.  Be ready to have it NOT in ideal condition soon after you start using it.&lt;br /&gt;The other issue I have is the zippers are down the CENTER of the plastic see-threw sections, thus it has to be laid flat to get value out of taking things in and out.  Had the zippers been on top of each section you could hang it and use it instead of mostly laying it on a counter, sink or table.&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;hook&amp;#34; to hang it is just a loop of not to sturdy cloth, not a hook.  Thus to hang it you need a peg type of holder to put it on and will not go around a hotel bathroom towel rack no matter how small.&lt;br /&gt;Best of luck.</li>
            <li> The sewing quality is poor. One week barely using it and the sown on part of one of the zipper is already coming off. But for about 12 bucks, it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Did not represent what I was looking for in a travel cosmetic bag</li>
            <li> smaller than it looks,I prefer to buy the bigger sizes</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> A zipper already broke otherwise I did like it. Only got to use once.</li>
            <li> Great for storing all my cables and chargers! The zipper is cheap, but this little thing works really well.</li>
            <li> Zipper broke,very cheap :( 0 rating</li>
            <li> Not as large as the measurements say (bought 2 smaller ones for $6 from another Amazon seller and they were the exact size as this $13 one that stated it was larger). The magnet closure does not hold. Junk.</li>
            <li> This bag CANNOT hold everything it claims. It&#x27;s good for a makeup case and to hold small items but not for a toiletry bag.</li>
