    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Its great!</li>
            <li>Made my teeth feel awesome.</li>
            <li>Have been using this for almost a month and its great.</li>
            <li>My breath has a nice neutral smell as well!</li>
            <li>but it is part of a successful oral hygiene program that doesn&#x27;t include dentists.</li>
            <li>Another good thing is the holder it comes with, so you can just toss it in your purse and have your toothbrush with you everywhere.</li>
            <li>not so good but whitens and cleans teeth well.</li>
            <li>I am a dental hygienist and have seen the results of using a Miswak Peelu in our patients from Africa and it is amazing.</li>
            <li>So you kind of need to have a sink handy, or some water and a place to spit it out.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s kind of</li>
            <li>Super happy to find a way to do without it.</li>
            <li>This is a welcome addition, first i blot, then i rub the bristles of the miswak over my teeth and gums (after i&#x27;ve chewed it to make bristles)</li>
            <li>My Miswak arrived before it was even supposed to, and not only did it arrive in a timely manner, the product it&#x27;s awesome too!</li>
            <li>got dramatically better.</li>
            <li>and they said my teeth we healthy and no plaque.</li>
            <li>This is a great product which is effective, healthy and is well worth very penny!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to use these sticks!  </li>
            <li>I could compare it to stone ground mustard (really strong) but did cease as I continued.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use (just peel bark away and chew lightly to create bristles) and so compact that it easily fits in your purse.</li>
            <li>They felt clean and smooth for many hours.</li>
            <li>This it&#x27;s my first time using the Miswak, and after I brushed with it, my mouth had this great tingly refreshed feeling, LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s kind of like if every scent of incense in the world was living in an old fishtank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The little case is great, fits the Miswak perfectly and even has little breathable holes so your Miswak doesn&#x27;t get mouldy/dry out!</li>
            <li>good things are, they really leave your teeth feeling clean, and they are convenient because you don&#x27;t need to be directly in front of a sink to brush your teeth.</li>
            <li>I could feel how clean my teeth were after the first use of this .</li>
            <li>you really have to be a cheap ass if you dont try this for that price</li>
            <li>but it worth the taste.</li>
            <li>The miswak is gentle and leaves your teeth feeling really clean.</li>
            <li>Arrived yesterday- pretty speedy.</li>
            <li>The first time I have tried this or like item.  </li>
            <li>An easy way to make my mouth feel clean w/o toothpaste and mess.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really put my finger on the smell..</li>
            <li>It still works, I just find that I have to brush my teeth for much longer.</li>
            <li>I used them for about a week, but I really didn&#x27;t like them.  </li>
            <li>Definitely a very pungent smell upon opening them.</li>
            <li>wat i did was crush it with my teeth and use the liquid like a mouth wash although it really didn&#x27;t taste</li>
            <li>so well i really had to do it again</li>
            <li>I really like my Miswak Peelu oral care instrument.</li>
            <li>and my teeth actually feels squeaky clean</li>
            <li>Maybe someday i&#x27;ll be confident enough to stop blotting and only use the miswak.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall though I am pleasantly surprised with the miswak and have pretty much replaced the normal toothbrush completely.</li>
            <li>However, I have found that little bristles will often break off into your mouth, and it&#x27;s better to rinse them all out.</li>
            <li>Given this is my first time purchasing the product in general</li>
            <li>I have yet to open up a new package to see if the smell is better, but what I did was dry the stick out</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li>I just haven&#x27;t gotten that far yet.</li>
            <li>but i only started using this tonight and quite frankly it works really well ,</li>
            <li>There are good and bad things about this brand.&lt;br</li>

            <li> There are good and bad things about this brand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I scraped off the outer bark and it was a bit hard to chew on because of taste at first-</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t all down to this natural tooth brush</li>
            <li> People who haven&#x27;t had a professional cleaning in their entire life hardly have any calculus nor even any gingivitis.</li>
            <li> (and I wet the bristles before I brush my teeth</li>

            <li> so I don&#x27;t have a reference for comparison, but I was not aware that it would smell like this.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give it a 5 because I just don&#x27;t care for the taste &amp; the little fibers that come off while you chew it.  </li>
            <li> I ordered these for a few reasons.</li>
            <li> so its not so hard to use</li>
            <li> I never liked using toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Have only opened one, but did not have an unpleasant odor as others have been reported to do.</li>
            <li> It is not too bad though since I usually do it while I&#x27;m doing something else, like reading or watching a movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are very thin sticks.</li>
            <li> bad thing about this brand of miswak is the smell.</li>
            <li> My son declined to use it to help him stop smoking. :-(</li>
            <li> I think they are terrible.</li>

            <li> There are good and bad things about this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good things are, they really leave your teeth feeling clean, and they are convenient because you don&#x27;t need to be directly in front of a sink to brush your teeth. However, I have found that little bristles will often break off into your mouth, and it&#x27;s better to rinse them all out. So you kind of need to have a sink handy, or some water and a place to spit it out. Another good thing is the holder it comes with, so you can just toss it in your purse and have your toothbrush with you everywhere. Although you should make an effort to rinse the bristles off after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad thing about this brand of miswak is the smell. Given this is my first time purchasing the product in general so I don&#x27;t have a reference for comparison, but I was not aware that it would smell like this. It was so pungent that I initially thought it had gone rancid. I have yet to open up a new package to see if the smell is better, but what I did was dry the stick out so its not so hard to use (and I wet the bristles before I brush my teeth so they aren&#x27;t too rough). I can&#x27;t really put my finger on the smell.. it&#x27;s kind of like if every scent of incense in the world was living in an old fishtank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another downside is the size of the stick. They are very thin sticks. So it&#x27;s kind of like you are trying to brush your teeth with a toothbrush that only has 20 bristles. It still works, I just find that I have to brush my teeth for much longer. It is not too bad though since I usually do it while I&#x27;m doing something else, like reading or watching a movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall though I am pleasantly surprised with the miswak and have pretty much replaced the normal toothbrush completely. I find it to be too aggressive for my teeth now. The miswak is gentle and leaves your teeth feeling really clean. And it&#x27;s natural. I never liked using toothpaste. It just always felt like it was eating away at the enamel on my teeth. Super happy to find a way to do without it.</li>
            <li> Did not like the flavor. Hope there&#x27;s a way to return 4/5 of the sticks!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t gotten used to the taste of it.. and the bristle come off when you use it don&#x27;t care for that part.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t handle the smell of it, so I didn&#x27;t use it but one time.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to use these sticks!  I used them for about a week, but I really didn&#x27;t like them.  It worked well on my teeth, but I felt it left my mouth feeling \\&quot;dirty.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I could feel how clean my teeth were after the first use of this . Its great!</li>
            <li> My Miswak arrived before it was even supposed to, and not only did it arrive in a timely manner, the product it&#x27;s awesome too! The little case is great, fits the Miswak perfectly and even has little breathable holes so your Miswak doesn&#x27;t get mouldy/dry out! This it&#x27;s my first time using the Miswak, and after I brushed with it, my mouth had this great tingly refreshed feeling, LOVE IT. My breath has a nice neutral smell as well! Will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> I ordered these for a few reasons. One, what did people use before there were tooth brushes and tooth paste? two, i heard it helps stop smoking.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using a blotting brush for over a year, no toothpaste. This is a welcome addition, first i blot, then i rub the bristles of the miswak over my teeth and gums (after i&#x27;ve chewed it to make bristles) The tarter on my teeth has lessened. Maybe someday i&#x27;ll be confident enough to stop blotting and only use the miswak. My son declined to use it to help him stop smoking. :-(</li>
            <li> I think they are terrible.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give it a 5 because I just don&#x27;t care for the taste &amp; the little fibers that come off while you chew it.  But I&#x27;m guessing it does what they say...I just haven&#x27;t gotten that far yet.</li>
            <li> Arrived yesterday- pretty speedy. Definitely a very pungent smell upon opening them. I scraped off the outer bark and it was a bit hard to chew on because of taste at first- got dramatically better. I could compare it to stone ground mustard (really strong) but did cease as I continued. Made my teeth feel awesome. We will see if they can replace brushing and flossing.</li>
            <li> The first time I have tried this or like item.  Have only opened one, but did not have an unpleasant odor as others have been reported to do. I also like I can grab and go so if I plan to eat out. An easy way to make my mouth feel clean w/o toothpaste and mess. Different brushing technique, has a learning curve, but I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Did the job as promised</li>
            <li> taste not so good but whitens and cleans teeth well.</li>
            <li> i not defending this miswak because i am a Muslim but i only started using this tonight and quite frankly it works really well ,of course it does not give u the minty taste like toothpaste it taste like a root but it worth the taste. wat i did was crush it with my teeth and use the liquid like a mouth wash although it really didn&#x27;t taste so well i really had to do it again and my teeth actually feels squeaky clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now you really have to be a cheap ass if you dont try this for that price</li>
            <li> I really like my Miswak Peelu oral care instrument. It is easy to use (just peel bark away and chew lightly to create bristles) and so compact that it easily fits in your purse. I recently took a road trip and if my teeth started feeling fuzzy I would get out my Miswak and \\&quot;brush\\&quot; my teeth. They felt clean and smooth for many hours. I am a dental hygienist and have seen the results of using a Miswak Peelu in our patients from Africa and it is amazing. People who haven&#x27;t had a professional cleaning in their entire life hardly have any calculus nor even any gingivitis. It isn&#x27;t all down to this natural tooth brush but it is part of a successful oral hygiene program that doesn&#x27;t include dentists.</li>
            <li> This is a great product which is effective, healthy and is well worth very penny!</li>
            <li> I still brush my teeth with regular tooth paste in the morning but I carry a miswak on my purse to use when I go out or just after each meal at home.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for almost a month and its great. I recently went to the dentist and they said my teeth we healthy and no plaque. I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
