            <li>Much smaller and not as bright as it looks on line.  </li>
            <li>It was  pretty cheap</li>
            <li>Not bad considering what I paid for it, but not as useful as I would have hoped.</li>
            <li>I use these items for more than cosmetics; it is just the right size for many other uses and keep me organized.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much that I ordered a second one.</li>

            <li>They can be used for so many things and so easily hidden away when not in use.  </li>
            <li>but this is a very cute (very small)</li>

            <li> I was shocked at how small is is, but then I saw that the measurements noted are correct.  Just please be sure that you understand that they are in centimeters, not inches!  LOL!  This seemed more like a desktop item.  May fit a few lip glosses or nail polish...However, what do you expect for the price?  Lesson learned...double check measurements!</li>
            <li> Was not worth anything.waste of time and money it was many times smaller than it looked and doesn&#x27;t deserve even one star</li>

            <li> The material is very cheap and thin and a lot smaller than I expected.  It was  pretty cheap so I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I expected them to be a little bigger.  But they work great for Mary Kay incentive gifts or gift boxes.  I would order them again to use at skin care classes.  It did take a long time to receive, I had actually forgotten I ordered them!</li>
            <li> This is great for the price. My daughter uses it for art supplies and pens in it. It fits perfectly on her desk. Good buy.</li>
            <li> They are darling little containers. I&#x27;m using them for many things in my craft room and gave one to some of the girls I take care of as an Easter basket that they can also use for whatever they like.</li>

            <li> I like this but i just wish it was a little bit bigger. I also wish you could pick the color you wanted. The color i received is one i would not have picked.</li>
            <li> like it wish&lt;br /&gt;i could have picked color. will make keeping cosmetics organized when staying in hotels and traveling,  terrific.</li>
            <li> In my first review I mentioned about the shipping issues I had . I Had booked this item more than a month ago and had not received it when i wrote my first review . Frustrated i had written my review about the shipping delay. To my surprise the very next day I get a mail from the seller apologizing and that they will send me another in 8 days. I dint have any hope but I did get the shipment on time .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with the box .. its small ( a little wider than a  palm ) but is well made . Like some other reviews mentioned it does look a little cheap. but it still looks cute and durable .I received a pink one and its perfect for my nursery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always a septic when ordering out of country but this is a very cute (very small) bin that is great for makeup and it&#x27;s brushes, or for a sunglasses holder or a hair tie holder. I liked it so much that I ordered a second one.</li>
            <li> Love this storage box it fits perfectly on the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> I got two of these &amp; am using them to store the stuff I use daily.  They look very nice.  They are a tad bit small but for what I am using them for it is fine.</li>
            <li> This is the smallest make up box Ive ever seen or purchased. Not happy with purchase at all. But I guess you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be a little bigger that&#x27;s why I got it. I wanted it for using baby stuff in but had to figure something else out for it. Now its used for a remote holder</li>
            <li> Much smaller and not as bright as it looks on line.  I have it one my desk storing asprin and the like.  Not bad considering what I paid for it, but not as useful as I would have hoped.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute and small.  I wouldn&#x27;t order any more unless it&#x27;s for a little girl.  It ships straight from china, so it takes awhile to get delivered.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy these again. They were of very poor quality and fell apart almost instantly. You can make your own with a piece of cardboard (I&#x27;m not kidding), some fabric, and a needle and thread. Next time I need a cute little cheap box to hold my stuff I&#x27;ll go to the nearest dollar store. It also took over a month to come in.</li>
            <li> This item is so cute and efficient.  I love organization and this has a little sass and style to boot.</li>
            <li> I bought this to organize my makeup and beauty supplies. They are slightly smaller than what I expected and one of the boxes was missing the insert that keeps it sturdy. Other than that, I love them. I would still recommend them even under these circumstances.</li>
            <li> Cute. Smaller than I thought but it&#x27;s actually perfect. Using it on my makeup counter for my creams and makeup</li>
            <li> I have bought about ten of these makeup boxes and I love them.  They can be used for so many things and so easily hidden away when not in use.  I have had them about a year now and never had a problem with any of them.  The price is great on them to.</li>
            <li> Cheap material. Strings hanging. And tiny.  The picture made it look a lot bigger by far . Would not recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> This was small than I expected, the side pockets are a little small, but for the price I paid, Its ok.</li>
            <li> I ordered three of these storage baskets. They are a lot smaller than I had expected and two out of the three where had tears along the bottom. It would have cost me more to send them back. I would not recommend them.</li>
            <li> This is a great container. it can be used for storage for many items. It makes a great make up organizer!</li>
            <li> I bought one of these to keep makeup and clutter from spreading across my dresser :) It works! I have all my lipsticks, pencils, foundation etc contained, and can also fit in my moisturizers and deodorant too, it literally holds everything I use in the morning that isn&#x27;t in the shower :)</li>
            <li> I got this product within a week of ordering it which was very nice, I received the orange one its very cute and the perfect size to store my makeup in, My  mascaras fit perfectly in the outside pockets</li>
            <li> NOT WHAT IT WAS STATED IN AD IT WAS SMALL AND CAME IN WRONG COLOR PLUS DAMAGED</li>
            <li> These r very small boxes but they come in so handy for the little thi gs laying arou d the house u have no spot for lol ..these r cute too I have about 1 of these per room for the lil junk I have no place for ...thanks</li>
            <li> They were really cute but too little. My daughter likes to put her make-up in them. Loved the colors! Loved the price!</li>
            <li> I love these little makeup bags. I was hoping it would come in pink or even blue, but both came in yellow/orange color. i was disappointed about that but otherwise they are handy. just becareful they dont get wet since the cardboard is inside holding it together.</li>
            <li> It was a bit flimsy and not deep enough for the purpose I had in mind. Gave it to a teenager who likes and uses it.</li>
            <li> Thought I was going to get all three I only got 1</li>
