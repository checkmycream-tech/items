            <li>This product works really well.</li>
            <li>directions for use on the box are clear and concise, and the company also follows up the order with a &amp;#34;best practices&amp;#34; email to help you use the serum properly and effectively, which I really appreciate.</li>
            <li>The consistency would make it easier to apply and the price is reasonable.</li>

            <li>, I go jogging every morning which caused appeared many spots on my skin, buy this product to test and only a week using it saw positive results, I&#x27;m impatient of see the last results when finished using it, it&#x27;s amazing how fast it works.</li>
            <li>and I personally have noticed a significant difference in the tone and smoothness of my face.  </li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t trade it for any other product love it</li>
            <li>I read many of other reviews before buying this Vit C Serum</li>
            <li>I am over 60 yrs old and this is the first time I have ever used Vit C oil for my face and it really seems to be working.  </li>
            <li>At first i thought it wasn&#x27;t going to work, but then I try it for a few weeks and the results were totally satisfying.</li>
            <li>The texture of my skin is smoother and has a healthier look to it – less dull and saggy is probably the best way to explain it.</li>
            <li>Some skin care products get their 15 minutes of fame before getting pushed to the back of my drawer, but this vitamin C serum does pretty much exactly what is promised on the box, this product  really reduces wrinkles.</li>
            <li>but no sure you’ll find a product that’s as effective</li>
            <li>but a friend recommended that I try something natural first.</li>
            <li>I have used vitamin C products in the past that I have liked.  </li>
            <li>I have some fine lines around my mouth that I do not want to get worse and they seem to be getting better.</li>

            <li>I have noticed less wrinkles and a more youthful appearance.</li>
            <li>My wrinkles are less pronounced and there is a healthy glow to my cheeks.</li>
            <li>I have to admit I am getting older</li>
            <li>Compared to similar results can be seen quickly .</li>
            <li>The B.B. (for short) is highly potent and addictive.</li>
            <li>So far my skin feels super soft, healthy and just plain radiant.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to all ages.</li>

            <li>Vital product works!!</li>
            <li>Just 5 uses is early days to judge what it really is doing to my skin, but I am developing increasingly high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li>but so far I really like it --</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really started to feel self conscious about my skin</li>
            <li>Have used a few of serums, and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Normally for my face, and neck it take about 3 to 5 drops of this serum.</li>
            <li>a more even toned skin in few days of use.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something that would boost hydration and with long term regular use give a more youthful tone to my skin.</li>
            <li>I am only using the product for a few days, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smoother than normal.</li>
            <li>This product is kind of thick</li>
            <li>My skin can be very sensitive to products with any citrus fruit elements, particularly the enzymes.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a new skin product.</li>
            <li>It does brighten my skin tone, instead of making face more pale, it makes face skin glowing.</li>
            <li>with no side effects and it´s very cheap, since the first time i use it, the people ask me for my secret, all thanks to this product.</li>
            <li>For the first time in so long, I actually felt confident enough to leave my house without foundation.</li>
            <li>I did not get any irritations like some of the other products on the market and my skin is so smooth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m telling you know if you have tried the new vitamin C serum</li>
            <li>She loves to try out products like these, she said that after a month of use she has noticed less expression lines and the wrinkles around her eyes have easily faded away..</li>
            <li>The texture of this serum allows it to dry quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too expensive and even so, the customers are super satisfied and lasts much longer.</li>
            <li>you have to have patience, I lasts approximately 2 months without seeing changes in my skin, but after they spent two months the results were incredible.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product if you want a natural glow</li>
            <li>I used expensive products before and this is the real thing, it is simple and it is working,smell great and feels great.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I first put on I was taken back by the thickness.</li>
            <li>I simply applied it first to my fingertips and then onto my face.</li>
            <li>I the past, which I enjoyed, but this product has raised the bar.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely order this product again thanks Vitl!</li>
            <li>We are willing to accept the fragrance, different but not objectionable, and the stickiness because it works better then the moisturizers and organics that we have used in the past.</li>
            <li>I needed help with wrinkles at 28 years old!</li>
            <li>At 25%, Vitl is the highest grade Vitamin C on The Market it reduces wrinkles soft skin reduce fine lines an dark spots non oily</li>
            <li>Large doses of vitamin C does not usually cause toxicity because , being a water-soluble vitamin , it is simply excreted through the urine ,</li>
            <li>I wish the actual Vitamin C Serum Content wasn&#x27;t so far down on the ingredient list, but I suppose it&#x27;s better than none?</li>
            <li>Really surprised me.  </li>
            <li>I was really surprised by this product.</li>
            <li>but my husband told me my wrinkles are fading fast, especially around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I am a 52 year old man</li>
            <li>I was pleasently surprised.</li>
            <li>Vita&#x27;s 25% was still completely ineffective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I adore all vitamin C natural supplements.</li>
            <li>never would have thought that something so simple could do so much.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, but have used.</li>
            <li>It has helped me so much with my facial skin.</li>
            <li>I should be able to look like I&#x27;m actually in my 20&#x27;s for at least a couple few more years if I keep using this.</li>
            <li>The pores in my skin aren&#x27;t anywhere near as noticeable.</li>
            <li>I am still young</li>
            <li>My 4 year old daughter even started commenting on it.</li>
            <li>I have used a couple weeks so far.</li>
            <li>This product is working well for me so far.  </li>
            <li>She looks younger and thanks to Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about 2 weeks and the biggest thing I have noticed so far is increased moisture.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to people who need that help and those young people who is taking advantage of their youth.</li>
            <li>I also use the combination on the back of my hands and am really noticing an improved appearance.</li>
            <li>I really look younger.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 46 year old dude.</li>
            <li>After using this product my skin sentie much smoother and younger.</li>
            <li>Also I have sensitive skin and this serum helps me so that I do not irritate the skin at all.</li>
            <li>My skin can be somewhat sensitive and this Vitamin C Serum hasn&#x27;t caused any irritation or breakouts whatsoever.</li>
            <li>My personal routine, which seems to be working very well, is to wash my face with a cleansing brush when I get up in the morning, followed by a toner, and then apply the Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product and my skin feels soft and clear.</li>
            <li>I have been using v25 for nearly a week</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about 2 weeks and the biggest thing I have noticed so far is increased moisture.</li>
            <li>This is a natural product and it smells like it should.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I am a busy working mom...</li>
            <li>Skin is so soft.  </li>
            <li>General instructions re using serum include to have the skin a little moist after a thorough cleansing, and to let it set for a few minutes before using moisturizer, and I have followed this with good success.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I see a small but noticeable difference in the fine lines around my face.</li>
            <li>Glad I discovered this product as it beats more expensive products with less concentration of vitamin C.</li>
            <li>I love what I recommend, helped me remove my small spots that the sun leaves me back when I go to the beach, using this product</li>
            <li>I can honestly say when I put on my glasses and look in the mirror, there is less cringing and just a little bit of wonder</li>
            <li>this product is such high quality material that you could even feel the Purest Grade Vitamin C Serum and the prices of the product are as well as the quality</li>
            <li>I am counting on it being the same or better than my previous product because of all the reviews I read!!</li>
            <li>This serum is slightly sticky and dries tacky initially, however when I wake in the morning my skin is smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried to use many different products over the last few years.</li>
            <li>V25 left me a new skin.</li>
            <li>I was using this other Vitamin C serum which I did not like very much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a thick liquid that was easy to apply.</li>
            <li>At first, I wasnt resl crazy about it because it left a bit of a sticky feel to it, but after a little while, the sticky was gone  and I was left with a very soft beautiful look.</li>
            <li>I started using this product and was a little leary because most of the same sort of oil are much more expensive.</li>
            <li>I use it as the first layer, before I put on other serums and oils.</li>
            <li>This serum has a higher percent of vitamin C and the price is comparable to other serums.  </li>
            <li>I started using this product and was a little leary because most of the same sort of oil are much more expensive.</li>
            <li>My pores are barely noticeable and my skin is glowing!</li>
            <li>Just a few drops go a long way and my skin feels smooth and soft after applying.</li>
            <li>Just a few drops go a long way and my skin feels smooth and soft after applying</li>
            <li>Frankly I was looking for something more economical that provides results similar to the expensive facial products I am using.</li>
            <li>know you&#x27;re looking at the price tag of this product and thinking &amp;#34;ouch!&amp;#34; but seriously, sometimes you have to pay more to get something that is actually what its supposed to be.</li>
            <li>Right now it is too soon to tell, but I do like the tight feeling as soon as it goes on.</li>
            <li>once before bedtime for 3 weeks and have really noticed as I have spots on the face have become clearer and longer see me very little, really recommended.</li>
            <li>With how much you use this product this bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li>and i reckon if i keep using this they will soon be barely visible at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m young but I have already noticed larger pores and....</li>
            <li>it’s totally gone, replaced by a brighter natural color.</li>
            <li>Im very suprised that after only a few days I already feel my skin so much healthier.</li>
            <li>but I think I&#x27;m going to revert back to my old serum.</li>
            <li>and I have to say I&#x27;m surprised I will definitely be buying this for her again, and</li>
            <li>After using it fora week, I find v25 has its abilities to replenish skin and restore a healthy food looking for me, even my face was dry and dull.</li>
            <li>For a while I was looking for a supplement that contains large amounts vitamin C, and to get this product I achieved what I wanted since I have obtained besides other benefits from this as the protection of the skin, among others.</li>
            <li>great product, use it to boost my immune system, have not gotten sick since i have started using it.</li>
            <li>This particular Vitamin C serum is on the sticky side while also being pretty thick...  </li>
            <li>This product really works and this is not like other products that they are a deception.</li>
            <li>I wanted something basic and natural to put on my face daily.</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;m only in my late 20s, the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles really gets me down.</li>
            <li>This is the best Vitamin C product I have ever used you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li>I can tell it is so much stronger than the other Vitamin C facial products I have tried</li>
            <li>This was just after a few weeks of using my first bottle of this product.</li>
            <li>I have read in a few reviews that it smells funny</li>
            <li>Typically my face is very dry (due to the powder and such I&#x27;m sure)</li>
            <li>I had a few dark spots from acne and after applying this for a week i could see a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I suffer from dry skin from the harsh winter elements, and this product has really helped in healing this and bringing my skin back to normal.</li>
            <li>Most have been liquid, which is difficult to tell if it&#x27;s spread evenly or if you&#x27;re missing any spots because it tends to dry quickly.</li>
            <li>I was doing different because my skin looked so much heathier, brighter and had less wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>As we get older we start to notice the dark spots and wrinkles and we look for all types of products to help aide us in this battle.</li>
            <li>, I think the secret is there, because the skin becomes softer less spots on the skin, healthier skin, and all these changes are you noticing quickly, applying it twice a day for me it has worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>I have classic Irish rudiness compounded by rosacea, and a long though remote history in the California sunshine.  </li>
            <li>My dry skin due to the harsh winter this season is smooth and looks younger.</li>

            <li> The texture of my skin is smoother and has a healthier look to it – less dull and saggy is probably the best way to explain it.</li>
            <li> Some skin care products get their 15 minutes of fame before getting pushed to the back of my drawer, but this vitamin C serum does pretty much exactly what is promised on the box, this product  really reduces wrinkles.</li>
            <li> but no sure you’ll find a product that’s as effective</li>
            <li> but a friend recommended that I try something natural first.</li>
            <li> I have used vitamin C products in the past that I have liked.  </li>
            <li> I have some fine lines around my mouth that I do not want to get worse and they seem to be getting better.</li>
            <li> Really like the ease that I can use it , new to this type of product but fully feel like I will use this one often.</li>
            <li> I have noticed less wrinkles and a more youthful appearance.</li>
            <li> My wrinkles are less pronounced and there is a healthy glow to my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I am getting older</li>
            <li> Compared to similar results can be seen quickly .</li>
            <li> The B.B. (for short) is highly potent and addictive.</li>
            <li> So far my skin feels super soft, healthy and just plain radiant.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to all ages.</li>

            <li> Vital product works!!</li>
            <li> Just 5 uses is early days to judge what it really is doing to my skin, but I am developing increasingly high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li> but so far I really like it --</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really started to feel self conscious about my skin</li>
            <li> Have used a few of serums, and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Normally for my face, and neck it take about 3 to 5 drops of this serum.</li>
            <li> a more even toned skin in few days of use.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that would boost hydration and with long term regular use give a more youthful tone to my skin.</li>
            <li> I am only using the product for a few days, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smoother than normal.</li>
            <li> This product is kind of thick</li>
            <li> My skin can be very sensitive to products with any citrus fruit elements, particularly the enzymes.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a new skin product.</li>
            <li> It does brighten my skin tone, instead of making face more pale, it makes face skin glowing.</li>
            <li> with no side effects and it´s very cheap, since the first time i use it, the people ask me for my secret, all thanks to this product.</li>
            <li> For the first time in so long, I actually felt confident enough to leave my house without foundation.</li>
            <li> I did not get any irritations like some of the other products on the market and my skin is so smooth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m telling you know if you have tried the new vitamin C serum</li>
            <li> She loves to try out products like these, she said that after a month of use she has noticed less expression lines and the wrinkles around her eyes have easily faded away..</li>
            <li> The texture of this serum allows it to dry quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too expensive and even so, the customers are super satisfied and lasts much longer.</li>
            <li> you have to have patience, I lasts approximately 2 months without seeing changes in my skin, but after they spent two months the results were incredible.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product if you want a natural glow</li>
            <li> I used expensive products before and this is the real thing, it is simple and it is working,smell great and feels great.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I first put on I was taken back by the thickness.</li>
            <li> I simply applied it first to my fingertips and then onto my face.</li>
            <li> I the past, which I enjoyed, but this product has raised the bar.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely order this product again thanks Vitl!</li>
            <li> We are willing to accept the fragrance, different but not objectionable, and the stickiness because it works better then the moisturizers and organics that we have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I needed help with wrinkles at 28 years old!</li>
            <li> At 25%, Vitl is the highest grade Vitamin C on The Market it reduces wrinkles soft skin reduce fine lines an dark spots non oily</li>
            <li> Large doses of vitamin C does not usually cause toxicity because , being a water-soluble vitamin , it is simply excreted through the urine ,</li>
            <li> I wish the actual Vitamin C Serum Content wasn&#x27;t so far down on the ingredient list, but I suppose it&#x27;s better than none?</li>
            <li> Really surprised me.  </li>
            <li> I was really surprised by this product.</li>
            <li> but my husband told me my wrinkles are fading fast, especially around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I am a 52 year old man</li>
            <li> I was pleasently surprised.</li>
            <li> Vita&#x27;s 25% was still completely ineffective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I adore all vitamin C natural supplements.</li>
            <li> never would have thought that something so simple could do so much.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, but have used.</li>
            <li> It has helped me so much with my facial skin.</li>
            <li> I should be able to look like I&#x27;m actually in my 20&#x27;s for at least a couple few more years if I keep using this.</li>
            <li> The pores in my skin aren&#x27;t anywhere near as noticeable.</li>
            <li> I am still young</li>
            <li> My 4 year old daughter even started commenting on it.</li>
            <li> I have used a couple weeks so far.</li>
            <li> This product is working well for me so far.  </li>
            <li> She looks younger and thanks to Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 2 weeks and the biggest thing I have noticed so far is increased moisture.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to people who need that help and those young people who is taking advantage of their youth.</li>
            <li> I also use the combination on the back of my hands and am really noticing an improved appearance.</li>
            <li> I really look younger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 46 year old dude.</li>
            <li> After using this product my skin sentie much smoother and younger.</li>
            <li> Also I have sensitive skin and this serum helps me so that I do not irritate the skin at all.</li>
            <li> My skin can be somewhat sensitive and this Vitamin C Serum hasn&#x27;t caused any irritation or breakouts whatsoever.</li>
            <li> My personal routine, which seems to be working very well, is to wash my face with a cleansing brush when I get up in the morning, followed by a toner, and then apply the Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product and my skin feels soft and clear.</li>
            <li> I have been using v25 for nearly a week</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 2 weeks and the biggest thing I have noticed so far is increased moisture.</li>
            <li> This is a natural product and it smells like it should.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I am a busy working mom...</li>
            <li> Skin is so soft.  </li>
            <li> General instructions re using serum include to have the skin a little moist after a thorough cleansing, and to let it set for a few minutes before using moisturizer, and I have followed this with good success.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I see a small but noticeable difference in the fine lines around my face.</li>
            <li> Glad I discovered this product as it beats more expensive products with less concentration of vitamin C.</li>
            <li> I love what I recommend, helped me remove my small spots that the sun leaves me back when I go to the beach, using this product</li>
            <li> I can honestly say when I put on my glasses and look in the mirror, there is less cringing and just a little bit of wonder</li>
            <li> this product is such high quality material that you could even feel the Purest Grade Vitamin C Serum and the prices of the product are as well as the quality</li>
            <li> I am counting on it being the same or better than my previous product because of all the reviews I read!!</li>
            <li> This serum is slightly sticky and dries tacky initially, however when I wake in the morning my skin is smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to use many different products over the last few years.</li>
            <li> V25 left me a new skin.</li>
            <li> I was using this other Vitamin C serum which I did not like very much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a thick liquid that was easy to apply.</li>
            <li> At first, I wasnt resl crazy about it because it left a bit of a sticky feel to it, but after a little while, the sticky was gone  and I was left with a very soft beautiful look.</li>
            <li> I started using this product and was a little leary because most of the same sort of oil are much more expensive.</li>
            <li> I use it as the first layer, before I put on other serums and oils.</li>
            <li> This serum has a higher percent of vitamin C and the price is comparable to other serums.  </li>
            <li> I started using this product and was a little leary because most of the same sort of oil are much more expensive.</li>
            <li> My pores are barely noticeable and my skin is glowing!</li>
            <li> Just a few drops go a long way and my skin feels smooth and soft after applying.</li>
            <li> Just a few drops go a long way and my skin feels smooth and soft after applying</li>
            <li> Frankly I was looking for something more economical that provides results similar to the expensive facial products I am using.</li>
            <li> know you&#x27;re looking at the price tag of this product and thinking &amp;#34;ouch!&amp;#34; but seriously, sometimes you have to pay more to get something that is actually what its supposed to be.</li>
            <li> Right now it is too soon to tell, but I do like the tight feeling as soon as it goes on.</li>
            <li> once before bedtime for 3 weeks and have really noticed as I have spots on the face have become clearer and longer see me very little, really recommended.</li>
            <li> With how much you use this product this bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li> and i reckon if i keep using this they will soon be barely visible at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m young but I have already noticed larger pores and....</li>
            <li> it’s totally gone, replaced by a brighter natural color.</li>
            <li> Im very suprised that after only a few days I already feel my skin so much healthier.</li>
            <li> but I think I&#x27;m going to revert back to my old serum.</li>
            <li> and I have to say I&#x27;m surprised I will definitely be buying this for her again, and</li>
            <li> After using it fora week, I find v25 has its abilities to replenish skin and restore a healthy food looking for me, even my face was dry and dull.</li>
            <li> For a while I was looking for a supplement that contains large amounts vitamin C, and to get this product I achieved what I wanted since I have obtained besides other benefits from this as the protection of the skin, among others.</li>
            <li> great product, use it to boost my immune system, have not gotten sick since i have started using it.</li>
            <li> This particular Vitamin C serum is on the sticky side while also being pretty thick...  </li>
            <li> This product really works and this is not like other products that they are a deception.</li>
            <li> I wanted something basic and natural to put on my face daily.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m only in my late 20s, the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles really gets me down.</li>
            <li> This is the best Vitamin C product I have ever used you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I can tell it is so much stronger than the other Vitamin C facial products I have tried</li>
            <li> This was just after a few weeks of using my first bottle of this product.</li>
            <li> I have read in a few reviews that it smells funny</li>
            <li> Typically my face is very dry (due to the powder and such I&#x27;m sure)</li>
            <li> I had a few dark spots from acne and after applying this for a week i could see a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I suffer from dry skin from the harsh winter elements, and this product has really helped in healing this and bringing my skin back to normal.</li>
            <li> Most have been liquid, which is difficult to tell if it&#x27;s spread evenly or if you&#x27;re missing any spots because it tends to dry quickly.</li>
            <li> I was doing different because my skin looked so much heathier, brighter and had less wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> As we get older we start to notice the dark spots and wrinkles and we look for all types of products to help aide us in this battle.</li>
            <li> , I think the secret is there, because the skin becomes softer less spots on the skin, healthier skin, and all these changes are you noticing quickly, applying it twice a day for me it has worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> I have classic Irish rudiness compounded by rosacea, and a long though remote history in the California sunshine.  </li>
            <li> My dry skin due to the harsh winter this season is smooth and looks younger.</li>
            <li> Second, what I completely did NOT expect, is that it seems to be moderating my extreme facial redness.</li>
            <li> I am not kind to my skin for 3 reasons: I don&#x27;t drink anywhere near a gallon of water per day, I cake on makeup like Donald Trump is paying me $20 for each layer I apply, and I live in the sun.</li>
            <li> a 45 year old mother and wrinkles have shown up and this product has helped them be less noticeable and has made me look younger.</li>
            <li> With this product will get the results you want to hydrate your skin as long as you forget the smell is a bit funky but does the job my wife is a doctor she recommends besides that uses preferably daily in the morning</li>
            <li> I am amazed on how  two drops go such a long way.</li>
            <li> It has been such a dry winter where I am</li>
            <li> It has been such a dry winter where I am</li>
            <li> Curious that several of them have reviewed the same 5 products!!  </li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and tight.</li>
            <li> The other product is like water, make it more difficult to maintain in the fingertips.</li>
            <li> Have tried several other products that promise to reduce wrinkles but this one actually works!</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin especially in the winter months</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long, but I can tell that it&#x27;s already fading some of my hyper pigmentation and my skin is softer.</li>
            <li> I plan to keep using it, and see what it can do over the long haul.  </li>
            <li> the strange color that the alcohol gave to it</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m getting all the expected benefits of a Vitamin C Serum, with none of the potential issues or</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it for a long time.</li>
            <li> I will buy this for the long haul.</li>
            <li> The do called eye bag region and the serum is really thick which I really like.</li>
            <li> I am a 58 year old woman and have no fine lines or spots.  </li>
            <li> After just a few uses, her skin looked much smoother and less wrinkly.</li>
            <li> Due of my work, I am constantly exposed to the sun for long time, which has caused me a lot of spots and dryness.</li>
            <li> Compared to other products for our skin on the market, it makes total sense to use Vitamin C Serum on your face.</li>
            <li> there is no oily residue left on my face unlike other serums i have tried.</li>
            <li> I tried other products that were so watery they didn&#x27;t make my skin feel any different after I used it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve definitely expanded to use on other areas of face and décolletage.</li>
            <li> My skin was so dry</li>
            <li> It cleared up my dry skin that I have suffered from for years on my hands and fingers.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have so far is the smell.  </li>
            <li> and I will definitely continue to use this serum in my everyday facial regimen.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Vitamin C Serum for my mother, when she started to complain about dry and loose skin on her face.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I clumsily spilled half the first.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other products that claim to do the same thing and the only real big qualm I have with any of the other ones is the consistency of the serums or oils.</li>
            <li> I used to have a few scars and now you can barely see them.</li>
            <li> After trying this product, my skintone is slowly returning to its normal color.</li>
            <li> The serum is exactly what I expected- thick and concentrated and not watered down.</li>
            <li> I have used several different Vitamin C serums over the past year</li>
            <li> This product made such a difference in less than 2 weeks that my boyfriend asked</li>
            <li> I have used several different Vitamin C serums over the past year</li>
            <li> I have very deep wrinkles around my eyes, I have noticed they are getting less noticeable.</li>
            <li> My face was very dry</li>
            <li> The first time I used the brush cleaner and the V25 serum, I noticed just a few small spots on my face that stung a little bit, then the sting faded away.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several brands and while I&#x27;ve fortunately not had any bad experiences, I have had some outstanding experiences, and this brand is one of those.</li>
            <li> It is free from parabens, fillers, alcohol, artificial colors and</li>
            <li> sometimes complained about the smell and texture but has not stopped using it so far</li>
            <li> (I Have been using it only for a few days</li>
            <li> I ordered it and it arrive quicker than expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent over $100 for.</li>
            <li> I did see some improvement in about a week with that one, but I didn&#x27;t like how wet and watery it felt</li>
            <li> and I feel so rejuvenated because I look a few years younger.</li>
            <li> Have only been using for a few days</li>
            <li> The Vitamin C Serum provided results as expected.</li>
            <li> I recommend it with my eyes closed.</li>
            <li> Once your skin tries it on, it will never want to be washed again.</li>
            <li> The other product is like water, make it harder to keep on the fingertips.</li>
            <li> The other product is like water, make it harder to keep on the fingertips.  </li>
            <li> The other product is like water, make it harder to keep on the fingertips.</li>
            <li> Having said that, I have noticed an immediate improvement in my skin,- smoother, less dry.  </li>
            <li> I have used other products like this</li>
            <li> read on some of the other reviews about the smell.</li>
            <li> and the serum has a stickiness I haven&#x27;t encountered with other serums.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other Vitamin C serums and I like the consistency of this one.  </li>
            <li> , I did not get any irritations like some of the other products on the market</li>
            <li> extremely suggest mistreatment day and night underneath moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Its no fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am at a point where I am not exactly willing to change my ways but also don&#x27;t want to sit by idly as I turn into the Crypt Keeper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I like this product because of the smell and the color was yellow.</li>
            <li> Other than that I like the way it works and the redness is disappearing.</li>
            <li> I use this every other day in the evenings.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t compare it to other brands.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product on January 29, 2015, since I have been using it, I have noticed the difference in its consistency and the way it adheres to the skin, it doesn&#x27;t burn when you apply it, like my experience with other vitamin C products and it stays put.  </li>
            <li> and I have little bit of loose skin.</li>
            <li> I decided due to wrinkles under eyes and dark circles</li>
            <li> The consistency is just right (not too thick, not too thin).  </li>
            <li> I have dark spots too, this vitamin c serum has been my savior.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered the v25 25% Vitamin C Complex Serum in part because I could see the writing on the wall with skin care products containing polyethylene beads to exfoliate.</li>
            <li> This vitamin c serum can help with that by boosting collagen production in your skin while also evening put your skin tone to reduce sun spots and dark spots.</li>
            <li> and I also have been seeing improvement in the size of my pores and the dark discoloration on my jaw line</li>
            <li> I regret it, wrinkles and dark circles plague my face.</li>
            <li> I have defined crow&#x27;s feet under my eyes alongside dark circles.</li>
            <li> I have been using this specific one for a while now and have nothing negative to say.</li>
            <li> Not a fan, gets a slightly sour odor to it and is sticky.</li>
            <li> Really stinky, impossible to use it and smell at the same time.</li>
            <li> I have aborted many a miserable facial because the &amp;#34;fruit enzyme miracle serum&amp;#34; lit my face on fire.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s less than 1/5 the cost.  </li>
            <li> I  noticed a slight tingling of my  face after application  </li>
            <li> About a half a dropper was all I needed for each use for my face and neck.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;ve seen already the changes in my skin, softer and less decolored.</li>
            <li> The spots are now much less visible</li>
            <li> and it is half the price of my previous product.  </li>
            <li> It has a slight smell which dissipates when it dries.  </li>
            <li> This product has a slight scent I am not fond of</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve lighted a couple of dark patches on my face substantially  and when I use a green tinted primer, they darkness is not noticeable at all.  </li>
            <li> I am almost done with the bottle and the few dark spots on my face haven&#x27;t changed in appearance.</li>
            <li> I probably use a little less moisturizer afterwards because it does feel like it hydrates so well.  </li>
            <li> Her dark marks have lightened and has less wrinkles!</li>
            <li> It&#x60;s a little sticky, I rather something silkier.</li>
            <li> I had lots of sunspot and was a little darker from sunburns.</li>
            <li> This product is a little thicker, somewhere between an ointment/gel type thing and liquid, which allows you to spread it and see where it is before you fully finish rubbing it in.</li>
            <li> is a little lighter.</li>
            <li> Other serums I&#x27;ve used in the past worked but stung my face which I didn&#x27;t like at all</li>
            <li> She recommends this product to every one, for as little as 20 bucks you can get one that lasts months..</li>
            <li> I have also recommended this to anyone that could use a little moisture boost this winter for their skin.</li>
            <li> I have used Estee Lauder products previously, but alas despite their high price, those products seemed to do no good for me.</li>
            <li> I noticed the difference of my skin in just a few days.  </li>
            <li> i started taking vitamin C a few years ago</li>
            <li> and i start taking this a few months ago</li>
            <li> My sister recommended me this Vitamin C serum a few weeks ago for my girlfriend.</li>
            <li> take off few years from your face and body like i did, try this product.</li>
            <li> I started using this serum for a few days now</li>
            <li> I was browsing through serums on here because i have been ill lately and as many of us know when we are ill and lose weight, the wrinkles that were never there before start to appear.</li>
            <li> After just a few days I could see the difference</li>
            <li> As soon as it dried I would lather my face with lotion to mask the smell.</li>
            <li> I bought it and waited a few weeks</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money folks.</li>
            <li> In a few weeks makes my body has a firmer appearance and makes my skin toned.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> i have not been using this product that long,but i use it everyday</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks now and have noticed a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> Have been using it for a few days now</li>
            <li> The texture of the serum is just a little thick and sticky, which means that when I put my fingers to my face to spread it on, it&#x27;s still on my fingers and not dripping down my wrists like some watery products we have all tried.</li>
            <li> The smell is not very nice</li>
            <li> Not very effective.</li>
            <li> I would recommend only if your not sensitive to bad smells.</li>
            <li> Usually when I hear vitamin C</li>
            <li> and I was afraid to try it because I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Needless to say I have used every cream from every cosmetic line for over&lt;br /&gt;25 years, anything to look younger.  </li>
            <li> Use it sparingly though because it works well in small amounts. .</li>
            <li> I am in my 50&#x27;s and have tried everything to minimize small lines on my face.</li>
            <li> no more spots on my face.</li>
            <li> I felt so uncomfortable with the attention I was getting in front of my husband but definitely flattered.</li>
            <li> The coloring on my cheeks was very uneven</li>
            <li> I have come to really rely on Amazon reviews, and this is very disappointing.</li>
            <li> then you need to get it now before its to late.</li>
            <li> ; that is going on as of late</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and not watery</li>
            <li> This serum was too thick and sticky for me to wear during the day.</li>
            <li> mean who does at this age?  </li>
            <li> I was little skeptical about this product after reading about its smell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used my wife&#x27;s expensive cream around my eyes with little help.  </li>
            <li> I had ever made that only bad thing</li>
            <li> Like that it&#x27;s not to thick nor is it to thin.</li>
            <li> I have come across some pretty nasty smelling serums which made me stop using them alone.</li>
            <li> will say the scent isn&#x27;t as bad as I expected.</li>
            <li> The vitamin C does work and my wrinkles are reduced, I don&#x27;t look tired</li>
            <li> This product is very sticky and smells terrible.  </li>
            <li> When you apply the serum there is an odd smell but nothing too unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Seriously folks!</li>
            <li> After a couple of years of been an alcoholic the damage of my skin was unrepairable, I was desperate to find a solution</li>
            <li> I work at a college around students who are constantly sick and in the past I would catch everything</li>
            <li> Smells weird when I put it on</li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> Very poor product, made me break out, will not use again.</li>
            <li> I also have not had a cold since I started to use this product.</li>
            <li> This serum does not leave a sticky or bad feeling on the skin.</li>
            <li> I know bad for you, but this helps repair any damage.</li>
            <li> I know bad for you, but this helps repair any damage.</li>
            <li> and now I&#x27;m shocked at the results.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Just started using the product. The only complaint I have so far is the smell.  Smells weird when I put it on and I can smell it during the night and when I wake up.</li>
            <li> Though I&#x27;ve used the serum only a couple of days, I am very impressed with it. I have used various anti-aging products and I am excited about this serum as it seems to have great potential for improving my skin. Upon applying the serum, my skin instantly felt refreshed and smoother. What I really like is that it immediately soaked in without feeling heavy, sticky, or greasy as some products do.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Makes my skin look and feel great!!</li>
            <li> I decided to get this because I heard Vitamin C was good for your skin. So after a week or so of having this my skin has definitely gotten better. Many people kept complementing me about how my skin looked and how I looked better. I did notice a bit of a difference. I d recommend you try it and don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it.</li>
            <li> I have tried many vitamin c products &amp; this one is one of the best! I was little skeptical about this product after reading about its smell but i dint find the smell annoying. The ingredient serum absorbs to many layers of your skin. I use it every morning &amp; I use it at night 3x a week.. I wake up to bright, glowing skin, and wrinkles around my eyes lessened!My skin is becoming smoother day by day.</li>
            <li> I tried using the Vitamin C Serum By Vitl and started feeling the effects within one week.  I feel better than I&#x27;ve every felt with more energy and I know my immune system is working the greatest that it ever has.  I work at a college around students who are constantly sick and in the past I would catch everything but since I started using the Vitamin C Serum by Vitl I haven&#x27;t been sick once this year. Since it&#x27;s a serum your body absorbs the vitamin C much quicker than taking tablets.  I recommend that everyone try it.</li>
            <li> great product, use it to boost my immune system, have not gotten sick since i have started using it. funny taste, but it is not bad at all</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C Serum is good for removing darks spots and the few wrinkles I have had. The only things that I did not like was the smell and how sticky it was but I would rather it be sticky then watery. I have very dry skin especially in the winter months so this leaves my skins feeling very smooth. I would recommend only if your not sensitive to bad smells.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!! Made my skin so clear and smooth!! I would recommend this to anyone who wants to have smoother skin. You can&#x27;t be the price either!!</li>
            <li> The v25 is vitl System serum vitamin C presence of this vitamin is required for a number of metabolic reactions in all animals and plants and is created internally by almost all organisms, humans being a notable exception</li>
            <li> I am impressed with the quality of this product, I have a little over one month using it and am very happy with all its benefits, I&#x27;ve tried many others and in my opinion, by the consistency and viscosity makes it much easier the application, I am pleased and highly recommend ... for me it is the best vitamin C that are on the market.</li>
            <li> Some skin care products get their 15 minutes of fame before getting pushed to the back of my drawer, but this vitamin C serum does pretty much exactly what is promised on the box, this product  really reduces wrinkles. After purchasing the serum, it’s a good idea to keep it refrigerated. This will keep the serum from oxidizing too quickly, and will give you a better result for the price.</li>
            <li> If you want your skin soft and clear you have to use this , clear you skin from acne and make your skin look clean and hydrated it , I recommend this to anyone who wants to fell good about they health and have troubles with your skin buy this. if you look good you fell good.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent, I recommend it.  Due of my work, I am constantly exposed to the sun for long time, which has caused me a lot of spots and dryness. (I Have been using it only for a few days but I like the way it absorbs quickly, and I really think my skin looks healthy. A colleague of mine recommended it to me and now has given me good results.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C serums is quite amazing. I was told to try these to help reduce wrinkles and they were right. I have used it for about a week now and have noticed disappearing wrinkles.. thanks. loveIt</li>
            <li> I bought it for my wife and she said to me that this vitamin C serums is quite amazing. She applied this as soon as she got it. Lol. Her skin was actually a bit brighter as well. It is a fabulous product!!</li>
            <li> I have tried several products before yours was recommended to me.  I noticed the difference of my skin in just a few days.  My friends have been asking me what I am doing different.  My skin is more radiant and glowing than it has ever been.  I am very happy with your product.  I have been using it for several months now and have no desire to look for another product.</li>
            <li> i started taking vitamin C a few years ago and i start taking this a few months ago and it&#x27;s great it have a good quantity of vitamin C and is really easy to take, vitamin C is good for your body and for your skin and this is for me a great and easy way to get it</li>
            <li> Vitamin C can help improve your skin, and this one works perfectly! I this love this serum as its not sticky or oily i highly recommend</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  I am over 60 yrs old and this is the first time I have ever used Vit C oil for my face and it really seems to be working.  I will keep using it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about two weeks and have seen great results.  When you apply the serum there is an odd smell but nothing too unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin absorbs this serum without  leaving my skin looking greasy.  It softens he lines around my eyes. I wear it daily under my make up.</li>
            <li> I’ve tried two different brand of the Vitamin C serum, and decided to stay with this one. The only reason is this brand is stickier, hence easier to hold it on my finger tips and apply onto my face. The other product is like water, make it harder to keep on the fingertips. I believe the contents are similar, although this one claims to have 25% of Vitamin C.</li>
            <li> This product has been very helpfully to my skin! My face looks more healthy and feels very soft. 100% recomended</li>
            <li> good product, nice interesting color flavor. buy with doubt but what use bes like me and now I think stop eating. I would like to try more products of this company, I loved it. recommend timely delivery, good price for an excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;my next purchase pedirecinco so I never miss one.</li>
            <li> I have used many alternatives to this Vitamin C Serum and they work, but not to my satisfactory desires. This product in particular is very good. It is thicker which is preferable for me and does exactly what is states it can do. Delivery times were fairly quick and overall I am impressed with this product. For a fairly cheap price, I would recommend this product for anyone contemplating using Vitamin C Serum. This 25% Vitamin C Serum feels smooth on the skin and reduces the appearance of wrinkles quickly. I have only used this product for almost a month now and I&#x27;m impressed with this so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to anyone interested in enhancing the appearance of their skin.</li>
            <li> Very nice product. I would recommend it to anyone. I noticed that after using this project I started feeling a lot healthier and a lot more energetic. It&#x27;s definitely worth the money. Mostly because it&#x27;s very cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the 5/5 star rating :)</li>
            <li> Got in exchange for an honest review Vitl V25 is the Most Potent Vitamin C Serum System Available Today. At 25%, Vitl is the highest grade Vitamin C on The Market it reduces wrinkles soft skin reduce fine lines an dark spots non oily this is a great product the only thing I see needs improvements is the smell of it maybe make a fruity smell or purfume smell or something like that but throughout a very awesome product I love serum as its not sticky or oily i highly reccomend to anyone that&#x27;s wants to reduce wrinkles lines or dark spots make yourself look young again and have beautiful looking skin makes u feel like a teenager again make yourself feel like your beautiful an young love your skin with this serum I promise you will not wanna use anything else ever again for wrinkles an fine lines it does it all</li>
            <li> This producto is awsome. Just after some weeks using it and now my skin feels so healthy and smooth. I use it twice a day like as the manufacturer recommends and the results have been very satisfactory for me.</li>
            <li> Great product! I am loving the way it makes my skin feel! I&#x27;m already feeling my skin tighten up. Definitely recommend people try this great product!!</li>
            <li> I’ve tried two different brand of the Vitamin C serum, and decided to stay with this one.  The only reason is this brand is stickier, hence easier to hold it on my finger tips and apply onto my face.  The other product is like water, make it harder to keep on the fingertips.  I believe the contents are similar, although this one claims to have 25% of Vitamin C.  I used this product for six weeks now, it&#x27;s a fine product.</li>
            <li> I love it. I haven&#x27;t been using it long, but I can tell that it&#x27;s already fading some of my hyper pigmentation and my skin is softer. My skin seems to like it a lot.</li>
            <li> My SIL told me to buy this and I did!  Just got it but so far I really like it -- makes my skin look and feel great!</li>
            <li> Didnt think my skin could of ever looked so &amp;#34;Beautiful and Radiant&amp;#34; as stated in the title of the product. this product is such high quality material that you could even feel the Purest Grade Vitamin C Serum and the prices of the product are as well as the quality</li>
            <li> I can really tell the difference since I have been taking this vitamin c compared to others. I believe that vit c is great for the skin and I have tried several different brands, but this one has been working. it isnt instant results, but it does make my skin clearer and i can tell the difference after using for about 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I really like this product an was happy with the purchase and service thank you.</li>
            <li> Great product, as put in the description, recommended 100% energizes and keeps you all day, made my skin firmer and gave him a bright glow and dark spots disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;recommended</li>
            <li> I regularly get sun spots on my skin so I decided to try this stuff out. I ordered it and it arrive quicker than expected. I opened it up and put some on and just had it on for the remainder of the day. The next morning I examined my self in the mirror and the sun spots were noticeable smaller and seemed to be going away. So for that reason alone I give this product 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This is the best serum i&#x27;ve ever used! I have used other products like this but it didn&#x27;t work for me... Also it is cheap, so is a good option. I definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> I promise you will not wanna use anything else ever again for wrinkles an fine lines it does it all. I did not get any irritations like some of the other products on the market and my skin is so smooth</li>
            <li> THIS BEST C SERUM .. is the best. I have tried all kinds of VIT C serum&#x27;s and this surpasses them all with HIGH VIT C 22% plus other necessary skin loving nutrients. IT leaves your skin soft, smooth and clears out the sun spots. I love it. I used to be an Obagi user but now am sold on this brand of Vit C. Try it, i know you will love it and its even the best price on the market!</li>
            <li> Started seeing results in a week skin is firmer and fine lines are disappearing!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!! I noticed and felt a difference the first day of using it.  My face was very dry and I need something to moisturize it. I have dark spots too, this vitamin c serum has been my savior. After a week using it every morning and night, my face looks smoother and wrinkles reduced. There is a tingle sensation when first use it, but it feels wonderful!  Love love this stuff! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Without question, this has to be the BEST product for better skin as one ages. . . .I am 68, and just today, someone commented on my skin.  I don&#x27;t normally have great skin. . . .I mean who does at this age?  But she commented on it. . . and I personally have noticed a significant difference in the tone and smoothness of my face.  I cannot say enough good things about this Vitamin C serum. . . .I would take a boxful for life!</li>
            <li> I love this serum that is the best</li>
            <li> Really surprised me.  I was so impressed by this product and it really toned my face and my wrinkles did fade,  I found that it was easier to apply than most and I&#x27;m excited to give it my highest recommendation.</li>
            <li> I used expensive products before and this is the real thing, it is simple and it is working,smell great and feels great.&lt;br /&gt;My skin so supple and moist, that&#x27;s  all I needed</li>
            <li> This product has made my skin look great, clear and firm. I have noticed less wrinkles and a more youthful appearance. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> A MUST buy for anyone with stretch marks! This works wonders!! You just can&#x27;t beat it for the price! It helps diminish the appearance and soften the skin all at once.</li>
            <li> I have used vitamin E for years and love the results, however many formulas are oily and cause breakouts. I&#x27;m Excited to see what adding vitamin C will do for me and hopefully this formula won&#x27;t be too oily</li>
            <li> Within a week of using this, I saw a difference in my skin.  With in two weeks of using this even my daughter noticed and asked what I was using!  The difference is in the amount of vit C serum in the product. Most only have 15-20%. Vitl has 25% and I can really see the difference.</li>
            <li> This vitamica c gives me energy every day. the daily consumption before doing my exercises . and . no complaints. I love to consume , because it is a very good antioxidant. 3 weeks taking the dose. and . I have a different skin texture. I love this product.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product for almost a month, and I&#x27;m impressed. I have used others alternatives of Vitamin C, but any of them worked so good like this. The consistent it feels confortable to apply and the wrinkles, they have star to dissapear. Is wonderful!</li>
            <li> is the best way to use vitamin C, the results are more remarkable, although the place feels sticky in the first applied, then the skin absorbs it and it feels good, I think the secret is there, because the skin becomes softer less spots on the skin, healthier skin, and all these changes are you noticing quickly, applying it twice a day for me it has worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sticky when first applied to the skin but once it soaks in the stickiness goes away. It has a light citrus scent but isn&#x27;t overwhelming. With how much you use this product this bottle will last a long time. I can tell a difference in the appearance on my face since I have started using this, my face doesn&#x27;t look dull anymore and has a nice glow to it! I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> My sister recommended me this Vitamin C serum a few weeks ago for my girlfriend. I bought it and gave it to her as a gift. Last time i saw her she asked me where could she find it to buy some more.</li>
            <li> I use this product and really proved me very well, I go jogging every morning which caused appeared many spots on my skin, buy this product to test and only a week using it saw positive results, I&#x27;m impatient of see the last results when finished using it, it&#x27;s amazing how fast it works.</li>
            <li> The overall of this product it is that it will leave your skin beautiful and radiant. That is exactly what all of us want! This product has a sticky feel to it. This will help when applying it on your face. This product helps your face look radiant and rested. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Have used a few of serums, and this is my favorite. It has an amazing orange or citrus like scent. Like that it&#x27;s not to thick nor is it to thin. The texture of this serum allows it to dry quickly. This serum does not leave a sticky or bad feeling on the skin. Use this serum twice daily. Normally for my face, and neck it take about 3 to 5 drops of this serum.</li>
            <li> I really like how this made my face fell I mean yea the smell isnt all great but the product does what it says it does! :)</li>
            <li> For a while I was looking for a supplement that contains large amounts vitamin C, and to get this product I achieved what I wanted since I have obtained besides other benefits from this as the protection of the skin, among others. Excellent product</li>
            <li> Great product.  The consistency is just right (not too thick, not too thin).  I&#x27;m a repeat customer and recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I started using this product and was a little leary because most of the same sort of oil are much more expensive. Well this oil is amazing. My skin was glowing. I&#x27;m a sun tanner yes I know bad for you, but this helps repair any damage. Great stuff</li>
            <li> really this product makes it look spectacular and radiant skin regain vitality that you lose over the years, I totally recommend it without any kind of complaints about this product delivers what it promises, revive the skin, gives softness and leaves a pleasant smell..</li>
            <li> One of the best options to take vitamin C , changes are noticed quickly because it is concentrated , it shows that the body assimilates quickly , the difference is its high degree of purity so you &#x27;ll notice how effective the time to include it in our daily habit of taking vitamins .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used another vitamin C serum but It irritates my skin. Just started using the product my skin smooth like butter and absorbed fast.</li>
            <li> very effective and inexpensive. noticeable changes very fast.&lt;br /&gt;I have tested many similar products and none gave favorable results like this, Minimize sun spots and skin discoloration by&lt;br /&gt;creating a more even toned skin in few days of use. you can use any age. 100% recommended,</li>
            <li> Vitamin C serum is great for taking care of scars and wrinkles.At 25%, this Vitamin C Serum is of the most potent ones on the market. Vitamin C Really works great from my experience with it. It is highly recommended by many doctors for a reason. Its becoming a very popular item in the anti aging realm. It really helps!</li>
            <li> My wrinkles are gone for ever thanks to this magical substance! I&#x27;am really happy with this product and have now started buying this for my friends. I highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I was really surprised by this product. When I first put on I was taken back by the thickness. Then realized it absorbs nicely and after using for a while I noticed smoother softer skin, even my family and friends started noticing and then purchased the serum. Wouldn&#x27;t trade it for any other product love it</li>
            <li> Use this every morning.</li>
            <li> Big huge rave for this product! my boyfriend bought to me and I LOVE it in the morning as a primer underneath my foundation. I wish the actual Vitamin C Serum Content wasn&#x27;t so far down on the ingredient list, but I suppose it&#x27;s better than none? This is fantastic for setting &amp; extending the wear of my skin white the pass of years, and I love the polished and shined on me now older skin. so if you&#x27;re a woman o wanna change or look younger this is the product for you. take off few years from your face and body like i did, try this product. you will never regret.</li>
            <li> I tried two different brands of serum vitamin C, and decided to stay with this. The only reason is this brand is more sticky, therefore easier to hold in my finger tips and apply to face. The other product is like water, make it more difficult to maintain in the fingertips. I have used this product for a year, and is of excellent quality. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many vitamin C products and this one is by far my favorite! It works so well on sun spots and burns. I used to have a few scars and now you can barely see them. I recommend this to anyone with skin problems!</li>
            <li> This product is perfect. I have my skin brightest and hydrated thanks to vitamin C, I recommend this product by the first hand. Nice smell.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I am getting older but my husband told me my wrinkles are fading fast, especially around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I wanted to share how very pleased I am with Vitl Vitamin C Serum!&lt;br /&gt;I figured out through trial and error that Vitamin C is really what you need to get that healthy glow. It fades discoloration, tightens skin, shrinks my pores and generally gives my skin that healthy, youthful glow. Vitl at a high 25% is a great value for their price point. I have paid a lot more for Vitamin C serums, that are not as good a quality as Vitl.</li>
            <li> I started using this serum for a few days now and I already feel my skin is smoother. The shipping was very fast and the product was as described. I will definately keep using this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best vitamin c that used so far , good quality product at low cost . Definitely good reasons to purchase this product . Compared to similar results can be seen quickly . Besides the quality of it can be seen more with its use .. Definitely a highly recommended product . I &#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> Best c serum I&#x27;ve used!!</li>
            <li> This product is kind of thick but i really like this consistency. It´s not that oily so absorbs really great in to the skin and you can see the results really fast.&lt;br /&gt;Better to apply at night</li>
            <li> Since I started to use this product, I have noticed a decrease in wrinkles on my neck and face. I highly recommend this product to all ages. I also have not had a cold since I started to use this product.</li>
            <li> Love this!!! It is made with Vitamin C, who hasn&#x27;t heard from your mom, grandmother or great-grandmother, of how good Vitamin C is for us. Compared to other products for our skin on the market, it makes total sense to use Vitamin C Serum on your face. The stress and synthetics in foods, medications, soaps and whatever else we don&#x27;t realize we are exposed to daily, it is best to fight against them with a natural product. Don&#x27;t get another wrinkle thinking about getting this product, just get it and see the results for yourself.</li>
            <li> And cheap! Seems legit! Review don&#x27;t lie!  This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> This really is the best Vitamin C serum out there, Mother looks younger everyday, she loves it!!!</li>
            <li> I read many of other reviews before buying this Vit C Serum and I finally got my chance to give it a go. It works wonders. I have faded wrinkles under my eyes. The do called eye bag region and the serum is really thick which I really like.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for all skin types</li>
            <li> It&#x60;s a little sticky, I rather something silkier.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C serum really work! I have two weeks using it and i have noticed a great result in my skin. My skin is clearer and smoother since I began the treatment. This product really works and this is not like other products that they are a deception. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I’ve tried two different brand of the Vitamin C serum, and decided to stay with this one..&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product for anyone contemplating using Vitamin C Serum. This 25% Vitamin C Serum feels smooth on the skin and reduces the appearance of wrinkles quickly. I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> this serum gave me great results from compliments on my skin to having glowing fresh skin. Vitamin C is a great antioxidant and this product is so silky and works so well with my body. It gives the perfect nutrients my skin was lacking. From the formula I noticed that it was made from the highest quality ingredients that left my skin flawless. Highly recommend this product if you want a natural glow</li>
            <li> I purchased this Vitamin C Serum for my mother, when she started to complain about dry and loose skin on her face. After just a few uses, her skin looked much smoother and less wrinkly. Her face looks brighter and fresher. Everyone says she is Glowing!</li>
            <li> I have never tried a Vitamin C serum before, but after reading about them online, seemed like an inexpensive investment into my skin care routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a thick liquid that was easy to apply. I simply applied it first to my fingertips and then onto my face. I liked the feel of it, found it quite refreshing if not a little bit sticky. However, it absorbed quickly into the skin without any oily residue&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read on some of the other reviews about the smell. Personally I found it to be natural and quite appealing. However, the scent of a product all depends on the user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An excellent product that you will be happy to use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> Not a fan, gets a slightly sour odor to it and is sticky.</li>
            <li> Amazing on the skin, love this product.</li>
            <li> I asked a close relative that recommends This vitamin c supplement. It&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> Just started to use this vit c serum and in just 4 days I saw improvement.  My skin felt so soft and its so easy to apply and most important of all its affordability</li>
            <li> I recently ordered the v25 25% Vitamin C Complex Serum in part because I could see the writing on the wall with skin care products containing polyethylene beads to exfoliate. Their days are numbered and rather than try to find an acceptable apricot scrub facial cleanser, I settled on a powered brush cleansing system using a cleanser I know won&#x27;t irritate my skin. I expected this would be a little more challenging to my sensitive, middle-aged dry skin, so I wanted a good serum to put under my moisturizer. Toner has never done anything for my skin. I was looking for something that would boost hydration and with long term regular use give a more youthful tone to my skin. The internet reviews on this product were well written and positive, and the price was attractive in comparison to other similar products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the bottle I ordered last week and have used it 5 times.  The dropper seems to be good quality and dispenses in well controlled amounts. The texture of the serum is just a little thick and sticky, which means that when I put my fingers to my face to spread it on, it&#x27;s still on my fingers and not dripping down my wrists like some watery products we have all tried. It goes on very smoothly and soaks into the skin promptly, leaving a very soft smooth surface, with no tackiness even in the undereye area. General instructions re using serum include to have the skin a little moist after a thorough cleansing, and to let it set for a few minutes before using moisturizer, and I have followed this with good success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from this product. My skin can be very sensitive to products with any citrus fruit elements, particularly the enzymes. I have aborted many a miserable facial because the &amp;#34;fruit enzyme miracle serum&amp;#34; lit my face on fire.  The first time I used the brush cleaner and the V25 serum, I noticed just a few small spots on my face that stung a little bit, then the sting faded away.  Subsequent use has had norecurrence of the stinging, it now goes on very comfortably.  I probably use a little less moisturizer afterwards because it does feel like it hydrates so well.  Just 5 uses is early days to judge what it really is doing to my skin, but I am developing increasingly high hopes for this product. First, it makes my skin feel soft and hydrated all day, just like after having a good facial - it feels younger.  Second, what I completely did NOT expect, is that it seems to be moderating my extreme facial redness. I have classic Irish rudiness compounded by rosacea, and a long though remote history in the California sunshine.  I won&#x27;t claim that the redness has gone away, but it already seems to be changing into more of a rosy glow that looks healthy and attractive. I can honestly say when I put on my glasses and look in the mirror, there is less cringing and just a little bit of wonder - What is going on here?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers have noted a funky smell.  I have not, but don&#x27;t have the most acute sense of smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a terrific product. I plan to keep using it, and see what it can do over the long haul.  I wish I had tried this 20 years ago.</li>
            <li> I loved the product Vitl v25.  It is easy to apply, then I apply my moisturizer and makeup.  I ran into some people I had not seen for&lt;br /&gt;5 years and they commented I looked younger than I did last time they saw me.  I think it has a nice clean feeling and my skin&lt;br /&gt;feels smoother.</li>
            <li> I purchased a bottle of Vitl v25 serum January 14 2015.. My skin was so dry I needed something to help. I tried all those exspensive sets of facial produts and nothing gave me satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made my purchase of Vitl V25 C serum January 14 2015 and I am pleased with the results. My dry skin due to the harsh winter this season is smooth and looks younger. I&#x27;;m satisfied with this product and will order again in the future.&lt;br /&gt;Thank&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 25% Vitamin C Serum By Vitl,</li>
            <li> This product is great!  Between having the highest percentage of vitamin C I&#x27;ve been able to find and having such good feedback from the people who have tried it, I had to experience it for myself.  I&#x27;ve used Obagi&#x27;s version of this I the past, which I enjoyed, but this product has raised the bar.  The Vitl is more concentrated and was worried it may leave my skin looking oily, but it didn&#x27;t.  Instead it quickly absorbed right in and just left a healthy glow.  Not to mention the fact I don&#x27;t have to go to the dermatologist to get it and it&#x27;s less than 1/5 the cost.  I&#x27;m definitely hooked!</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with the fresh \\&quot;dewy\\&quot; look this created. People have already asked what I am doing because my skin looks so healthy! This was just after a few weeks of using my first bottle of this product.</li>
            <li> I am a 52 year old man and I have been using this product for about two months and I love it. Several people have asked if I have had plastic surgery, which I just smile and laugh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with Vitl v25. My face and neck are moisturized , lighten and reduce wrinkles. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is the best product ever!! This is my second bottle of it and I will always use it.  My skin looks fabulous.  I am a 58 year old woman and have no fine lines or spots.  Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;Mary Farmer</li>
            <li> I  noticed a slight tingling of my  face after application  and the serum has a stickiness I haven&#x27;t encountered with other serums.  Having said that, I have noticed an immediate improvement in my skin,- smoother, less dry.  I love this product and will continue to use.  I apply in the morning and just before bed.  I will give an update on my skin in a month to report any improvements.</li>
            <li> Really stinky, impossible to use it and smell at the same time.</li>
            <li> This product has made my skin much smoother and I will continue to buy again!</li>
            <li> I have the worst skin scars on my face. I never even thought they would ever disappear until I found this stuff my sister recommended and I was blown away. Works great.</li>
            <li> perfect skin and radiant!. I have bought skin creams all my life but, this is the best. It works and without side effects. Recommended product.</li>
            <li> These vitamins c, allow your skin be healthy and look very nice, in my case through my skin problems it&#x27;s over, for example my skins fungus products for the sun exposure, my skin is healthy now totally thanks to this powerful vitamin.</li>
            <li> i recently purchased the Vitamin C Serum By Vitl. I was pleasently surprised. At first, I wasnt resl crazy about it because it left a bit of a sticky feel to it, but after a little while, the sticky was gone  and I was left with a very soft beautiful look. It doesnt have a very nice smell that we all love, but it does leave your feelingvery soft and beautiful and most of the fine lines have diminished. I would definitly recomend this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different types of  Vitamin C Serums. I love this product! It absorbs the second you put it on your face. I will definitely order this product again thanks Vitl!</li>
            <li> I love your product I am so glad someone finally created a product that really works!!!!! I give V25 a definite A+ !!!</li>
            <li> I tried this thinking it would be more effective than the Oz Naturals 20% vitamin C serum - see http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DPE9EQO/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_172.  I was wrong.  Viti&#x27;s 25% serum literally had no effect on my skin -- none, zero, zilch.  I tried it alone and with Cosmedica Skincare&#x27;s Best-Selling Hyrauluonic acid - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CLILRMY/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_170.  Vita&#x27;s 25% was still completely ineffective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m back to using Oz Naturals and Cosmedica Skincare&#x27;s Best-Selling Hyrauluonic acid both of which I purchased on Amazon.  They work well combined.  They&#x27;ve lighted a couple of dark patches on my face substantially  and when I use a green tinted primer, they darkness is not noticeable at all.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CLILRMY/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_170</li>
            <li> I was looking for a vitamin C serum with a minimum of 25% Vitamin C so when I saw Vitl product I thought I would give it a try.I&#x27;m glad I did. I love this product! About a half a dropper was all I needed for each use for my face and neck.It goes on easy and it seemed to help make the fine lines around my eyes less noticeable.  I have also used it as a massage oil for my hands after working in the garden. I have tried several products with Vitamin C Serum and in comparison, my opinion is, Vitl is one of the better ones.</li>
            <li> I love Vitamin C for everything..lol This particular Vitamin C serum is on the sticky side while also being pretty thick...  Overall I believe this 25% vitamin c serum is a good product to use just as a night time mask or bedtime use..</li>
            <li> I adore all vitamin C natural supplements. The benefits of adding this product were amazing</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve used this serum, I noticed my skin is silkier and smoother.I will always continue to use it. I am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I just started using this and am very pleased so far.  I&#x27;ve tried other Vitamin C serums and I like the consistency of this one.  It&#x27;s thick and not watery so it adheres to my skin.  I feel as though it will last the day. I&#x27;m using this  twice a day. Once in the morning and before bed. I&#x27;m excited to see the results as I will be consistent in using daily and not just on outdoor days.</li>
            <li> I used to take the vitamin c tablets but this is way better great product</li>
            <li> i iam very content with this</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m only in my late 20s, the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles really gets me down. This vitamin c serum can help with that by boosting collagen production in your skin while also evening put your skin tone to reduce sun spots and dark spots. It brightens your skin and leaves it smoother and healthier looking and feeling. Great product for any woman (or man for that matter)</li>
            <li> The wrinkles under my eye brows, crows feet and under my lower lids are GONE!!!  Those Pucker lines around my mouth, also gone.&lt;br /&gt;I never would have thought that something so simple could do so much. I have spent so much on fancy creams, then I find something reasonable to be the most effective.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, but have used. 20% vitamin C Serum successfully for years. Within 2-3 minutes of applying this product I broke out in an itchy red rash from head to toe. If I could, I would give this zero stars</li>
            <li> This is perfect for me! - My skin is so smooth, I did not get any irritations like some of the other products on the market this just seems to be my perfect pick, Highly recommend! +++A</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good enough... maybe cos I kept it in a warm area, it seemed to have a different smell/texture after a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to use many different products over the last few years. As I am now passing the age of 50. This product is far better than the others . I recommend it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, really liked me a lot and helped me ah me and my family, vitamin C is ensencial and thanks to this product I have it and share it with friends and family, plus is suepr accessible and good, I recommend it</li>
            <li> his product smells nice and looks to create my skin glow! Love it! extremely suggest mistreatment day and night underneath moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Good brand, I&#x27;ve been using its for about 4 weeks now and receive compliments on my skin</li>
            <li> This serum is absolutely amazing. As we get older we start to notice the dark spots and wrinkles and we look for all types of products to help aide us in this battle. Well I found this serum and it has helped me tremendously! It helps with my dark spots which has become so much lighter and it leaves my skin feeling amazing! I am glad my search is over because I now have the best product on the market. You will not be disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Not as expected but does make skin soft</li>
            <li> This is a Good product, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was browsing through serums on here because i have been ill lately and as many of us know when we are ill and lose weight, the wrinkles that were never there before start to appear. This serum was reasonable priced so i decided to give it a try. I am so glad i did. After not having hardly no wrinkles to having more than i wanted i was pleasantly suprised when they started to fade. Now im not saying over night you will not have any wrinkles but with continued use you will definatly be feeling better about your wrinkles. I know  that i am.</li>
            <li> Today one man who goes to work on the street, gets plenty of sun where at the end of the day you end up with a face as if he were a cardboard, which is why I recommend you apply Vitamin C serum to start the day, for to notice the difference at the end of your day where will feel fresher.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this brand compared to others and decided to give this a try instead of the one I get from my local store. I can say that I am not dissapointed with it at all and is a very good product for the price. It cleared up my dry skin that I have suffered from for years on my hands and fingers. Thanks and I would recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> Awesome! I used this for 3 days in a row before I went to sleep, next day my face felt so clean and fresh. I honestly do highly recommend this product because it does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> did not do anything for me, on the plus side, it didn&#x27;t break me out either.</li>
            <li> If you need appearance improvments than here is a product that can satisfy your over all look.</li>
            <li> Great product. Helps your skin and helps reduce wrinkles. Vitamin C also helps your immune system.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C Serum itl V25 has the power to Boost collagen production for firmer appearance and reduce wrinkles , minimizes sun spots and skin discoloration by creating a more toned skin , prevents oxidative damage caused by the elements damaging as sunlight , smoke and air pollution, Smoothes skin texture and gives a brighter complexion .</li>
            <li> This product has become very popular thanks to its role as an antioxidant, as it helps the body cells grow and stay healthy, the benefits of Vitamin C Serum By Vital are extraordinary. This product in particular is very good, and overall I am impressed with this product. For a fairly cheap price, I would recommend this product for anyone contemplating using Vitamin C Serum</li>
            <li> Excellent product been using it for about 3 weeks now and i&#x27;ve seen already the changes in my skin, softer and less decolored. I recommend this product without any doubt! You wont regret.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product. The serum is easy to apply and feels so lightweight on skin doesnt clog up my pores nor leaves it sticky nor gunky what it does is smooth out my dry skin and leave it with a healthy younger looking appearance. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am only using the product for a few days, but so far so good. I use it as the first layer, before I put on other serums and oils. I use it am and pm. It has not caused any breakouts. I will continue with the product and see if it has an effect on sagging, which is my primary concern. Right now it is too soon to tell, but I do like the tight feeling as soon as it goes on. I was impressed with the fast delivery of the product, and the company is really interested in making sure the customer is satisfied.</li>
            <li> I had too much sun exposure after my vacation since I stayed in the beach a lot. I had lots of sunspot and was a little darker from sunburns. After trying this product, my skintone is slowly returning to its normal color.</li>
            <li> I love this vitamin c product! It has helped me so much with my facial skin. I am a 45 year old mother and wrinkles have shown up and this product has helped them be less noticeable and has made me look younger.I feel so much more confident in myself and I would highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a new skin product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other products that claim to do the same thing and the only real big qualm I have with any of the other ones is the consistency of the serums or oils. Most have been liquid, which is difficult to tell if it&#x27;s spread evenly or if you&#x27;re missing any spots because it tends to dry quickly. This product is a little thicker, somewhere between an ointment/gel type thing and liquid, which allows you to spread it and see where it is before you fully finish rubbing it in. Definitely the best designed product, and it does everything written in the description. I should be able to look like I&#x27;m actually in my 20&#x27;s for at least a couple few more years if I keep using this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m telling you know if you have tried the new vitamin C serum then you need to get it now before its to late. Its been wonderful and I can&#x27;t say no to this great product so get yours while they last.</li>
            <li> Quite amazing results for a great price!  It is sticky but skin feels smoother, disappearing wrinkles and it is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I adore the way this leaves my skin feeling. It helps even out my skin, which is great considering the sun damage I have thanks to my gardening addiction. lol It&#x27;s pretty easy to use to, no confusing directions, or anything. just simple. I would highly recommend it to anyone trying to get their skin more youthful looking.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s works pretty well. I am impressed because I was skeptical at first but if you truly keep on it twice a day it works just as it says it will.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used another vitamin C serum a year ago. It went on smooth like butter and absorbed fast. But this stuff makes my face feel sticky and residue-y. Won&#x27;t be buying again</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I had a few dark spots from acne and after applying this for a week i could see a huge difference. The spots are now much less visible and i reckon if i keep using this they will soon be barely visible at all. The serum goes directly into the skin and is not to oily or greasy which good when applying to your face.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pure genius.  How can this work so fast?  I just use it under my eyes and around my outer mouth areas and noticed a big change.  My wrinkles are fading and i feel so happy.  I will continue to use this over and over again.  I will recommand this product to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I am not kind to my skin for 3 reasons: I don&#x27;t drink anywhere near a gallon of water per day, I cake on makeup like Donald Trump is paying me $20 for each layer I apply, and I live in the sun. I&#x27;m young but I have already noticed larger pores and....dare I say it....lines on my face. Its no fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am at a point where I am not exactly willing to change my ways but also don&#x27;t want to sit by idly as I turn into the Crypt Keeper. I was scrolling the internet and saw all of these get-pretty-fast schemes. None of them seemed really believable. I ended up reading about the health benefits of vitamins. One click led to another and I ended up settling on Vitamin C Serums. I didn&#x27;t really understand the whole &amp;#34;serum craze&amp;#34; that is going on as of late but I decided to give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know you&#x27;re looking at the price tag of this product and thinking &amp;#34;ouch!&amp;#34; but seriously, sometimes you have to pay more to get something that is actually what its supposed to be. This isn&#x27;t water in a bottle with a fancy label thrown on it. Its the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this off and on for some time now. I like to use it at night and in the morning for those rare days when I am not piling on the makeup (believe me, they are rare). I actually like the way it makes my skin feel. It feels hydrated. Typically my face is very dry (due to the powder and such I&#x27;m sure) but this serum helps. The pores in my skin aren&#x27;t anywhere near as noticeable. I actually like this stuff. I only wonder what a 50% or 75% grade can do. Definitely give this a try.</li>
            <li> I suffer from hyper pigmentation, after trying multiple different serums, nothing seemed to work except for this serum. I have used Estee Lauder products previously, but alas despite their high price, those products seemed to do no good for me. Finally a friend recommended me Vitl Products, and ever since then I am in love.</li>
            <li> love it love it best purchase I had ever made that only bad thing id&#x27;s the smell but otherwise it&#x27;d amazing</li>
            <li> Excellent product , a little on the sticky side but extremely beneficial results after about four weeks of use. Really like the ease that I can use it , new to this type of product but fully feel like I will use this one often.</li>
            <li> Love it. Before I was purchasing the Obagi Vit C, but now that I found this one that compares in quality but at a fraction of Obagi&#x27;s price; I choose the 25% Vit C by Vitl.</li>
            <li> 5 stars for this product, thanks to its presentation is the most recommended by doctors and the body absorbs me so incredible and you begin to notice as will removing facial wrinkles and it is best that I can apply before the of makeup smoothly</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the difference in my skin in just a short time. My skin is brighter and lines are very much finer.. I can&#x27;t wait to continue to use this! I feel like this product has taken years off my face. I can tell it is so much stronger than the other Vitamin C facial products I have tried but yet it does not irritate my face in any way. I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> This particular product is very good. My wife uses it and its critics are very good. Delivery times are pretty fast and overall I&#x27;m impressed with this product. For a fairly cheap price, I would recommend this product to anyone contemplating the use of vitamin C serum. This 25% of serum vitamin C. feels soft on the skin and reduce the appearance of wrinkles quickly. My wife has used this product for about a month and am impressed with the progress.</li>
            <li> I am still young so I don&#x27;t have really any lines but I wanted to use it so my skin feels healthier and so I can hopefully prevent wrinkles. So far my skin feels super soft, healthy and just plain radiant. I love this product!</li>
            <li> I am very grateful that this product was recommended to me by a friend.  After just a few days I could see the difference and I am often asked what I am using.  I am very happy and satisfied with your product.</li>
            <li> Great product! After a couple of years of been an alcoholic the damage of my skin was unrepairable, I was desperate to find a solution and I found it with this vitamin c serum, my skin feels a lot more smooth and the strange color that the alcohol gave to it it’s totally gone, replaced by a brighter natural color. It’s amazing!</li>
            <li> Im very suprised that after only a few days I already feel my skin so much healthier. Im glad I purchased this serum.</li>
            <li> I’ve tried a lots of differents brands of the Vitamin C serum, and this is the best. Thats because this brand is stickier. The other product is like water, make it harder to keep on the fingertips. And have 25% of the vitamin C, this one it&#x60;s the better product</li>
            <li> I am giving this two stars and not one because I didn&#x27;t use it enough to tell of it worked. THE SMELL IS TERRIBLE! As soon as it dried I would lather my face with lotion to mask the smell. My 4 year old daughter even started commenting on it. I tried this because of the reviews but I think I&#x27;m going to revert back to my old serum.</li>
            <li> I expend all my time in the beach with my family and I need to care my skin so keeps me fresh and protected. You can notice the effect it makes this product into the skin. Very useful and effective.</li>
            <li> After a week since I first started I saw the results! it&#x27;s incredible how it works! it fits perfect with my skin type, and I don&#x27;t have second effects as dry skin, wich I got with another products.....100% recommended!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  This serum has a higher percent of vitamin C and the price is comparable to other serums.  I like the consistency of this serum, as it is a bit thicker, making a smaller amount go further.  I recommend!</li>
            <li> Omg using this product was the best think I can ever do my skin feels great</li>
            <li> this irritated my skin beyond belief</li>
            <li> Love it! I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and my skin is visibly brighter and tighter. I have pretty good skin but it just turned 30 and wanted to start taking better care of it. Love how it has firmed and tightened!</li>
            <li> I love this serum. The serum is very lightweight. It goes on very smoothly and absorbs quickly. there is no oily residue left on my face unlike other serums i have tried. I see a small but noticeable difference in the fine lines around my face. It will leave your face feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I like this product because of the smell and the color was yellow.</li>
            <li> I have used a couple weeks so far. My skin feels brighter and tighter. Great product!</li>
            <li> Great product for the price.  Seems as good as others I&#x27;ve spent over $100 for.</li>
            <li> My first purchase of trying any type of Vitamin C serum was with Oz Naturals. I did see some improvement in about a week with that one, but I didn&#x27;t like how wet and watery it felt so I wanted to try this serum because so many reviews were saying they like the consistency of the Vitl V25 serum and saying it was thicker and applied better and when I received it which was very fast in 4 days. I was really happy with the thicker texture of the serum. I have been using for a week now and I am very happy with the results. I like the way it feels on my face and I also have been seeing improvement in the size of my pores and the dark discoloration on my jaw line is a little lighter. My face actually glows now within this weeks time. I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t yet tried it but my sister has an she likes it , loves the results .</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about a month. I have noticed that after I began using it my skin bacame softer ,.and my skin tone became more uniform.  I suffer from dry skin from the harsh winter elements, and this product has really helped in healing this and bringing my skin back to normal. Highly recommended...</li>
            <li> I would like to try. I&#x27;ve lost a lot of weight and I have little bit of loose skin.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  Glides on like warm butter on toast.  You must use it consistently but I have seen quite a difference in my skin.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li> Love the serum I am out in the sun a lot living in Arizona it did reversed my sun damage thank you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using vitamin c for my face for several months and have noticed a big improvement. I decided to try VITLC serum 25% I&#x27;ve only been using this particular product for 2 weeks,so far I love it! I figured the higher percentage of vitamin c the better,thats not always the case; so make sure you do a test patch,some people have very sensitive skin. This product is working well for me so far.  Yolanda San Antonio,TX</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for a month and I already see an improvement in the softness and texture of my skin.  I also use it on my chest and neck.  I&#x27;ll definitely continue to use this and now my 2 daughters are using it as well.&lt;br /&gt;Patty Bowman</li>
            <li> This is the Very Best C Serum I have used. I am 70 years old and it makes my face feel wonderful and has a youthful Glow! Thank You I will be Reordering many more the Price for this Product is amazing.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend has been using another brand but she tried this and it absolutely suits her. She looks younger and thanks to Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li> I have used several different Vitamin C serums over the past year and I really am liking this one. I have been using it for about 2 weeks and the biggest thing I have noticed so far is increased moisture. It has been such a dry winter where I am and this has really made my skin look and feel much better!!!</li>
            <li> This serum was too thick and sticky for me to wear during the day. I used it at night only.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, skin is softer and smoother. Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy either.</li>
            <li> I bought this bottle at end of January, I have been use it for more than a month now, every night before sleep. It does brighten my skin tone, instead of making face more pale, it makes face skin glowing. the only thing confuses me is that this serum is smelt sugary somehow.</li>
            <li> Good for aging skin!  I like the product!</li>
            <li> After using it fora week, I find v25 has its abilities to replenish skin and restore a healthy food looking for me, even my face was dry and dull. I think v25 is a unique product for most ladies and leaves. The skin feeling deeply nourished and relaxed. I will keep using it.</li>
            <li> Love this product and already seeing sn improvement in my skin&#x27;s brightness and texture. I mix it with my moisturizer so it&#x27;s easier to apply.</li>
            <li> I’ve a fair amount of sun damage so I’m always looking for effective products to even out my skin tone. I’ve tried a number of vit-c products and to date and I have to say V25 is the best I’ve found. It’s viscosity makes it easy to apply..doesn&#x27;t drip thru your fingers, it absorbs quickly so you can apply additional products to maintain a good skin care regime. I know you can pay a lot more for similar products but no sure you’ll find a product that’s as effective</li>
            <li> I was using this other Vitamin C serum which I did not like very much. Then I received V25 as a gift and have been using it for about a month. I like it way better. It goes on smooth and silky. The smell could be better, but I apply moisturizer after so it doesn&#x27;t bother me. Great product.</li>
            <li> I love it! I&#x27;ve really started to feel self conscious about my skin and I was planning to buy one of the big name beauty products to help but a friend recommended that I try something natural first. I bought it and waited a few weeks and now I&#x27;m shocked at the results. My skin looks soo much better and I feel so rejuvenated because I look a few years younger.</li>
            <li> Amazon should review ratings for authenticity. This product is 1 month old and already has so many reviews.</li>
            <li> I have never been the type to really care for my skin in the 20&#x27;s, took advantage of the youth. Now in my 30&#x27;s I regret it, wrinkles and dark circles plague my face. The youth gone and aging here I was looking for beauty products to help me bring back that youth I took advantage of. I found this Vitamin C serum and wanted to try and see if it really does what they state. I have to say I am so happy I found this! I am noticing a change in my face and its for the better! The vitamin C does work and my wrinkles are reduced, I don&#x27;t look tired and I am telling everyone about this! I recommend this to people who need that help and those young people who is taking advantage of their youth. Take care of your skin and use this serum to do it!</li>
            <li> I have to give this vitamin c serum 5 stars because it&#x27;s gentle but still effective. Other serums I&#x27;ve used in the past worked but stung my face which I didn&#x27;t like at all</li>
            <li> I bought this product on my husband&#x27;s account, so the review is in his name. Great product. I used it morning and night for two weeks with great results. My skin was smoother and brighter and my lines are not as noticeable. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love what I recommend, helped me remove my small spots that the sun leaves me back when I go to the beach, using this product V25 left me a new skin. The smell is not very nice but it&#x27;s worth using will soon see what results is a product that I recommend. Here though I wear protective sunglasses are those stains on the skin and this product also eliminated. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these couple weeks ago for my wife, and it works well for her,  i can feel the smooth in her skin, the smell is not bad for us, is just like a fresh orange, we don&#x27;t have issues with it, she says me that feels great and easy to apply and easy to remove..thats enough for me!</li>
            <li> This product is great. Usually when I hear vitamin C I think of something that benefits me. This product does just that! I have been using it for a while and it has definitely enhanced the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> I have these brown spots on my face under ny eyes...so I decided to try this product and I can see a huge difference...my brown spots are looking alot lighter which has made me feel really confident...</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a month now and can actually see a visible difference in the wrinkles by my eyes. Have tried several other products that promise to reduce wrinkles but this one actually works!</li>
            <li> I received this product gift from a friend and I was afraid to try it because I have sensitive skin so I gave it to my wife until now its result helps to improve the smoothness of her skin sometimes complained about the smell and texture but has not stopped using it so far</li>
            <li> Great product didn&#x27;t think it would work this good removed my sun spots and also firmed my skin on my face tremendously :) thanks a lot vitamin c syrum</li>
            <li> I have defined crow&#x27;s feet under my eyes alongside dark circles. I tried this product and had noticeable results within the first month of usage.</li>
            <li> I own a salon and many a times we use metal tips and tools in order to remove the cuticles, but one customer recommended me to try to use this and the effects are great! It&#x27;s not too expensive and even so, the customers are super satisfied and lasts much longer. I would recommend for salon and for personal use!</li>
            <li> Nice product, is very helpfull for me, is just what i was looking for my skin cuz i really like to take care! recommended!!!</li>
            <li> Had this product for a while, is great for the value!</li>
            <li> I recommend this so much. its a great vitamin C in excellent cost..</li>
            <li> Excellent seller really everything perfect exactly what you offer matches your purchase insurance products ... 100%</li>
            <li> This vitamin c serum is great. I have many sun spots and wanted a more even skin tone and this seems to be working for me. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Have only been using for a few days but I like the way it absorbs quickly, and I really think my skin looks healthier.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since January and I really like it.  I use it in combination with a Hyaluronic Acid Serum. Frankly I was looking for something more economical that provides results similar to the expensive facial products I am using. With these two products I think I&#x27;m getting close especially for night use.  I also use the combination on the back of my hands and am really noticing an improved appearance.</li>
            <li> I am really happy with this product. I massage it around my face before I go to sleep and it feels cool on my skin. It also absorbs fast and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m already seeing my wrinkles diminishing so it has made a difference. I have added this product to my facial routine every night!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommended.</li>
            <li> So I am a retired Macy&#x27;s Store Manager.  Needless to say I have used every cream from every cosmetic line for over&lt;br /&gt;25 years, anything to look younger.  This product made such a difference in less than 2 weeks that my boyfriend asked&lt;br /&gt;what I was doing different because my skin looked so much heathier, brighter and had less wrinkles.  I love my new skin.</li>
            <li> At age 67, my skin looks good. I&#x27;m not saying I don&#x27;t have lines and wrinkles I&#x27;d like to see disappear, but with a good skin care routine and good products, I think my skin is still youthful and bright. And this vitamin C serum by Vitl starts my day and I know it is working all day to help combat the effects of aging.</li>
            <li> So excited to try this product, I have not found a vitamin C serum this potent on the market before!</li>
            <li> I love this product, it&#x27;s great for my skin an it don&#x27;t cause my skin to breakout</li>
            <li> I was told to try these to help reduce wrinkles and they were right. I have used it for about a week now and have noticed disappearing wrinkles. My skin feels smoother than normal. Along with that, applying it should be very easy if you are a beginner. This vitamin c serum is amazing!</li>
            <li> This product is a nice new way to get rid of some wrinkles. I have been using it and can reconize a difference right away. My skin is glowing!</li>
            <li> Awesome Product. The 25 % is the strongest that I have found. Use it sparingly though because it works well in small amounts. . I use it at night and in the morning. Love it.</li>
            <li> I started using this product and was a little leary because most of the same sort of oil are much more expensive. Well this oil is amazing.  My skin was glowing. I&#x27;m a sun tanner yes I know bad for you, but this helps repair any damage. Great stuff</li>
            <li> Great Product! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> This is the best Vitamin C product I have ever used you will not be disappointed! I will never use another Vitamin C product!</li>
            <li> So far, so good.... I have used vitamin C products in the past that I have liked.  I am trying this one because it has so many positive feedback reviews and it is half the price of my previous product.  I am counting on it being the same or better than my previous product because of all the reviews I read!!</li>
            <li> I am protected in several ways with this serum but my skin is getting the best results.  I really look younger.</li>
            <li> It irritates my skin.  I requested for a return, and the seller required me to pay for the shipping.  This product is not made fresh.  When it comes it was already oxidized as the color of it was yellow.  A fresh Vitamin C should be clear color.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome.  I&#x27;m a 46 year old dude. I&#x27;ve used my wife&#x27;s expensive cream around my eyes with little help.  I read about this and had to try it. --- AWESOME I love it.  It makes a noticeable difference</li>
            <li> The Vitamin C Serum provided results as expected. I can tell a difference in my skin. My wrinkles are less pronounced and there is a healthy glow to my cheeks.</li>
            <li> Bought 2 bottles hoping it would work over time....nope!   It also STINKS!   Don&#x27;t waste your money folks.</li>
            <li> The serum vitamin c is a revolutionary product to market my sister uses it 40 years and have seen incredible changes, especially in lines of facial expression she always used before going to work to look radiant and renewed.&lt;br /&gt;It is a low cost option aging and is not an invasive productive.</li>
            <li> This product is very good, it is thicker which is great for me a does exactly what is states. Witch this product will get the result you want to hydrate your skin. The serum vitamin C is a revolutionary product to marked, you can see incredible changes, specialy in facial expressions, is so amazing. I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This product in particular is very good. For a fairly cheap price, I would recommend this product for anyone contemplating using Vitamin C Serum, so i decided to give it a try. I am so glad i did.  I have used it for about a week now and have noticed disappearing wrinkles. It also absorbs fast and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my girlfriend, she told me that this product is very good because provides potent antioxidant protection, shielding skin from damaging free radicals—those pesky rogue molecules that promote premature aging.  In addition the vitamin C Serum provide a range of benefits that keep your skin younger-looking.</li>
            <li> The result of this Vitamin C Serum are just great. In a few weeks makes my body has a firmer appearance and makes my skin toned.&lt;br /&gt;I love it this Serum.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this Serum! Bought this for my mom for a Christmas gift and she has seen amazing results! Her dark marks have lightened and has less wrinkles!</li>
            <li> With this product will get the results you want to hydrate your skin as long as you forget the smell is a bit funky but does the job my wife is a doctor she recommends besides that uses preferably daily in the morning and before you go to sleep for best results on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;get ready for a softer and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Since I use this product my skin feels much smoother and it has much more vitality. I always loved supplement my feed and cared for my skin with products containing vitamins and minerals, I think that  it is great. I would recommend this product for anyone.</li>
            <li> I love this vitamin c serum, is the best one that i&#x27;ve tried, the way is applied on the skin is very good, actually is very stickier which makes it better to use it. It minimize and almost disappear the sun marks and the skin decoloration.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with the results. I am in my 50&#x27;s and have tried everything to minimize small lines on my face. This is the first product that worked for me. I didn&#x27;t expect the amazing results. Use it with rose water and your face will look amazing. I have dry skin and it didn&#x27;t dry my skin like most products I have tried. The serum absorbs well without any greasy feeling. It comes in a nice sized bottle and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Very good product. I totally recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Because my work, i am exposed to the sun for long time which origins many spots on my face&lt;br /&gt;The results of this Vitamin C Serum are amazing, in only two weeks, no more spots on my face.</li>
            <li> 25% Vitamin C Serum By Vitl, The Highest and Purest Grade Vitamin C Serum On The Market! Leaves Your Skin Beautiful and Radiant!    This medicine is perfect. I&#x27;ve used it since I was 22 years and the truth is perfect. I take it 3 times a day and it works. you have to have patience, I lasts approximately 2 months without seeing changes in my skin, but after they spent two months the results were incredible. I recommend it with my eyes closed. and I recommend taking as I do to see good results. You may be taking it lasts one month 3 times a day, but not very expensive.</li>
            <li> is a product that I recommend with confidence, it is the best currently on the market, I loved from the first moment you use the above had tried similar products but had not achieved the desired result, Vitamin C Serum By Vitl is amazing!</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with this product and I will use it for the rest of my life! For the first time in so long, I actually felt confident enough to leave my house without foundation. Men have been flirting with me everywhere I seem to go these days. A man approached me at the grocery store and told me I was a beautiful lady and that my husband is very lucky! I thought that was a fluke until my husband and I went shopping at a bath tile company and the owner told my husband how beautiful I was and then it happened again while my husband and I were were browsing at the mall. I literally had my hair in a ponytail with no make up whatsoever and a guy still went on and on about how beautiful my skin is. I felt so uncomfortable with the attention I was getting in front of my husband but definitely flattered. I swear I am not lying. This all happened within the last two weeks. My pores are barely noticeable and my skin is glowing! I will never stop using this</li>
            <li> Special. My mother&#x27;s skin, is perfect, hydrated and free of fat.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it because is very notable the change in her,&lt;br /&gt;and it is very positive. My little sister, uses too, and she is free acne,&lt;br /&gt;results are excellent. Buy it!</li>
            <li> Nothing about this product works.  It smells and is sticky. Not very effective.</li>
            <li> I am very glad I tried the serum 25% Vitamin C Serum For Vitl leaves my skin so soft and smooth. I use it once in the morning and once before bedtime for 3 weeks and have really noticed as I have spots on the face have become clearer and longer see me very little, really recommended.</li>
            <li> This product works really well. I have used it in combination with a Vitamin C toner and I like the results on my face. No breakouts, and both products smell really great. I use it for anti aging. I have some fine lines around my mouth that I do not want to get worse and they seem to be getting better. I&#x27;m about 3 weeks in and will update in about 3 more weeks if I change my mind. But so far so good!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy for this product. After using this product my skin sentie much smoother and younger. Also I have sensitive skin and this serum helps me so that I do not irritate the skin at all. Strongly recommended for anyone who lack vitamin C and want more in your body the way</li>
            <li> just beautifull refults for the right price.. i bought this inicialy for my wife( she wanted and i buyed.. like always) we take the serum vitamin becouse a friend of us recommended like the best product of this type evere. And he wa not wrong! simply amazed.</li>
            <li> I also have a problem with the way it smells but it&#x27;s not terrible just funky as one person mentioned. Other than that I like the way it works and the redness is disappearing. I haven&#x27;t noticed a lot of improvement on the wrinkles but if that changes I will edit my review. I will buy it again for sure!</li>
            <li> Vitamin c is so good for your skin. I use this in combination with the retinol cream and together it works great!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my wife. She loves to try out products like these, she said that after a month of use she has noticed less expression lines and the wrinkles around her eyes have easily faded away.. She loved how small the bottles was, easy enough to carry when going out of town..She&#x27;s purchase 2 more every time she runs out, the price is also very affordable. She recommends this product to every one, for as little as 20 bucks you can get one that lasts months..</li>
            <li> I started adding Vitamin C Serum into my skin care routine last year, shortly after I turned 38. I&#x27;ve tried several brands and while I&#x27;ve fortunately not had any bad experiences, I have had some outstanding experiences, and this brand is one of those. I had some fine lines just starting to make an appearance, and I&#x27;ve managed to stave them off and even make them retreat by using Vitamin C Serum in conjunction with good cleansers and moisturizers. I&#x27;ve actually had people tell me that I look like I&#x27;m still in my 20s – I assume they&#x27;re exaggerating, but the compliments are still nice to hear!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of those products where the longer you use it (and the more consistent you are with your usage), the better your results will be. That being said, even after just three weeks of using this brand I&#x27;m very pleased with the results. My skin can be somewhat sensitive and this Vitamin C Serum hasn&#x27;t caused any irritation or breakouts whatsoever. The texture of my skin is smoother and has a healthier look to it – less dull and saggy is probably the best way to explain it. So I&#x27;m getting all the expected benefits of a Vitamin C Serum, with none of the potential issues or problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions for use on the box are clear and concise, and the company also follows up the order with a &amp;#34;best practices&amp;#34; email to help you use the serum properly and effectively, which I really appreciate. My personal routine, which seems to be working very well, is to wash my face with a cleansing brush when I get up in the morning, followed by a toner, and then apply the Vitamin C serum. You don&#x27;t need to use much (less is more, as OZ Naturals states right in the follow-up email). I then follow up immediately afterwards with eye gel and moisturizer. I&#x27;ve heard that a lot of women get really great results using a derma roller in conjunction with Vitamin C Serum, but I just haven&#x27;t had the courage to put needles on my face yet – thankfully, this serum shows positive results even without that added step. I also use a 5% hyaluronic acid serum (followed again by eye gel and moisturizer) right before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest review; all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Of all of the vitamin c serums I have bought and tried myself, this one is the only one I will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> 100% recomended! This gave me a new clearly and beautiful skin! with no side effects and it´s very cheap, since the first time i use it, the people ask me for my secret, all thanks to this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this product! people said my skin looked good and I could see the difference. I would recommend!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t possibly know how  great this works until you have tried it.</li>
            <li> I am almost done with the bottle and the few dark spots on my face haven&#x27;t changed in appearance. But my skin does feel smoother.</li>
            <li> Incredible product.  Works for both men and women.</li>
            <li> Vital product works!! I&#x27;ve used this product and my skin feels soft and clear. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I like this product. I wanted something basic and natural to put on my face daily. I use this every other day in the evenings. My skin feels soft and tight. I think this is a great product and I would buy again.</li>
            <li> My husband and I are using this oil and it works for us. We are willing to accept the fragrance, different but not objectionable, and the stickiness because it works better then the moisturizers and organics that we have used in the past. Vitamin C is an antioxidant and I think it also acts as a nutrient for the skin. We like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been the type of person who has facial blemishes and dry skin, but after buying this product all change, now i have a bright  and clean skin.&lt;br /&gt;The results are surprising and so quickly!!&lt;br /&gt;With no side effects at all!</li>
            <li> Vitamin C contributes to many body functions , including iron absorption . Large doses of vitamin C does not usually cause toxicity because , being a water-soluble vitamin , it is simply excreted through the urine , is a vitamin that can not fail to take as it helps us keep locked inmologico system prevents respiratory infections helps us heal. is recommended by all doctors . and this is an excellent presentation</li>
            <li> I have not used a Vitamin C serum before so I can&#x27;t compare it to other brands.  This serum is slightly sticky and dries tacky initially, however when I wake in the morning my skin is smooth. It has a slight smell which dissipates when it dries.  I have also layered a sleep mask over it and my skin looks very nice in the morning.</li>
            <li> I have been using v25 for nearly a week and I am very pleased with the results so far. I particularly like the fact that my skin is more supple, and that the product doesn&#x27;t have  a strong &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; odor or leave an oily residue sitting on my face like most moisturizers will. I do not have many wrinkles for my age (47 years old) or sagging skin, but I anticipate an even healthier, more radiant complexion in weeks to come! And the product is much more economical than other products I&#x27;ve tried. So glad I made this purchase!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every morning and night with no result since I received them 2 months ago</li>
            <li> i have not been using this product that long,but i use it everyday and i can it is working and my skin feels better already .i will keep using this product.</li>
            <li> This product is very sticky and smells terrible.  I tried it because the wording in the add made it seem awesome but it is terrible.  So i will stick with the one i always buy has a wonderful smell and goes on amazing&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C Serum For Face By Isabis Formulae</li>
            <li> As time goes by young good looking goes with it. Rejuvenate with 25% Vitamin C Serum and have your young good looking back in time.</li>
            <li> This product is just OK. The smell is not pleasing!</li>
            <li> Been usin itbfor years an wouldntb suggest anything else</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and was pleased this serum did not sting nor irritate my skin. No red rash or peeling either. The most visible effects are seen after fresh applications, which is pleasing.</li>
            <li> Amazing product works great</li>
            <li> Y&#x27;all! Have you tried this product before? Will you be interested in purchasing your skin a gift? If so, I strongly recommend 25% Vitamin C Serum By Vitl. However, there is a &amp;#34;Buyers Beware&amp;#34; placed on this product. The B.B. (for short) is highly potent and addictive. Once your skin tries it on, it will never want to be washed again. Seriously folks! This product is one of the best out there for purchase. Try it. Your beautiful, healthy, radiant, soft, and younger looking skin will thank you over and over again. Thank you for allowing me the pleasure of sharing my review. This product is a God Send! A miracle. I will forever use it and recommend it.</li>
            <li> This seems like a good choice for fighting aging.  Vitamin C has so many health benefits using it to fight the signs of aging seems to be a good option.  The consistency would make it easier to apply and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> This product performs as promised.  I have been using it for a few weeks now and have noticed a difference in my skin.  I use it alone at night with a moisturizer on top and  I use it during the day with Hyaluronic Acid  and a moisturizer. I have noticed my crow&#x27;s feet are dramatically reduced and my skin is much softer and brighter.  I think it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I have used several different Vitamin C serums over the past year and I really am liking this one. I have been using it for about 2 weeks and the biggest thing I have noticed so far is increased moisture. It has been such a dry winter where I am and this has really made my skin look and feel much more hydrated. I will definitely continue to use.&lt;br /&gt;I also like that there isn&#x27;t much of an oder to it. I don&#x27;t like to use anything on my face with fragrance because I break out fairly easy.</li>
            <li> Take a look at the reviewers &amp;#34;other reviews&amp;#34;.  Curious that several of them have reviewed the same 5 products!!  I have come to really rely on Amazon reviews, and this is very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I love that it is slightly thicker than most serums. Much easier to apply. It has a nice light smell to it. Not bothersome to me at all. My face feels smoother after the first bottle. I have very deep wrinkles around my eyes, I have noticed they are getting less noticeable. I will recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> I love this serum! The coloring on my cheeks was very uneven and I had fine lines around my eyes. My skin tone is much more even (and brighter!) and my wrinkles around my eyes have disappeared. It is great!!</li>
            <li> this product was so good, people asked me if I used a new makeup,thank you</li>
            <li> My wife and I both are using this serum because it makes our skin glow.  I have read in a few reviews that it smells funny but I beg to&lt;br /&gt;differ.  This is a natural product and it smells like it should.  It is a vitamin&lt;br /&gt;serum and it actually works so well.  If you want a perfume smelling product?  Well they just don&#x27;t work like this does.</li>
            <li> I found this product to be exactly what it says it is. I will continue to use it for a long time.</li>
            <li> This is my second  bottle of Vitamin C Serum by Viti.  Unfortunately, I clumsily spilled half the first.  I had tried another much more expensive serum and then searched reviews for another.  So glad to have found this!  Potent yet feels great on my skin.  The price point is excellent considering the strength in comparison to others. Won&#x27;t be without it again!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I use it with hyaluronic acid. My skin is smoother and has a glow.  Great product,great price !</li>
            <li> The serum is exactly what I expected- thick and concentrated and not watered down. One bottle lasts a long time and is easy to apply. Best of all the results are immediate, glowing even refreshing and protecting. Glad I discovered this product as it beats more expensive products with less concentration of vitamin C. I find it Vitl to my skin care program! (pun intented!) Cheers!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s and I have been looking for good anti-aging products and I found this amazing serum.  I don&#x27;t put a lot of chemicals on my skin because I have acne issues.  But I&#x27;ve been using Vitl for the last 4 months or so every morning and night and my skin feels tighter than before I started using it.  I do a lot of research on products before I put them on my face or body, and the Vitamin C really helps boost the collagen in skin. My husband started using it as well after he saw how nice my skin looked.  I&#x27;m on my 4th bottle right now and I will definitely continue to use this serum in my everyday facial regimen. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good priced anti-aging product.</li>
            <li> I like it and it&#x27;s not oily.</li>
            <li> It works wonders on me I just love it... &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Gave to a friend as a gift...she liked it.</li>
            <li> Love this product, I really like the feel as you put it on and how it leaves your skin.</li>
            <li> Good product. It holds to my fingertips very easily. Have been using it for a few days now and I am pleased with what I see. Price was a good driving force that made me purchase this. The downside is the smell and stickiness as many users have commented above.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I&#x27;m using it preventatively, so I don&#x27;t see any noticeable differences in fine lines, etc (I didn&#x27;t have any to begin with), but my skin feels and looks great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a strange smell to this product, but it dissipates quickly and isn&#x27;t especially strong. Most of the time, I don&#x27;t even notice it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Since purchasing the Vitamin C Serum, I have seen an improvement to my face. I have wrinkles under my eye and on my forehead. I have been looking and looking for a product that could help. When I came across this Vitamin C Serum and noticed that it was the #1 Best Seller I went through other reviews and figured it was worth a shot. I needed help with wrinkles at 28 years old! I was desperate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say the scent isn&#x27;t as bad as I expected. I have come across some pretty nasty smelling serums which made me stop using them alone. I have been using this specific one for a while now and have nothing negative to say. I have seen improvement and will say it is worth the money. I also understand now why it is considered a best selling product.</li>
            <li> My son told me that I look great.  He said I look years younger.  That is enough for me.  I will buy this for the long haul.</li>
            <li> I love everything vitamin C.  I take Vitamin C daily and can definitely see the results in my immune system.  I am glad that I tried the serum, it leaves my skin feeling so soft and smooth.  I use it once in the morning and once before bed.  I have added it to my beauty arsenal and will be stocking up on in product in the future.  I have also recommended this to anyone that could use a little moisture boost this winter for their skin.</li>
            <li> I love its smell is maintained for several hours.. all the persons need vitamin C i recommend this! and dont get  irritations</li>
            <li> Since i have been taking this vitamin C compared to others, i can tell the difference. My friends started to tell me that i look like i am glowing. Great product. Easy to use. Great for the skin.</li>
            <li> This oil is pleasant to use, goes on easily and absorbs quickly, and leaves my skin very moist and healthy looking.  I have seen an improvement in the overall condition of my skin.</li>
            <li> I really love this product. I&#x27;m starting to take care of myself by my own and I see this and bought it for trying, for me it works.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girlfriend, She loves it! it goes on smooth and left her skin feeling smoother then ever. I even found myself using it and I have to say I&#x27;m surprised I will definitely be buying this for her again, and maybe even one for myself! recommend it as a gift or even for personal use.</li>
            <li> Good Product--- gradually helps lighten facial pigmentation.    Gets good comments from friends and family  about skin tone.</li>
            <li> Very poor product, made me break out, will not use again. This should be advertised as skin burning serum. It will take weeks for my skin to heal:( I was not expecting that. List of ingredients was impressive but do not use it twice daily as the directions state.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a decent vitamin C product and this one suits me perfectly. Been using for a couple weeks by now and the benefits are already showing up, my skin is getting better. If you want to improve your body I highly recommend taking vitamin C and this product offers the perfect solution.</li>
            <li> Is great to make you look young again. I have two children and this has done wonders for the wrinkles kids give you from stress. It is worth the price to make you look great and feel better.</li>
            <li> A thicker, easier to apply, serum that has helped to hide wrinkles, aging spots, and freckles. I tried other products that were so watery they didn&#x27;t make my skin feel any different after I used it. This product has a slight scent I am not fond of but I could not ask for a product to give me any better results. If you want smooth skin with fewer blemishes, try this product!</li>
            <li> Too soon to give an honest answer, however, I am applying the vitamin C Serum and the Hyaluronic Acide Serum together as instructed. So far, I am quite happy.</li>
            <li> Even though the smell isnt all that pleasant,  this is a great product. It is affordable too. Most skim care products like this one are so expensive to buy and you have to keep buying and using them.once you start. That eats away at your wallet. This product works just as well but at a better price. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> good products, gives good results. meets all my need and at a price I can afford.</li>
            <li> Very good product, the smell is funky but overall worth the money.  shipping was very quick</li>
            <li> This product With just a week of using it has left my beautiful, radiant skin. Excellent texture that helps when applied to the face, is easy to use. Excellent product with the properties of vitamin C has left my perfect skin. I recommend ...</li>
            <li> I would buy this product to my breast and has helped a lot because you feel more rejuvenated his face both fine lines and physically I feel very satisfied with this audando by my mother sentirce most beautiful and quiet with your body ...</li>
            <li> Really good product. A friend of mine told me that I had to try it. At first i thought it wasn&#x27;t going to work, but then I try it for a few weeks and the results were totally satisfying.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love Vitamin C? I love it in my orange juice and in my fruits and vegetables. I only recently in the last 6 months found out that people apply it in topical form to their face to reduce the signs of aging and prevent further wrinkles and spots. It is free from parabens, fillers, alcohol, artificial colors and fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s Amazing!!! I feel beatiful!</li>
            <li> Perfection for my face. Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> After using v25 day and night for 4 days I think it is a good product.  Just a few drops go a long way and my skin feels smooth and soft after applying.</li>
            <li> After using v25 day and night for 4 days I think it is a good product. Just a few drops go a long way and my skin feels smooth and soft after applying</li>
            <li> I bought this product on January 29, 2015, since I have been using it, I have noticed the difference in its consistency and the way it adheres to the skin, it doesn&#x27;t burn when you apply it, like my experience with other vitamin C products and it stays put.  My skin looks healthier and brighter, smoother,  I get compliments all the time.  I&#x27;m so impressed by this product I just reorder another bottle  to make sure I don&#x27;t run out of it.  I would like to know if your company has more products, this is really the best Vitamin C serum I have tried and you can track my orders with Amazon, I am very satisfied with it and I highly recommended to anyone who needs a boost in their skin.</li>
            <li> The product works wonderful. I am amazed on how  two drops go such a long way. I will definitely be purchasing the product again.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased V25 and I can&#x27;t be more pleased and excited. I immediately noticed a lessening of my crow&#x27;s feet and a much better texture to my skin.. Definitely five stars</li>
            <li> Great serum! My sister-in-law ordered this and said it works wonders, she started seeing a huge difference in her skin. Less dryness and feels great!!!</li>
            <li> I gave this for my mother in law and she keeps hounding me for more ( so she can go out )</li>
            <li> I have such radiant, glowing skin almost immediately starting this product! I am a busy working mom...no time to get out in the sun and don&#x27;t need fine lines or wrinkles! Problem solved...doesn&#x27;t smell great! The end justifies the means!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Feels very smooth.  Totally recommend it to anyone who is looking for a great vitamin C serum!</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t see a difference in 25% vitamin C as opposed to 20%.  I do think vitamin C products make a difference. Just like with any skin care one must be consistent.</li>
            <li> I used to use Vitamin C for years and got a way from using it both related to moving and not seeing same esthetician and cost. I decided due to wrinkles under eyes and dark circles I should have never stopped using (now 52 y.o.). I&#x27;m very pleased after a month the circles, puffiness and wrinkles have improved.  I won&#x27;t stop this time and will keep using this product. I&#x27;ve definitely expanded to use on other areas of face and décolletage.</li>
            <li> Love the product.  This is my second time of ordering it and plan to do so again once I finish this bottle.  Skin is so soft.  I&#x27;m over 60.</li>
