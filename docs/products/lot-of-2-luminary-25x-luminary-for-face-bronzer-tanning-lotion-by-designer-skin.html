            <li>and it smells nice.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the price</li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very light.  </li>
            <li>I also love the bottle :)</li>
            <li>LOVE THE SMELL OF THIS LOTION BEFORE AND AFTER TANNING.</li>

            <li>I love this tanning lotion.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed a quick tan, smells nice, and</li>
            <li>After you tan, it leaves you with a very sweet scent called Champagne Fizz.  </li>
            <li>Received this quickly and love using it.</li>
            <li>I AM LIGHT SKIN</li>
            <li>I was super excited when i found it on Amazon for</li>
            <li>The smell of the lotion reminds me of perfume :) The lotion goes in really well</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s why we go to Amazon to get it at a more reasonable price</li>
            <li>It gets you so dark also and smells amazing!</li>
            <li>leaves you soft and tan :)</li>
            <li>, right?  </li>
            <li>If you have extremely dry skin like me, I would suggest also getting an after-tan moisturizer for later to really get the best results.  </li>
            <li>I could do without the little pieces of glitter that come off the outside of the bottle, but the lotion is awesome.</li>
            <li>The price is so much cheaper than in tanning salons!</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE Luminary not only because it helps delay the effects of aging</li>
            <li>(less is more) and leaves my skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li>This was a waste of money, the cheap stuff from the drug store work better</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t care for the smell of the facial tanner smelled kind of like burbon but other than that its fine</li>
            <li>it helps tan my face really well .</li>
            <li>The salon I&#x27;ve been going to really suggested Designer Skin Luminary  </li>
            <li>Received the package really fast and even though the fully body lotion was wrapped in a plastic container, I broke out one of my packets to check for consistency.  </li>
            <li>This is the real product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling very soft also.</li>
            <li>but I have a sensitive face</li>

            <li> It has a silicone emulsion and goes on like silk and disappears, no greasy or wet after-feel.  </li>
            <li> So I love that this product goes on like silk, tans you like CRAZY, and disappears into your skin, and leaves no residue on your clothes!  </li>
            <li> was kinda skeptical about buying this at first</li>
            <li> It had dried lotion all around the top: (</li>
            <li> If you sweat a lot during the summer (or any other time like me), this is the line of lotions to use!  </li>
            <li> less then half of what i paid before.</li>

            <li> I always get so dark when I use it!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel smoother and silkier than any other bronzer I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I am almost everyday).</li>
            <li> I got my tanning lotion in less then a week!</li>
            <li> You can save at least $10 buying from ebay.</li>
            <li> I am very pale, and this lotion does WONDERS for me!  </li>
            <li> Lotions make me sweat worse because I am so &#x27;hot-natured&#x27;.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These people are amazing. I got my tanning lotion in less then a week! the packaging was great and i LOVE the product!</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money, the cheap stuff from the drug store work better and I didn&#x27;t see a difference using the face one but I have a sensitive face</li>
            <li> I have bought this before and it was great! it  does not leave a gross feeling or anything and it smells good.  it helps tan my face really well . it has a sparkle in the lotion so it looks really good but doesn&#x27;t leave a glittery look when put on. I also love the bottle :)</li>
            <li> When I was looking at these items to buy, the seller says that you will get a lot of 2 luminary 25x plus the face bronzer, making you think that you will be receiving 3 items. While reading more the seller continues to false advertise this item. It was until after I already purchased the item that I started to think that maybe, just maybe I am not receiving what I THOUGHT I was buying. I contacted the seller, but did not receive a response.  I would say DO NOT BUY from this seller or this item. You can save at least $10 buying from ebay.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin and I&#x27;ve noticed a quick tan, smells nice, and no burns which is great :)</li>
            <li> LOVE THE SMELL OF THIS LOTION BEFORE AND AFTER TANNING. I AM LIGHT SKIN AND THIS LOTION WORKS GREAT FOR ME</li>
            <li> Received this quickly and love using it. I am 62. Tans beautifully when I&#x27;m outside(which I am almost everyday). Great smell, too!! I use this year-round. Leaves skin feeling very soft also. Great service! A+</li>
            <li> i LOVE this lotion, it is my favorite. I always get so dark when I use it! big fan, going on my third year of using this product. never disappoints. leaves you soft and tan :)</li>
            <li> The smell of the lotion reminds me of perfume :) The lotion goes in really well and no after tan smell afterwards</li>
            <li> Fast shipping great product</li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotion.  I could do without the little pieces of glitter that come off the outside of the bottle, but the lotion is awesome.</li>
            <li> I received only the body lotion sealed. The face cream was open &amp; even looked used. It had dried lotion all around the top: (</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product! The price is so much cheaper than in tanning salons! It gets you so dark also and smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I have used this product before but had got it from the tanning salon and paid over $100.00 just for the body lotion. I was super excited when i found it on Amazon for less then half of what i paid before. As soon as i got it in the mail i went tanning. it is the same stuff you can buy in the salon and it gives you amazing color and it smells nice.</li>
            <li> OMG I love this stuff!!!!  Luminary is probably the best tanning bed lotion I have used to date!  It has a silicone emulsion and goes on like silk and disappears, no greasy or wet after-feel.  If you sweat a lot during the summer (or any other time like me), this is the line of lotions to use!  Lotions make me sweat worse because I am so &#x27;hot-natured&#x27;.  So I love that this product goes on like silk, tans you like CRAZY, and disappears into your skin, and leaves no residue on your clothes!  FYI, I do not tan. I am very pale, and this lotion does WONDERS for me!  Darkest tan I&#x27;ve ever had!  If you have extremely dry skin like me, I would suggest also getting an after-tan moisturizer for later to really get the best results.  I also like the Black after-tan extender is this same line of products because it also has a gradual tanner in it with no smell because it has no DHA, they use walnut extract.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel smoother and silkier than any other bronzer I&#x27;ve used in the past. The smell is wonderful.</li>
            <li> was kinda skeptical about buying this at first cuz i didnt want to buy a knockoff. but when it came in we compared the consistency and scent of the previous one we got from the salon and the amazon one and it seemed legit... my wife seems to be happy with her tan too so i would recommend the seller!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten back to tanning for the summer and for my upcoming trip to the Bahamas.  The challenge I have is finding lotions that goes well with my sensitive skin. The salon I&#x27;ve been going to really suggested Designer Skin Luminary  and I did try the packets.  I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the price but that&#x27;s why we go to Amazon to get it at a more reasonable price, right?  Received the package really fast and even though the fully body lotion was wrapped in a plastic container, I broke out one of my packets to check for consistency.  This product does have the same consistency as well as smell and feel the same on my skin. This is the real product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I absolutely LOVE Luminary not only because it helps delay the effects of aging but it also firms the skin.  It goes on very smoothly (less is more) and leaves my skin silky smooth. After you tan, it leaves you with a very sweet scent called Champagne Fizz.  To me, it smells like watermelon and it&#x27;s very light.  I also like the Face Bronzer but I kinda wished it had the same scent.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t care for the smell of the facial tanner smelled kind of like burbon but other than that its fine</li>
