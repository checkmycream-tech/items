            <li> Not reversed polarity as stated. Needed a longer pos. Connection. Great value compared to others.</li>
            <li> Great Product and a great price</li>
            <li> My B&amp;S 15hp 10kw generator called for a reverse polarity battery. This one is an exact replacement at a great price. It worked perfect.</li>

            <li> I ordered the wrong model battery (XRP) for my generator but by making a new cable it worked as it should.</li>
            <li> This was for my generator the one that came with lasted 5 years so I hope this one does as good fast shipping</li>
            <li> We looked everywhere for a replacement battery for our generator to no avail. Found it on Amazon good price with free shipping.  3 days later we needed to use the generator because power was out.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the speed of delivery with my battery . 1st one actually came damaged and with just a couple photos they had me another one within just a couple days . Recommend highly ...</li>
            <li> This was the answer I was looking for! It is for my generator which is used for my welder. Perfect! It is an exact match.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit, worked instantly</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t what I ordered  the one I ordered was not reverse polarity, just a cp12180xrp .....was not usable at all in my generator.</li>
            <li> works as advertised no more hand cranking my generator</li>
            <li> The original battery was manufactured by Center Power Tech Co. LTD and shows the word &amp;#34;Vision&amp;#34;  on it which this exact battery is shown in the photo.  However, the battery I received apparently is not made by the same manufacturer and doesn&#x27;t say &amp;#34;Vision&amp;#34; on it but is the same model number and has the same specs.

Other than that, I would love it though I just purchased it and haven&#x27;t been able to truly evaluate its performance yet.</li>
            <li> All is working well and it fit perfect.  We&#x27;ll see if it can last a winter thought.  Time will tell.</li>
            <li> Dropped it in my generator. Fired right up.</li>
            <li> If you own one of the larger Troy Bilt mobile power generators, this is the replacement battery to get it to start every time.</li>
            <li> The battery that arrived was the same as the battery that was pictured.  Works great! Recommended.</li>

            <li> Exact fit in briggs and stratton generator</li>
            <li> I got this as a replacement for a Briggs 7000W generator. It was the exact battery that I was removing. The old one last almost 4 years being left on float charge the whole time.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and fit perfect</li>
            <li> It was an exact replacement for my generator battery. The non-Reverse Polarity batteries would have required modifications to the wiring.</li>
