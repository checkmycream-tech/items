    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>They have done a great job!</li>
            <li>This is an excellent shave cream for a close shave with almost zero irritation...</li>
            <li>probably one of the best I&#x27;ve tried in that respect.  </li>
            <li>Oh, by the way, Every Man Jack Signature Mint face lotion is the best you will find, ever...</li>
            <li>This was a gift and he as very happy with it.</li>
            <li>A wonderful product.</li>
            <li>Perfectly slippery.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for the shower.</li>
            <li>but this stuff isn&#x27;t all that great.  </li>
            <li>Great product over all.</li>
            <li>Even the gels are drying and not that great.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Great buy.</li>
            <li>Great at preventing burn and ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>Great consistency.</li>
            <li>Nice fragrances and very safe - no phthalates or parabens!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, for what it is..</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cremo Astonishingly Superior Shave Cream 6 oz&lt;</li>
            <li>Based on the reviews, this looked good.</li>
            <li>That stuf is amazing, and when comparing this to Aveda, I have to give this a 4 star.</li>
            <li>Washes off nicely, and you don&#x27;t need an aftershave lotion to soothe your face.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always looked for and use the cream kind.  </li>
            <li>It does gunk up on the blade though, so those multi-blade disposable blades probally won&#x27;t play nice with this.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what the others are doing to get good shaves, but for me this was a huge miss.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, but not quite my kind of shaving cream.</li>
            <li>The shave cream (which is more like a gel) does not rinse off well from the blades.  </li>
            <li>You also get more in the can.  </li>
            <li>I do notice that the blade clogs up a bit more with the EMJ</li>
            <li>That anyone reviews this product as acceptable documents the uselessness of many reviews and reviewers.]</li>
            <li>I also use the after shave lotion and love it as well.</li>
            <li>If you are in the same boat this works excellently.</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite cream for three or four years now.</li>
            <li>The C.O Bigelow had a rich (but not foamy) lather that covered nicely.</li>
            <li>It is cheaper than most and travels easily.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t give many one or two star ratings, but this was an easy grade to assign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>better than Kiehl&#x27;s  and a much better value.&lt;br /&gt;There should be a travel size available.</li>
            <li>Great cream, and love that I don&#x27;t have to mess with a good lather.</li>
            <li>Other than that awesome product.</li>
            <li>The Cremo would work fine as an every-day shave cream  for me.</li>
            <li>but fine, I guess \\&quot;cream\\&quot; needn&#x27;t be required to form foam.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use these days- makes a huge difference in preventing discomfort or the appearance thereof.</li>
            <li>This product ensures a smooth, close shave without burns or nicks.  </li>
            <li>The difference primarily comes in the creams themselves.</li>
            <li>that out of the way, I&#x27;d just like to say that this product has given me a fantastic shave time and time again.  </li>
            <li>I liked the eucalyptus scent, though it was not as nice if you happened to get it in your mouth, and it left a tingly sensation.</li>
            <li>In addition the stuff tends to clog up my razor pretty quickly and has kind of a greasy icing consistency.  </li>
            <li>The Cremo too had a nice lather and a pleasant, more subtle scent.</li>
            <li>I have fairly sensitive skin and shave with a double edge safety razor and this works perfectly.</li>
            <li>It gives you a very smooth and clean shave and reduces irritation very well.</li>
            <li>have to admit that I felt all three provided a nice smooth shave, I can&#x27;t say that I noticed anything different about the end result of my shave in terms of closeness or smooth skin.</li>
            <li>Some guys can go a week or more and not get as much of a beard as I do in one day.  </li>
            <li>The scent is extremely mild to absent, I&#x27;ve never detected even a whiff of mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For now tho, if you want a cheap alternative to conventional shave creams, and a good skin conditioner, give this a shot..</li>
            <li>Maybe it would be a good choice for a single blade razor?</li>
            <li>My favorite shave is using Nivea Sensitive Skin Shave Cream.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re thinking of changing shaving products, its definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, EMJ gives a nice smooth shave; at least as good as the Clinique and much better than any other non-lathering brands I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>It has kind of a clay/yeast smell to it which makes your skin feel dry even though its not.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely hot water in my house (hot water heater turned to max).  </li>
            <li>Even on light one day old stubble, my razor dragged and skipped all over my face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fourth, or maybe it is a combination of the first three issues, the cream does not smear well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m dead honest when I say regular canned goo provides much better lubrication.</li>
            <li>So I really wanted to like this stuff since it&#x27;s relatively inexpensive and an easy find at Target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a thick beard, very sensitive skin and have been using this for 2+ years and am happy with it as well as the post shave face lotion.</li>
            <li>The Every Man Jack had a texture that felt more like a skin lotion and not much of a lather.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Try the Real Shave cream</li>
            <li>Really.</li>
            <li>It sticks to my shaver too much</li>
            <li>Very effective.&lt;br /&gt;Much</li>
            <li>A very thin coat is all that is needed, incredible at eliminating friction.  </li>
            <li>and it takes a second or two longer to rinse clean.  </li>
            <li>&quot; shave cream, to compare, and sure enough it performed ok as a shave cream, in contrast to EMJ&#x27;s failure.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Kind of hard to get off the razor.</li>
            <li>I mean, it makes your skin feel nice and yes, works decent as a shave cream.</li>
            <li>If you are having trouble make sure you use lots of hot water on your face prior to shaving.  </li>
            <li>I find it pretty funny that some of the other reviewers can&#x27;t get it to &amp;#34;work&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>And after a razor stroke it didn&#x27;t always feel like it left enough lubrication to go over the same area more than once or twice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Regular shaving foam always dries out my face and seems kind of pointless to me.  </li>
            <li>I am someone that has extra sensitive skin, so I am very particular when it comes to my shaving routine.</li>
            <li>The problem is that it gets between the blades of a multiblade razor and won&#x27;t clear out when you try to rinse it off.</li>
            <li>It does gob up the razor edges while using it, a little hard to rinse it even with a blast of hot water from the tap, so I keep an old toothbrush handy.</li>
            <li>only positive thing I can really say about EMJ is that it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, it doesn&#x27;t rinse easily off my face, hands or the razor, and hot water works little better than cold water for rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I normally use Edge gel and thought I&#x27;d try something different.</li>
            <li>I regularly use Clinique, Proraso and Speick shaving creams, as I like variety and am always on the lookout for something new to try.  </li>
            <li>I have a really thick facial hair and shave most every day.  </li>
            <li>major problem</li>
            <li>A huge difference from even the past shave creams that we&#x27;ve purchased at local stores.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t even need to lather, but just work right on; it&#x27;s so smooth and not messy like traditional (and expensive!)</li>
            <li>I tried shaving using a lot of EMJ cream, a little cream; I tried mixing with lots of water and little water; I even tried it on top of glycerin shave soap but the results were the same.</li>

            <li> I have a really thick facial hair and shave most every day.  </li>
            <li> major problem</li>

            <li> Goes a long way and very economical but not a good shaving experience.  </li>
            <li> I use a double or single blade razor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m planning to use it up solely for the reason that it is amusing how badly</li>
            <li> Then just apply a super thin coat, and shave away!</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount to get a close shave.  </li>
            <li> It costs less than Edge Gel</li>
            <li> and you get a closer shave with much less irritation.  </li>
            <li> I think I would get the Cremo again because I like a less scented and less tingly feeling shave.</li>
            <li> Cold or hot water...</li>
            <li> I had difficulty finding my usual shave cream (tube variety, not from a can), and decided to look at some reviews of other shave creams and to try these three and compare:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It forms little globs that resist forming an even surface covering on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fifth</li>
            <li> Its hard to work with and is nearly impossible to get a decent later with.  </li>
            <li> No matter how thick or rough my beard -- even after weeks of not shaving -- this makes for the easiest</li>
            <li> Since I found this one a few years ago, I haven&#x27;t used anything else.  </li>
            <li> It is very similar to the Clinique Cream Shave - goes on as a thin cream and doesn&#x27;t lather up.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t perform anywhere near my expectations.</li>
            <li> And you can get it at Target usually or Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Left me with some pretty nasty ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> It is not supposed to lather, duh.  </li>
            <li> A thin layer applied to the skin is all</li>
            <li> , least painful shave I have ever had.    </li>
            <li> I tried this stuff every way I could think of but every shave was extremely uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start this by commenting on some of the bad reviews for this product, complaining that you cannot build a lather.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s just retarded.    </li>
            <li> and I really hate that.</li>

            <li> I like their aftershave but this stuff isn&#x27;t all that great.  Its hard to work with and is nearly impossible to get a decent later with.  It has kind of a clay/yeast smell to it which makes your skin feel dry even though its not.  In addition the stuff tends to clog up my razor pretty quickly and has kind of a greasy icing consistency.  I wouldn&#x27;t go for it.</li>
            <li> My husband loves all of the every man jack products. They have done a great job! Nice fragrances and very safe - no phthalates or parabens!</li>
            <li> Not a fan of the mint scent. It doesn&#x27;t smell minty at all. I prefer the unscented version.  Great product over all.</li>
            <li> This product simply works.  No matter how thick or rough my beard -- even after weeks of not shaving -- this makes for the easiest, least painful shave I have ever had.    Forget about those Art of Shaving products, which cost a fortune and must be used all together.  Who needs three or four shave products each day? That&#x27;s just retarded.    This product ensures a smooth, close shave without burns or nicks.  Washes off nicely, and you don&#x27;t need an aftershave lotion to soothe your face.    Try this product -- I hope they make it forever.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent shave cream for a close shave with almost zero irritation...probably one of the best I&#x27;ve tried in that respect.  The problem is that the shave cream builds up in between the blades of the shaver and traps all the dirt and hairs that come off of your face.  The shave cream (which is more like a gel) does not rinse off well from the blades.  I have extremely hot water in my house (hot water heater turned to max).  I rise the blades it the hottest scalding water I can get and the shave gel still won&#x27;t come out.  I use a Gillette Fusion razor and I replace the blades about once every 6 weeks (I shave every morning).  With this shave gel, because the blades don&#x27;t really rise well, the next time you go to use the shaver, you have dried gunk stuck on the blades.  This reduces the effectiveness of the blades which makes you have to throw them out sooner.  My favorite shave is using Nivea Sensitive Skin Shave Cream.  It costs less than Edge Gel and you get a closer shave with much less irritation.  You also get more in the can.  Nivea rises out in a snap, in any temperature water, so you can get on with your shower and your day.</li>
            <li> This stuff works well for me.  I find it pretty funny that some of the other reviewers can&#x27;t get it to &amp;#34;work&amp;#34;.  It is not supposed to lather, duh.  If you are having trouble make sure you use lots of hot water on your face prior to shaving.  Then just apply a super thin coat, and shave away!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, for what it is.. I mean, it makes your skin feel nice and yes, works decent as a shave cream. I&#x27;m just spoiled by Aveda. That stuf is amazing, and when comparing this to Aveda, I have to give this a 4 star. Would probably be a 5 if I wasn&#x27;t enlightened to the awesomeness of Aveda. For now tho, if you want a cheap alternative to conventional shave creams, and a good skin conditioner, give this a shot.. Oh, by the way, Every Man Jack Signature Mint face lotion is the best you will find, ever... Try it...</li>
            <li> A huge difference from even the past shave creams that we&#x27;ve purchased at local stores.  A very thin coat is all that is needed, incredible at eliminating friction.  It does gob up the razor edges while using it, a little hard to rinse it even with a blast of hot water from the tap, so I keep an old toothbrush handy.</li>
            <li> I had difficulty finding my usual shave cream (tube variety, not from a can), and decided to look at some reviews of other shave creams and to try these three and compare:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C.O. Bigelow Premium Shave Cream with Eucalyptus Oil 5.2 oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every Man Jack Shave Cream for All Skin Types-6.7 oz&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cremo Astonishingly Superior Shave Cream 6 oz&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit that I felt all three provided a nice smooth shave, I can&#x27;t say that I noticed anything different about the end result of my shave in terms of closeness or smooth skin. The difference primarily comes in the creams themselves. The C.O Bigelow had a rich (but not foamy) lather that covered nicely. I liked the eucalyptus scent, though it was not as nice if you happened to get it in your mouth, and it left a tingly sensation. The Cremo too had a nice lather and a pleasant, more subtle scent. The Every Man Jack had a texture that felt more like a skin lotion and not much of a lather. And after a razor stroke it didn&#x27;t always feel like it left enough lubrication to go over the same area more than once or twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall,  I would have to say I preferred the C.O. Bigelow and the Cremo. I think I would get the Cremo again because I like a less scented and less tingly feeling shave. The Cremo would work fine as an every-day shave cream  for me.</li>
            <li> I have a really thick facial hair and shave most every day.  Some guys can go a week or more and not get as much of a beard as I do in one day.  I use a double or single blade razor.  I really like this stuff.  Regular shaving foam always dries out my face and seems kind of pointless to me.  I don&#x27;t need lots of foam, just protection from razor burn.  Even the gels are drying and not that great.  I&#x27;ve always looked for and use the cream kind.  Since I found this one a few years ago, I haven&#x27;t used anything else.  You only need a small amount to get a close shave.  It is cheaper than most and travels easily.  And you can get it at Target usually or Amazon.  Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for the comments about clogging up the blades, I would say the problem is not this product but the user/technique.</li>
            <li> It is like gear lube.  Goes a long way and very economical but not a good shaving experience.  Try the Real Shave cream</li>
            <li> I regularly use Clinique, Proraso and Speick shaving creams, as I like variety and am always on the lookout for something new to try.  Picked up a tube of Every Man Jack at the grocery store recently.  It is very similar to the Clinique Cream Shave - goes on as a thin cream and doesn&#x27;t lather up.  I think the EMJ feels slicker than the Clinique; the razor blade just glides over my skin.  I do notice that the blade clogs up a bit more with the EMJ and it takes a second or two longer to rinse clean.  Otherwise, EMJ gives a nice smooth shave; at least as good as the Clinique and much better than any other non-lathering brands I&#x27;ve tried.  Considering the price, I&#x27;d choose Every Man Jack every time!</li>
            <li> Now foaming enough. Kind of hard to get off the razor. Other than that awesome product.</li>
            <li> Great product. Wife loves the smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start this by commenting on some of the bad reviews for this product, complaining that you cannot build a lather.  Like the name of the product says, it&#x27;s shave cream, not shave foam or shave lather.  A thin layer applied to the skin is all it takes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that out of the way, I&#x27;d just like to say that this product has given me a fantastic shave time and time again.  If you&#x27;re thinking of changing shaving products, its definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> So I really wanted to like this stuff since it&#x27;s relatively inexpensive and an easy find at Target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only positive thing I can really say about EMJ is that it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. But that&#x27;s about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The major problem: It provides no lubrication whatsoever. I&#x27;m dead honest when I say regular canned goo provides much better lubrication. I tried this stuff every way I could think of but every shave was extremely uncomfortable. I tried shaving using a lot of EMJ cream, a little cream; I tried mixing with lots of water and little water; I even tried it on top of glycerin shave soap but the results were the same. Even on light one day old stubble, my razor dragged and skipped all over my face. Left me with some pretty nasty ingrown hairs. I don&#x27;t know what the others are doing to get good shaves, but for me this was a huge miss.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m open to trying whatever oddity shows up on the grocery store shelves for something as trivial as shaving cream, so I tried EMJ signature mint shave cream.  I&#x27;m planning to use it up solely for the reason that it is amusing how badly it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it doesn&#x27;t lather at all - but fine, I guess \\&quot;cream\\&quot; needn&#x27;t be required to form foam.  Still, foaming would help make shaving work easier, encourage working it into the skin, marking unshaved area, and increasing the volume of the applied stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, it doesn&#x27;t rinse easily off my face, hands or the razor, and hot water works little better than cold water for rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, mint?  What mint?  The scent is extremely mild to absent, I&#x27;ve never detected even a whiff of mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth, or maybe it is a combination of the first three issues, the cream does not smear well.  It forms little globs that resist forming an even surface covering on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fifth (getting snarky here), EMJ sells pre-shave cream, shave cream, and post shave cream?  Seems like they are just pushing out anything they can think of without sticking to products that work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t give many one or two star ratings, but this was an easy grade to assign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[June 2014 - fascinated by the total dysfunctionality of this product, I used the entire tube, and my judgment remains the same - there is no reason to consider this a shaving cream, simply splashing water on my face would have worked just as well.  Further, I just got a tube of Nivea \\&quot;deep cleansing\\&quot; shave cream, to compare, and sure enough it performed ok as a shave cream, in contrast to EMJ&#x27;s failure.  That anyone reviews this product as acceptable documents the uselessness of many reviews and reviewers.]</li>
            <li> This is a cream, you wipe it on your beard, no lather, no foam. It gives you a very smooth and clean shave and reduces irritation very well. I have a thick beard, very sensitive skin and have been using this for 2+ years and am happy with it as well as the post shave face lotion.</li>
            <li> Great cream, and love that I don&#x27;t have to mess with a good lather. It does gunk up on the blade though, so those multi-blade disposable blades probally won&#x27;t play nice with this. I have fairly sensitive skin and shave with a double edge safety razor and this works perfectly. I also use the after shave lotion and love it as well.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine shaving with anything else. I am someone that has extra sensitive skin, so I am very particular when it comes to my shaving routine. If you are in the same boat this works excellently.</li>
            <li> Really. You don&#x27;t even need to lather, but just work right on; it&#x27;s so smooth and not messy like traditional (and expensive!) shaving gel and cream. Great buy.</li>
            <li> Great at preventing burn and ingrown hairs.  Only shaving cream I&#x27;ll use these days- makes a huge difference in preventing discomfort or the appearance thereof.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but not quite my kind of shaving cream. It sticks to my shaver too much and I really hate that.</li>
            <li> This was a gift and he as very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I normally use Edge gel and thought I&#x27;d try something different. Based on the reviews, this looked good. Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t perform anywhere near my expectations. The problem is that it gets between the blades of a multiblade razor and won&#x27;t clear out when you try to rinse it off. Cold or hot water...it made no difference. Maybe it would be a good choice for a single blade razor? I&#x27;ll use it up because I bought it, but it&#x27;s tempting to just throw it out.</li>
            <li> A wonderful product. Perfectly slippery. Great consistency. Very effective.&lt;br /&gt;Much better than Kiehl&#x27;s  and a much better value.&lt;br /&gt;There should be a travel size available.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of shaving creames over the years and because I like to shave in the shower I needed one that wasn&#x27;t in a can that would rust and I like the creames over the foam. This has been my favorite cream for three or four years now. It&#x27;s perfect for the shower.</li>
