            <li> so I will try again when I have a new solution to try.</li>
            <li> So I ended up mailing back a empty bottle.</li>
            <li> When I received it in the mail the body was empty.</li>
            <li> it would take the &amp;#34;tanning smell&amp;#34; away like previous posts said.. it may have a little but not like what I had hoped.  </li>
            <li> Anyways the second bottle was broken and leaking everywhere.</li>
            <li> After every spray with a lotion based primer, I would feel sticky for hours and couldn&#x27;t do anything except lay on towels on my bed while not moving until it dried</li>
            <li> not sure if I got charged for two?</li>
            <li> I was not happy with the solution I used with it</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  </li>
            <li> The spray nozzle ended up breaking :(...  </li>

            <li> Extremely fast shipping plus free samples of tanning lotions which was a great touch!</li>
            <li> This works great!  I use it because with any tanner I use, I get that &amp;#34;odor&amp;#34;... this eliminates the odor!</li>
            <li> This is a MUST have before any spray tan!!! I&#x27;ve never had a client complain, this is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> I bought one of these and was sent two... not sure if I got charged for two? Kind of strange. Anyways the second bottle was broken and leaking everywhere. Otherwise it smells really good and my clients seem to like it!</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite primer. My spray tan lasts so much longer and I don&#x27;t come out of the booth with that spray tan &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34;. After every spray with a lotion based primer, I would feel sticky for hours and couldn&#x27;t do anything except lay on towels on my bed while not moving until it dried but that&#x27;s not the case with Norvell&#x27;s primer. It dries much more quickly. I bought this last at the end of January and I have maybe 1/4 left. I&#x27;ve already put my next bottle in my Amazon Cart to order again.</li>
            <li> I apply this before each spray tan and the smell is amazing!! I would recommend this product. I can&#x27;t wait to order more!</li>
            <li> Makes the color go on even.</li>
            <li> Great prep spray in that it really does seem to make the tan darker.</li>
            <li> When I received it in the mail the body was empty. I tried to get a hold  of  someone but mailbox was full. So I ended up mailing back a empty bottle.</li>
            <li> This product does not help at all for moisture.&lt;br /&gt;I found a very light Nivea lotion that works better &amp; holds the moisture, plus color.</li>
            <li> This item arrived quickly and was as described.  I have only used once and cannot be sure if it helped extend the tan or not.  I was not happy with the solution I used with it so I will try again when I have a new solution to try.</li>
            <li> I use a custom spray machine so I tried out Norvell for this machine,I also use Infinity Sun and EVOLV by sunless Inc their products are much better quality and I have very satisfied clients. I have been in the business for 12+ yrs.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff seriously makes the tan LAST!!</li>
            <li> Good product to prep the sin priior to spray tanning.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  Thot it would take the &amp;#34;tanning smell&amp;#34; away like previous posts said.. it may have a little but not like what I had hoped.  The spray nozzle ended up breaking :(...  I would NOT buy again.</li>
            <li> This stuff actually makes my spray tan a bit darker and last longer. I did not try it with a self tanner but I highly recommend it for spray tanners!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well for me at all. I do like some of the Notvell products , but not this one!</li>
