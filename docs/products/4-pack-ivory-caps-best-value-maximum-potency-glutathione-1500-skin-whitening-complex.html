            <li>Just Love it and so happy with the result.</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>) Do not leave home without sunblock.&lt;br /&gt;This should be a no brainer, but I am sure many of the people who complain this product doesn&#x27;t work aren&#x27;t taking the best measures to protect themselves from UV rays that trigger your body to produce more melanin.</li>
            <li>this is like 50 dollars a month and get porcelain skin~ Amazing product</li>
            <li>then I use this  amazing  </li>
            <li>Vitamin C helps Glutathione to be effective by protecting it from oxidative damage.</li>
            <li>have shown that taking oral glutathione is not an effective way to lighten skin.</li>
            <li>But always remember that these alone doesn&#x27;t work as effectively as when you take Vitamin C, NAC, and Collagen with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good and authentic</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t work on its own but must be taken with 1000 mg of vitamin C,</li>
            <li>and I encourage you to do your own research.</li>
            <li>I received many compliments that I have a warm glow, nice skin etc</li>
            <li>this makes my skin so softer and is the best softener I have ever used, better than the high end  $ 150.</li>
            <li>But it is way much better for me.</li>
            <li>I love it, and will keep using it.</li>
            <li>Taking it with vitamin c and alpha lipoic acid or NAC will make it more</li>
            <li>So I will continue using this glutathione because I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>Also it gives me more energy, and I can not feel any side affects.</li>
            <li>I finished all four bottles and even ordered more afterwards thinking maybe I just need to stick with it, but nothing happened.</li>
            <li>I have never ever felt better</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to have a fairer skin, but, would rather keep gray hair out of my head.</li>
            <li>WILLM NOT BE ORDERING MORE.  </li>
            <li>I bought it more than 6 time of ivory caps&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>make it work even better</li>
            <li>My skin is more lighter and smoother.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the results and I try not to pick my skin to help the recovery process.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s 5 times better to get fairer clearer skin</li>
            <li>My moderate acne was gone, my skin flawless and even.</li>
            <li>I received many compliments that my skin was glowing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i love my color</li>
            <li>coz my skin become really healthy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update u again if it does its magic.</li>
            <li>I will still buy and give it more time...</li>
            <li>If you go from from Kelly Rowland to Beyonce in three months you will have family and friends asking what the heck is happening to you, and it will be more embarrassing than a compliment.</li>
            <li>However you should take vitamin C and use sunblock if you plan to commit to this product if you want to get the most bang for you buck.</li>
            <li>However you should take vitamin C and use sunblock if you plan to commit to this product if you want to get the most bang for you buck.</li>
            <li>, they just love the nice clean skin enhancement it gives.</li>
            <li>but it works pretty good.</li>
            <li>The second week you&#x27;ll feel the difference to how flawless and smooth your skin feels.</li>
            <li>1500mg and glutathione on an empty stomach twice a day for greatest absorbancy.</li>
            <li>If you keep taking the product you WILL keep getting light (more on that in section 6).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(Micheal Jackson, Vybz Cartel) its far from attractive..</li>
            <li>Yes began much improvement of the nicest people in the deal, thank you very much good luck</li>
            <li>I hear that many of the movie stars actually inject gelathione with VC through their vein to get a lighter skin, so I decided to take those pill to see what&#x27;s happen.this bottle is in a very great value, I took this for a month with 4 capsules a day, with 2000mg VC and collegen, after I finished the first bootle(about 15 days)</li>
            <li>I did not want a drastic change that would be easily noticed, I wanted a gradual change.  </li>
            <li>They are easy to swallow and they arrived on schedule.</li>
            <li>I can swallow it easily.</li>
            <li>Anyhow,  I&#x27;m seeing results within two weeks which is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>did give me sound sleep if I take it before going to sleep.</li>
            <li>My skin is normally light brown</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m of Filipino descent with light brown skin.</li>
            <li>Great for middle age women who wish to maintain healthful youth.  </li>
            <li>This is important and I will bring it up</li>
            <li>When I saw that I was lightening faster than I felt comfortable</li>
            <li>So exciting!</li>
            <li>I was on Amazon one eveing and saw these pills and thought hmmmm the 1500 should really make my skin fabulous,and take me the shade 1 more shade lighter.</li>
            <li>But I want to believe of the good results I can get from it because I have friends who take glutathione (not with the same brand)</li>
            <li>It also keeps Glutathione in their absorbable form so that they can continue to have their powerful free radical quenching effects.</li>
            <li>not bad .&lt;br /&gt;because</li>
            <li>Luckily, it works for me</li>
            <li>Aside from the additional lightening, many topical creams also include sunblock (more on that below) and alpha hydroxy among the ingredients.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other brands before in hopes of lightening my skin, but this is the most effective of all the brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I am looking forward to using this product I have read many good reviews on this product in the past</li>
            <li>I notice that I do get one shade lighter than before, what is important is my skin tone become even and looks much healthier.</li>
            <li>This product works great, but it should be noted that for maximum efficiency there a few things you should do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you can also take Alpha Lipoic sustain and even Cysteine tablets along with it, if its all worth getting just 1-2 shades lighter is another question.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>However,  I prefer buying in cost effective ways, so buying reduced Glutathione,  Alpha Lipoic Acid and vitamin C is a bigger bang for your buck.</li>
            <li>I believe that natural and safe is the way to go.</li>
            <li>Alpha hydroxy accelerates the cycle at which your skin is shed and fresh cells are generated (\\&quot;skin renewal\\&quot;).</li>
            <li>I got other wise</li>
            <li>After 2 weeks or so, I noticed some results right away.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t expect miracles with glutathione, but using it in the right way will get you 1-2 shades</li>
            <li>/&gt;start to say good by to the black heads</li>
            <li>And within the first week you&#x27;ll notice.</li>
            <li>IT DOES EXACTLY</li>
            <li>Glad to use this product, this order is my second set.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>where i only use it for nights out :)</li>
            <li>This pill really clears the skin up!</li>
            <li>and I have my customers coming back for more</li>
            <li>Depending on how many shades you are going for, you may not want to use my additional suggestions such as soap and skin cream that hasten the lightening process.</li>
            <li>Light skin isn&#x27;t for everyone and when you take it too far</li>
            <li>Thanks for reading!</li>
            <li>Thanks for reading!</li>
            <li>I want to note here that my doctor mentioned there is new research indicating Vitamin C can disrupt the natural flora and cause problems, time for me to research this, I do take probiotics daily just for good measure. .</li>
            <li>and it may cause ochronosis which is caused by exposure to certain chemicals.</li>
            <li>My doctor said, you typically take vitamin C to bowel tolerance,  Last time, I purchased and reviewed the Jarrow reduced Glutathione and felt it worked great.  </li>
            <li>Ivory Caps pills is an enhanced nutritional supplement supporting skin whitening utilizing a high potency proprietary &amp;#</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t give me skin lightening benefits as much as the one I tried - Ag Factor (http://www.ag-factor.com/), which is so costly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it really does make my pimple scars fade away faster, but it does not make my skin brighter or whiter after 5 months of using, so I gave up.</li>
            <li>It is much cheaper than getting the shoot(about 500 bucks a month in China)</li>
            <li>it was very helpful in my decision making.</li>
            <li>I really regret purchasing this Ivory caps bought 4 bottles to replace my Now L-gluthathione</li>
            <li>I am a Asian girl of 20 year old, having fair skin ( when I choose foundations I normally go with the lightest or the second lightest).but</li>
            <li>or even better Ivory caps vitamin C, that contain other bleaching agents as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other creams that use licorice extract and papaya may be more your thing.</li>
            <li>Personally I used Palmer&#x27;s Skin Success for the first two months, applying in the morning before heading out and in the evening before bed.</li>
            <li>I first bought my first set of four bottles back in March.</li>
            <li>) Keep realistic expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li>It is hard to find low cost health supplies, but in my opinion, they are pretty fairly priced.</li>
            <li>I will go back to the brand I was using as my skin was very pretty with the 250mg.</li>
            <li>By the way, Vitamin C itself is a skin lighener in high (1000mg+) doses, over time.</li>
            <li>It is a little misleading, but believe me it does its job of lightening skin &amp; making it more youthful</li>
            <li>The only change I have noticed so far is that my skin became a little smoother than before (I am naturally fair).</li>
            <li>i normally get from taking glutathione.</li>
            <li>/&gt;black color, whereas now the pigmentation is coming in one shade away from my normal skin tone(hope</li>
            <li>Anyways, they say you will start seeing obvious changes on the first three months...</li>
            <li>Actually, I&#x27;d just started taking it yesterday, and hopefully will see positive results.</li>
            <li>My natural night time cream lightener is  a couple drops of fresh squeezed lemon let it dry</li>
            <li>I will use all the money for Glutathione injection, it will be faster than this and may be more effective, but at least I will know the result after few injection, instead of using this pills for the whole 1 year and see little result.</li>
            <li>recommend to all who would like to clear their skins&lt;br /&gt;safe</li>
            <li>thanks need money back,,.</li>
            <li>and since then it changed my mind completely.</li>
            <li>far it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li>You be kinda surprised.</li>
            <li>SO FAR IN THE MARKET.</li>
            <li>I could be unusual to get this way since I&#x27;m currently living in California.</li>
            <li>arabic girl with natural tanned skin</li>
            <li>I got to a caramel tone and felt that was far enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I encourage you to be not to rush it for a natural transition to a lighter complexion.</li>
            <li>I got to a caramel tone and felt that was far enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I encourage you to be not to rush it for a natural transition to a lighter complexion.</li>
            <li>Normally, i would have the lighter shade just above the elbows wherein the shirt normally covers the shoulders.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve used  ivory caps before and it does work,but for some reason this did not work.i also think that this is an imitation of the real ivory caps,because it say skin brightening on the bottle…..usually the real ivory caps said skin whitening…..</li>
            <li>I have looked high and low.</li>
            <li>And now I&#x27;m bout to finish the second bottle, my hands and arm are getting back to my normal skin tone!</li>
            <li>The third week you&#x27;ll get to see the dramatic change to how divine one could look in their own skin.</li>
            <li>This product really does work as long as you maintain a daily intake of this glutathione.</li>
            <li>the skin becomes super thick like the skin on your heel of foot and the skin  becomes considerably darker, so do your research</li>
            <li>It was just a huge waste of money , I used three bottles  of vitamin c with 3 bottles of  ivory cabs pills , for three months , there is absolutely no difference  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Anyhow,  I&#x27;m seeing results within two weeks which is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> did give me sound sleep if I take it before going to sleep.</li>
            <li> My skin is normally light brown</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m of Filipino descent with light brown skin.</li>
            <li> Great for middle age women who wish to maintain healthful youth.  </li>
            <li> This is important and I will bring it up</li>
            <li> When I saw that I was lightening faster than I felt comfortable</li>
            <li> So exciting!</li>
            <li> I was on Amazon one eveing and saw these pills and thought hmmmm the 1500 should really make my skin fabulous,and take me the shade 1 more shade lighter.</li>
            <li> But I want to believe of the good results I can get from it because I have friends who take glutathione (not with the same brand)</li>
            <li> It also keeps Glutathione in their absorbable form so that they can continue to have their powerful free radical quenching effects.</li>
            <li> not bad .&lt;br /&gt;because</li>
            <li> Luckily, it works for me</li>
            <li> Aside from the additional lightening, many topical creams also include sunblock (more on that below) and alpha hydroxy among the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands before in hopes of lightening my skin, but this is the most effective of all the brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to using this product I have read many good reviews on this product in the past</li>
            <li> I notice that I do get one shade lighter than before, what is important is my skin tone become even and looks much healthier.</li>
            <li> This product works great, but it should be noted that for maximum efficiency there a few things you should do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you can also take Alpha Lipoic sustain and even Cysteine tablets along with it, if its all worth getting just 1-2 shades lighter is another question.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> However,  I prefer buying in cost effective ways, so buying reduced Glutathione,  Alpha Lipoic Acid and vitamin C is a bigger bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> I believe that natural and safe is the way to go.</li>
            <li> Alpha hydroxy accelerates the cycle at which your skin is shed and fresh cells are generated (\\&quot;skin renewal\\&quot;).</li>
            <li> I got other wise</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks or so, I noticed some results right away.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t expect miracles with glutathione, but using it in the right way will get you 1-2 shades</li>
            <li> /&gt;start to say good by to the black heads</li>
            <li> And within the first week you&#x27;ll notice.</li>
            <li> IT DOES EXACTLY</li>
            <li> Glad to use this product, this order is my second set.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> where i only use it for nights out :)</li>
            <li> This pill really clears the skin up!</li>
            <li> and I have my customers coming back for more</li>
            <li> Depending on how many shades you are going for, you may not want to use my additional suggestions such as soap and skin cream that hasten the lightening process.</li>
            <li> Light skin isn&#x27;t for everyone and when you take it too far</li>
            <li> Thanks for reading!</li>
            <li> Thanks for reading!</li>
            <li> I want to note here that my doctor mentioned there is new research indicating Vitamin C can disrupt the natural flora and cause problems, time for me to research this, I do take probiotics daily just for good measure. .</li>
            <li> and it may cause ochronosis which is caused by exposure to certain chemicals.</li>
            <li> My doctor said, you typically take vitamin C to bowel tolerance,  Last time, I purchased and reviewed the Jarrow reduced Glutathione and felt it worked great.  </li>
            <li> Ivory Caps pills is an enhanced nutritional supplement supporting skin whitening utilizing a high potency proprietary &amp;#</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t give me skin lightening benefits as much as the one I tried - Ag Factor (http://www.ag-factor.com/), which is so costly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it really does make my pimple scars fade away faster, but it does not make my skin brighter or whiter after 5 months of using, so I gave up.</li>
            <li> It is much cheaper than getting the shoot(about 500 bucks a month in China)</li>
            <li> it was very helpful in my decision making.</li>
            <li> I really regret purchasing this Ivory caps bought 4 bottles to replace my Now L-gluthathione</li>
            <li> I am a Asian girl of 20 year old, having fair skin ( when I choose foundations I normally go with the lightest or the second lightest).but</li>
            <li> or even better Ivory caps vitamin C, that contain other bleaching agents as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other creams that use licorice extract and papaya may be more your thing.</li>
            <li> Personally I used Palmer&#x27;s Skin Success for the first two months, applying in the morning before heading out and in the evening before bed.</li>
            <li> I first bought my first set of four bottles back in March.</li>
            <li> ) Keep realistic expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li> It is hard to find low cost health supplies, but in my opinion, they are pretty fairly priced.</li>
            <li> I will go back to the brand I was using as my skin was very pretty with the 250mg.</li>
            <li> By the way, Vitamin C itself is a skin lighener in high (1000mg+) doses, over time.</li>
            <li> It is a little misleading, but believe me it does its job of lightening skin &amp; making it more youthful</li>
            <li> The only change I have noticed so far is that my skin became a little smoother than before (I am naturally fair).</li>
            <li> i normally get from taking glutathione.</li>
            <li> /&gt;black color, whereas now the pigmentation is coming in one shade away from my normal skin tone(hope</li>
            <li> Anyways, they say you will start seeing obvious changes on the first three months...</li>
            <li> Actually, I&#x27;d just started taking it yesterday, and hopefully will see positive results.</li>
            <li> My natural night time cream lightener is  a couple drops of fresh squeezed lemon let it dry</li>
            <li> I will use all the money for Glutathione injection, it will be faster than this and may be more effective, but at least I will know the result after few injection, instead of using this pills for the whole 1 year and see little result.</li>
            <li> recommend to all who would like to clear their skins&lt;br /&gt;safe</li>
            <li> thanks need money back,,.</li>
            <li> and since then it changed my mind completely.</li>
            <li> far it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> You be kinda surprised.</li>
            <li> SO FAR IN THE MARKET.</li>
            <li> I could be unusual to get this way since I&#x27;m currently living in California.</li>
            <li> arabic girl with natural tanned skin</li>
            <li> I got to a caramel tone and felt that was far enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I encourage you to be not to rush it for a natural transition to a lighter complexion.</li>
            <li> I got to a caramel tone and felt that was far enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I encourage you to be not to rush it for a natural transition to a lighter complexion.</li>
            <li> Normally, i would have the lighter shade just above the elbows wherein the shirt normally covers the shoulders.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used  ivory caps before and it does work,but for some reason this did not work.i also think that this is an imitation of the real ivory caps,because it say skin brightening on the bottle…..usually the real ivory caps said skin whitening…..</li>
            <li> I have looked high and low.</li>
            <li> And now I&#x27;m bout to finish the second bottle, my hands and arm are getting back to my normal skin tone!</li>
            <li> The third week you&#x27;ll get to see the dramatic change to how divine one could look in their own skin.</li>
            <li> This product really does work as long as you maintain a daily intake of this glutathione.</li>
            <li> the skin becomes super thick like the skin on your heel of foot and the skin  becomes considerably darker, so do your research</li>
            <li> It was just a huge waste of money , I used three bottles  of vitamin c with 3 bottles of  ivory cabs pills , for three months , there is absolutely no difference  </li>
            <li> For a rather light-skinned person my skin is yellowish-brown and tans very easily,&lt;br /&gt;i also use something from the outside to make bigger changes, (like a lightening cream or soap) and with all this my skin gets pale white.</li>
            <li> I can only see minimal result.</li>
            <li> When you have reached your desired complexion you can cut back to a \\&quot;maintenance dose\\&quot; of half your regular dose.</li>
            <li> i got a round white spot on my cheek and few on my right arm that&#x27;s in but over all its a waste of money...</li>
            <li> - My lips don&#x27;t dry anymore           -</li>
            <li> the&lt;br /&gt;difference ;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no dry lips</li>
            <li> wasted my money plus more expensive than NOW</li>
            <li> It is simply an additional avenue for your melanin concentration to get knocked down, or your skin regeneration to be sped up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are serious about results get a decent (SPF 50+) sun block or you might as well burn your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 25% white 75% black and already had mocha skin tone.</li>
            <li> 25% white 75% black and already had mocha skin tone.</li>
            <li> In other words, taking it with Vitamin C aids its purpose of lightening your skin.</li>
            <li> Also I have a darkspot on my hip area due to my wallet putting pressure on that area</li>
            <li> MAYBE A LITTLE COSTLY IN THE LONG RUN @ $98.49 PER POP, BUT WHITENS SKIN (I think!)</li>
            <li> Not recommend, return due to severe body itching after using for 2 days.</li>
            <li> Other dark spots on my body have either lightened, or disappeared as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Studies</li>
            <li> After I tried this, their is no more pimples on my face for the last one and half month.</li>
            <li> - dark spots on my face have started to lighten.</li>
            <li> dark spot start to fade</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about a month and a half since I started taking them and I&#x27;ve noticed a slight difference.</li>
            <li> But no, if I haven&#x27;t seen a single change in all this time, I don&#x27;t want to keep wasting my hard earned money.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S ENTIRETY WITH LITTLE OR NO RESULTS.  </li>
            <li> Even some dark spots on my face faded!</li>
            <li> In addition to that I&#x27;m  taking  cold pressed organic flax seed oil which really  soften my skin.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I know that&lt;br /&gt;it is working because if I get a pimple and of course can&#x27;t resist picking at it, in the past the scarring would be a dark almost&lt;</li>
            <li> This product is a blend of glutathione , Alpha Lipoic Acid, Milk Thistle,  L- cysteine, and Green Tea Extract.</li>
            <li> ask why am I looking so pale and wonder if I am not getting any sun.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read that there is very small number of people that the glutathione  supplement is ineffective, due to their body chemistry.</li>
            <li> I usually take 2 capsules a day with a glass of orange juice with Vitamin C (100%).</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong with a solid regimen like this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong with a solid regimen like this.</li>
            <li> I have searched online about glutathione pills and have read that it is not effective.</li>
            <li> 34;Skin Essentials&amp;#34; Glutathione Complex for results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> at least it&#x27;s a way cheaper .</li>
            <li> Therefore, don&#x27;t expect to see results for at least a month.</li>
            <li> I mean, this is just 3 Weeks.</li>
            <li> it came late!</li>
            <li> This products does work, it makes you lighter then you are, but prossess is very slow, and I am not kidding is very slow; you need to take it about two months to see some changes.</li>
            <li> Mad I wasted money just use lemon juice and water in a spray bottle.</li>
            <li> , it is not because of my skin cause four of my friends tried it and they got the same bad results as me!</li>
            <li> A bit expensive</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I just had a weird reaction to it</li>
            <li> Consider Soap.&lt;br /&gt;Whether you choose a lightening soap or just an exfoliating one, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> So im not giving a bad review as some swear it worked for them but</li>
            <li> It is not as bad as teenager acne, but does bothers me a lot.</li>
            <li> I feel like im taking them for nothing :(</li>
            <li> Glutahione pills have an awful smell of rotten eggs (sulfur)These pills do not have that smell at all,and for them being 1500mg.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the worst product ever!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve completed 2nd bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt; It didn&#x27;t give me skin lightening benefits as much as the one I tried - Ag Factor (http://www.ag-factor.com/), which is so costly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It did give me sound sleep if I take it before going to sleep. 2 capsules triggered deeper sleep.</li>
            <li> I have been taken Glutahione on and off for years. The glutathione gives my skin a very smooth and beautiful complexion, as if i have on makeup. I was on Amazon one eveing and saw these pills and thought hmmmm the 1500 should really make my skin fabulous,and take me the shade 1 more shade lighter. Unfortunalty i got nothing.I didnt even get the smoothed out look i normally get from taking glutathione. I dont believe there is even glutahione in the pills. Glutahione pills have an awful smell of rotten eggs (sulfur)These pills do not have that smell at all,and for them being 1500mg.They should be stinking up the cabinets I think its misleading as you cannot purchase glutahione pass 500mg. trust me I have looked high and low.I will go back to the brand I was using as my skin was very pretty with the 250mg. However I am very happy to hear for those of you that the pills did work for. Some things work for some and for others it does not work. So im not giving a bad review as some swear it worked for them but for me nope.</li>
            <li> I use two pills of this each day combined with the brightening vitamin c plus pills from the same brand.I also use Dr. Fred Palmer Skin Whitener Cream 2 oz day and night. For me they are a superb combination skin food. I used to have several breakouts on my cheeks, forehead or around my lips. It is not as bad as teenager acne, but does bothers me a lot. After I tried this, their is no more pimples on my face for the last one and half month. I do have instead two pimples at my back neck when I had my period last month. But it is way much better for me. I notice that I do get one shade lighter than before, what is important is my skin tone become even and looks much healthier. Just Love it and so happy with the result.</li>
            <li> Hi,  I have been using ivory caps for about 7 months now.  I did not want a drastic change that would be easily noticed, I wanted a gradual change.  Boy did I get want I want,  I only take 2 capsules a day so that the change will be gradual, with 1000 mg vit c, and my skin tone has lightened.  I had to get a lighter shade of foundation, and people who have not seen me for a while, ask why am I looking so pale and wonder if I am not getting any sun.  I love it, and will keep using it.</li>
            <li> (dec 02) I have searched online about glutathione pills and have read that it is not effective. But I want to believe of the good results I can get from it because I have friends who take glutathione (not with the same brand) and they became fairer. Actually, I&#x27;d just started taking it yesterday, and hopefully will see positive results. will let you know.  (dec 08) After one week of taking it? I can only see minimal result. The only change I have noticed so far is that my skin became a little smoother than before (I am naturally fair). Or maybe it&#x27;s because I am not taking vitamin c along with it (which is recommended as what I&#x27;ve read online). Anyways, they say you will start seeing obvious changes on the first three months... I hope someone will also try this item to help me figure out its effectiveness. ;-P  (dec 16) - My lips don&#x27;t dry anymore           - no longer constipated (I don&#x27;t know if this is also a result of taking glutathione)           - dark spots on my face have started to lighten.I used to rate it only 3 stars, but now it&#x27;s 4.</li>
            <li> I love this product! My skin is normally light brown but I don&#x27;t have the even skin tone that I&#x27;ve always wanted. I usually take 2 capsules a day with a glass of orange juice with Vitamin C (100%). After 2 weeks or so, I noticed some results right away. My skin is now smoother and fairer than normal especially the dark pigmented parts of my body got lighter and even. By the way, I did some research about the benefits of Vit C when taking it with glutathione. Vitamin C helps Glutathione to be effective by protecting it from oxidative damage. It also keeps Glutathione in their absorbable form so that they can continue to have their powerful free radical quenching effects. In other words, taking it with Vitamin C aids its purpose of lightening your skin.</li>
            <li> Finished 3rd bottle until now dont see any changes on my skin... Only thing i see i got a round white spot on my cheek and few on my right arm that&#x27;s in but over all its a waste of money... My skin tone is tan so im wonderring why didnt do anything for me. If the company can send my money that will be great... i still have the fourth bottle and i dont need to take it...thanks need money back,,.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m of Filipino descent with light brown skin. I&#x27;ve been taking 4 capsules a day with vitamin c &amp; alpha lipoic acid. I first bought my first set of four bottles back in March. It&#x27;s been about a month and a half since I started taking them and I&#x27;ve noticed a slight difference. My skintone has lightened atleast 1 shade. I&#x27;m definitely lighter than I used to be. My friends have even noticed. Also I have a darkspot on my hip area due to my wallet putting pressure on that area and since I started taking this glutathione it has basically disappeared. Other dark spots on my body have either lightened, or disappeared as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Studies have shown that taking oral glutathione is not an effective way to lighten skin. I used to believe this until I started taking this brand and since then it changed my mind completely. This product really does work as long as you maintain a daily intake of this glutathione. Taking it with vitamin c and alpha lipoic acid or NAC will make it more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far it&#x27;s working. I just received another order of 4 bottles today. So I will continue using this glutathione because I am satisfied. I&#x27;ve used other brands before in hopes of lightening my skin, but this is the most effective of all the brands I&#x27;ve used. It does it&#x27;s job. However, let me just let all of you know, 1 capsule DOES NOT contain 1,500 mg of glutathione. Two capsules contain a total of 1,500 mg of glutathione. On the bottle there is a daily dosage note and if you take two capsules it will total to 1,500 mg of glutathione. It is a little misleading, but believe me it does its job of lightening skin &amp; making it more youthful looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect immediate results though. Results vary from person to person and your initial skin tone. It could take months before you see an effect. Luckily, it works for me and I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Yes began much improvement of the nicest people in the deal, thank you very much good luck thank you alot</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a gift. Everything looks and works as advertised. I would have heard back by now if there were any problems. They loved this gift!</li>
            <li> Kudos. One of the best product I ever used.  I can see the effect in a very short time.</li>
            <li> it came late! i will try to make a review again after finishing the bottles...they should have sent it earlier</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to using this product I have read many good reviews on this product in the past</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used  ivory caps before and it does work,but for some reason this did not work.i also think that this is an imitation of the real ivory caps,because it say skin brightening on the bottle…..usually the real ivory caps said skin whitening…..not only that when i take the product it makes my skin gets DARKER. so i stop taking it.</li>
            <li> recommend to all who would like to clear their skins&lt;br /&gt;safe to use and no side effects&lt;br /&gt;natural and good</li>
            <li> not bad .&lt;br /&gt;because there is not a different since i use it until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; i don&#x27;t know way  ??</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d agree that this is the &amp;#34;best value&amp;#34; one can have. But always remember that these alone doesn&#x27;t work as effectively as when you take Vitamin C, NAC, and Collagen with it. Just food for thought.</li>
            <li> A bit expensive but it works pretty good. Been using it for a few weeks and I find my skin looks a bit clearer.</li>
            <li> This products does work, it makes you lighter then you are, but prossess is very slow, and I am not kidding is very slow; you need to take it about two months to see some changes. Also it gives me more energy, and I can not feel any side affects.</li>
            <li> MAYBE A LITTLE COSTLY IN THE LONG RUN @ $98.49 PER POP, BUT WHITENS SKIN (I think!)</li>
            <li> best price i got in the market so ever,so i recommend it to any one looking for this product..&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> Mad I wasted money just use lemon juice and water in a spray bottle. It will lighten skin. You be kinda surprised.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best whiting capsules</li>
            <li> and no change whatsoever. I have hyperpigmentation/sun damage and still have it. Do not buy. Save your money. Possibly if I took it longer? But no, if I haven&#x27;t seen a single change in all this time, I don&#x27;t want to keep wasting my hard earned money.</li>
            <li> They are easy to swallow and they arrived on schedule. However I don&#x27;t feel it does anything for my complexion.</li>
            <li> did NOTHING for me. zilch. I finished all four bottles and even ordered more afterwards thinking maybe I just need to stick with it, but nothing happened. It doesn&#x27;t do anything for your skin. I just wanted an even complexion but it didnt change a thing.</li>
            <li> Ivory Caps pills is an enhanced nutritional supplement supporting skin whitening utilizing a high potency proprietary &amp;#34;Skin Essentials&amp;#34; Glutathione Complex for results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ivory Caps Benefits May Include:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Preventing the oxidation (darkening) of existing skin melanin&lt;br /&gt;2. Precipitates the shedding / removal of melanin laden skin cells&lt;br /&gt;3. Regulation / Reduction of pigment production</li>
            <li> No results yet...!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels great, I feel great, its almost like I&#x27;m being detoxified from the inside out... I have never ever felt better</li>
            <li> I had finished taking two bottles. Didn&#x27;t see any changes nor improvement with my skin color, but ...... saw a lot of my hair getting gray!?!?!?! I don&#x27;t know if I just had a weird reaction to it but, as soon as I stopped taking the capsules, my graying hair seemed to have stopped proliferating. And yes, I took it with vitamin C. Now, i&#x27;m stuck with two unopened bottles. I&#x27;d love to have a fairer skin, but, would rather keep gray hair out of my head.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good and authentic</li>
            <li> excellent, works great love it...</li>
            <li> Great for middle age women who wish to maintain healthful youth.  It is hard to find low cost health supplies, but in my opinion, they are pretty fairly priced.</li>
            <li> it really does make my pimple scars fade away faster, but it does not make my skin brighter or whiter after 5 months of using, so I gave up. I will use all the money for Glutathione injection, it will be faster than this and may be more effective, but at least I will know the result after few injection, instead of using this pills for the whole 1 year and see little result.</li>
            <li> I love shopping at amazon because you are the best of all.  Keep up the good work!</li>
            <li> I just finished only one bottle and waiting for result.</li>
            <li> Yes, it works. And within the first week you&#x27;ll notice. The second week you&#x27;ll feel the difference to how flawless and smooth your skin feels. The third week you&#x27;ll get to see the dramatic change to how divine one could look in their own skin.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S ONE OF THE BEST SKIN WHITENING PRODUCE SO FAR IN THE MARKET. IT DOES EXACTLY WHAT&#x27;S WRITTEN ABOUT IT.</li>
            <li> DID NOT NOTICE A DIFFERENCE.  USED THIS PRODUCT IN IT&#x27;S ENTIRETY WITH LITTLE OR NO RESULTS.  WILLM NOT BE ORDERING MORE.  THANK YOU FOR ASKING THOUGH.</li>
            <li> I bought it more than 6 time of ivory caps&lt;br /&gt;And 6 times ivory caps C and not use&lt;br /&gt;The color is the same</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t expect miracles with glutathione, but using it in the right way will get you 1-2 shades lighter.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t work on its own but must be taken with 1000 mg of vitamin C, every dose you take! or even better Ivory caps vitamin C, that contain other bleaching agents as well.&lt;br /&gt;To make it work even better you can also take Alpha Lipoic sustain and even Cysteine tablets along with it, if its all worth getting just 1-2 shades lighter is another question.&lt;br /&gt;I can say that these pills works alright for me tho. For a rather light-skinned person my skin is yellowish-brown and tans very easily,&lt;br /&gt;i also use something from the outside to make bigger changes, (like a lightening cream or soap) and with all this my skin gets pale white.</li>
            <li> I am a Asian girl of 20 year old, having fair skin ( when I choose foundations I normally go with the lightest or the second lightest).but got tanned on my arm and hands over the summer. I hear that many of the movie stars actually inject gelathione with VC through their vein to get a lighter skin, so I decided to take those pill to see what&#x27;s happen.this bottle is in a very great value, I took this for a month with 4 capsules a day, with 2000mg VC and collegen, after I finished the first bootle(about 15 days) I noticed a big difference on my hand, it starts to lighten up. I could be unusual to get this way since I&#x27;m currently living in California. And now I&#x27;m bout to finish the second bottle, my hands and arm are getting back to my normal skin tone! So exciting! Even some dark spots on my face faded! My scar on body lightened too! Definitely purchase again! It is much cheaper than getting the shoot(about 500 bucks a month in China) this is like 50 dollars a month and get porcelain skin~ Amazing product</li>
            <li> Did not work as intended. Not for me.</li>
            <li> This is a repeat order. been using this product for over a year now.</li>
            <li> After using the product for 2 months, I noticed a big difference in my skin tone. I  became two skin tones lighter! My skin is more lighter and smoother. Even my friends can&#x27;t seem to notice. The effects started in my arms, the skin tone became even from hands up to shoulders. Normally, i would have the lighter shade just above the elbows wherein the shirt normally covers the shoulders. But now, it is even. Glad to use this product, this order is my second set. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because the product delivers on its claims.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this item for discoloration on my face-post acne scars. I am not trying to lighten my overall skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;Before I purchased I researched how melanin occurs in our body and what Glutathione does in the body. I know that&lt;br /&gt;it is working because if I get a pimple and of course can&#x27;t resist picking at it, in the past the scarring would be a dark almost&lt;br /&gt;black color, whereas now the pigmentation is coming in one shade away from my normal skin tone(hope that makes sense)&lt;br /&gt;and it continues to get lighter and lighter. I am pleased with the results and I try not to pick my skin to help the recovery process.&lt;br /&gt;Melanin goes to the injured area to assist with healing, but there are two hues of melanin this is where this product works it&#x27;s magic.&lt;br /&gt;Please do some melanin research or just Youtube the Ivory Caps info. it was very helpful in my decision making.Good Luck to All!</li>
            <li> I really regret purchasing this Ivory caps bought 4 bottles to replace my Now L-gluthathione so I could get a clearer skin faster instead of getting clearer skin I got other wise so I stop taking it and I re order Now L-gluthathione it&#x27;s 5 times better to get fairer clearer skin haven&#x27;t finish taking the 4 bottles of Ivory caps don&#x27;t know what to do with it wasted my money plus more expensive than NOW I will never take Ivory Caps whitening gluthathione again it&#x27;s all lies</li>
            <li> With this product I went through 2 bottles a month of the glutathione &amp; 2 bottles of the vitamin C. Taking 2 caps of glutathione + 2 caps of vitamin C in morning &amp; again at night. My tone went from Kelly Rowland&#x27;s to Ke ke palmer in 3 months. My moderate acne was gone, my skin flawless and even. I received many compliments that my skin was glowing. As with anything be consistant.</li>
            <li> hi&lt;br /&gt;i purchase this from their web site&lt;br /&gt;after a sleepless nights of research&lt;br /&gt;i decide to give it a chance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;im arabic girl with natural tanned skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i love my color but i needed to added the glow&lt;br /&gt;for it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i try it and after only a 1 1/2 week i notice the&lt;br /&gt;difference ;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no dry lips any more&lt;br /&gt;may dark spot start to fade&lt;br /&gt;glowing skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after two weeks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;start to say good by to the black heads&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 weeks my skin tone become even &amp; lighter&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no need to where make up every where i only use it for nights out :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i will continue use it coz my skin become really healthy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;baby skin yaaaay</li>
            <li> I purchased this a month ago and i dnt see any changes with my skin color. I feel like im taking them for nothing :( maybe it takes time to achieve results. I&#x27;ll update u again if it does its magic. I&#x27;m asian and maybe it takes time for it to lighten my skin. Hope it works just in time for my wedding!</li>
            <li> It was just a huge waste of money , I used three bottles  of vitamin c with 3 bottles of  ivory cabs pills , for three months , there is absolutely no difference  , now I am starting to try (Jarrow Formulas Glutathione Reduced ) at least it&#x27;s a way cheaper .</li>
            <li> This pill really clears the skin up! I resale these Ivory Caps and I have my customers coming back for more, they just love the nice clean skin enhancement it gives. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I have not started started seeing the results of what I purchased it for, but my skin feels smoother. I will still buy and give it more time...I mean, this is just 3 Weeks.</li>
            <li> I can swallow it easily. Affordable, taking it for almost 5 mos. now my skin is lighter I guess, because people noticed it.</li>
            <li> I  purchased the Best Value Pack, but  I did not realize that I would have to take two capsules to get 1500 mg of glutathione.  This product is a blend of glutathione , Alpha Lipoic Acid, Milk Thistle,  L- cysteine, and Green Tea Extract. I would not of   purchased this product had I realized it was a blend that had green tea extract,  because I want to really avoid caffeine, since I have several sensitivities .  This product does work, I&#x27;m taking it vitamin C  1500mg and glutathione on an empty stomach twice a day for greatest absorbancy. In addition to that I&#x27;m  taking  cold pressed organic flax seed oil which really  soften my skin. Anyhow,  I&#x27;m seeing results within two weeks which is pretty amazing. However,  I prefer buying in cost effective ways, so buying reduced Glutathione,  Alpha Lipoic Acid and vitamin C is a bigger bang for your buck. I want to note here that my doctor mentioned there is new research indicating Vitamin C can disrupt the natural flora and cause problems, time for me to research this, I do take probiotics daily just for good measure. . My doctor said, you typically take vitamin C to bowel tolerance,  Last time, I purchased and reviewed the Jarrow reduced Glutathione and felt it worked great.  Please STAY AWAY FROM HYDROQUINE  I read that  it is a possible carcinogen and it may cause ochronosis which is caused by exposure to certain chemicals. the skin becomes super thick like the skin on your heel of foot and the skin  becomes considerably darker, so do your research It has been banned in some countries.  I&#x27;ve read that there is very small number of people that the glutathione  supplement is ineffective, due to their body chemistry. I believe that natural and safe is the way to go. My natural night time cream lightener is  a couple drops of fresh squeezed lemon let it dry then I use this  amazing  shea butter this makes my skin so softer and is the best softener I have ever used, better than the high end  $ 150. creamslts.</li>
            <li> This product works great, but it should be noted that for maximum efficiency there a few things you should do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Calculate your dose.&lt;br /&gt;To achieve the skin lightening effects of glutathione you must calculate the dose necessary for therapeutic levels. Resources online say you should take 20-40mg per kg (~2.2 lbs) of body weight, per day in 2-3 divided doses. So if you weigh 130 lbs you should take between ~1200mg and 2400mg a day. That&#x27;s 2-3 capsules. I recommend taking them after a meal. Remember to spread the doses out. When you have reached your desired complexion you can cut back to a \\&quot;maintenance dose\\&quot; of half your regular dose. If you keep taking the product you WILL keep getting light (more on that in section 6).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Increase your Vitamin C intake.&lt;br /&gt;Without going into lengthy scientific explanation, vitamin C helps L-Glut absorb easier. Resources online say you should match or double your vitamin C intake for each mg of L-glut. However I recommend not to exceed 2000mg of vitamin C. I was taking 3000mg (double my dose of 1500mg L-Glut) and started getting stomach cramps. I looked it up and found that to be a symptom of vitamin C overdose, so please pay attention not to start popping vitamin C pills. Administer your serving of vitamin C at the same time you take the L-glut. By the way, Vitamin C itself is a skin lighener in high (1000mg+) doses, over time. This is important and I will bring it up later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Consider a topical cream.&lt;br /&gt;L-glut works, but from the lower skin layers up. So a lot of people get discouraged at the rate of the lightening. I recommend adding a skin cream to the regimen for faster, longer lasting results. Personally I used Palmer&#x27;s Skin Success for the first two months, applying in the morning before heading out and in the evening before bed. This is not a recommendation-- I am just telling you what I used. Palmer&#x27;s SS has hydroquinone and I encourage you to do your own research. Other creams that use licorice extract and papaya may be more your thing. Aside from the additional lightening, many topical creams also include sunblock (more on that below) and alpha hydroxy among the ingredients. Alpha hydroxy accelerates the cycle at which your skin is shed and fresh cells are generated (\\&quot;skin renewal\\&quot;). That means faster results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Do not leave home without sunblock.&lt;br /&gt;This should be a no brainer, but I am sure many of the people who complain this product doesn&#x27;t work aren&#x27;t taking the best measures to protect themselves from UV rays that trigger your body to produce more melanin. So I am telling you now, don&#x27;t think you are just going to stay out the sun. If you are serious about results get a decent (SPF 50+) sun block or you might as well burn your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) Consider Soap.&lt;br /&gt;Whether you choose a lightening soap or just an exfoliating one, you can&#x27;t go wrong. It is simply an additional avenue for your melanin concentration to get knocked down, or your skin regeneration to be sped up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6) Keep realistic expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Your skin renews in about 14-30 days. Therefore, don&#x27;t expect to see results for at least a month. You don&#x27;t want to rush it anyway. Depending on how many shades you are going for, you may not want to use my additional suggestions such as soap and skin cream that hasten the lightening process. If you go from from Kelly Rowland to Beyonce in three months you will have family and friends asking what the heck is happening to you, and it will be more embarrassing than a compliment. When I saw that I was lightening faster than I felt comfortable I cut back on the soap and cream for a month. I got two shades later in my desired span of 3 months. I received many compliments that I have a warm glow, nice skin etc which is what I was looking for. I didn&#x27;t want anyone calling me out on skin bleaching. Light skin isn&#x27;t for everyone and when you take it too far (Micheal Jackson, Vybz Cartel) its far from attractive.. I&#x27;m mixed 25% white 75% black and already had mocha skin tone. I got to a caramel tone and felt that was far enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong with a solid regimen like this. It works almost too good and I encourage you to be not to rush it for a natural transition to a lighter complexion. However you should take vitamin C and use sunblock if you plan to commit to this product if you want to get the most bang for you buck. Thanks for reading!..
