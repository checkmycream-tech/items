            <li>I can even go to sleep and wake up with nice curls.</li>

            <li>We had tried a lot of Paul Mitchell products and liked how well they worked</li>
            <li>Not to mention it smells really nice.</li>

            <li>Fast delivery, awesome smell!</li>

            <li>If you want shiny, smooth amazing smelling hair buy this product!</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and makes my hair very soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s a very fine mist)</li>
            <li>It is the best available by far!</li>
            <li>I have been using for 2 years and have never had any more problems with breakage.  </li>
            <li>So I have to brush through it in order to be able to be able to straighten it.</li>
            <li>Awesome product; does protect your hair before doing our hot iron; I hot iron</li>
            <li>If I just straighten without this product, my hair seems to have more &amp;#34;fly aways&amp;#34; and looks dryer.</li>
            <li>I love this product but the spray bottle doesn&#x27;t work so no way to use it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>When I straighten my hair, this is my favorite product.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite thermal product</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>This thermal spray is in my opinion magic in a can.</li>
            <li>and she said it felt more like a hair spray in her hair than anything else.</li>
            <li>then this product might be OK for you</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair incredibly shiny and soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>but then within an hour or so most of the curl falls out.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the quick service providing this not to be beat hair product.  </li>
            <li>After you get out of the shower, spray some all over your hair (not too much though) and it smells amazing!</li>
            <li>It is a little easy to get carried away with spraying and a more neutral smell would be good (although woman are probably the primary target audience with this) but for guys its great too!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, I can&#x27;t remember the exact kind I used before</li>
            <li>It is a little easy to get carried away with spraying and a more neutral smell would be good (although woman are probably the primary target audience with this) but for guys its great too!ause</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, but you can find it for a more reasonable price elsewhere!!  </li>
            <li>this stuff really helps and it leaves it so soft afterwards and smells wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Great product, my favorite to use for flat ironing my hair.  </li>
            <li>I love to curl my hair, but because my hair is a longer length and pretty fine, it looks good when I first curl it</li>
            <li>First off, I love Paul Mitchell because all of the products are cruelty free!</li>
            <li>I have really fine hair and this stuff helps my hair hold a curl.</li>
            <li>Hot off the press is the best flat iron spray ever.   </li>
            <li>Makes hair smooth.</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel comfortable using it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing stuff, really.</li>
            <li>She put it on lightly and had this hair spray effect</li>
            <li>and then when I am done spray it all over for a light hold.</li>
            <li>because Im a dyed blonde with brazilian keratin, lol.</li>
            <li>After I spray and straighten, my hair feels so soft and smells so good</li>
            <li>If its recommended by a professional, it must be good.</li>
            <li>Most thermal sprays make my hair look greasy easily, but I do not have this issue with the hot off the press spray.</li>
            <li>I have an original bottle and it does not have a sticker wrapped around it.</li>
            <li>They are almost indistinguishable but pretty sure its bits of ironed spray (or pieces of skin from my iron burned scalp but</li>
            <li>First off let me say I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>It smells great, works great, and isn&#x27;t horribly expensive.</li>
            <li>Nothing special here.  </li>
            <li>( I have bright red hair).</li>
            <li>I had the help of my more stylish friends to help me figure out that its important to use a protective spray on your hair prior to ironing.  </li>
            <li>After getting a much needed haircut a month ago, I knew I needed to take better care of my hair.</li>
            <li>No more static, split ends, and provides a wonderful not heavy or sticky hold.</li>
            <li>I did not find this product as great as other people were saying as of</li>
            <li>So I just give another quick spray to help keep my hair in place.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and works well, but can dry out your hair and make it &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; if you use too much!</li>
            <li>As long as you don&#x27;t use too much, this is a great product.</li>
            <li>After that I sprayed this Hot of the Press on and continued to use the blow dryer and my hair is like SILK  that HOLDS!  </li>
            <li>In stores its usually $16, this deal is so good!</li>
            <li>Easy to use, deffinitely helps styling hair as I notice that if I dont use it and I curl my hair, the curls wont last more than a couple hours.</li>
            <li>( I know that&#x27;s it&#x27;s job, but I&#x27;ve used a fair amount of products that if you aren&#x27;t super careful, you get burnt hair).</li>
            <li>this is perfect thermal protection it is light enough to not weigh down my fine hair but has enough texture to hold my styles better than without it</li>
            <li>Keeps my fine hair curled for a much longer duration.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, my hair has never been this shiny or healthy looking, which was my other problem before using HOt off the PRess.  </li>
            <li>This Paul Mitchel flat iron spray works great at straightening my super thick hair and does a good job at protecting it from damage.</li>
            <li>The next time I used it, I made sure to put a light, even layer on.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I purchased this after my stylist used the product on my hair at my last color apt.</li>
            <li>worth the buy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s honestly worth all the money you spend on it, no doubt.</li>
            <li>I spray this on my hair right before I use a curling iron.</li>
            <li>It is very light, not wet</li>
            <li>I received the new bottle very quickly as well.</li>
            <li>Love this spray - makes hair super shiny when flat ironed.</li>
            <li>My wife recently purchased a nice hair flat iron and she wanted to try to use a thermal protection spray to make sure that she didn&#x27;t damage her hair.</li>
            <li>That seemed to do the trick: it made my hair smooth, soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair very straight too.</li>
            <li>Was told it would leave my fine hair soft.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair hard or sticky, and helps prevent fly away hair.  </li>
            <li>I stopped using it when I had my son because my hair always ends up in his mouth but still highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>I also like that I can use it on day one, sleep on my hair a couple of days, and it still stays straight!  </li>
            <li>This product is a must when using hot products on your hair.  </li>
            <li>I really feel like it protects my hair from the heat and keeps the curls locked in forever!</li>
            <li>If you love to curl your hair and have it STAY all day and into the next one or 2 days........</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product if you want to repair your hair!!</li>
            <li>If you use a curling iron or any product that heats up your head then use this first.  </li>
            <li>So for me this is really a miracle product!</li>
            <li>I have tried many different thermal protection sprays and this exceeds them all.</li>
            <li>Really protects against the onslaught of the curling iron!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as heavy as hairspray, so you have a nice flexible hold that looks and feels more natural.</li>
            <li>I tried TRESemme flat iron protection (its a pump style spray style like windex) and it was just ok</li>
            <li>you are looking for more hold in your hair and curls after using a flat iron</li>
            <li>Keeps my very fine, straight hair in a curl all day long (which is really saying something!).</li>
            <li>pretty much every day</li>
            <li>So on day 2 it&#x27;s still great if I just want to get up, spray it on my dry hair, blow dry to style it in place and go.  </li>
            <li>Hey guys who may be thinking that flat ironing their short hair into stylish fashions would be cool</li>
            <li>I read all the other reviews before I purchased this and as many others mentioned not to use too much of this product on your hair, I only sprayed it lightly from the middle down to the ends of my hair and that works great.</li>
            <li>They were very prompt and helpful in getting me the product I ordered.</li>
            <li>I thought I was buying a real Paul Mitchell product.</li>
            <li>and it protects the ends of my hair very well.</li>
            <li>but then upgraded to this spray by Paul Mitchell and really like it</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much because if you do, as some of the others have mentioned, your hair will get crunchy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that I really don&#x27;t need much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I gave in and started blow drying it straight.  </li>
            <li>It works sort of like a hair spray as well so don&#x27;t pack it on too much.</li>
            <li>Costs about as much as the Haute Iron Spray, too.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how much protection</li>
            <li>I like to let me hair almost completely dry before I give a quick overall spray, run my hands through my hair to make sure it gets all distributed throughout, and then iron.  </li>
            <li>this is actually providing my hair since I don&#x27;t use heat tools very much, but this spray definitely helps my style hold better.</li>
            <li>Years of doing this my hair was damaged, dry and filled with split ends.</li>
            <li>If you have colored hair, you have to watch out for alcohol being one of the main ingredients in a product, which it is in this, but unlike a lot of others, this doesn&#x27;t leech the color from my hair</li>
            <li>Hair holds for hours and hours, even in high humidity.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you just spray a little bit throughout your hair before you iron.</li>
            <li>Smells great and doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel weird like some products do.</li>
            <li>As far as protecting the hair from the heat I dont really know</li>
            <li>The extra money you will spend will definitely be worth it.</li>
            <li>The price was right and the delivery time was short...</li>
            <li>but more to tame it.</li>
            <li>It keeps hair smooth without the greasiness that you get from other products.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this product.  </li>
            <li>I order the Hot off the press thermal spray and was very excited when I received it a few days later.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t care for is the way it makes my hair look afterwards, it almost makes it look kind of dull if I spray too much so</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I made the mistake of spraying a LOT on before I ironed like I usually did with the drugstore heat shields, making sure to put extra on the ends to prevent them from splitting.</li>
            <li>Its nothing special, but I do like it more than other heat protection sprays I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>This product far exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li>then complete your styling with whatever heated tools you use.</li>
            <li>and I have used many products that make your hair oily quickly, greasy, stiff and just plain gross.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great as long as you don&#x27;t go to crazy with it.</li>
            <li>I am very picky with my hair products because I have such long hair and don&#x27;t want anything to happen to it...</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have much hope for it after that, but I had spent my money on it and didn&#x27;t want to just toss it out, so</li>
            <li>A worthy substitute for TIGI Catwalk&#x27;s Haute Iron Spray, which I usually use but ran out of and couldn&#x27;t find anywhere.</li>
            <li>I received a new bottle plus a small free gift to replace the other bottle.</li>
            <li>so you hair is not so flat and soft</li>
            <li>On really windy days must use hair spray after, but other days it is all I need to use.</li>
            <li>I also do not experience nearly as much damage to my hair from heat styling as I have seen with other brands of thermal protection spray.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really need to us any other spray than this.</li>
            <li>Not sure if the price is worth it</li>
            <li>If you have fine, thin hair, think twice about using this product.  </li>
            <li>Really gives your hair a little hold and helps protect</li>
            <li>But keep in mind that if you use too much here, your hair gets a little shiny, extra sticky, crunchy and those specks show up.  </li>
            <li>Really helps keep the frizzies down!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Awesome product; does protect your hair before doing our hot iron; I hot iron</li>
            <li> If I just straighten without this product, my hair seems to have more &amp;#34;fly aways&amp;#34; and looks dryer.</li>
            <li> I love this product but the spray bottle doesn&#x27;t work so no way to use it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> When I straighten my hair, this is my favorite product.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite thermal product</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love.</li>
            <li> This thermal spray is in my opinion magic in a can.</li>
            <li> and she said it felt more like a hair spray in her hair than anything else.</li>
            <li> then this product might be OK for you</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair incredibly shiny and soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> but then within an hour or so most of the curl falls out.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the quick service providing this not to be beat hair product.  </li>
            <li> After you get out of the shower, spray some all over your hair (not too much though) and it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> It is a little easy to get carried away with spraying and a more neutral smell would be good (although woman are probably the primary target audience with this) but for guys its great too!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, I can&#x27;t remember the exact kind I used before</li>
            <li> It is a little easy to get carried away with spraying and a more neutral smell would be good (although woman are probably the primary target audience with this) but for guys its great too!ause</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, but you can find it for a more reasonable price elsewhere!!  </li>
            <li> this stuff really helps and it leaves it so soft afterwards and smells wonderful.  </li>
            <li> Great product, my favorite to use for flat ironing my hair.  </li>
            <li> I love to curl my hair, but because my hair is a longer length and pretty fine, it looks good when I first curl it</li>
            <li> First off, I love Paul Mitchell because all of the products are cruelty free!</li>
            <li> I have really fine hair and this stuff helps my hair hold a curl.</li>
            <li> Hot off the press is the best flat iron spray ever.   </li>
            <li> Makes hair smooth.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel comfortable using it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing stuff, really.</li>
            <li> She put it on lightly and had this hair spray effect</li>
            <li> and then when I am done spray it all over for a light hold.</li>
            <li> because Im a dyed blonde with brazilian keratin, lol.</li>
            <li> After I spray and straighten, my hair feels so soft and smells so good</li>
            <li> If its recommended by a professional, it must be good.</li>
            <li> Most thermal sprays make my hair look greasy easily, but I do not have this issue with the hot off the press spray.</li>
            <li> I have an original bottle and it does not have a sticker wrapped around it.</li>
            <li> They are almost indistinguishable but pretty sure its bits of ironed spray (or pieces of skin from my iron burned scalp but</li>
            <li> First off let me say I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> It smells great, works great, and isn&#x27;t horribly expensive.</li>
            <li> Nothing special here.  </li>
            <li> ( I have bright red hair).</li>
            <li> I had the help of my more stylish friends to help me figure out that its important to use a protective spray on your hair prior to ironing.  </li>
            <li> After getting a much needed haircut a month ago, I knew I needed to take better care of my hair.</li>
            <li> No more static, split ends, and provides a wonderful not heavy or sticky hold.</li>
            <li> I did not find this product as great as other people were saying as of</li>
            <li> So I just give another quick spray to help keep my hair in place.  </li>
            <li> Smells great and works well, but can dry out your hair and make it &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; if you use too much!</li>
            <li> As long as you don&#x27;t use too much, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> After that I sprayed this Hot of the Press on and continued to use the blow dryer and my hair is like SILK  that HOLDS!  </li>
            <li> In stores its usually $16, this deal is so good!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, deffinitely helps styling hair as I notice that if I dont use it and I curl my hair, the curls wont last more than a couple hours.</li>
            <li> ( I know that&#x27;s it&#x27;s job, but I&#x27;ve used a fair amount of products that if you aren&#x27;t super careful, you get burnt hair).</li>
            <li> this is perfect thermal protection it is light enough to not weigh down my fine hair but has enough texture to hold my styles better than without it</li>
            <li> Keeps my fine hair curled for a much longer duration.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, my hair has never been this shiny or healthy looking, which was my other problem before using HOt off the PRess.  </li>
            <li> This Paul Mitchel flat iron spray works great at straightening my super thick hair and does a good job at protecting it from damage.</li>
            <li> The next time I used it, I made sure to put a light, even layer on.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after my stylist used the product on my hair at my last color apt.</li>
            <li> worth the buy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s honestly worth all the money you spend on it, no doubt.</li>
            <li> I spray this on my hair right before I use a curling iron.</li>
            <li> It is very light, not wet</li>
            <li> I received the new bottle very quickly as well.</li>
            <li> Love this spray - makes hair super shiny when flat ironed.</li>
            <li> My wife recently purchased a nice hair flat iron and she wanted to try to use a thermal protection spray to make sure that she didn&#x27;t damage her hair.</li>
            <li> That seemed to do the trick: it made my hair smooth, soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair very straight too.</li>
            <li> Was told it would leave my fine hair soft.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair hard or sticky, and helps prevent fly away hair.  </li>
            <li> I stopped using it when I had my son because my hair always ends up in his mouth but still highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I also like that I can use it on day one, sleep on my hair a couple of days, and it still stays straight!  </li>
            <li> This product is a must when using hot products on your hair.  </li>
            <li> I really feel like it protects my hair from the heat and keeps the curls locked in forever!</li>
            <li> If you love to curl your hair and have it STAY all day and into the next one or 2 days........</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product if you want to repair your hair!!</li>
            <li> If you use a curling iron or any product that heats up your head then use this first.  </li>
            <li> So for me this is really a miracle product!</li>
            <li> I have tried many different thermal protection sprays and this exceeds them all.</li>
            <li> Really protects against the onslaught of the curling iron!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as heavy as hairspray, so you have a nice flexible hold that looks and feels more natural.</li>
            <li> I tried TRESemme flat iron protection (its a pump style spray style like windex) and it was just ok</li>
            <li> you are looking for more hold in your hair and curls after using a flat iron</li>
            <li> Keeps my very fine, straight hair in a curl all day long (which is really saying something!).</li>
            <li> pretty much every day</li>
            <li> So on day 2 it&#x27;s still great if I just want to get up, spray it on my dry hair, blow dry to style it in place and go.  </li>
            <li> Hey guys who may be thinking that flat ironing their short hair into stylish fashions would be cool</li>
            <li> I read all the other reviews before I purchased this and as many others mentioned not to use too much of this product on your hair, I only sprayed it lightly from the middle down to the ends of my hair and that works great.</li>
            <li> They were very prompt and helpful in getting me the product I ordered.</li>
            <li> I thought I was buying a real Paul Mitchell product.</li>
            <li> and it protects the ends of my hair very well.</li>
            <li> but then upgraded to this spray by Paul Mitchell and really like it</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much because if you do, as some of the others have mentioned, your hair will get crunchy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that I really don&#x27;t need much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I gave in and started blow drying it straight.  </li>
            <li> It works sort of like a hair spray as well so don&#x27;t pack it on too much.</li>
            <li> Costs about as much as the Haute Iron Spray, too.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how much protection</li>
            <li> I like to let me hair almost completely dry before I give a quick overall spray, run my hands through my hair to make sure it gets all distributed throughout, and then iron.  </li>
            <li> this is actually providing my hair since I don&#x27;t use heat tools very much, but this spray definitely helps my style hold better.</li>
            <li> Years of doing this my hair was damaged, dry and filled with split ends.</li>
            <li> If you have colored hair, you have to watch out for alcohol being one of the main ingredients in a product, which it is in this, but unlike a lot of others, this doesn&#x27;t leech the color from my hair</li>
            <li> Hair holds for hours and hours, even in high humidity.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you just spray a little bit throughout your hair before you iron.</li>
            <li> Smells great and doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel weird like some products do.</li>
            <li> As far as protecting the hair from the heat I dont really know</li>
            <li> The extra money you will spend will definitely be worth it.</li>
            <li> The price was right and the delivery time was short...</li>
            <li> but more to tame it.</li>
            <li> It keeps hair smooth without the greasiness that you get from other products.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this product.  </li>
            <li> I order the Hot off the press thermal spray and was very excited when I received it a few days later.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t care for is the way it makes my hair look afterwards, it almost makes it look kind of dull if I spray too much so</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I made the mistake of spraying a LOT on before I ironed like I usually did with the drugstore heat shields, making sure to put extra on the ends to prevent them from splitting.</li>
            <li> Its nothing special, but I do like it more than other heat protection sprays I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> This product far exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li> then complete your styling with whatever heated tools you use.</li>
            <li> and I have used many products that make your hair oily quickly, greasy, stiff and just plain gross.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great as long as you don&#x27;t go to crazy with it.</li>
            <li> I am very picky with my hair products because I have such long hair and don&#x27;t want anything to happen to it...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have much hope for it after that, but I had spent my money on it and didn&#x27;t want to just toss it out, so</li>
            <li> A worthy substitute for TIGI Catwalk&#x27;s Haute Iron Spray, which I usually use but ran out of and couldn&#x27;t find anywhere.</li>
            <li> I received a new bottle plus a small free gift to replace the other bottle.</li>
            <li> so you hair is not so flat and soft</li>
            <li> On really windy days must use hair spray after, but other days it is all I need to use.</li>
            <li> I also do not experience nearly as much damage to my hair from heat styling as I have seen with other brands of thermal protection spray.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really need to us any other spray than this.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the price is worth it</li>
            <li> If you have fine, thin hair, think twice about using this product.  </li>
            <li> Really gives your hair a little hold and helps protect</li>
            <li> But keep in mind that if you use too much here, your hair gets a little shiny, extra sticky, crunchy and those specks show up.  </li>
            <li> Really helps keep the frizzies down!</li>
            <li> Let me first start by saying that my linen closet is FULL of expensive products that I don&#x27;t like!  </li>
            <li> I use this before using my Paul Mitchell Flat Iron.</li>
            <li> I was using a flat iron on my hair.  </li>
            <li> She recommended this product for use before using the flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Flat iron temp was 250.</li>
            <li> She used it when flat ironing my hair.  </li>
            <li> Helps protect your hair before you use a flat iron on it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to use a flat iron either.  </li>
            <li> She tells me if I don&#x27;t use it I will fry my hair with flat ironing it.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty thick hair</li>
            <li> This spray makes a big difference in your hair if you spray it on before you blow dry it.</li>
            <li> I do everything to my hair on a daily basis: blow dry, straighten, sometimes curl.</li>
            <li> I spray it on my ends after I dry my hair and before I curl, and my hair still has a bit of a curl the next day.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to spray too much or your hair will feel a little rough, similar to hair spray.</li>
            <li> Seriously think this was the first time windy weather didn&#x27;t make my hair into a flock of seagulls style hair.  </li>
            <li> I like to spray a little from far away</li>
            <li> I have very thin and fine hair.</li>
            <li> I do not like thermal sprays that are not aerosol; I think they make my hair too wet for the flat iron and that defeats the purpose of a protective spray to begin w/!</li>
            <li> and my hair does not feel dry or damaged.</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t dry anymore</li>
            <li> Partially dry your hair, then spray all over</li>
            <li> but this is not a &#x27;New&#x27;</li>
            <li> (yes thats exactly what I thought and really its not too bad to do).  </li>
            <li> Also, I noticed that if I do use too much, little bits of white looking specks show up while ironing.</li>
            <li> My hair is a little thick and very curly.</li>
            <li> Performed as expected.</li>
            <li> be careful with the amount you use.</li>
            <li> I have only used it a few times</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly, thick hair and when I use this before I straighten it helps my hair lay flatter.</li>
            <li> if I were to wash and blow dry with out flat ironing my hair would be a MESS!  </li>
            <li> My hair is very dry, and this makes it feel softer and less dry.</li>
            <li> Other products that I have tried were too wet.  </li>
            <li> I have VERY thick semi course hair, as it is highly lifted from highlights...</li>
            <li> Well at first I hated it, because it smelled like my Mom&#x27;s hairspray (although it is supposed to be unisex, right).</li>
            <li> As long as you don&#x27;t go too heavy on it, this stuff works wonders.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m always worried about damaging them since I blow dry and curl my hair a few times per week.</li>
            <li> (I have very thick hair, down to the middle of my back, for reference.)</li>
            <li> The bottle usually lasts me 2-3 months and that&#x27;s using it everyday with my long hair that is probably about 14-16 inches long.</li>
            <li> hair is an odd sticky, stiff texture and needs lots of combing and brush afterwards to get that strange texture out.</li>
            <li> My hair was looking dull and damaged and now looks like a hair commercial.</li>
            <li> I had some trouble with the spray button initially, but jiggled it into place and no more worries.</li>
            <li> Warning though, I did make the mistake of using it on my wet hair before I blow dried it</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down, give me helmet head, crunchy hair or let my hair get singed</li>
            <li> This product works well, but I can find other similar less expensive products that will do the same work on my hair.</li>
            <li> If I could give half a star I would.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m noticing less split ends</li>
            <li> Hair was very stiff and dry.</li>
            <li> it gives it a little hold</li>
            <li> Hair is glossy, still has volume, and product imparts a little bit of hold, too.</li>
            <li> this doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel heavy</li>
            <li> burned myself a few times figuring that out)</li>
            <li> There is probably something out there that has the same effect that is less expensive.</li>
            <li> i bought this at a rave review by a youtube guru, works really well, it doesnt smell bad or make your hair like really stiff.</li>
            <li> But as I have had no idea or expertise in the area of hair irons and products (get a small 1/2 inch iron - yeah</li>
            <li> Not sure it is all that I hoped for.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, in transit the bottle sprayed out into the box and was completely empty.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sad it was wasted.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed  and would like a bottle that actually works.</li>
            <li> I have difficult hair...</li>
            <li> For me it smells like girls hair salon (which isn&#x27;t really bad</li>
            <li> Leaked all out before I could use it :(</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this spray - makes hair super shiny when flat ironed. Perfect if you straighten your hair often and need some heat protection. I stopped using it when I had my son because my hair always ends up in his mouth but still highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I use this before using my Paul Mitchell Flat Iron. No frizzes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this since it came out, not only does it protect your hair it gives it a little hold so you hair is not so flat and soft</li>
            <li> My hair dresser used this product on me after I got my haircut and I absolutely loved it. Instead of buying it in the salon, I decided to go with the cheaper option and purchase it on Amazon. After I sprayed it onto my already blow-dryed hair, I attempted to straighten my hair. The product turned to a sticky, glue like substance that I had to pick out of my hair! Pieces of my hair even came out with it. This is definitely not the same product that my hair dresser used on me. ADVICE: If you&#x27;re going to buy any Paul Mitchell product, get in the salon or at a certified beauty supply store, NOT ONLINE! The extra money you will spend will definitely be worth it.</li>
            <li> Hot off the press is the best flat iron spray ever.   I have pretty thick hair so I need a lot of hold with my hair products.  This works great along with my hair spray for great hold.  Hot off the press also smells great and is not sticky!  I love it!</li>
            <li> I order the Hot off the press thermal spray and was very excited when I received it a few days later. Unfortunately, in transit the bottle sprayed out into the box and was completely empty. I emailed to let them know what happened and they took care of it immediately. I received a new bottle plus a small free gift to replace the other bottle. I received the new bottle very quickly as well. They were very prompt and helpful in getting me the product I ordered.</li>
            <li> I was using a flat iron on my hair.  My hair dresser noticed that my hair was breaking off.  She recommended this product for use before using the flat iron.  I have been using for 2 years and have never had any more problems with breakage.  I can&#x27;t live without this product.  Great.</li>
            <li> As long as you don&#x27;t go too heavy on it, this stuff works wonders. The first time I used it, I made the mistake of spraying a LOT on before I ironed like I usually did with the drugstore heat shields, making sure to put extra on the ends to prevent them from splitting. My hair came out crunchy and brittle! I didn&#x27;t have much hope for it after that, but I had spent my money on it and didn&#x27;t want to just toss it out, so I figured I&#x27;d suffer through the rest of the can. The next time I used it, I made sure to put a light, even layer on. That seemed to do the trick: it made my hair smooth, soft and shiny! This stuff works great as long as you don&#x27;t go to crazy with it. Smells great, too.</li>
            <li> I feel that it still works as a heat protector because I don&#x27;t smell my hair burning, but definitely not the same stuff as was used on my hair in the salon. I tend then it leaves me hair is an odd sticky, stiff texture and needs lots of combing and brush afterwards to get that strange texture out.</li>
            <li> Smells great. Not sure if the price is worth it but it does work well. There is probably something out there that has the same effect that is less expensive.</li>
            <li> It feels like hairspray when I put it on my hair. So I have to brush through it in order to be able to be able to straighten it. However, it does it&#x27;s job. It keeps my hair very straight too.</li>
            <li> Great product. Well worth the money. I have blonde extensions so I&#x27;m always worried about damaging them since I blow dry and curl my hair a few times per week. This product works great protecting my hair form all the damage. I read all the other reviews before I purchased this and as many others mentioned not to use too much of this product on your hair, I only sprayed it lightly from the middle down to the ends of my hair and that works great.</li>
            <li> Awesome product; does protect your hair before doing our hot iron; I hot iron my hair pretty much every day and my hair does not feel dry or damaged.</li>
            <li> I use the spray every time I use my straightening iron and I find it helps with the heat not to damage my hair.</li>
            <li> Great product, my favorite to use for flat ironing my hair.  On really windy days must use hair spray after, but other days it is all I need to use.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser suggested the product. I didnt feel like spending all the money while i was at the salon, so I bought it online. Its nothing special, but I do like it more than other heat protection sprays I have used in the past. My hair is very dry, and this makes it feel softer and less dry.</li>
            <li> Great product!! Does not weight. Makes hair smooth. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly, thick hair and when I use this before I straighten it helps my hair lay flatter. If I just straighten without this product, my hair seems to have more &amp;#34;fly aways&amp;#34; and looks dryer.</li>
            <li> Purchased from Paul Mitchell school. Was told it would leave my fine hair soft. NOT. Hair was very stiff and dry. Flat iron temp was 250. Used clarifying shampoo and deep conditioner to get product out of hair and hopefully put enough moisture back into my hair so I do not have to cut off a couple of inches. If you have fine, thin hair, think twice about using this product.  If I could give half a star I would.</li>
            <li> This is the only thermal protections spray that I have found that works for me. I have very thin and fine hair. Most thermal sprays make my hair look greasy easily, but I do not have this issue with the hot off the press spray. I also do not experience nearly as much damage to my hair from heat styling as I have seen with other brands of thermal protection spray. I have purchased this product from a salon, but it is cheaper through amazon for the same quality product.</li>
            <li> Really gives your hair a little hold and helps protect</li>
            <li> I purchased this after my stylist used the product on my hair at my last color apt. She used it when flat ironing my hair.  It smells wonderful and makes my hair very soft and manageable.  I have VERY thick semi course hair, as it is highly lifted from highlights...if I were to wash and blow dry with out flat ironing my hair would be a MESS!  This product tames my hair and makes it look lovely!  Will continue to order when I run out!</li>
            <li> I love this product but the spray bottle doesn&#x27;t work so no way to use it. I am very disappointed  and would like a bottle that actually works.</li>
            <li> I thought I was buying a real Paul Mitchell product. Based on the reviews I thought it was legitimate seller but what I received is a silver bottle with a Paul Mitchell sticker wrapped around. I have an original bottle and it does not have a sticker wrapped around it. The scent is completely different, who knows what chemicals are in it but this is not a &#x27;New&#x27; never opened proudest that was sent to me. It has been tampered with and is counterfeit. BUYER BEWARE!</li>
            <li> Bought it on the recommendation of a you-tube beauty blogger. Great choice. Smells fantastic. Does not leave a residue and protects hair while maintaining shine.</li>
            <li> This product works wonders on my hair. I use it before I use straighten or curl my hair to protect if from heat damage.  Smells great and doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel weird like some products do.</li>
            <li> Protects and smooths while styling, use it all the time!  It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair hard or sticky, and helps prevent fly away hair.  Especially helpful when dealing with humidity.</li>
            <li> I swear by this stuff. I do not like thermal sprays that are not aerosol; I think they make my hair too wet for the flat iron and that defeats the purpose of a protective spray to begin w/! this doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel heavy (I have very thick hair, down to the middle of my back, for reference.) and it protects the ends of my hair very well. I also like that I can use it on day one, sleep on my hair a couple of days, and it still stays straight!  Love!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this product is a knock off or what but the can has a sticky printed label rather than being imprinted on the can (not how Paul Mitchell products look at the store).  Just makes you wonder??  I don&#x27;t feel comfortable using it.</li>
            <li> this stuff not only helps protect your hair while heat styling, I use it in lieu or in addition to my regular styling products (mousse, gel, etc).  Amazon is the only place I can find it now so I just keep stocking up.</li>
            <li> Helps protect your hair before you use a flat iron on it. Hair holds for hours and hours, even in high humidity.</li>
            <li> Hey guys who may be thinking that flat ironing their short hair into stylish fashions would be cool (yes thats exactly what I thought and really its not too bad to do).  But as I have had no idea or expertise in the area of hair irons and products (get a small 1/2 inch iron - yeah burned myself a few times figuring that out) I had the help of my more stylish friends to help me figure out that its important to use a protective spray on your hair prior to ironing.  I tried TRESemme flat iron protection (its a pump style spray style like windex) and it was just ok but then upgraded to this spray by Paul Mitchell and really like it, here&#x27;s my experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Make sure you just spray a little bit throughout your hair before you iron. You don&#x27;t need much because if you do, as some of the others have mentioned, your hair will get crunchy.  I like to let me hair almost completely dry before I give a quick overall spray, run my hands through my hair to make sure it gets all distributed throughout, and then iron.  Also, I noticed that if I do use too much, little bits of white looking specks show up while ironing. They are almost indistinguishable but pretty sure its bits of ironed spray (or pieces of skin from my iron burned scalp but probably not).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Bonus! You can use it once you are done ironing and styling your hair as a hair spray.  So I just give another quick spray to help keep my hair in place.  Seriously think this was the first time windy weather didn&#x27;t make my hair into a flock of seagulls style hair.  But keep in mind that if you use too much here, your hair gets a little shiny, extra sticky, crunchy and those specks show up.  I&#x27;ve found that I really don&#x27;t need much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The smell.  Well at first I hated it, because it smelled like my Mom&#x27;s hairspray (although it is supposed to be unisex, right). For me it smells like girls hair salon (which isn&#x27;t really bad but not a smell I&#x27;m used to spraying at myself), but I&#x27;ve gotten over it because it doesn&#x27;t smell after you&#x27;ve gotten it on, especially after I&#x27;ve styled my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, its great! It is a little easy to get carried away with spraying and a more neutral smell would be good (although woman are probably the primary target audience with this) but for guys its great too!ause it doesn&#x27;t smell after you&#x27;ve gotten it on, especially after I&#x27;ve styled my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, its great! It is a little easy to get carried away with spraying and a more neutral smell would be good (although woman are probably the primary target audience with this) but for guys its great too!</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t look or smell fried when I use this product just before ironing my hair.  Pleasant fragrance also.</li>
            <li> This spray makes a big difference in your hair if you spray it on before you blow dry it. Really helps keep the frizzies down!</li>
            <li> Performed as expected. Recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s a thermal spray that I use with my straightener, and it&#x27;s a finishing spray to lock my style in place! It&#x27;s not as heavy as hairspray, so you have a nice flexible hold that looks and feels more natural.</li>
            <li> This product is a must when using hot products on your hair.  The fragrance and shine are great.  Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> AMAZING! Keeps my fine hair curled for a much longer duration.  Protects too? Added bonus.</li>
            <li> Let me first start by saying that my linen closet is FULL of expensive products that I don&#x27;t like!  I have naturally curly hair that for some reason , started to lose it&#x27;s curl.  I gave in and started blow drying it straight.  After that I sprayed this Hot of the Press on and continued to use the blow dryer and my hair is like SILK  that HOLDS!  It&#x27;s amazing stuff, really. Not sticky at ALL. I don&#x27;t need to use a flat iron either.  So on day 2 it&#x27;s still great if I just want to get up, spray it on my dry hair, blow dry to style it in place and go.  Honestly, my hair has never been this shiny or healthy looking, which was my other problem before using HOt off the PRess.  My hair was looking dull and damaged and now looks like a hair commercial.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair manageable and shiny.</li>
            <li> I spray this before I curl my hair. I don&#x27;t really need to us any other spray than this. It holds my curl until the next day. Absolutely love this.</li>
            <li> I spray this on my hair right before I use a curling iron. I really feel like it protects my hair from the heat and keeps the curls locked in forever! I can even go to sleep and wake up with nice curls. I will definitely repurchase this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product. When I straighten my hair, this is my favorite product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, but you can find it for a more reasonable price elsewhere!!  The spray itself works perfectly to protect my hair, and doesn&#x27;t make my hair oily!!</li>
            <li> Awesome, awesome, awesome product!!!  This product far exceeded my expectations.  I am an African American woman with truly coarse hair, but after reading reviews of this product on Amazon I gave it a try.  It made the flatIon glide through my unruly hair, and helped me to achieve Salon quality results at home!!!</li>
            <li> The best hair product</li>
            <li> Defective can. Leaked all out before I could use it :( This is my favorite thermal product so I&#x27;m sad it was wasted.</li>
            <li> Read the reviews before buying, bought 2 and almost finished one. Not sure it is all that I hoped for.</li>
            <li> You can tell the difference in the heat protection while using it as opposed to not using anything. Be careful not to spray too much or your hair will feel a little rough, similar to hair spray. As long as you don&#x27;t use too much, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Love. It smells great, works great, and isn&#x27;t horribly expensive. It doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down, give me helmet head, crunchy hair or let my hair get singed( I know that&#x27;s it&#x27;s job, but I&#x27;ve used a fair amount of products that if you aren&#x27;t super careful, you get burnt hair). If you have colored hair, you have to watch out for alcohol being one of the main ingredients in a product, which it is in this, but unlike a lot of others, this doesn&#x27;t leech the color from my hair( I have bright red hair). Basically, It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product.  If you love to curl your hair and have it STAY all day and into the next one or 2 days........spray this product on each section, curl with a curling iron, and then go on to the next section.  Once all the sections have cooled, BRUSH THROUGH the curls...YES, I said that.  These curls will beautifully.  I will never be without this again!</li>
            <li> Does what it says. My hair isn&#x27;t as fried as it used to be. Using with Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Heat Seal is a plus.</li>
            <li> This Paul Mitchel flat iron spray works great at straightening my super thick hair and does a good job at protecting it from damage. The only thing I don&#x27;t care for is the way it makes my hair look afterwards, it almost makes it look kind of dull if I spray too much so be careful with the amount you use.</li>
            <li> Does just what it says it does. No more static, split ends, and provides a wonderful not heavy or sticky hold.</li>
            <li> This product works well, but I can find other similar less expensive products that will do the same work on my hair.</li>
            <li> Nothing special here.  My stylist uses this product on my hair and boasts about how wonderful it is.  She tells me if I don&#x27;t use it I will fry my hair with flat ironing it.  It has a nice scent, but I think it makes my hair greasy.</li>
            <li> this is perfect thermal protection it is light enough to not weigh down my fine hair but has enough texture to hold my styles better than without it</li>
            <li> I used this to style my hair. It&#x27;s ok, I can&#x27;t remember the exact kind I used before and I thought this would work.</li>
            <li> i bought this at a rave review by a youtube guru, works really well, it doesnt smell bad or make your hair like really stiff. worth the buy</li>
            <li> I do everything to my hair on a daily basis: blow dry, straighten, sometimes curl. Years of doing this my hair was damaged, dry and filled with split ends. After getting a much needed haircut a month ago, I knew I needed to take better care of my hair. My hair stylist recommended Paul Mitchell&#x27;s hair products. This thermal spray is in my opinion magic in a can. After I spray and straighten, my hair feels so soft and smells so good like I just got out of the salon. My hair isn&#x27;t dry anymore and I&#x27;m noticing less split ends (I also use Paul Mitchell&#x27;s ginger sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner if that makes a difference). I highly recommend this product if you want to repair your hair!!</li>
            <li> this is a great product. I have been using Maul Mitchell for years! Its the best hair product out there</li>
            <li> First off let me say I LOVE this product. My hair is a little thick and very curly. This product is not meant to straighten your hair but more to tame it. After you get out of the shower, spray some all over your hair (not too much though) and it smells amazing! When you go to blow-dry your hair or straighten... you&#x27;ll see that your hair is super silky, smooth NOT frizzy and smells awesome. I am very picky with my hair products because I have such long hair and don&#x27;t want anything to happen to it... and I have used many products that make your hair oily quickly, greasy, stiff and just plain gross. If you want shiny, smooth amazing smelling hair buy this product! In stores its usually $16, this deal is so good! The bottle usually lasts me 2-3 months and that&#x27;s using it everyday with my long hair that is probably about 14-16 inches long. It&#x27;s honestly worth all the money you spend on it, no doubt. BUY THIS PRODUCT!! IT&#x27;S AMAZING</li>
            <li> My hair dresser recommended this to me. If its recommended by a professional, it must be good. It&#x27;s great! Smells good &amp; my hair looks perfect! No damage to my hair at all.</li>
            <li> every time i straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> My wife recently purchased a nice hair flat iron and she wanted to try to use a thermal protection spray to make sure that she didn&#x27;t damage her hair. We had tried a lot of Paul Mitchell products and liked how well they worked so I took her to a salon and we purchased a can of this. The salon actually recommended a lower priced product that they used in the salon but we trusted the Paul Mitchell product name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife immediately didn&#x27;t care for it and she said it felt more like a hair spray in her hair than anything else. She also felt that her hair actually looked frizzier using this product than without it. She didn&#x27;t want a hair spray or a stiffener and so this will be the last can of this product she will buy. She put it on lightly and had this hair spray effect and I have to admit her hair did look frizzier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for more hold in your hair and curls after using a flat iron then this product might be OK for you but my wife will not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Keeps my very fine, straight hair in a curl all day long (which is really saying something!). I spray it on my ends after I dry my hair and before I curl, and my hair still has a bit of a curl the next day. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> If you use a curling iron or any product that heats up your head then use this first.  It is very light, not wet and it protects your hair.Other products that I have tried were too wet.  This is perfect. Love it.</li>
            <li> I use this every time I curl my hair.  Wish it came in a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> Smells great and works well, but can dry out your hair and make it &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; if you use too much!</li>
            <li> First off, I love Paul Mitchell because all of the products are cruelty free! That is my number one priority! Also if I understand correctly, any animal ingredients have been replaced with man made versions so that&#x27;s great too! Now on to how it works. It works great! :D Warning though, I did make the mistake of using it on my wet hair before I blow dried it (should have read the instructions, I know). Any who, when used correctly it works great! It makes your hair incredibly shiny and soft and smooth! Not to mention it smells really nice. It works sort of like a hair spray as well so don&#x27;t pack it on too much. I like to spray a little from far away and then when I am done spray it all over for a light hold. I love it!</li>
            <li> Best lightweight heat protectant hairspray</li>
            <li> A worthy substitute for TIGI Catwalk&#x27;s Haute Iron Spray, which I usually use but ran out of and couldn&#x27;t find anywhere. Costs about as much as the Haute Iron Spray, too. The can says it provides a &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34;-- don&#x27;t worry, it is NOT a hairspray.</li>
            <li> I love to curl my hair, but because my hair is a longer length and pretty fine, it looks good when I first curl it but then within an hour or so most of the curl falls out. So for me this is really a miracle product! I love love love it!!! No matter what kind of curling iron I use it not only protects my hair from damage but also makes my curls last all day, and even the next day. If you have issues with your curls falling out, definatly try this stuff. It works great.</li>
            <li> I have difficult hair...this stuff really helps and it leaves it so soft afterwards and smells wonderful.  I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I love this product. Partially dry your hair, then spray all over (it&#x27;s a very fine mist) then complete your styling with whatever heated tools you use. Hair is glossy, still has volume, and product imparts a little bit of hold, too. I had some trouble with the spray button initially, but jiggled it into place and no more worries. Just a dud can, I think.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how much protection this is actually providing my hair since I don&#x27;t use heat tools very much, but this spray definitely helps my style hold better.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, awesome smell!</li>
            <li> I have tried many different thermal protection sprays and this exceeds them all. It keeps hair smooth without the greasiness that you get from other products.</li>
            <li> I did not find this product as great as other people were saying as of I have only used it a few times</li>
            <li> Easy to use, deffinitely helps styling hair as I notice that if I dont use it and I curl my hair, the curls wont last more than a couple hours. When I use this they last up to days. As far as protecting the hair from the heat I dont really know because Im a dyed blonde with brazilian keratin, lol.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the quick service providing this not to be beat hair product.  Really protects against the onslaught of the curling iron!  The price was right and the delivery time was short...what&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li> It is the best available by far!</li>
            <li> I have really fine hair and this stuff helps my hair hold a curl.</li>
    </ol>
