    <ol>
            <li>you will have to exert some effort to get them off, and it is best to brush thoroughly after-ward&#x27;s to remove all the gel.  </li>
            <li>Very impressed with the Rembrandt brand.</li>
            <li>Nothing against Rembrandt, though, as the best whitener I&#x27;ve used was some of their gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>think that the application and the adhesion of the strips is superb.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product.  </li>
            <li>Using a desensitizing toothpaste a number of days before using any bleaching product is the best practice...or better yet, place some of desensitizing toothpaste (any brand -</li>
            <li>I felt I got good whitening even after using it once for 1/2 hour.</li>
            <li>They arrived on time in good shape.  </li>
            <li>Of all the strips I have tried these are superior to the others...</li>
            <li>So, using that kind of toothpaste is probably a good idea while using any whitening product.</li>
            <li>The best way I can describe it is that they are moldable, and when you press them onto your teeth they cover them better, and stay in place easily.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very pleased with how effectively they are.</li>
            <li>Be sure to brush off the toothpaste before applying the strip!</li>
            <li>This are by far the best strips I have used!</li>
            <li>the amount of drool i have to say is kind of intense, but i expect by day 7 that i will be happy with this product at the rate of my improvements.</li>
            <li>He says that these fit much much better, stay in place, and are just a superior product.  </li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>I found them to be just okay.</li>
            <li>Rembrandt strips are much better.</li>
            <li>They work better too, as they mold to the teeth</li>
            <li>and I will be using it for many years to come.</li>
            <li>The strips aren&#x27;t flimsy; they&#x27;re more waxy so they form better to the teeth and stay put.</li>
            <li>I like the way Rembrandt strips cover much more tooth area..</li>
            <li>The gel seems more \\&quot;encased\\&quot;</li>
            <li>He said Crest white strips are the best.</li>
            <li>favorite--</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re cheaper than the Whitestrips also, and they cover more teeth</li>
            <li>so you get a more uniform whitening.    </li>
            <li>Imagine how bright I looked after a whole week.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>Out of all of the whitening products I have tried, this product is the most user friendly.</li>
            <li>They are also easy to remove.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you would get the same results if you bought 2 of these; it&#x27;d just take longer because they&#x27;re not as strong (sometimes that&#x27;s a good thing).</li>
            <li>These are comfortable and stay where you put them; but don&#x27;t get excited about the \\&quot;mint\\&quot; flavor, these still taste like peroxide.</li>
            <li>Someone asked me if I&#x27;m married to a dentist, I said no, but I love Rembrandt.  </li>
            <li>Your greatest amount of noticeable  change will come the first few days of your initial use of a bleaching product...and you may not notice much of a change with \\&quot;maintenance tune-ups\\&quot;, but tune-ups keep &#x27;em bright and light!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a Rembrandt fan for a long time now; so far these are the best whitening strips that I&#x27;ve found in its price range.</li>
            <li>Other reviewers have indicated that they experienced some discomfort using the strips.</li>
            <li>They whiten more quickly and stay on MUCH better than the Crest Whitestrips (my second</li>
            <li>They have a nice taste and they stay on your teeth better than any other brand of strip.</li>
            <li>Honestly, the taste is barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>They give you a nice white result too.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>do need to do semiannual touch-ups if you want to maintain your smile, but that goes with any whitening treatment.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, they didn&#x27;t exactly dissolve in 5 to 10 minutes as claimed, more like 20 minutes, and then they didn&#x27;t dissolve completely necessitating brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them for the full 5 days, and they really do whiten your teeth.  </li>
            <li>I have tried about 4 different types of white strips/ whitening products, and these are by far the best.  </li>
            <li>They also cost like 1/2 as much as most of the strips you can get at the grocery store, and only take 5 days.</li>
            <li>This is not a difficult decision to make.</li>
            <li>Rembrandt is the only teeth whitening and toothpaste product that I use and I love it.  </li>
            <li>pro&#x27;s: trays stick to teeth and stay in place, no white lines across teeth, no sensitivity, no disgusting taste in mouth,</li>
            <li>no weird \\&quot;slimy\\&quot; thing sliding around, results are excellent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The strips are TEN times better than any others; instead of having those cheap, flimsy clear little strips that glide off easily, these mold to the shape of your teeth and are literally STUCK on there (don&#x27;t worry, they&#x27;re easy to remove).</li>
            <li>They are a lot thicker than other strips, and they have a nice feeling when you apply them.</li>
            <li>I purchased this Rembrandt product after having positive results with their toothpaste and two hour whitening trays.</li>
            <li>they are maybe not the kind you can \\&quot;run down to the mall while</li>
            <li>After I had been using these strips per the directions for THREE days, people started randomly commenting on my beautiful smile, and even asking what I used.</li>
            <li>only gave it 4 stars because I&#x27;ve recently tried the Crest 3D Whitening strips and those work amazingly.</li>
            <li>The whitening strips worked very well.  </li>
            <li>They whitened reasonably well.</li>
            <li>I was very</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product for anyone who wants whiter teeth, but don&#x27;t have the time to see a dentist or for the strips that require wear (2)</li>
            <li>Thanks Rembrandt and thanks Amazon for making these a Deal of the Day.</li>
            <li>My son and I used these and didn&#x27;t see much difference in color to our teeth.</li>
            <li>So, if you have a Target nearby, I recommend trying their strips first because you get more for less</li>
            <li>For me personally, they didn&#x27;t give me a bit of sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;The true test of course, was, how much whiter did my teeth get?</li>
            <li>However, they&#x27;re a bit strong and do make your teeth hurt if you have sensitive teeth (even if you think you don&#x27;t), and they&#x27;re also double the price of these.</li>
            <li>You may only need to touch up with a single strip top-and-bottom once or twice a year to maintain a nice appearance...</li>
            <li>This product conforms to teeth very securely, covers all areas, and does not loose its adhesiveness after 1.5 hours (as long as I have tested).</li>
            <li>Less time each day, one week instead of two, easier to use packaging and strips, better results.</li>
            <li>all whitening strips pretty much use the same chemical to achieve whiteness so the real quality lies in the strip itself.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this</li>
            <li>The packages open easily, the strips are simple to apply and stay in place very well.</li>
            <li>All in all this is a trusted product that actually brightened my smile</li>
            <li>I could still eat and drink normally.</li>
            <li>Nearly all of the \\&quot;strips\\&quot; on the market have the same levels of peroxide for whitening; the true product differentiatior is the usability of the product.</li>
            <li>front, back and length of coverage is better than other products.  </li>
            <li>This fact is a GOOD thing, as there actually really IS gel still on the teeth, unlike other products that slowly wash away during the wearing.</li>
            <li>The strips stayed on for the full thirty minutes each day unlike other strips.</li>
            <li>A complete loss.</li>
            <li>and so far im two shades whiter in two days.</li>
            <li>I love these, and have been buying online since you cant seem to get them at stores lately.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t cause nearly the sensitivity that their Crest counterparts caused.</li>
            <li>My husband has used these for several years, has tried most of your other competitors, and has always come back to Rembrandt.  </li>
            <li>I have previously used Listerine Quick Dissolving strips.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The con&#x27;s: cost could be cheaper, there are store brand knockoffs now which may do a similar job, only one type to choose from (versus 7575978 kinds of crest strips!).&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, if you are like me, and don&#x27;t smoke, drink coffee, or drink tea or wine, then you will have sparkling white teeth in a few days with these strips, and it&#x27;ll last you a good six months.</li>
            <li>/&gt;A note for those with sensitive teeth, try using a toothpaste for sensitive teeth for a couple of days before starting the strips and continue to use it while you&#x27;re using the strips.  </li>
            <li>but they felt slimy and slid around in my mouth and the intense tooth sensitivity canceled out any positives for me.&lt;br /&gt;The Rembrandt ones are firm, instead of snail-like, and they really stick to every crevice of your teeth.</li>
            <li>These \\&quot;strip\\&quot; products actually bleach out the natural color of the teeth...</li>
            <li>If you have already used other products, using any strip thereafter may not seem to give \\&quot;as much of a result\\&quot; as the teeth may already have become lightened somewhat .  </li>
            <li>The strips are more of a wax like substance that takes a little while to mold to your teeth, so some firm pressing and holding / molding works.  </li>
            <li>I bought these during a one day sale for about half as much as they sell for in stores.</li>

            <li> This product did not work for me.  It hurt my gums, its painful, and my teeth are the same color as before.  A complete loss.</li>
            <li> Este producto funciona muy bien. Su objetivo de blanquear los dientes se cumple de manera eficaz. Recomiendo que lo compren.</li>
            <li> i got this in the mail yesterday and im liking what i see. two days of wearing the strips and I can see an improvement. im not experiencing any sensitivity so far, but my gums kinda feel like ive been brushing my teeth too hard. its not unbearable in any way. the amount of drool i have to say is kind of intense, but i expect by day 7 that i will be happy with this product at the rate of my improvements. i smoke a half pack of cigarettes a day, drink red wine every night, and coffee every morning. i definitely have done damage to the color of my teeth as you can imagine. they were veryy yellow and so far im two shades whiter in two days. hope this helps.</li>
            <li> These strips are thick and have a wax like appearance.  I couldn&#x27;t get them to stay put as they are very stiff.  If you push them down on one side, the other side pops up.  They also are too stiff to conform to the contours of my teeth.  They don&#x27;t stay in place.  I don&#x27;t recommend these strips.</li>
            <li> My husband has used these for several years, has tried most of your other competitors, and has always come back to Rembrandt.  He says that these fit much much better, stay in place, and are just a superior product.  Thank you for keeping this product on the market.  Don&#x27;t ever discontinue it.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t as slimy as the Crest ones. I felt I got good whitening even after using it once for 1/2 hour.</li>
            <li> I love these, and have been buying online since you cant seem to get them at stores lately. They are a lot thicker than other strips, and they have a nice feeling when you apply them. The best way I can describe it is that they are moldable, and when you press them onto your teeth they cover them better, and stay in place easily.  They also cost like 1/2 as much as most of the strips you can get at the grocery store, and only take 5 days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them for the full 5 days, and they really do whiten your teeth.  They are much thicker than the other brand that are a little slimy around your teeth.  The strips are more of a wax like substance that takes a little while to mold to your teeth, so some firm pressing and holding / molding works.  I find the upper strips get easier to work in than the bottom strips, and I even broke one of the bottom strips taking it out of the package!  Otherwise, they work well for the short period they are in your mouth.</li>
            <li> I love these. They have a nice taste and they stay on your teeth better than any other brand of strip. They give you a nice white result too.</li>
            <li> The whitening strips worked very well.  They arrived on time in good shape.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have previously used Listerine Quick Dissolving strips. I found them to be just okay. They whitened reasonably well. But the strips were flimsy and slipped around somewhat, making for a messy process. The packages were a little tricky to open, and some of the strips were wasted because of being torn or stuck together while opening the package. Also, they didn&#x27;t exactly dissolve in 5 to 10 minutes as claimed, more like 20 minutes, and then they didn&#x27;t dissolve completely necessitating brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Rembrandt strips are much better. The packages open easily, the strips are simple to apply and stay in place very well. They are also easy to remove. They work better too, as they mold to the teeth so no spots are missed, resulting in whitening being even across all tooth surfaces. Also, you apply them once a day for 30 minutes, as opposed to twice a day for 20 minutes each with Listerine. The treatment process is also shorter, as it&#x27;s just one week as opposed to two weeks for Listerine. And whitening (or at least brightening) is quite noticeable in just five days as claimed by the advertising. I was very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, let&#x27;s compare. Less time each day, one week instead of two, easier to use packaging and strips, better results. Not enough evidence? Rembrandt is also cheaper than Listerine on Amazon ($23 vs. $39). This is not a difficult decision to make. I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One final note. Other reviewers have indicated that they experienced some discomfort using the strips. I followed the advice of others and used a desensitizing toothpaste for a couple of days before and during the treatment week, and felt no discomfort at all. So, using that kind of toothpaste is probably a good idea while using any whitening product.</li>
            <li> I regret buying this product.  After using 1 strip, I had to take pain reliever for 2 days.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Rembrandt product after having positive results with their toothpaste and two hour whitening trays. This are by far the best strips I have used! The strips stayed on for the full thirty minutes each day unlike other strips. Honestly, the taste is barely noticeable. I did experience teeth spotting after the individual treatments. However, the spots went away within a few hours and are nothing to worry about. My teeth were slightly yellow to begin with and look much whiter after only a few days of treatments. I can&#x27;t wait to see the five day result! All in all this is a trusted product that actually brightened my smile and I will be using it for many years to come.</li>
            <li> I bought these during a one day sale for about half as much as they sell for in stores. I paid extra for shipping to get them in time to use them prior to my sister&#x27;s wedding. After using them only two times, I could see a difference. The strips aren&#x27;t flimsy; they&#x27;re more waxy so they form better to the teeth and stay put. They didn&#x27;t cause nearly the sensitivity that their Crest counterparts caused. I could still eat and drink normally. I&#x27;ve been very pleased with how effectively they are. Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> As a dental hygienist since 1988 I have been introduced to just about every product out there...Of all the strips I have tried these are superior to the others...they are maybe not the kind you can \\&quot;run down to the mall while wearing\\&quot;...these are visibly noticeable, and this is their only downfall.  However this doesn&#x27;t matter in the least to me...30 minutes once-a-day when convenient..morning or night..they STAY PUT!  It is the result that counts! The gel thickens and envelopes the teeth as the strip warms in your mouth...all whitening strips pretty much use the same chemical to achieve whiteness so the real quality lies in the strip itself.  I have been frustrated with the Crest strips, as they are thin and slide all over the teeth, losing gel the whole time... However Crest recently has improved them somewhat.  Sensitivity can occur with any brand as it is the ingredient and not the strip that causes it.  Using a desensitizing toothpaste a number of days before using any bleaching product is the best practice...or better yet, place some of desensitizing toothpaste (any brand - I use Aquafresh) in a night guard and wear for 10 minutes before applying any strip.  Be sure to brush off the toothpaste before applying the strip! I like the way Rembrandt strips cover much more tooth area..front, back and length of coverage is better than other products.  The gel seems more \\&quot;encased\\&quot; so you don&#x27;t end up simply swallowing all of it.  With other strips you battle to keep them on the teeth...With Rembrandt strips you will have to exert some effort to get them off, and it is best to brush thoroughly after-ward&#x27;s to remove all the gel.  This fact is a GOOD thing, as there actually really IS gel still on the teeth, unlike other products that slowly wash away during the wearing. These \\&quot;strip\\&quot; products actually bleach out the natural color of the teeth...\\&quot;whitening\\&quot; toothpastes merely remove extrinsic stains from the surface of the tooth...they do NOT change the actual color ofyour tooth .  If you have already used other products, using any strip thereafter may not seem to give \\&quot;as much of a result\\&quot; as the teeth may already have become lightened somewhat .  Your greatest amount of noticeable  change will come the first few days of your initial use of a bleaching product...and you may not notice much of a change with \\&quot;maintenance tune-ups\\&quot;, but tune-ups keep &#x27;em bright and light! You may only need to touch up with a single strip top-and-bottom once or twice a year to maintain a nice appearance...I wish you well as you use this product.</li>
            <li> The product was a bit bulky in my mouth but as another reviewer stated they do stay in place. Not sure I noticed as much improvement as with crest premium white strips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Rembrandt fan for a long time now; so far these are the best whitening strips that I&#x27;ve found in its price range. The strips are TEN times better than any others; instead of having those cheap, flimsy clear little strips that glide off easily, these mold to the shape of your teeth and are literally STUCK on there (don&#x27;t worry, they&#x27;re easy to remove). I also like how they have individual cut-outs for each tooth so you cover the sides of the tooth too, not just the flattest part on the front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only gave it 4 stars because I&#x27;ve recently tried the Crest 3D Whitening strips and those work amazingly. However, they&#x27;re a bit strong and do make your teeth hurt if you have sensitive teeth (even if you think you don&#x27;t), and they&#x27;re also double the price of these. I&#x27;m sure you would get the same results if you bought 2 of these; it&#x27;d just take longer because they&#x27;re not as strong (sometimes that&#x27;s a good thing).</li>
            <li> I have tried the Crest whitening strips in the past, and decided to go with the cheaper Rembrandt strips this time around. These strips did not work for me at all, and caused the same amount of tooth pain that the Crest ones did. I would just spend the extra money on the Crest next time.</li>
            <li> Out of all of the whitening products I have tried, this product is the most user friendly. Nearly all of the \\&quot;strips\\&quot; on the market have the same levels of peroxide for whitening; the true product differentiatior is the usability of the product. This product conforms to teeth very securely, covers all areas, and does not loose its adhesiveness after 1.5 hours (as long as I have tested).</li>
            <li> Ive been using this product for 3 days and have already seen an improvement in my color.  One of my bottom teeth was experiencing a little sensitivity but nothing too unbearable (just moments but that didn&#x27;t last very long).  I would recommend this product for anyone who wants whiter teeth, but don&#x27;t have the time to see a dentist or for the strips that require wear (2) times a day.  Very impressed with the Rembrandt brand.</li>
            <li> Rembrandt is the only teeth whitening and toothpaste product that I use and I love it.  People always ask me what I use.  Someone asked me if I&#x27;m married to a dentist, I said no, but I love Rembrandt.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> This product stays on your teeth, doesn&#x27; fall apart while getting them on your teeth</li>
            <li> I regreted ordering this stuff. The strips are too short, it only covers part of the teeth. I had to use 2 strips for the upper and 2 strips for the lower instead of 1 for each so I ended up using only 3 days instead of 7 days and I don&#x27;t see the differences.</li>
            <li> I will never, ever wear those slimy, slippery Crest strips again. These are comfortable and stay where you put them; but don&#x27;t get excited about the \\&quot;mint\\&quot; flavor, these still taste like peroxide. Thanks Rembrandt and thanks Amazon for making these a Deal of the Day.</li>
            <li> My son and I used these and didn&#x27;t see much difference in color to our teeth. He said Crest white strips are the best.</li>
            <li> I give the strips five stars, but I&#x27;m rating them at two stars because I didn&#x27;t notice any change in my teeth.  With every other whitening strip I&#x27;ve used over the years, I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement (multiple Crest strips and Target&#x27;s store brand).  Not with these, though.  However, others here have noted a nice improvement, so perhaps it was just me or a bad package (it had not expired, though).  Nothing against Rembrandt, though, as the best whitener I&#x27;ve used was some of their gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that the application and the adhesion of the strips is superb.  These are quite a bit thicker than the Crest strips and will not easily slip off like the Crest strips.  These are not unique, though.  I had used Target&#x27;s store brand before these (and since), and these are identical in construction except that Target&#x27;s strips are blue and these are white.  The Target strips are also quite a bit cheaper.  So, if you have a Target nearby, I recommend trying their strips first because you get more for less money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note for those with sensitive teeth, try using a toothpaste for sensitive teeth for a couple of days before starting the strips and continue to use it while you&#x27;re using the strips.  I use to experience extreme pain when using whitening strips, but I don&#x27;t now that I use toothpaste for sensitive teeth during whitening.  I&#x27;ve used Colgate, Crest, and Sensodyne - they all work the same for me.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I have tried about 4 different types of white strips/ whitening products, and these are by far the best.  They whiten more quickly and stay on MUCH better than the Crest Whitestrips (my second favorite-- they&#x27;re my fall back).  Not only that, but they&#x27;re cheaper than the Whitestrips also, and they cover more teeth so you get a more uniform whitening.    I could see a difference after two uses.  I&#x27;m a convert.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these strips almost exclusively since I&#x27;ve discovered them in 2005. A couple years ago, there was just Crest Whitestrips and these Rembrandt whitening strips.&lt;br /&gt;I had tried the Crest ones but they felt slimy and slid around in my mouth and the intense tooth sensitivity canceled out any positives for me.&lt;br /&gt;The Rembrandt ones are firm, instead of snail-like, and they really stick to every crevice of your teeth. For me personally, they didn&#x27;t give me a bit of sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;The true test of course, was, how much whiter did my teeth get? After I had been using these strips per the directions for THREE days, people started randomly commenting on my beautiful smile, and even asking what I used. Imagine how bright I looked after a whole week.&lt;br /&gt;You do need to do semiannual touch-ups if you want to maintain your smile, but that goes with any whitening treatment.&lt;br /&gt;The pro&#x27;s: trays stick to teeth and stay in place, no white lines across teeth, no sensitivity, no disgusting taste in mouth, no weird \\&quot;slimy\\&quot; thing sliding around, results are excellent.&lt;br /&gt;The con&#x27;s: cost could be cheaper, there are store brand knockoffs now which may do a similar job, only one type to choose from (versus 7575978 kinds of crest strips!).&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, if you are like me, and don&#x27;t smoke, drink coffee, or drink tea or wine, then you will have sparkling white teeth in a few days with these strips, and it&#x27;ll last you a good six months.</li>
