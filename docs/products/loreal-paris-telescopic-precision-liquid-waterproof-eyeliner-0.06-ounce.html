            <li>A wonderful thing about this is it doesnt smudge!</li>
            <li>The tool to apply the eyeliner is wonderful.</li>
            <li>Perfectly crappy piece.</li>
            <li>Great product, have used for years.</li>
            <li>, however it stays on great throughout the day.  </li>

            <li>Good product.</li>

            <li>It doesn&#x27;t give me raccoon eyes, goes on smooth, and is the best liquid eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite eyeliner!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have any makeup remover handy, you can just rub it off with a tissue or facecloth.</li>
            <li>I do prefer the pen kind rather that the felt tipped kind that you have to dip</li>
            <li>Try it at your own risk.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s easy to use, goes on smooth, and the tip is perfect for leaving that cute extending line on the corners.</li>
            <li>Eventhough I don&#x27;t have a steady hand, it turns out perfect.</li>
            <li>Amazing liquid eyeliner, leaves it very nice and clean.</li>
            <li>Still, a good eyeliner and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>if not the warm weather makes it rub off on the top of my lashes.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s also very comfortable) and did not budge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s more like a felt tip pen</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure happens with all liquid eyeliners)</li>
            <li>I love liquid eyeliner, but this one is peels and feckles onto the face.  </li>
            <li>Thought maybe it would do better as an upper-lid liner.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t give you raccoon eyes :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really pigmented and has great coverage.</li>
            <li>I guess there are many more out there</li>
            <li>that are better.</li>
            <li>but yet again it will be better used in the colder days to come.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a &#x27;flake-type&#x27; than &#x27;smudge-type&#x27; eyeliner, in that, when it does come off, it flakes or peels off.</li>
            <li>for the price this waterproof eyeliner is my favorite.</li>
            <li>and I just bought more of it.  </li>
            <li>and I love to use this with mascara.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite eye liner.</li>
            <li>Although I have tried some pretty good eyeliners, none work as well as this one.  </li>
            <li>For a beginner, the foam tips are better but they don&#x27;t allow as precise of a line.</li>
            <li>the mistake ,came off really easily</li>
            <li>goes on easily.</li>
            <li>It sort of forms a strip that will peel off easily when washed</li>
            <li>, I can easily peel it off at the end of the day if I wanted to.</li>
            <li>It glides on easily , it lasts all day , and is waterproof yet easy to take off when you need to take it off.</li>
            <li>It is easy to put on in the morning --</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and it stays on ALL DAY.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year, and I find the applicator is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>And for liquid eyeliner, it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li>the positive side, the applicator tip was very fine and was easy to use, so there was that.</li>
            <li>It goes on perfectly smooth.</li>
            <li>I have very oily eyelids with deep-set eyes, and this is the only eyeliner I&#x27;ve used that looks perfect after oily lids, watery eyes from allergies, humidity and drizzly rain, and an hour in the pool.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really waterproof -- last summer I wore it into a swimming pool and it came out perfectly.  </li>
            <li>You can go swimming in this and it won&#x27;t come off, but it&#x27;s super easy to get off at night.</li>
            <li>This stuff is definitely worth the price you pay !</li>
            <li>The liquid itself is very good, it comes out really black.</li>
            <li>This performs nearly as well for far cheaper, so I would pick this up if you&#x27;re looking for a good waterproof liquid eyeliner!</li>
            <li>I wear cat eye eyeliner pretty much everyday and this is the best liner I&#x27;ve found!!!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have a chance to test if its waterproof, but overall its a good eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Intense Felt Tip Liquid Eyeliner is much better and stays on longer even though it&#x27;s not marketed as waterproof.</li>
            <li>I like the product very much, it stays on, doesn&#x27;t smudge but comes off easily with makeup remove.  </li>
            <li>The makeup dries quickly too.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the product is waterproof, but it&#x27;s a non-issue because it flakes off.</li>
            <li>Seriously, never had a liquid liner with this type of staying power!!!</li>
            <li>Definitely my new favorite eyeliner.</li>
            <li>The color is a great jet black though</li>
            <li>It applies smoothly with a fine, soft tip, and dries fairly quickly, but not so quickly that I can&#x27;t wipe off mistakes.</li>
            <li>overall really nice liner but not quite waterproof</li>
            <li>By far my favorite eyeliner.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner is very easy to apply because of the short tip of the applicator.  </li>
            <li>It goes on well; gets old very quickly.</li>
            <li>This is my first liquid eyeliner I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This absolutely does not smudge!  </li>
            <li>and these stay on really well!</li>
            <li>favorite liquid liner is Urban Decay&#x27;s Perversion</li>
            <li>I occasionally use high-end pencil liner, haven&#x27;t dabbled with high-end liquid liner yet, but this is truly my favorite liquid,&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the first liquid I&#x27;ve used, but I&#x27;ve tried my fair share of creme and kohl pencils and all pale in comparison.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much, I would never go back to pencil eyeliner or gel.</li>
            <li>i love this eyeliner it stays on for a long time .</li>
            <li>This is a nice product- lasted about two months, color was dark-</li>
            <li>The product is not 100% waterproof but pretty good and long lasting.</li>
            <li>Make sure you let it dry before batting your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In that case, sometimes, it gets on the area above my eyes, but it is easy to remove.</li>
            <li>and it looked exactly as it did prior to crying, which is a great thing in a liquid liner.</li>
            <li>Thus, I was constantly removing gobs of burning black eyeliner from my eyes, which was an attractive look in front of my class.</li>
            <li>I would have given it 5 stars if the applicator was a real brush.</li>
            <li>It rained the whole time and my eyeliner DID NOT BUDGE.</li>
            <li>not as much as the non-waterproof though.</li>
            <li>I am really picky about the coverage.</li>
            <li>I used to live in hot and humid Mississippi, and this eyeliner stood up to it everytime.</li>
            <li>I find that this one might need a second coat applied once the first one dries, otherwise I just go over the top of the liquid eyeliner with a regular eyeliner pencil.</li>
            <li>Easy to hold and apply,the brush is short and thick so nice for the wing eye look</li>
            <li>I would not purchase this again, mainly because I think eye makeup should NOT BURN A PERSON&#x27;S EYES.</li>
            <li>This went on like a dream, but I noticed it started to peel off like a masque after a few hours.not sure why, perhaps interacting with my face products, but it didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li>I wear thick eyeliner almost every single day and this is definitely the BEST liquid liner I have ever used.</li>
            <li>but as a person who uses eyeliner everyday I know better than that.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know if you can add eye drops to it to make it last longer, but it is still worth the purchase.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it is fine.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to use and a mice dark color.</li>
            <li>and you need a new one.</li>
            <li>I have a pretty oily face and eyeliner would constantly smear or imprint itself below my lower lashes, but I don&#x27;t have that problem with this eyeliner!</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I don&#x27;t mind dark brown...</li>
            <li>Water proof, easy to apply, and very dark.</li>
            <li>My only criticism is that sometimes the liquid liner coagulates a little around the top of the bottle, and you&#x27;ve got to wipe it off the wand with a tissue.  </li>
            <li>This has consistently happened with the last several bottles of this particular liner.</li>
            <li>and so therefore a lot more air will allowed into my tubes, but even then, each tube lasts me 3 months at least.</li>
            <li>Been using this product for nearly 5 years now.</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;ve made mistakes it wiped off easy as long as it was still wet or damp</li>
            <li>The main reason I wanted to try this eyeliner was to see if I could use it instead of a pencil on the inner rim of my lower lids.</li>
            <li>I have very watery eyes from allergies and needed something that would stay on for as long as i needed it to.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it, but it does have a few cons, it sort of flakes off as the day goes by, but not enough that your eyeliner looks any different.</li>
            <li>I have to have my eyeliner extra black and rich in color.</li>
            <li>Well, after wearing it for a few days in the hot August sun, I can say it does stay!  </li>
            <li>Prior to using this product, I was using brush and gel eyeliner that L&#x27;oreal offers.</li>
            <li>Top of it&#x27;s game for this price</li>
            <li>Also, because of the flaking issue, touch-ups at the end of the night can be more difficult, since the &#x27;old&#x27; line has a tendency to catch onto the brush (which is a sponge-tip, btw).</li>
            <li>Also, because it is waterproof, it can be very hard to take off but easily done with a make up removal pad/towelette.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m one of those people that only wears concealer and eyeliner and perhaps a bold lip color, and since I wear so little makeup, the little makeup I wear should be decent</li>
            <li>It comes off when I want it to but does not really smear much after it&#x27;s dry.  </li>

            <li> i love this eyeliner it stays on for a long time .</li>
            <li> This is a nice product- lasted about two months, color was dark-</li>
            <li> The product is not 100% waterproof but pretty good and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Make sure you let it dry before batting your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In that case, sometimes, it gets on the area above my eyes, but it is easy to remove.</li>
            <li> and it looked exactly as it did prior to crying, which is a great thing in a liquid liner.</li>
            <li> Thus, I was constantly removing gobs of burning black eyeliner from my eyes, which was an attractive look in front of my class.</li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars if the applicator was a real brush.</li>
            <li> It rained the whole time and my eyeliner DID NOT BUDGE.</li>
            <li> not as much as the non-waterproof though.</li>
            <li> I am really picky about the coverage.</li>
            <li> I used to live in hot and humid Mississippi, and this eyeliner stood up to it everytime.</li>
            <li> I find that this one might need a second coat applied once the first one dries, otherwise I just go over the top of the liquid eyeliner with a regular eyeliner pencil.</li>
            <li> Easy to hold and apply,the brush is short and thick so nice for the wing eye look</li>
            <li> I would not purchase this again, mainly because I think eye makeup should NOT BURN A PERSON&#x27;S EYES.</li>
            <li> This went on like a dream, but I noticed it started to peel off like a masque after a few hours.not sure why, perhaps interacting with my face products, but it didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li> I wear thick eyeliner almost every single day and this is definitely the BEST liquid liner I have ever used.</li>
            <li> but as a person who uses eyeliner everyday I know better than that.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know if you can add eye drops to it to make it last longer, but it is still worth the purchase.  </li>
            <li> Other than that it is fine.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to use and a mice dark color.</li>
            <li> and you need a new one.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty oily face and eyeliner would constantly smear or imprint itself below my lower lashes, but I don&#x27;t have that problem with this eyeliner!</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I don&#x27;t mind dark brown...</li>
            <li> Water proof, easy to apply, and very dark.</li>
            <li> My only criticism is that sometimes the liquid liner coagulates a little around the top of the bottle, and you&#x27;ve got to wipe it off the wand with a tissue.  </li>
            <li> This has consistently happened with the last several bottles of this particular liner.</li>
            <li> and so therefore a lot more air will allowed into my tubes, but even then, each tube lasts me 3 months at least.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for nearly 5 years now.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;ve made mistakes it wiped off easy as long as it was still wet or damp</li>
            <li> The main reason I wanted to try this eyeliner was to see if I could use it instead of a pencil on the inner rim of my lower lids.</li>
            <li> I have very watery eyes from allergies and needed something that would stay on for as long as i needed it to.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it, but it does have a few cons, it sort of flakes off as the day goes by, but not enough that your eyeliner looks any different.</li>
            <li> I have to have my eyeliner extra black and rich in color.</li>
            <li> Well, after wearing it for a few days in the hot August sun, I can say it does stay!  </li>
            <li> Prior to using this product, I was using brush and gel eyeliner that L&#x27;oreal offers.</li>
            <li> Top of it&#x27;s game for this price</li>
            <li> Also, because of the flaking issue, touch-ups at the end of the night can be more difficult, since the &#x27;old&#x27; line has a tendency to catch onto the brush (which is a sponge-tip, btw).</li>
            <li> Also, because it is waterproof, it can be very hard to take off but easily done with a make up removal pad/towelette.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m one of those people that only wears concealer and eyeliner and perhaps a bold lip color, and since I wear so little makeup, the little makeup I wear should be decent</li>
            <li> It comes off when I want it to but does not really smear much after it&#x27;s dry.  </li>
            <li> The felt tip is good to use for thin or thick lines depending on your preference.</li>
            <li> Normally, when I wear liquid liner it smudges down below my eyes but this has not happened with this liner.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very black and very waterproof.</li>
            <li> Not a major problem since this, again, is hours into your night, but I thought I&#x27;d note it anyway,</li>
            <li> The only negative is that it adheres to my eyelashes to much.</li>
            <li> This causes the liquid inside to dry up eventually, even though there is still some left.</li>
            <li> I will keep using it as long as they continue to make it.</li>
            <li> But for crying out loud, everyone gets makeup in her eyes once in a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like this eyeliner for a long wearing liner.</li>
            <li> It also is water proof, just as long as you don&#x27;t rub it.</li>
            <li> The only problem I&#x27;ve had is when I put it on and don&#x27;t let it dry before opening my eyes wide.  </li>
            <li> As for the actual line, parts of it stayed on, but other parts flaked off.</li>
            <li> Lasts for a very long time</li>
            <li> It does dry shiny though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna go back to my trust Stilla liquid liner, expensive but worth it after trying some of the store brand stuff.</li>

            <li> brush is a little short and lacks flexibility, but it only takes one or two tries to get used to it.</li>
            <li> When it dries on your skin, it&#x27;s truly waterproof and--assuming you&#x27;re not scrubbing at your eyes--it lasts a long time (will partially come off if you sleep in it, though).</li>
            <li> The only slight downside(which</li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly,If I made an error It dried almost instantly</li>
            <li> Absolutely no smudging</li>
            <li> I have deep set eyes and have always had trouble with smudging.  </li>
            <li> But be careful.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> When it is applied, it also maintains a shiny look, like it is wet.</li>
            <li> The brush is fantastic and can thin or thick lines.</li>
            <li> I am also not going to bother with other products when this one works so well for me.</li>
            <li> If you try to wipe off part of your eyeliner to redraw it, it&#x27;ll peel off other bits of the eyeliner with it.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical whether this product would remain on my eyelids all day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this brand over three years now and it always outshines other liquid eyeliners in my opinion.</li>
            <li> But that could be due to my oily skin.</li>
            <li> gives only a thick line.  </li>
            <li> I am used to the gel liner or black Loreal pencil/smudger that being said,</li>
            <li> I wanted to switch to a water proof liner during spring/summer to prevent &#x27;&#x27;black under</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using a previous eyeliner brush with this container</li>
            <li> I have slightly hooded eyes</li>
            <li> while it is waterproof it flakes off throughout the day and looks like a shiny black after it dries.</li>
            <li> I wear it in black.</li>
            <li> This liner smeared and creased (all over my lids) after less than four hours, working in an office in 70 degree, non-humid conditions.</li>
            <li> but after a time the lid no longer screws on tight like it should.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Regardless of the minor issues, I was rubbing my eye like crazy from midday tiredness, completely forgetting that I was wearing eyeliner</li>
            <li> It does take some practice if you&#x27;re not familiar with the eyeliner tip.</li>
            <li> This goes on shiny and when you try to remove it, it comes off it little clumps that get all over your face.</li>
            <li> This is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; eyeliner, hands down!</li>
            <li> I use it everyday</li>
            <li> I wear this eyeliner everyday.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of traditional, thin brush tips.</li>
            <li> Even the few times Ive fallen asleep with it on</li>
            <li> Just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Wasted money on this one.</li>
            <li> I like a thin line of liquid liner right on my lash line, and after this dries it&#x27;s this weird rubbery, gummy thing.</li>

            <li> One thing I don&#x27;t like is the stiff felt like applicator tip.</li>
            <li> but it was sealed tight in the packaging, not sure.</li>

            <li> only con is that it is a little tough to remove, but that&#x27;s a small complaint.</li>
            <li> However, after awhile it separates and the brush is coated with a dull black</li>

            <li> it sucks it flakes&amp;#34; - the package says waterproof and does just that.</li>
            <li> For those saying it flakes off, it does, after being worn for at least 20 + hours.</li>
            <li> What I like about it is that as tough and waterproof as the eyeliner is</li>
            <li> Not attractive at the office of course</li>
            <li> - I like a thin line and to build it up this</li>
            <li> so I like my lines as thin as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> *** was irritating to my waterline!</li>
            <li> However, it burned my eyes horribly, and what did stay on the inner rims flaked off in chunks as the day went on.</li>
            <li> I wear waterproof because I am a contact wearer of 30 years and have learned (unfortunately through trial, error, and pain) not to wear makeup that &#x27;might&#x27; run into my eyes.</li>
            <li> it stays on all day if the weather is cold.</li>
            <li> THE WRONG COLOR!</li>
            <li> Ive been using it for years now and will be very sad if it ever stops being produced.</li>
            <li> I bought this 2 weeks ago after being frustrated with the raccoon eyes</li>
            <li> Also if you don&#x27;t get it all off when you wash your face it tends to cake at the base of your eyelashes.</li>
            <li> but the formula is horrible after it dries.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product, have used for years.</li>
            <li> I am used to the gel liner or black Loreal pencil/smudger that being said,I wanted to switch to a water proof liner during spring/summer to prevent &#x27;&#x27;black under eye look&#x27;&#x27; Not attractive at the office of course AND I work a 9 hour day staring at a computer screen. So my eye makeup has to last! That being said I tried the Telescopic liner because of a coupon it was only 4 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;First. Easy to hold and apply,the brush is short and thick so nice for the wing eye look&lt;br /&gt;Secondly,If I made an error It dried almost instantly and I used my smudger from my pencil to just &#x27;&#x27;erase&#x27;&#x27; the mistake ,came off really easily&lt;br /&gt;not good if your wanting it to stay all day.&lt;br /&gt;Finally ,the BIG test ,wearing it for 9 hours without the under eye shadow….Yes,it worked!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a 3 star because it flakes off if touched/rubbed but as a person who uses eyeliner everyday I know better than that.&lt;br /&gt;The cost with a coupon was awesome as I will be saving these when I come across them ,because I will purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;Cant wait to see if it holds up to swimming,I never wear makeup at the pool but I will now if it stays.&lt;br /&gt;Will follow up later .</li>
            <li> I like the product very much, it stays on, doesn&#x27;t smudge but comes off easily with makeup remove.  But the applicator - I thought I was buying a brush but it&#x27;s more like a felt tip pen - I like a thin line and to build it up this gives only a thick line.  I&#x27;m using a previous eyeliner brush with this container and I have no intention of every purchasing this product again.  I would have given it 5 stars if the applicator was a real brush.</li>
            <li> goes on easily. Has a perfect fine line. I have no problem with it.</li>
            <li> Makes a perfect line.  Love it!</li>
            <li> So I like the brush and the way it applies but the formula is horrible after it dries. I like a thin line of liquid liner right on my lash line, and after this dries it&#x27;s this weird rubbery, gummy thing. It peels and flakes off. I&#x27;m not sure if I got a defective one but it was sealed tight in the packaging, not sure. I&#x27;m gonna go back to my trust Stilla liquid liner, expensive but worth it after trying some of the store brand stuff.</li>
            <li> It does clump and come off in strips at times.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is very easy to apply because of the short tip of the applicator.  It stays on all day and has never smudged on me.  Normally, when I wear liquid liner it smudges down below my eyes but this has not happened with this liner.  Also, I have cried using this and it looked exactly as it did prior to crying, which is a great thing in a liquid liner.</li>
            <li> I would use it again.  When I&#x27;ve made mistakes it wiped off easy as long as it was still wet or damp</li>
            <li> This is my favorite eyeliner ever!!!! Absolutely no smudging</li>
            <li> This s*** was irritating to my waterline!</li>
            <li> This is a nice product- lasted about two months, color was dark- went on well- no irritation. Good product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a chance to test if its waterproof, but overall its a good eyeliner. It does dry shiny though. The felt tip is good to use for thin or thick lines depending on your preference. After some hours, it does tend to flake on the ends of my eye.</li>
            <li> Prior to using this product, I was using brush and gel eyeliner that L&#x27;oreal offers. This is my first liquid eyeliner I have ever used. But it&#x27;s easy to use, goes on smooth, and the tip is perfect for leaving that cute extending line on the corners. I love this product so much, I would never go back to pencil eyeliner or gel. I am also not going to bother with other products when this one works so well for me. It&#x27;s good quality and quantity for the price. The only slight downside(which I&#x27;m sure happens with all liquid eyeliners) is that it dries out over time if you don&#x27;t use it frequently enough. I use it everyday and so therefore a lot more air will allowed into my tubes, but even then, each tube lasts me 3 months at least.</li>
            <li> I love liquid eyeliner, but this one is peels and feckles onto the face.  It goes on well; gets old very quickly.</li>
            <li> Eyeliner came intact, and on time. It truly is waterproof and stays on all day. The price was cheaper than in retail stores, and I would buy this product again!</li>
            <li> This absolutely does not smudge!  It sort of forms a strip that will peel off easily when washed, however it stays on great throughout the day.  I have deep set eyes and have always had trouble with smudging.  Although I have tried some pretty good eyeliners, none work as well as this one.  I will keep using it as long as they continue to make it.</li>
            <li> The main reason I wanted to try this eyeliner was to see if I could use it instead of a pencil on the inner rim of my lower lids. However, it burned my eyes horribly, and what did stay on the inner rims flaked off in chunks as the day went on. Thus, I was constantly removing gobs of burning black eyeliner from my eyes, which was an attractive look in front of my class. Thought maybe it would do better as an upper-lid liner. Again, though, one tiny slip and it got into my eye and burned like the lava over Pompeii. As for the actual line, parts of it stayed on, but other parts flaked off. I would not purchase this again, mainly because I think eye makeup should NOT BURN A PERSON&#x27;S EYES. Yes, I know it isn&#x27;t supposed to go *in* your eye. But for crying out loud, everyone gets makeup in her eyes once in a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side, the applicator tip was very fine and was easy to use, so there was that.</li>
            <li> Wore this eyeliner when I ran this year&#x27;s Boston Marathon. It rained the whole time and my eyeliner DID NOT BUDGE. are you kidding me??? literally flawless.</li>
            <li> I like this eyeliner- not as much as the non-waterproof though. I find that this one might need a second coat applied once the first one dries, otherwise I just go over the top of the liquid eyeliner with a regular eyeliner pencil. Also if you don&#x27;t get it all off when you wash your face it tends to cake at the base of your eyelashes. Still, a good eyeliner and easy to apply. I like eyeliners with the felt tip pen instead of the brush so this one does the trick.</li>
            <li> I have oily eyelids (gross!) and these stay on really well! It does take some practice if you&#x27;re not familiar with the eyeliner tip. Make sure you let it dry before batting your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that it does rub off sometimes but it usually comes off in chunks so it doesn&#x27;t give you raccoon eyes :)</li>
            <li> I wear this eyeliner everyday. To go out, to work, to whatever. It&#x27;s really pigmented and has great coverage. I am really picky about the coverage. I have to have my eyeliner extra black and rich in color. I can wash my face and the eyeliner is still there. What I like about it is that as tough and waterproof as the eyeliner is, I can easily peel it off at the end of the day if I wanted to. So for everyone saying &amp;#34;oh it sucks it flakes&amp;#34; - the package says waterproof and does just that.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty oily face and eyeliner would constantly smear or imprint itself below my lower lashes, but I don&#x27;t have that problem with this eyeliner! Absolutely love it, but it does have a few cons, it sort of flakes off as the day goes by, but not enough that your eyeliner looks any different. If you try to wipe off part of your eyeliner to redraw it, it&#x27;ll peel off other bits of the eyeliner with it.</li>
            <li> Truly waterproof and dynamite precision brush for getting between lashes on the lash line. You will be very happy with this liner. Will definitely buy again, thank you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this liquid eyeliner for several years. I wear thick eyeliner almost every single day and this is definitely the BEST liquid liner I have ever used. It lasts all day. You do not need to re-apply it, and it has even lasted me all night. For those saying it flakes off, it does, after being worn for at least 20 + hours. It does not run or smear. It goes on perfectly smooth. The only times it gets clumpy is when it is about to run out and you need a new one. Also, because it is waterproof, it can be very hard to take off but easily done with a make up removal pad/towelette.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s O.K. I guess there are many more out there that are better. One thing I don&#x27;t like is the stiff felt like applicator tip. Other than that it is fine.</li>
            <li> The product is not 100% waterproof but pretty good and long lasting. The summer heat and swimming is not favorable for this product but yet again it will be better used in the colder days to come.</li>
            <li> A cost-effective alternative to department store brands.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Amazing liquid eyeliner, leaves it very nice and clean. Lasts for a very long time</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m giving this four stars is because I don&#x27;t like the applicator. I am a fan of traditional, thin brush tips. For a beginner, the foam tips are better but they don&#x27;t allow as precise of a line. I have slightly hooded eyes so I like my lines as thin as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is great. It&#x27;s very black and very waterproof. It survives swimming. When I got it, I swiped a line on the back of my hand to see how it held up. It didn&#x27;t even come off in the shower the next day (until I started rubbing it. Just don&#x27;t rub your eyes until they&#x27;re dry!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite liquid liner is Urban Decay&#x27;s Perversion but it&#x27;s $18! This performs nearly as well for far cheaper, so I would pick this up if you&#x27;re looking for a good waterproof liquid eyeliner!</li>
            <li> Seriously, never had a liquid liner with this type of staying power!!! It&#x27;s incredible! Best eyeliner I&#x27;ve owned to date. I occasionally use high-end pencil liner, haven&#x27;t dabbled with high-end liquid liner yet, but this is truly my favorite liquid,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is a little short and lacks flexibility, but it only takes one or two tries to get used to it. The formula smells like acrylic paint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of the minor issues, I was rubbing my eye like crazy from midday tiredness, completely forgetting that I was wearing eyeliner (it&#x27;s also very comfortable) and did not budge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m one of those people that only wears concealer and eyeliner and perhaps a bold lip color, and since I wear so little makeup, the little makeup I wear should be decent quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I can&#x27;t compare it to high-end liquid liner, I&#x27;ll compare it to my Urban Decay 24/ pencil. The pencil will smudge sooner than this liquid liner.</li>
            <li> This went on like a dream, but I noticed it started to peel off like a masque after a few hours.not sure why, perhaps interacting with my face products, but it didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is the best . I&#x27;ve been using this eyeliner for about a year now and I don&#x27;t plan on switching anytim soon. It glides on easily , it lasts all day , and is waterproof yet easy to take off when you need to take it off. This stuff is definitely worth the price you pay !</li>
            <li> This is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; eyeliner, hands down! Ive been using it for years now and will be very sad if it ever stops being produced. This stuff is amazing. No smudges, no smears. Even the few times Ive fallen asleep with it on, I wake up and it looks like I just applied it. I used to live in hot and humid Mississippi, and this eyeliner stood up to it everytime.</li>
            <li> This goes on shiny and when you try to remove it, it comes off it little clumps that get all over your face.</li>
            <li> while it is waterproof it flakes off throughout the day and looks like a shiny black after it dries.</li>
            <li> i love this eyeliner it stays on for a long time . I have very watery eyes from allergies and needed something that would stay on for as long as i needed it to. and it did . i will buy this again. Maybe in a different color.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner! The brush is fantastic and can thin or thick lines. it&#x27;s easy to use and a mice dark color. It will stay on when you swim but will crack-they&#x27;re is also a lot of liner in the bottle (I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a year!) overall really nice liner but not quite waterproof</li>
            <li> I bought this 2 weeks ago after being frustrated with the raccoon eyes my non-watetproof eyeliner was giving me during training sessions at the gym. This eyeliner stayed put, no running or smudging. I give it a 4 only because I think the brush tip is too harsh/stiff and if you go over a spot you already applied the eyeliner to, the brush tip actually will scrap into the product and remove it.</li>
            <li> Excellent waterproof eyeliner. This is the first liquid I&#x27;ve used, but I&#x27;ve tried my fair share of creme and kohl pencils and all pale in comparison. I wear it in black. It applies smoothly with a fine, soft tip, and dries fairly quickly, but not so quickly that I can&#x27;t wipe off mistakes. I have very oily eyelids with deep-set eyes, and this is the only eyeliner I&#x27;ve used that looks perfect after oily lids, watery eyes from allergies, humidity and drizzly rain, and an hour in the pool. It doesn&#x27;t flake or fade, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is that it is a little tough to remove, but that&#x27;s a small complaint. This is one of my favourite products in my cosmetic bag.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best drugstore-brand eyeliners... BUT THEY MAILED ME THE WRONG COLOR! Fortunately, I don&#x27;t mind dark brown... But be careful.</li>
            <li> Never, ever buy this. It flakes off. I even tried shaking it before I used it. Just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> not overly impressed with coverage</li>
            <li> The skinny: truly water- and smudgeproof. Enthusiastically recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this eyeliner. When it dries on your skin, it&#x27;s truly waterproof and--assuming you&#x27;re not scrubbing at your eyes--it lasts a long time (will partially come off if you sleep in it, though). It&#x27;s more of a &#x27;flake-type&#x27; than &#x27;smudge-type&#x27; eyeliner, in that, when it does come off, it flakes or peels off. Painlessly, rest assured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes: shake the bottle before applying. Also, because of the flaking issue, touch-ups at the end of the night can be more difficult, since the &#x27;old&#x27; line has a tendency to catch onto the brush (which is a sponge-tip, btw). Not a major problem since this, again, is hours into your night, but I thought I&#x27;d note it anyway,</li>
            <li> A great waterproof liner but after a time the lid no longer screws on tight like it should. This has consistently happened with the last several bottles of this particular liner. I keep buying it because there are so few reasonably priced waterproof liners out there.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical whether this product would remain on my eyelids all day.  Well, after wearing it for a few days in the hot August sun, I can say it does stay!  It is easy to put on in the morning -- only takes about 30 seconds and I&#x27;m set for the day.  The only problem I&#x27;ve had is when I put it on and don&#x27;t let it dry before opening my eyes wide.  In that case, sometimes, it gets on the area above my eyes, but it is easy to remove.</li>
            <li> You can go swimming in this and it won&#x27;t come off, but it&#x27;s super easy to get off at night. If you don&#x27;t have any makeup remover handy, you can just rub it off with a tissue or facecloth. It doesn&#x27;t give me raccoon eyes, goes on smooth, and is the best liquid eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used. Top of it&#x27;s game for this price</li>
            <li> I like this eyeliner for a long wearing liner. The only negative is that it adheres to my eyelashes to much.</li>
            <li> for the price this waterproof eyeliner is my favorite. I do prefer the pen kind rather that the felt tipped kind that you have to dip but the product is excellent!</li>
            <li> This is the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used! The flexible felt tip is great and I like that I don&#x27;t have to do several coats to get a streamlined, effortless cat eye look. It&#x27;s easy to use and it stays on ALL DAY. I&#x27;ve been buying this brand over three years now and it always outshines other liquid eyeliners in my opinion.</li>
            <li> The liquid itself is very good, it comes out really black. It also is water proof, just as long as you don&#x27;t rub it. It could also last all day if not rubbed/slept on. A wonderful thing about this is it doesnt smudge! I only took off a star because after a while of putting the brush back in, the bottle tend to crack. This causes the liquid inside to dry up eventually, even though there is still some left.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite eyeliner. Water proof, easy to apply, and very dark.</li>
            <li> This was watery, flaked off and stung my eyes. I gave myself three weeks to like it but, in the end, chucked this in the trash. The Loreal Lineur Intense Felt Tip Liquid Eyeliner is much better and stays on longer even though it&#x27;s not marketed as waterproof. Go figure.</li>
            <li> it flakes off and that is UNACCEPTABLE.  Sorry; MABELLINE WATER PROOF IS MUCH BETTER and I just bought more of it.  Wasted money on this one.</li>
            <li> For prescision: 5 stars. The tool to apply the eyeliner is wonderful. I use it to dot my upper eyelid in between my lashes. Eventhough I don&#x27;t have a steady hand, it turns out perfect. The makeup dries quickly too.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the product is waterproof, but it&#x27;s a non-issue because it flakes off. I wear waterproof because I am a contact wearer of 30 years and have learned (unfortunately through trial, error, and pain) not to wear makeup that &#x27;might&#x27; run into my eyes. Obviously, if the product flakes off into my eyes, it is a problem.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again unless they reformulate the eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Perfectly crappy piece. Try it at your own risk. Gets into the eyes while applying and burns. Smudges and sticks the eye lids with a crease. Total waste of money. If bought already, think of this review while using and shake your head...</li>
            <li> Horrendous! This liner smeared and creased (all over my lids) after less than four hours, working in an office in 70 degree, non-humid conditions. It was a pain in the arse to apply, and then it smeared, leaving me with panda eyes at work. Ugggh! If you buy this liner, do yourself a favour and don&#x27;t look in the mirror until you get home-- because there is no saving the disaster it leaves on your eyelids!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite eyeliner! However, after awhile it separates and the brush is coated with a dull black so I have to shake it up to get it to blend together again</li>
            <li> I wear cat eye eyeliner pretty much everyday and this is the best liner I&#x27;ve found!!! Been using this product for nearly 5 years now.</li>
            <li> So I like the brush and the way it applies but the formula is horrible after it dries. I like a thin line of liquid liner right on my lash line, and after this dries it&#x27;s this weird rubbery, gummy thing. It peels and flakes off. I&#x27;m not sure if I got a defective one but it was sealed tight in the packaging, not sure. I&#x27;m gonna go back to my trust Stilla liquid liner, expensive but worth it after trying some of the store brand stuff.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is horrible. It goes on well, then it peels of in chunks. It gets stuck to your eyelashes and when you try and remove it, chunks of the eyeliner come off. It seems to me that this could be a safety hazard. Chunks could possibly get into your eye and scratch your eye. When it is applied, it also maintains a shiny look, like it is wet.</li>
            <li> it stays on all day if the weather is cold. if not the warm weather makes it rub off on the top of my lashes. But that could be due to my oily skin.</li>
            <li> This is my eyeliner of choice.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year, and I find the applicator is easy to use.  It&#x27;s really waterproof -- last summer I wore it into a swimming pool and it came out perfectly.  My only criticism is that sometimes the liquid liner coagulates a little around the top of the bottle, and you&#x27;ve got to wipe it off the wand with a tissue.  The color is a great jet black though and I love to use this with mascara.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite eye liner. It is the only eyeliner that doesn&#x27;t melt off by midday. And for liquid eyeliner, it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner seems almost like liquid latex.  It comes off when I want it to but does not really smear much after it&#x27;s dry.  I have not tried the saline-solution-eyeliner-longevity trick on this so I don&#x27;t know if you can add eye drops to it to make it last longer, but it is still worth the purchase.  Definitely my new favorite eyeliner.</li>
