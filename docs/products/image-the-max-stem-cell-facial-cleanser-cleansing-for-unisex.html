            <li>LOVE image products.</li>
            <li>Promotes a nice clean shiny face and diminishes wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Great facial cleanser, love it!</li>
            <li>This is such a great cleanser.</li>
            <li>I am used to the original Image cleanser.</li>
            <li>She let me use this Image cleanser, and I was amazed by how clean my face felt.</li>
            <li>Have used various Image products over the years (also tried The Max serum) and wanted so much to love The Max with its bebeficial ingredients but cant tolerate the strong cheap perfume smell.</li>
            <li>New skin care for me, love the product(s) and I would buy no place</li>
            <li>This one seems more gentle with a much milder scent.</li>
            <li>My face feels soft and clean.</li>
            <li>The bottom line is that I do love these products and the cleanser in particular takes off my makeup and leaves my skin feeling fresh and ready for my other products to go on.</li>
            <li>Cleanses very well without overdoing it.</li>
            <li>Makes my middle aged skin feel better!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I will say that it does make my face a little red, so I use it at night for a deep cleanse before bed, and then use a more mild cleanser in the morning.</li>

            <li> Great for skin. Cleanses very well without overdoing it.</li>
            <li> New skin care for me, love the product(s) and I would buy no place but Amazon,best prices.</li>
            <li> This is such a great cleanser. I stumbled upon it when I went to visit my mom and forgot to bring face wash. She let me use this Image cleanser, and I was amazed by how clean my face felt. I immediately went home and purchased it. I will say that it does make my face a little red, so I use it at night for a deep cleanse before bed, and then use a more mild cleanser in the morning. I would highly recommend this product. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>

            <li> I am used to the original Image cleanser. This seems ok but I think I will go back to the other. This one seems more gentle with a much milder scent. It smells like oranges.</li>
