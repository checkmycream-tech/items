            <li>I would say the best use for this product is to pull hair out of the way for makeup application.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perfect for working out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of headbands but these have worked great!</li>

            <li>Works great for how i have to hVe my hair at work</li>
            <li>For $10, 5 headbands is a great price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Price is good</li>
            <li>These headbands are the perfect light weight..</li>
            <li>They fit perfectly.</li>
            <li>Am super happy with this product!</li>
            <li>It does a great job during most any activity.</li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>I also like headbands that are nice and lightweight, like these.</li>
            <li>Very cheap... was expecting sewn headbands, what I received were pieces of fabric sewn end to end with no stitching on the edging...</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I like these headbands, but I wish they were more absorbent.</li>
            <li>It is OK for what I paid for.  </li>
            <li>I really love these headbands for what I need them for.</li>
            <li>So I bought these headbands and fabric transfers to transfer the appropriate glyph that I need on the headbands.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>Keep my flyaways from becoming so unruly.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this since the reviews seemed good.</li>
            <li>The fit is snug, but not too tight.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>It is comfortable and I am wearing it as I type.</li>
            <li>Fit</li>
            <li>But they do fit.</li>
            <li>fit well &amp; stay in place because they are wide.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Extremely cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>Charged for shipping on an order over $35 and they don&#x27;t even fit -</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!!  </li>
            <li>The large size looks great on the top and sides, however it is not particularly functional on the bottom - unless you are wearing your hair in a ponytail.  </li>
            <li>Not bad for the winter to cover my ears- but not as practical as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li>You could easily take an old t-shirt, cut out a strip and sew the ends together to get a better product than this.  </li>
            <li>It was the right size and fit.  </li>
            <li>They fit really well.</li>
            <li>However, it slips right off my head after 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>They are very light and comfortable and wide.</li>
            <li>They are also super wide and cover almost the full top of my head.</li>
            <li>I have an average-sized head and fine, soft, wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I like how soft and comfortable it feels.  </li>
            <li>but i don&#x27;t have any old tshirts that i want to cut up, so these fit the bill.</li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase more...</li>
            <li>Light weight, thin material, good band width.  </li>
            <li>;) I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again, and wouldn&#x27;t recommend it, but I didn&#x27;t feel it was worth returning, because it actually was worth pretty much what I paid for it.</li>
            <li>They are a bit flimsy and the fabric rolls a bit easily, but overall, they hold my hair out of my face, which is the goal here.</li>
            <li>They hardly stretch so they stay on your head, and they seem more comfortable</li>
            <li>These are really just single-layer strips of cloth that have been cut and sewn together.  </li>
            <li>Comfortably hold hair back</li>
            <li>I have layered, shoulder length, straight hair that even when up in a ponytail, falls into my face.</li>
            <li>Too big, one layer, cheap</li>
            <li>I wish I can adjust the fit in the back</li>
            <li>Easy to slip on keeps forehead dry.</li>
            <li>Well, I brought these with me on vacation, where I knew I wasn&#x27;t going to waste my time straightening my hair, and my hair looked so cute.</li>
            <li>I thought they were normal headbands, but they cover the hole front of my head.</li>
            <li>After removing simply hand wash With five in the order these are extremely economical.</li>
            <li>Size is good for me, not too tight not too loose.</li>
            <li>They are amazing if you need to heal from any physical, emotional or mental issues.</li>
            <li>They are pretty simple</li>
            <li>Only con is that the charcoal color isn&#x27;t exactly what I would call charcoal.</li>
            <li>I tried a few times, but if you move on your pillow much it will slide back and off pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>got the charcoal/black pack and the heathered charcoal fabric is significantly softer than the black.</li>
            <li>I liked these, but the material is thin and tends to roll up on itself.  </li>
            <li>I on the other hand roll it in half which causes it to catch more liquid.</li>
            <li>Pretty wide!</li>
            <li>Buy them you will be happy with the light duty rather than some heavy duty name brand crap.</li>
            <li>and I find myself having to try to smooth them down every few minutes.</li>

            <li> The wide band really lifts underneath the hair giving it an odd lump in the back.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sometimes they roll up in the back, no different tha other headbands</li>
            <li> I  like big and wide headlands that can cover my ears, part of my forehead, and the front part of my head.</li>
            <li> Cheap, casual.</li>
            <li> In fact, when I got it, some of the stitching was already loose.</li>
            <li> The material however is very thin and u can actually see right thru them.</li>
            <li> They were so tight that they kept sliding off the back of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Quality was not as expected.</li>
            <li> This was not a spandex headband as expected.  </li>
            <li> Thin enough to fold or scrunch up but thick enough to hold my natural hair back.</li>
            <li> The lady likes them because they are wide to keep her hair out of her face and they are not hot.</li>
            <li> They stay on my head a lot easier than any other I&#x27;ve bought</li>
            <li> I have very thick, wavy to curly hair that I flat iron religiously.</li>
            <li> so I just pull it down when needed.</li>
            <li> I usually ring it out in the sink after a workout and let it dry overnight.</li>
            <li> * Not good for very short</li>
            <li> Regardless of how I folded them, these headbands were too tight and started giving me a headache.</li>
            <li> 👍👍👍 could be a little thicker</li>
            <li> Because the head bans are made out of such thin material they curl up</li>
            <li> The material was literally cut into uneven strips, and sewn together.</li>
            <li> Visible scissor cuts were jagged and uneven.</li>
            <li> Just a little small but will stretch out</li>
            <li> It is also a little to small.  </li>
            <li> Theses inexpensive headbands have a raw edge.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was pretty disappointed with the quality.</li>
            <li> Not good for sleeping in.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t like how thin the material is that they are made out of.  </li>
            <li> Poorly made not satified with the product would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I use them while I sleep so no one is looking at how silly it must look.</li>
            <li> Very thin material.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like how soft and comfortable it feels.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I  like big and wide headlands that can cover my ears, part of my forehead, and the front part of my head. I also like headbands that are nice and lightweight, like these. They are stretchy but not stretchy. Sometimes they roll up in the back, no different tha other headbands so I just pull it down when needed.</li>
            <li> I like the thickness of the head bans but I don&#x27;t like how thin the material is that they are made out of.  Because the head bans are made out of such thin material they curl up and I find myself having to try to smooth them down every few minutes.</li>
            <li> I have an average-sized head and fine, soft, wavy hair. Regardless of how I folded them, these headbands were too tight and started giving me a headache. They were so tight that they kept sliding off the back of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the charcoal/black pack and the heathered charcoal fabric is significantly softer than the black.</li>
            <li> I liked these, but the material is thin and tends to roll up on itself.  It was the right size and fit.  The material however is very thin and u can actually see right thru them.</li>
            <li> 👍👍👍 could be a little thicker</li>
            <li> Am super happy with this product!</li>
            <li> These do what I need them to do.  Keep my flyaways from becoming so unruly.  And you can&#x27;t beat the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know, i know... one could easily make these by cutting of the sleeves of old tshirts...but i don&#x27;t have any old tshirts that i want to cut up, so these fit the bill.</li>
            <li> I was pretty disappointed with the quality. I guess I was expecting something thicker. These roll at the edges and don&#x27;t hold the form well once it&#x27;s on. They are also super wide and cover almost the full top of my head. Not bad for the winter to cover my ears- but not as practical as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> These are really just single-layer strips of cloth that have been cut and sewn together.  I have concerns that the cut edges will fray eventually, but we shall see. Here are my opinions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The fit is snug, but not too tight.&lt;br /&gt;* The large size looks great on the top and sides, however it is not particularly functional on the bottom - unless you are wearing your hair in a ponytail.  The wide band really lifts underneath the hair giving it an odd lump in the back.&lt;br /&gt;* I would say the best use for this product is to pull hair out of the way for makeup application.&lt;br /&gt;* Not good for very short hair.&lt;br /&gt;* Not good for sleeping in. I tried a few times, but if you move on your pillow much it will slide back and off pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> The bands roll on my hair and they don&#x27;t sit still. I no longer use it because of the rolls it makes.</li>
            <li> Pretty wide! Works great for how i have to hVe my hair at work</li>
            <li> They hardly stretch so they stay on your head, and they seem more comfortable</li>
            <li> I originally use the head band with thin layer of rubber inside so it won&#x27;t slip off my head during running. I had high hopes for this since the reviews seemed good. However, it slips right off my head after 5 minutes. Size is good for me, not too tight not too loose. I wonder if my hair lacks texture and the sleek spandex fabric can&#x27;t grab on my hair properly. I will go back to rubberized headband.</li>
            <li> I have a couple packs of these spandex headbands for exercising. The lady likes them because they are wide to keep her hair out of her face and they are not hot. I on the other hand roll it in half which causes it to catch more liquid. I usually ring it out in the sink after a workout and let it dry overnight. Too reset it, just toss in the washer with your clothes.</li>
            <li> Comfortably hold hair back</li>
            <li> I may have a big head now with mega hair.. It is comfortable and I am wearing it as I type. Buy them you will be happy with the light duty rather than some heavy duty name brand crap.</li>
            <li> Very cheap... was expecting sewn headbands, what I received were pieces of fabric sewn end to end with no stitching on the edging... But then again, I guess you get what you pay for! ;) I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again, and wouldn&#x27;t recommend it, but I didn&#x27;t feel it was worth returning, because it actually was worth pretty much what I paid for it.</li>
            <li> Fit okay but just a piece of cloth.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, wavy to curly hair that I flat iron religiously. Well, I brought these with me on vacation, where I knew I wasn&#x27;t going to waste my time straightening my hair, and my hair looked so cute. They held my bangs away from my face, and didn&#x27;t move at all.</li>
            <li> Perfect for working out. Keeps shape and stays in place.</li>
            <li> i wear on head during my work outs.  Item bunches up and gets smaller.  I would not recommend if wearing on head with baseball cap.  seek out the ones made by buff.</li>
            <li> These headbands suck. I thought they were normal headbands, but they cover the hole front of my head.</li>
            <li> I like these headbands, but I wish they were more absorbent. They fit really well.</li>
            <li> I have layered, shoulder length, straight hair that even when up in a ponytail, falls into my face. If you are looking for a no frills headband that will hold your hair back off your face, this is it. I use them for yoga class, working in the garden, house cleaning chores and washing my face at night. It does a great job during most any activity.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!!  Now I  can focus on working out instead of focusing on wiping the sweat for my eyes.</li>
            <li> Cheap, casual. I use these to hold my hair back during exercising.</li>
            <li> They are pretty simple but I wear one every workout. Thin enough to fold or scrunch up but thick enough to hold my natural hair back. Only con is that the charcoal color isn&#x27;t exactly what I would call charcoal. Either way, once it&#x27;s drenched in sweat color doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> Too big, one layer, cheap</li>
            <li> Poorly made not satified with the product would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Light weight, thin material, good band width.  It is OK for what I paid for.  I wish I can adjust the fit in the back</li>
            <li> Love these! I&#x27;m not a fan of headbands but these have worked great! I am converted.</li>
            <li> These are the perfect width and thickness. Sweat stays out of my eyes and I don&#x27;t have to wear a bulky bandana. I will definitely purchase more...maybe even spice it up with some color.</li>
            <li> Quality was not as expected. But they do fit.</li>
            <li> This was not a spandex headband as expected.  Instead it is made out of a stretch jersey material and cut like a headband.  Poor fit, bunching up and basically it&#x27;s pieces of cloth cut and sewn together.  Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> Just a little small but will stretch out</li>
            <li> Very thin material.  It is also a little to small.  It curls up on my head when I use them.</li>
            <li> Theses inexpensive headbands have a raw edge.&lt;br /&gt;They fit well &amp; stay in place because they are wide.&lt;br /&gt;The can be washed and they keep looking.&lt;br /&gt;Price is good so you can buy a bunch to keep on hand for exercise or just pulling your hair out of your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I have a ton!</li>
            <li> These headbands are the perfect light weight.. Easy to slip on keeps forehead dry. After removing simply hand wash With five in the order these are extremely economical. Namaste!</li>
            <li> Extremely cheaply made.  You could easily take an old t-shirt, cut out a strip and sew the ends together to get a better product than this.  In fact, when I got it, some of the stitching was already loose.</li>
            <li> Charged for shipping on an order over $35 and they don&#x27;t even fit - I want to return them.</li>
            <li> They stay on my head a lot easier than any other I&#x27;ve bought</li>
            <li> I use these at the gym every day.  I sweat a lot and these seem to help.</li>
            <li> I really love these headbands for what I need them for. I don&#x27;t use headbands Ever! But I started using Jean Logan&#x27;s glyphs and there are some you need to put on your crown chakra, third eye and throat chakra and I don&#x27;t want to tape them on those areas. So I bought these headbands and fabric transfers to transfer the appropriate glyph that I need on the headbands. I use them while I sleep so no one is looking at how silly it must look. They are very light and comfortable and wide. Love them. FYI: Look up Jean Logan&#x27;s two books on sacred symbols and glyphs. You will need both of them. They are amazing if you need to heal from any physical, emotional or mental issues. Just saying!! Oh by the way, you don&#x27;t need to use fabric transfers either, you can just tape the glyphs to the inside of the headband, glyph facing you and wear it like that!!</li>
            <li> I like the headbands. They fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> I use these headbands for working out. They are a bit flimsy and the fabric rolls a bit easily, but overall, they hold my hair out of my face, which is the goal here. For $10, 5 headbands is a great price. I think Urban Outfitters sells very similar headbands for $10-$15 a piece. So, I will take these any day!</li>
            <li> These headbands looked like they were cut and assembled by 5 year olds. The material was literally cut into uneven strips, and sewn together. Visible scissor cuts were jagged and uneven.</li>
