            <li>so  good</li>
            <li>Smells nice and lathers well, so</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find its antibacterial properties as effective as deodorant soap, but Axe doesn&#x27;t claim that, and some people don&#x27;t like to use antibacterial soap.  </li>

            <li>will see how it goes smells nice also.</li>
            <li>It  has a nice scent to it.</li>
            <li>Loving it.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s nice that you can purchase on Amazon instead of going to the store.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s because of their nice fragrances that aren&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li>To be honest I fell for two things: Brand and the chill menthol after shower effect.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Bought and given as a Gift as well as used on my own.</li>
            <li>Its always nice to have a nice smelling teens</li>
            <li>menthol.&lt;br /&gt;-Smells nice.</li>
            <li>I have for the most part been very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>It produces a fairly generous lather and is easy to rinse off.</li>
            <li>In fact, this shower gel leaves my skin feeling better after a shower than most others i&#x27;ve used!  </li>
            <li>GREAT PRODUCT AND SMELLS THE BEST COMPARED TO THE OTHER ONES</li>
            <li>I love Axe, I even use my husbands own.</li>
            <li>because I don&#x27;t get that blast of minty menthol that this shower gel advertises (perfect for early morning showers before work).  </li>
            <li>and I would go as far to say the best body wash in the market.</li>
            <li>Still smells nice, kind of herbal, but not too strong</li>
            <li>Nice and Refreshing Smell, Recommended to those who loves to have a refreshing smell and freshness all around.</li>
            <li>Axe in general makes great fragrances, but Shock has a great smell and makes ya feel clean!</li>
            <li>i will buy some more just for the price and</li>
            <li>I will be buying more</li>
            <li>Four more words needed.</li>
            <li>And even if most of them can&#x27;t handle the Axe-</li>
            <li>/&gt;They were shipped to my deployment zone with nothing more than the bubble packs in the box.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Axe Shower Gel, Shock, 16 Fluid Ounce is an awesome shower gel.  </li>

            <li>This really has a nice smell and it really helps me get going in the morning.  </li>
            <li>It has just the right amount of soapiness to it (not too much and not too little) and most of the scents smell great.</li>
            <li>does &amp;#34;shock&amp;#34; your more sensitive parts.</li>
            <li>So depending if you have sensitive skin or not, you might not get such a strong reaction, but it does work to get you clean and smell nice</li>
            <li>I use several of these scents, doesnt break me out even with my sensitive skin and smells great.</li>
            <li>I also at times use it in place of shampoo and it leaves your scalp feeling fresh and has a tingling effect.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite Axe scents because it smells masculine and its not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Smell not strong or even that great.</li>
            <li>Axe shower Gel, Shock goes on cool giving you a little buzz with a nice, but not over powering smell.</li>
            <li>When he gets out of the shower and opens the bathroom door, the whole house smells fresh and so does he.</li>
            <li>The first thing that I noted when I poured into my hands was this had a pungent chemical fragrance.</li>
            <li>Though it smells good, it dwindles away within a few minutes of being out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>Axe Shower Gel, Shock, 16 fluid ounces had transformed my entire being into a sexy, virile, man-beast!</li>
            <li>I would have to use a lot of it just to feel clean and smell clean versus other gels.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a real deal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried straight bleach to no avail.</li>
            <li>The cool menthol effect didn&#x27;t last long and after shower it never gave me a refreshing feel.</li>
            <li>Confirmed by females.&lt;br /&gt;-Scent isn&#x27;t too strong, or too aggressive.&lt;br /&gt;-Inexpensive, lasts a long time even with daily use.&lt;br /&gt;-Might not sting your eyes?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to lather up so well on the Axe Shower Tool however, other body washes seem do this better.</li>
            <li>I love Axe shower gel because it includes ingrediants other than soap in their gel.</li>
            <li>The smell does last a long time it makes you smell really great..and keep you smelling great for a long time...</li>
            <li>Similar to Axe&#x27;s &#x27;Cool Metal&#x27; line</li>
            <li>, this formula contains slightly less &#x27;grit&#x27; and more eucalyptus and menthol.  </li>
            <li>I use it sparingly now, because while it has transformed me into a virtual Adonis, we&#x27;re getting older and they don&#x27;t don&#x27;t make it for women yet.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>If you are particular about a fragrance get old spice and if you are particular about a decent wash, get Dove for men.</li>
            <li>The Axe body wash was exactly what I wanted but one of the bottles was open when it got here</li>
            <li>but for now I will stick with old faithful.</li>
            <li>Wildly tearing off her robe she screamed &amp;#34;Give</li>
            <li>I use it regularly and it really makes you feel refreshed.</li>
            <li>I picked this item primarily because I&#x27;m disabled and depend on my wife to do my shopping.</li>
            <li>Not wanting to add any more trouble to my working wife I find I can do some minor shopping on Amazon.</li>
            <li>: (none, really)&lt;br /&gt;-Could be more abrasive, as more of a scrub than a wash?&lt;br</li>
            <li>(not really their fault so much as mine, hah)</li>
            <li>and i did notice a slight cooling feeling, even on a hot day.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it everyday; it&#x27;s more a &amp;#34;treat&amp;#34; when I can spend a few extra minutes in the shower.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a few Axe shower gels, and they&#x27;re all pretty equal.</li>

            <li> Similar to Axe&#x27;s &#x27;Cool Metal&#x27; line</li>
            <li> , this formula contains slightly less &#x27;grit&#x27; and more eucalyptus and menthol.  </li>
            <li> I use it sparingly now, because while it has transformed me into a virtual Adonis, we&#x27;re getting older and they don&#x27;t don&#x27;t make it for women yet.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> If you are particular about a fragrance get old spice and if you are particular about a decent wash, get Dove for men.</li>
            <li> The Axe body wash was exactly what I wanted but one of the bottles was open when it got here</li>
            <li> but for now I will stick with old faithful.</li>
            <li> Wildly tearing off her robe she screamed &amp;#34;Give</li>
            <li> I use it regularly and it really makes you feel refreshed.</li>
            <li> I picked this item primarily because I&#x27;m disabled and depend on my wife to do my shopping.</li>
            <li> Not wanting to add any more trouble to my working wife I find I can do some minor shopping on Amazon.</li>
            <li> : (none, really)&lt;br /&gt;-Could be more abrasive, as more of a scrub than a wash?&lt;br</li>
            <li> (not really their fault so much as mine, hah)</li>
            <li> and i did notice a slight cooling feeling, even on a hot day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it everyday; it&#x27;s more a &amp;#34;treat&amp;#34; when I can spend a few extra minutes in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few Axe shower gels, and they&#x27;re all pretty equal.</li>
            <li> Stains the stone in our shower - terrible to get out - as of now I have NOT been able to do it!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do not be fouled, Axe products are usually outpriced online and in some &#x27;&#x27;high end&#x27;&#x27; supermarket, such as Ralphs, where it is priced $6.99 or even 7.99.</li>
            <li> After working out, or just out working in the yard, on a hot day, this stuff makes a hot shower feel like a cold one.  </li>
            <li> Makes your body fell refreshed for a long day.</li>
            <li> bottle lasts a long time.(Even if I borrow it sometimes.)</li>
            <li> I recommend every single men in the world to buy this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It isn&#x27;t a bad shower gel, just not my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I also have so much trouble keeping the ladies away that my wife gave me an axe-handle from the local hardware store just for that purpose.</li>
            <li> May have other reasons for that though.</li>
            <li> and there was soap all over the other bottles and the box when it arrived.</li>
            <li> My eyes opened wide as it reached my backside,feeling as if I&#x27;d smoked a pack of Kools with it and blown the smoke over my manhood!</li>
            <li> Seriously, not worth it.</li>
            <li> Would use something less invigorating for an evening shower, or if you&#x27;re just trying to take a relaxing shower to chill out.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how cold this stuff actually makes you feel!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too tingly for me.</li>
            <li> It tingles in all sorts of areas, not sure it attracts the women like they claim to do though....</li>
            <li> Could have been a real mess.</li>
            <li> And it will be hard as heck to get undone.</li>
            <li> I slowly worked it into my skin, feeling the tingly menthol rush all over my body.</li>
            <li> How excessively expensive is this product sold in amazon?!&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> but this was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I hated the smell of it, though I tried it on.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> man it smells great it lathers up good i will buy some more just for the price and the size it&#x27;s a real deal.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this body wash... Axe in general makes great fragrances, but Shock has a great smell and makes ya feel clean!</li>
            <li> Stains the stone in our shower - terrible to get out - as of now I have NOT been able to do it!!!</li>
            <li> I love Axe, I even use my husbands own. Smells nice and lathers well, so I will be buying more</li>
            <li> It tingles in all sorts of areas, not sure it attracts the women like they claim to do though.... May have other reasons for that though.</li>
            <li> The shower gel smells very good and lasts a long time.  To me the mint smell isn&#x27;t as strong as I would like, but overall it&#x27;s a very good product.</li>
            <li> Smells great and came as expected.  Would definitely purchase again.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes Axe products.</li>
            <li> This is a very good scent from Axe. My boyfriend was happy with the product when I gave it to him.</li>
            <li> I first bought this stuff around the time it was introduced, and I love it.  I don&#x27;t use it everyday; it&#x27;s more a &amp;#34;treat&amp;#34; when I can spend a few extra minutes in the shower.  Invigorating, cooling tingle...all over!  I don&#x27;t find its antibacterial properties as effective as deodorant soap, but Axe doesn&#x27;t claim that, and some people don&#x27;t like to use antibacterial soap.  I tend to use my regular soap beforehand and follow up with this.  It has a great lather if used with a gel puff or pouf or whatever they&#x27;re called...</li>
            <li> This gel will stain the grout in your shower. And it will be hard as heck to get undone. I&#x27;ve tried straight bleach to no avail. Seriously, not worth it.</li>
            <li> This shower gel doesn&#x27;t seem to have the strong scent that most Axe products produce.  Though it smells good, it dwindles away within a few minutes of being out of the shower.  The soap cleans well and washes off easily leaving a nice crisp clean feeling.  In fact, this shower gel leaves my skin feeling better after a shower than most others i&#x27;ve used!  Maybe i&#x27;m used to the [[ASIN:B003A4HSYY Irish Spring Intensify]] .. because I don&#x27;t get that blast of minty menthol that this shower gel advertises (perfect for early morning showers before work).  I also find that it takes a lot of soap to lather up well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t a bad shower gel, just not my favorite.  If I caught it on sale i&#x27;d consider getting it again.. but for now I will stick with old faithful.</li>
            <li> This really has a nice smell and it really helps me get going in the morning.  Four more words needed.</li>
            <li> It will definitely wake you up in the morning. Would use something less invigorating for an evening shower, or if you&#x27;re just trying to take a relaxing shower to chill out.</li>
            <li> Says it has menthol but don&#x27;t worry, doesn&#x27;t smell like it. Still smells nice, kind of herbal, but not too strong so shouldn&#x27;t clash with the body spray. It does have what looks like scrub beads, but not densely so I don&#x27;t think it would exfoliate that well. It doesn&#x27;t claim to. Price was good compared to our local stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Axe shower gel&#x27;s for a while and I&#x27;m usually happy with them but this was a disappointment. Smell not strong or even that great. I would have to use a lot of it just to feel clean and smell clean versus other gels.</li>
            <li> it was on sale and i thought id treat my boyfriend to something nice. i dont think hes ever used this one so will see how it goes smells nice also.</li>
            <li> The Axe body wash was exactly what I wanted but one of the bottles was open when it got here and there was soap all over the other bottles and the box when it arrived.</li>
            <li> This stuff changed my_life! The ladies now call me the &amp;#34;Axe Handle&amp;#34;!  And even if most of them can&#x27;t handle the Axe- it doesn&#x27;t stop them from trying. I used to be a loser with low self-esteem, but Axe Shock has changed all that. My wife gave me a bottle for Christmas, and I used it in the shower the following day. I slowly worked it into my skin, feeling the tingly menthol rush all over my body. My eyes opened wide as it reached my backside,feeling as if I&#x27;d smoked a pack of Kools with it and blown the smoke over my manhood! The results were instantaneous! She ran into the bathroom and said &amp;#34;Oh MY GOD! What IS that heavenly man-scent?!?!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;It&#x27;s my Shock, baby!&amp;#34; I replied, &amp;#34;...16 fluid ounces!&amp;#34; Wildly tearing off her robe she screamed &amp;#34;Give it too me baby! Give me that big Shock! All 16 Fluid ounces!&amp;#34;. And I did, for hours and hours! Axe Shower Gel, Shock, 16 fluid ounces had transformed my entire being into a sexy, virile, man-beast! I use it sparingly now, because while it has transformed me into a virtual Adonis, we&#x27;re getting older and they don&#x27;t don&#x27;t make it for women yet. I also have so much trouble keeping the ladies away that my wife gave me an axe-handle from the local hardware store just for that purpose. Awesome product Axe!</li>
            <li> It is what it says and does what it says. Very pleased with it and have to keep typing til it tells me I can submit lol</li>
            <li> How excessively expensive is this product sold in amazon?!&lt;br /&gt;If you go to walmart or vons, it only costs you $3.99 in regular price and $2.99 when on sale in Los Angeles.&lt;br /&gt;Do not be fouled, Axe products are usually outpriced online and in some &#x27;&#x27;high end&#x27;&#x27; supermarket, such as Ralphs, where it is priced $6.99 or even 7.99.</li>
            <li> Cooling but not overbearing. Smells good too. I tried a cooling shower gel by Nivea and felt no presence of the cooling menthol whatsoever. This stuff is nice and cool.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is really cool. It is one of best choice. I use it regularly and it really makes you feel refreshed.</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price.&lt;br /&gt;Certainly does &amp;#34;shock&amp;#34; your more sensitive parts. (Menthol sensation.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank goodness the bottles didnt pop their tops like they do when you fly with them in your suitcase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were shipped to my deployment zone with nothing more than the bubble packs in the box. Could have been a real mess.</li>
            <li> Maybe it was just me and my skin, but i didn&#x27;t feel any of the tingly or freezing feeling on my skin that others have described after using this product, but it did make me feel refreshed and i did notice a slight cooling feeling, even on a hot day. So depending if you have sensitive skin or not, you might not get such a strong reaction, but it does work to get you clean and smell nice</li>
            <li> Makes your body fell refreshed for a long day.</li>
            <li> I have for the most part been very satisfied with this product. It  has a nice scent to it. If you are a fan of axe shower gel, this is one to try.</li>
            <li> Nice and Refreshing Smell, Recommended to those who loves to have a refreshing smell and freshness all around. Loving it.</li>
            <li> I got this for my hubby because it was on sale. It smells amazing! I guess Axe knows their stuff and how to make men smell great!</li>
            <li> It is a fantastic product which give you relaxation while shower. I recommend every single men in the world to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery. Good product.</li>
            <li> Axe Shower gel in general is great. It has just the right amount of soapiness to it (not too much and not too little) and most of the scents smell great. The Shock scent smells good but I don&#x27;t like the tingling sensation it causes. It&#x27;s a little too tingly for me. I&#x27;ll stick with Phoenix and Deep Space.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few Axe shower gels, and they&#x27;re all pretty equal. They smell really good when showering, although it&#x27;s not like it lingers afterwards. They also have micro-beeds that help in exfoliating. It doesn&#x27;t seem to lather up so well on the Axe Shower Tool however, other body washes seem do this better.</li>
            <li> Love it it&#x27;s smells so good !</li>
            <li> Axe shower gel smells amazing! It smells like you are wearing cologne. And it&#x27;s nice that you can purchase on Amazon instead of going to the store.</li>
            <li> Axe Shower Gel, Shock, 16 Fluid Ounce is an awesome shower gel.  I use several of these scents, doesnt break me out even with my sensitive skin and smells great.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT AND SMELLS THE BEST COMPARED TO THE OTHER ONES</li>
            <li> This shower gel was definitely a great buy. The fragrance was not overpowering and it seems to be ok for any occasion.</li>
            <li> What can I say, it&#x27;s shower gel. Fresh fragrance and leaves your skin feeling clean. I also at times use it in place of shampoo and it leaves your scalp feeling fresh and has a tingling effect.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best Axe Body Wash and I would go as far to say the best body wash in the market. The tingly feeling after washing this soap off is refreshing. Females complement the smell as well. I recommend.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, use it all the time</li>
            <li> My son loves all AXE products, and this one is no different.  When he gets out of the shower and opens the bathroom door, the whole house smells fresh and so does he.</li>
            <li> My husband likes this shower gel because it smells good and leathers well. The menthol makes it refreshing to shower with on a hot day. I like it because it&#x27;s priced well and the 16 oz. bottle lasts a long time.(Even if I borrow it sometimes.) It seems like men of all ages like these Axe products. My husband uses several. I think it&#x27;s because of their nice fragrances that aren&#x27;t overpowering. I like the way they smell too.</li>
            <li> Purchase the Axe Shower Gel for my grandson&#x27;s when they come to visit.  Maybe Grandpa will use it too! It smells  so  good and so will he!&lt;br /&gt;Great price!  Great delivery!</li>
            <li> To be honest I fell for two things: Brand and the chill menthol after shower effect.&lt;br /&gt;I read through reviews and thought I would give it a shot. The first thing that I noted when I poured into my hands was this had a pungent chemical fragrance. I hated the smell of it, though I tried it on. The cool menthol effect didn&#x27;t last long and after shower it never gave me a refreshing feel. Shame that Axe makes these. I would not recommend someone to use this. If you are particular about a fragrance get old spice and if you are particular about a decent wash, get Dove for men.</li>
            <li> I picked this item primarily because I&#x27;m disabled and depend on my wife to do my shopping. I saw this on TV and wanted to try it, but I kept forgetting to add this (and others) to the shopping list. Not wanting to add any more trouble to my working wife I find I can do some minor shopping on Amazon. As for the product, it&#x27;s great. Cleans well, smells great. This is a keeper.</li>
            <li> the problem with ordering stuff like this is you cant tell what it smells like.  Its ok but i wont buy it again.  When shipped, it exploded all over everything else i ordered . needs improvement</li>
            <li> Similar to Axe&#x27;s &#x27;Cool Metal&#x27; line, this formula contains slightly less &#x27;grit&#x27; and more eucalyptus and menthol.  The scent isn&#x27;t as strong as the Cool Metal formula.  Beware, leave this on for more than a minute, and you&#x27;ll have the body wash equivalent of a York Peppermint patty.  I was pleasantly surprised at how cold this stuff actually makes you feel!  After working out, or just out working in the yard, on a hot day, this stuff makes a hot shower feel like a cold one.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I use many of these products each and every day.  It makes me feel clean all under and the products that are body wash and shampoo are my favorites  Makes my old gray hair easy to handle and looks good.  I&#x27;m all satisfied with AXE products like I am with Surf City car products.  When you find something that works the way you want it to................go for it.</li>
            <li> Bought and given as a Gift as well as used on my own. Great Stuff!!!. Great Price too.</li>
            <li> Love the scent, opens your pores and refreshes and like the mint tingle on my skin.</li>
            <li> Axe shower Gel, Shock goes on cool giving you a little buzz with a nice, but not over powering smell. I bought this product originally over a year ago and continue to buy it. Amazon&#x27;s subscribe and save is the best way to make sure you get the Axe Shower Gel at a low cost and never run out.</li>
            <li> I love Axe shower gel because it includes ingrediants other than soap in their gel. In this products case, it contains ground up sea algae and menthol. This is one of my favorite Axe scents because it smells masculine and its not overpowering. It produces a fairly generous lather and is easy to rinse off. If you like Axe, get this product.</li>
            <li> Its always nice to have a nice smelling teens instead of well they are teens, so needless to say it last longer than the most scented shower gels. They like the smell and I Love the price.</li>
            <li> The smell does last a long time it makes you smell really great..and keep you smelling great for a long time...i would recomand this product..A++++++</li>
            <li> This is my favorite body wash.  The menthol in it gives a cool tingly sensation.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to sting my eyes, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;-Minty tingle from the menthol.&lt;br /&gt;-Smells nice. Confirmed by females.&lt;br /&gt;-Scent isn&#x27;t too strong, or too aggressive.&lt;br /&gt;-Inexpensive, lasts a long time even with daily use.&lt;br /&gt;-Might not sting your eyes?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: (none, really)&lt;br /&gt;-Could be more abrasive, as more of a scrub than a wash?&lt;br /&gt;-Isn&#x27;t free?&lt;br /&gt;-Cap has a tendency to break when dropped from chest height? (not really their fault so much as mine, hah)</li>
