            <li>I &#x27;m very satisfied with Murad.  </li>
            <li>The way it spreads, the mild fragrance and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t make me look like I&#x27;m covered in Vaseline makes it very pleasant to use.  </li>
            <li>The Resurgence line from Dr Murad is by far the best product line I have ever experienced.  </li>
            <li>Best skincare product...;-)</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>So glad this qualifies for Prime too!</li>
            <li>Love my Murad!</li>
            <li>I love my Murad!</li>
            <li>Positively the best eye cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>It works great removes fine lines and brighten my eye area, and don&#x27;t cost a mint.</li>
            <li>Great eye cream, not greasy at all, absorbs fast and looks great under make up.</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely though</li>
            <li>Not a miracle solution but is a nice eye cream.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find this product to be effective at all.  </li>
            <li>Was delivered quickly and the product is great.  </li>
            <li>After using this product for 3 months I can honestly say my skin has changed for the better.  </li>
            <li>This is the best product I have found so far to help with under-eye puffiness.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many but this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Some work better than others for me, but this one is far and away the best.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>great product and fast delivery</li>
            <li>I love this product and will not change it for nothing...</li>
            <li>and i love it...</li>
            <li>It is the best eye cream next to Arbon eye cream</li>
            <li>Have reordered many times.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the great price.</li>
            <li>In December I received an unordered package and was charged more than $100.  </li>
            <li>I received another unordered package in March with another charge for more than $100.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful product, most especially for puffiness.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I immediately ordered the full size and am very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>Great product and much much cheaper on-line than at the salon or spa.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years and paying way more at the stores.  </li>
            <li>Maybe thats why I was expecting more...</li>
            <li>My wife loves this product it works well and has a nice smooth finish on her skin.</li>
            <li>Love the stuff.</li>
            <li>like arbonne re9 much much better</li>
            <li>I have used this eye cream for many years.  </li>
            <li>So glad I did.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love that I can put it on my lid as well.  </li>
            <li>Most products can&#x27;t be put there</li>
            <li>but this one is safe to do</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to a friend and will be buying more when I run out.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have tried many eye creams and have never noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li>Love the way it goes on and doesn&#x27;t irritate your eyes.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>In fact I have seen more lines and deeper lines after using this product.</li>
            <li>This is an okay eye-cream.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many eyecreams and they just don&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>was more beig color and efective and creamy</li>
            <li>My mom, who is allergic to everything, was able to use it no problem as well.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this eye cream.  </li>
            <li>can be used on top of eye as well as under the eye does not burn your eyes.</li>
            <li>Rather spendy, but would rather spend more for a product that truly works.  </li>
            <li>I love this eye cream.</li>
            <li>NO nut oil which is a plus for me :)</li>
            <li>I love how &#x27;awake&#x27;</li>
            <li>It took many months to make a difference, but a difference it did make.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased.</li>
            <li>Love this Resurgence eye cream.  </li>
            <li>I love this eye cream.  </li>
            <li>Typically I love this brand, I have been using Murad for years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 29 years old, I have very fair skin, and I inherited really dark puffy circles under my eyes from my lovely and wonderful mother.</li>
            <li>I have  learned these packages can be marked REFUSED and they will be returned to the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The products may be great but dealing with a company with these policies is a nightmare.</li>
            <li>First introduced to this product at Sephora, very pleased.  </li>
            <li>I get good results with these and my regeime and recommend it all highly.</li>
            <li>Fine lines are no longer viseable, darker areas under eyes and the morning</li>
            <li>I have been using this for about 3 weeks and do not see any difference in the fine lines around my eyes</li>
            <li>It also eliminates the fine lines around the eyes and puffiness on eye lids.</li>
            <li>Lucky me!</li>
            <li>The product I have purchased has been great and worked out as expected or better.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and creamy but not at all greasy.  </li>
            <li>The product is gentle but effective.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The only fly in the ointment is the bottle.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous.  </li>
            <li>Product has a smooth application</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>I now use the whole line of Murad and always get complements on my complexion!!!</li>
            <li>but the results are worth it!</li>
            <li>I still saved around $20 over Murad membership price so its worth it!...</li>
            <li>I love this product it does exactly what Murad say it will do for your face.</li>
            <li>I do not think it is anything special for the money and will not repurchase.</li>
            <li>This product is the best eye cream I&#x27;ve ever used, I&#x27;ve noticed how it slowly reduced the puffiness and wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I pay the full price</li>
            <li>When I squirt out a full pump</li>
            <li>Love the product fast shipping</li>
            <li>i love the whole resurgence program and will continue it</li>
            <li>This cream is as good or better and much less costly!</li>
            <li>I love the Murad cleanser, but don&#x27;t know if this particular product is really worth the money.  </li>
            <li>My first bottle lasted 5 months, very economical in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Only eye cream that has been able to diminish my stubborn crows feet!</li>
            <li>Feels nice when I apply it under my eyes, but to be honest I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in dark circle, or puffiness reduction.</li>
            <li>I am almost 65, but have pretty good skin, but I noticed some wrinkles forming from the nose to the mouth and a few more around the eyes.</li>
            <li>Wonderful, non irritating, soothing.</li>
            <li>My 30 yr old daughter started using an entire line of Murad products and I noticed her skin was looking great.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin/eyes &amp; tend to react to many products.</li>
            <li>at sephora near me it was about $30 more, out of my range of &#x27;try and see&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I am going to keep buying this product, it is worth the $$</li>
            <li>, this was to sticky and didn&#x27;t sit the right way.</li>
            <li>Dispenses just the right amount in one pump - I also dab it on my browbone and around my lip area as well.  </li>
            <li>It does have a slight tingly feel, which is pleasant.</li>
            <li>I think this Murad eye cream does a good job in reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles and keeping the delicate skin around the eyes protected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought this twice and really don&#x27;t see much of a difference in the appearance of fine lines or hydration, for that matter.</li>
            <li>I was going back and forth on whether I should purchase, but since I had enjoyed their other products for years and read the good reviews, I decided to take the plunge.  </li>
            <li>This eye cream very much moisturizes the eye area</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even use the department store, but this one does not bother my sensitive skin, and it works fantastic.  </li>
            <li>First tried this when a sample was given to me.  </li>
            <li>Last October I ordered from their site to making sure I did not select  in any automatic product shipping.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of eye creams, and most of them have been in the same price range as the Murad Resurgence.</li>
            <li>I use this product daily and am pleased with the results and on line price.</li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t consistent.</li>
            <li>Murad Resurgence Renewing Eye Cream really smooths this out as well as lifts!  </li>
            <li>For awhile I thought this was effective, but either other products are working just as well</li>
            <li>I am on my second bottle and loving it so far.  </li>
            <li>Very noticeable difference from the first application.</li>
            <li>It does smooth fine lines and brighten my eye area, which tends to be plagued by dark circles.  </li>
            <li>The reason I gave 3 stars - I do think it has helped with the suppleness under the eye and the cream absorbed nicely, however I think I can get that from many other products that are a little easier on the pocket book.  </li>
            <li>My eyes are a lot brighter now and the fine lines are starting to soften.  </li>
            <li>This box appears to have been open but looks fine.</li>
            <li>It is only 2 weeks since I have been using the entire Resurgence treatment and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>Works very well</li>
            <li>The Renewing Eye Cream absolutely does what it claims to do.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t help my wrinkles as much as the night cream does.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks now, and I already notice that the skin around my eyes is much lighter and firmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I have yet to see much of a difference with my under eye circles which I&#x27;ve inherited genetically.</li>
            <li>or I do not have much of an eyelid problem as I had thought.</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>so I know I&#x27;m getting the real deal.</li>
            <li>This eye cream does not do much for your eyes.  </li>
            <li>For what the product does, the price is way too high even for Amazon!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s too much for one eye.  </li>
            <li>It works and is better than I expected</li>
            <li>This product really irritates my eyes.  </li>
            <li>so i decided to order via Amazon which turned out to be much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>It is very creamy</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a change in my eyes yet, but I think I just need to use it longer.</li>
            <li>, I really didn&#x27;t have any until I started using the eye cream.</li>
            <li>This really works for puffy eyes.  </li>
            <li>After a couple of weeks use, I found it to be very drying  to my skin.  </li>
            <li>So I bought all the Resurgence line and a NuFace microcurrent machine, a red light and a laser.</li>
            <li>Did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li>I really like Murad products, don&#x27;t know what happened with this though.</li>
            <li>I like it so much</li>
            <li>So, I am not sure it is any better, but it is certainly not bad.</li>
            <li>Other than the cost, I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the product.</li>
            <li>Whenever I decide to try other products to see if there&#x27;s anything better out there, I regret wasting the money</li>
            <li>I use it only on special occasions.</li>
            <li>, I finally found what was right there for years!</li>
            <li>Have used many other brands, from inexpensive to high end eye creams.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the retail price but enjoy paying less thru Amazon.</li>
            <li>There must be a sweet spot somewhere in the middle.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve gotten compliments specifically on my eyes, saying they look less puffy and more &amp;#34;awake.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>U notice a slight difference with darkness under my eyes, but mostly the difference is with the texture/lines.  </li>
            <li>Very hallo with results thus far!</li>
            <li>I got a free sample of this in my latest sephora order but was pretty skeptical about any product that makes skin appear firmer.  </li>
            <li>Love this little miracle cream.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews I was expecting a little more from this product.  </li>
            <li>Next time I will look for the 2 oz.size and refill the pump bottle since it&#x27;s a better deal in the long run.</li>
            <li>I am giving it a few weeks more to see.</li>
            <li>The true test was when I went for a facial and the esthetician remarked at how tight and smooth my skin was.</li>
            <li>Maybe I have very sensitive skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li>but if u have very sensitive skin this might not be the way to go.</li>
            <li>Leaves the skin around my eyes very soft.  </li>
            <li>If you are compelled to try it, make sure nobody is going to see you for a few days in case you puff up like I did!</li>
            <li>This cream is the only one that works, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eye area like many other creams did.  </li>
            <li>The improvement is enough that I could recommend the product, but not necessarily enough that I&#x27;ll be willing to pay this much for it again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice moisturizer at the very least, even if quite pricey.</li>
            <li>I have little \\&quot;laugh lines\\&quot; around my eyes, but those don&#x27;t bother me, and they aren&#x27;t what I&#x27;m trying to treat, so I can&#x27;t really speak to this product&#x27;s effectiveness in that regard.</li>
            <li>Clearly a resale.  </li>
            <li>My skin is clear and luminescent.</li>
            <li>And for a 65 year old woman, that&#x27;s quite an accomplishment.</li>
            <li>I started using the sample and within just three days, the scaling had healed completely.</li>
            <li>It is very creamy and instantly moisturizes.</li>
            <li>It will probably depend on how long the bottle lasts &amp; if the results remain consistent.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin to any colorants/perfumes and this product never gives me any irritation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m turning 70 years old &amp; have wrinkling on  my eyelid (I sleep on my side).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s, so</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference in those tiny laugh lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Not aure if I need more time of use but as of now I noticed only small improment.</li>
            <li>This product arrived quickly, but despite previous reviews and giving it a month to work I&#x27;ve seen no improvement with puffiness or squint lines.</li>
            <li>I started using nutrogena oil free moisturizer around my eyes and it smoothed the wrinkles and eliminated the dark circles immensely.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money, and since you only have to use a tiny amount, it will last 4 or 5 months (15ml).</li>
            <li>- I do my normal facial regime and put this on after my moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll figure it out, and if that&#x27;s the only problem, I can live with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different products to address the problem with minimal success.</li>
            <li>I have not had this product long enough to see real effects with aging.</li>
            <li>I will go back to my old brand of eye cream.</li>
            <li>I have been using this on my neck crease lines and you can now barely see them.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten older, it seems the skin around my eyes has gotten quite dry.</li>
            <li>Not recommended for sensitive skin, called to cancel &amp; was placed on hold several times.</li>
            <li>I only use a little amount, not to go through so quickly, one drop of cream and one drop of water....</li>
            <li>Works pretty darn well compared to other products in same price range</li>
            <li>This product also seems to be moisturizing and does not dry out the area under the eyes.</li>
            <li>and I am seeing a very noticeable difference with the dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t used it for long, but like it so far</li>
            <li>It really tones down my under-eye puffiness.  </li>
            <li>murad&#x27;s renewing eye cream is so thin and easy to use.</li>
            <li>However as I am getting older and experiencing signs of aging, I was looking to them to find a solution for my under eye area for puffiness and dark circles.  </li>

            <li> Happy customer :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very pleased using the Murad Resurgence</li>
            <li> I &#x27;m very satisfied with Murad.  </li>
            <li> The way it spreads, the mild fragrance and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t make me look like I&#x27;m covered in Vaseline makes it very pleasant to use.  </li>
            <li> The Resurgence line from Dr Murad is by far the best product line I have ever experienced.  </li>
            <li> Best skincare product...;-)</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> So glad this qualifies for Prime too!</li>
            <li> Love my Murad!</li>
            <li> I love my Murad!</li>
            <li> Positively the best eye cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> It works great removes fine lines and brighten my eye area, and don&#x27;t cost a mint.</li>
            <li> Great eye cream, not greasy at all, absorbs fast and looks great under make up.</li>
            <li> It goes on nicely though</li>
            <li> Not a miracle solution but is a nice eye cream.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find this product to be effective at all.  </li>
            <li> Was delivered quickly and the product is great.  </li>
            <li> After using this product for 3 months I can honestly say my skin has changed for the better.  </li>
            <li> This is the best product I have found so far to help with under-eye puffiness.  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many but this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Some work better than others for me, but this one is far and away the best.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> great product and fast delivery</li>
            <li> I love this product and will not change it for nothing...</li>
            <li> and i love it...</li>
            <li> It is the best eye cream next to Arbon eye cream</li>
            <li> Have reordered many times.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the great price.</li>
            <li> In December I received an unordered package and was charged more than $100.  </li>
            <li> I received another unordered package in March with another charge for more than $100.  </li>
            <li> Wonderful product, most especially for puffiness.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I immediately ordered the full size and am very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Great product and much much cheaper on-line than at the salon or spa.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and paying way more at the stores.  </li>
            <li> Maybe thats why I was expecting more...</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product it works well and has a nice smooth finish on her skin.</li>
            <li> Love the stuff.</li>
            <li> like arbonne re9 much much better</li>
            <li> I have used this eye cream for many years.  </li>
            <li> So glad I did.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love that I can put it on my lid as well.  </li>
            <li> Most products can&#x27;t be put there</li>
            <li> but this one is safe to do</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to a friend and will be buying more when I run out.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I have tried many eye creams and have never noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li> Love the way it goes on and doesn&#x27;t irritate your eyes.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> In fact I have seen more lines and deeper lines after using this product.</li>
            <li> This is an okay eye-cream.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many eyecreams and they just don&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> was more beig color and efective and creamy</li>
            <li> My mom, who is allergic to everything, was able to use it no problem as well.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this eye cream.  </li>
            <li> can be used on top of eye as well as under the eye does not burn your eyes.</li>
            <li> Rather spendy, but would rather spend more for a product that truly works.  </li>
            <li> I love this eye cream.</li>
            <li> NO nut oil which is a plus for me :)</li>
            <li> I love how &#x27;awake&#x27;</li>
            <li> It took many months to make a difference, but a difference it did make.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased.</li>
            <li> Love this Resurgence eye cream.  </li>
            <li> I love this eye cream.  </li>
            <li> Typically I love this brand, I have been using Murad for years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 29 years old, I have very fair skin, and I inherited really dark puffy circles under my eyes from my lovely and wonderful mother.</li>
            <li> I have  learned these packages can be marked REFUSED and they will be returned to the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The products may be great but dealing with a company with these policies is a nightmare.</li>
            <li> First introduced to this product at Sephora, very pleased.  </li>
            <li> I get good results with these and my regeime and recommend it all highly.</li>
            <li> Fine lines are no longer viseable, darker areas under eyes and the morning</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 3 weeks and do not see any difference in the fine lines around my eyes</li>
            <li> It also eliminates the fine lines around the eyes and puffiness on eye lids.</li>
            <li> Lucky me!</li>
            <li> The product I have purchased has been great and worked out as expected or better.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and creamy but not at all greasy.  </li>
            <li> The product is gentle but effective.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only fly in the ointment is the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Fabulous.  </li>
            <li> Product has a smooth application</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> I now use the whole line of Murad and always get complements on my complexion!!!</li>
            <li> but the results are worth it!</li>
            <li> I still saved around $20 over Murad membership price so its worth it!...</li>
            <li> I love this product it does exactly what Murad say it will do for your face.</li>
            <li> I do not think it is anything special for the money and will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> This product is the best eye cream I&#x27;ve ever used, I&#x27;ve noticed how it slowly reduced the puffiness and wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I pay the full price</li>
            <li> When I squirt out a full pump</li>
            <li> Love the product fast shipping</li>
            <li> i love the whole resurgence program and will continue it</li>
            <li> This cream is as good or better and much less costly!</li>
            <li> I love the Murad cleanser, but don&#x27;t know if this particular product is really worth the money.  </li>
            <li> My first bottle lasted 5 months, very economical in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Only eye cream that has been able to diminish my stubborn crows feet!</li>
            <li> Feels nice when I apply it under my eyes, but to be honest I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in dark circle, or puffiness reduction.</li>
            <li> I am almost 65, but have pretty good skin, but I noticed some wrinkles forming from the nose to the mouth and a few more around the eyes.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, non irritating, soothing.</li>
            <li> My 30 yr old daughter started using an entire line of Murad products and I noticed her skin was looking great.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin/eyes &amp; tend to react to many products.</li>
            <li> at sephora near me it was about $30 more, out of my range of &#x27;try and see&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I am going to keep buying this product, it is worth the $$</li>
            <li> , this was to sticky and didn&#x27;t sit the right way.</li>
            <li> Dispenses just the right amount in one pump - I also dab it on my browbone and around my lip area as well.  </li>
            <li> It does have a slight tingly feel, which is pleasant.</li>
            <li> I think this Murad eye cream does a good job in reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles and keeping the delicate skin around the eyes protected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this twice and really don&#x27;t see much of a difference in the appearance of fine lines or hydration, for that matter.</li>
            <li> I was going back and forth on whether I should purchase, but since I had enjoyed their other products for years and read the good reviews, I decided to take the plunge.  </li>
            <li> This eye cream very much moisturizes the eye area</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even use the department store, but this one does not bother my sensitive skin, and it works fantastic.  </li>
            <li> First tried this when a sample was given to me.  </li>
            <li> Last October I ordered from their site to making sure I did not select  in any automatic product shipping.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of eye creams, and most of them have been in the same price range as the Murad Resurgence.</li>
            <li> I use this product daily and am pleased with the results and on line price.</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t consistent.</li>
            <li> Murad Resurgence Renewing Eye Cream really smooths this out as well as lifts!  </li>
            <li> For awhile I thought this was effective, but either other products are working just as well</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle and loving it so far.  </li>
            <li> Very noticeable difference from the first application.</li>
            <li> It does smooth fine lines and brighten my eye area, which tends to be plagued by dark circles.  </li>
            <li> The reason I gave 3 stars - I do think it has helped with the suppleness under the eye and the cream absorbed nicely, however I think I can get that from many other products that are a little easier on the pocket book.  </li>
            <li> My eyes are a lot brighter now and the fine lines are starting to soften.  </li>
            <li> This box appears to have been open but looks fine.</li>
            <li> It is only 2 weeks since I have been using the entire Resurgence treatment and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> Works very well</li>
            <li> The Renewing Eye Cream absolutely does what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t help my wrinkles as much as the night cream does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks now, and I already notice that the skin around my eyes is much lighter and firmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I have yet to see much of a difference with my under eye circles which I&#x27;ve inherited genetically.</li>
            <li> or I do not have much of an eyelid problem as I had thought.</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> so I know I&#x27;m getting the real deal.</li>
            <li> This eye cream does not do much for your eyes.  </li>
            <li> For what the product does, the price is way too high even for Amazon!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too much for one eye.  </li>
            <li> It works and is better than I expected</li>
            <li> This product really irritates my eyes.  </li>
            <li> so i decided to order via Amazon which turned out to be much cheaper.  </li>
            <li> It is very creamy</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a change in my eyes yet, but I think I just need to use it longer.</li>
            <li> , I really didn&#x27;t have any until I started using the eye cream.</li>
            <li> This really works for puffy eyes.  </li>
            <li> After a couple of weeks use, I found it to be very drying  to my skin.  </li>
            <li> So I bought all the Resurgence line and a NuFace microcurrent machine, a red light and a laser.</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li> I really like Murad products, don&#x27;t know what happened with this though.</li>
            <li> I like it so much</li>
            <li> So, I am not sure it is any better, but it is certainly not bad.</li>
            <li> Other than the cost, I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the product.</li>
            <li> Whenever I decide to try other products to see if there&#x27;s anything better out there, I regret wasting the money</li>
            <li> I use it only on special occasions.</li>
            <li> , I finally found what was right there for years!</li>
            <li> Have used many other brands, from inexpensive to high end eye creams.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the retail price but enjoy paying less thru Amazon.</li>
            <li> There must be a sweet spot somewhere in the middle.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve gotten compliments specifically on my eyes, saying they look less puffy and more &amp;#34;awake.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> U notice a slight difference with darkness under my eyes, but mostly the difference is with the texture/lines.  </li>
            <li> Very hallo with results thus far!</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of this in my latest sephora order but was pretty skeptical about any product that makes skin appear firmer.  </li>
            <li> Love this little miracle cream.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I was expecting a little more from this product.  </li>
            <li> Next time I will look for the 2 oz.size and refill the pump bottle since it&#x27;s a better deal in the long run.</li>
            <li> I am giving it a few weeks more to see.</li>
            <li> The true test was when I went for a facial and the esthetician remarked at how tight and smooth my skin was.</li>
            <li> Maybe I have very sensitive skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li> but if u have very sensitive skin this might not be the way to go.</li>
            <li> Leaves the skin around my eyes very soft.  </li>
            <li> If you are compelled to try it, make sure nobody is going to see you for a few days in case you puff up like I did!</li>
            <li> This cream is the only one that works, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eye area like many other creams did.  </li>
            <li> The improvement is enough that I could recommend the product, but not necessarily enough that I&#x27;ll be willing to pay this much for it again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice moisturizer at the very least, even if quite pricey.</li>
            <li> I have little \\&quot;laugh lines\\&quot; around my eyes, but those don&#x27;t bother me, and they aren&#x27;t what I&#x27;m trying to treat, so I can&#x27;t really speak to this product&#x27;s effectiveness in that regard.</li>
            <li> Clearly a resale.  </li>
            <li> My skin is clear and luminescent.</li>
            <li> And for a 65 year old woman, that&#x27;s quite an accomplishment.</li>
            <li> I started using the sample and within just three days, the scaling had healed completely.</li>
            <li> It is very creamy and instantly moisturizes.</li>
            <li> It will probably depend on how long the bottle lasts &amp; if the results remain consistent.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin to any colorants/perfumes and this product never gives me any irritation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m turning 70 years old &amp; have wrinkling on  my eyelid (I sleep on my side).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s, so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference in those tiny laugh lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Not aure if I need more time of use but as of now I noticed only small improment.</li>
            <li> This product arrived quickly, but despite previous reviews and giving it a month to work I&#x27;ve seen no improvement with puffiness or squint lines.</li>
            <li> I started using nutrogena oil free moisturizer around my eyes and it smoothed the wrinkles and eliminated the dark circles immensely.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money, and since you only have to use a tiny amount, it will last 4 or 5 months (15ml).</li>
            <li> - I do my normal facial regime and put this on after my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll figure it out, and if that&#x27;s the only problem, I can live with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different products to address the problem with minimal success.</li>
            <li> I have not had this product long enough to see real effects with aging.</li>
            <li> I will go back to my old brand of eye cream.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my neck crease lines and you can now barely see them.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older, it seems the skin around my eyes has gotten quite dry.</li>
            <li> Not recommended for sensitive skin, called to cancel &amp; was placed on hold several times.</li>
            <li> I only use a little amount, not to go through so quickly, one drop of cream and one drop of water....</li>
            <li> Works pretty darn well compared to other products in same price range</li>
            <li> This product also seems to be moisturizing and does not dry out the area under the eyes.</li>
            <li> and I am seeing a very noticeable difference with the dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used it for long, but like it so far</li>
            <li> It really tones down my under-eye puffiness.  </li>
            <li> murad&#x27;s renewing eye cream is so thin and easy to use.</li>
            <li> However as I am getting older and experiencing signs of aging, I was looking to them to find a solution for my under eye area for puffiness and dark circles.  </li>
            <li> , yours is just simple random cream i have no efect or diferences at all.. first of all is not the same cream i have try-out package, I have before in small original package.</li>
            <li> , I am in my early fourties so I only have a few.  </li>
            <li> The dispenser is well designed and no excessive cream is wasted.</li>
            <li> unfortunately it can not help with all of my fine lines</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle, and it is the only thing that I have found that helps get rid of dark circles and puffiness under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> The darkness around my eyes have diminished somewhat, aliitle does go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I still have the dark circles but one problem is better than two.  </li>
            <li> Every winter I battle dry, scaling skin on my browbones.</li>
            <li> I started using Murad years ago but tried to cut costs by using only a few products and using cheaper products for my daily skin routine.</li>
            <li> I still have the same appearance I began with, so not worth the money.</li>
            <li> If dark circles are a cross you have to bear, this is 100% the eye cream for you.</li>
            <li> It has definitely helped with removing dark circles and puffy eyes.</li>
            <li> using this for a very long time &amp; it works!</li>
            <li> If I squirt out a half, it&#x27;s not enough.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for 1-2 weeks, but I see a little difference in the skin texture.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> Item arrived open, seal popped and half empty!  </li>
            <li> Soft on the delicate eye</li>
            <li> Be careful if you order from Murad.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way...</li>
            <li> I have noticed that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I will never look for any other skin care products because I don&#x27;t have to</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Murad eye creams and had no problem.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Murad products before and found that they exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount and this size lasts me 2-3 months.</li>
            <li> no i will never use any other eye cream 10 out of 10</li>
            <li> For me, I want to manage those dark circles (seriously, left untreated, these babies make me look like I lost a bar fight, hard).</li>
            <li> But I have very dark circles and heavy bags that I constantly try to combat with heavy concealers and eye brightening makeup.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price.  </li>
            <li> If dark circles and crows feet are a problem please consider purchasing this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed some improvement to the dark circles under my eyes with almost-daily use.</li>
            <li> This I see a difference with my dark circles and lines.</li>
            <li> but I cannot say that the puffiness and dark circles are gone....</li>
            <li> no reduction in puffiness or dark circles.  </li>
            <li> Have used this cream every day religously, ever since I received it, but there hasn&#x27;t been an iota of difference in my under-eye puffiness and dark circles</li>
            <li> it was to thick, i like a fluid serum type of eye cream</li>
            <li> but I found the eye cream on Amazon for a lot less</li>
            <li> I have noticed less circles and darkness under my eyes.</li>
            <li> after using this product twice a day for about 3 weeks, the shadow under my eyes seems less noticeable, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, works well under makeup.</li>
            <li> perhaps slightly better??..or just wishful thinking...</li>
            <li> You can tell this eye cream is firming, and even somewhat brightens my dark circles after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money trying to &#x27;save&#x27; money.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that moisturizers without irritating my eyes.</li>
            <li> I stopped using the product for a few days and my eyes recovered.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks and have noticed a difference in the skin under by eyes.</li>
            <li> Have been using this twice a day for a few weeks now; in the morning after washing my face and applying my makeup and in the evening after cleansing my face.  </li>
            <li> i use it everyday and like it.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> this makes me look instead of constantly being told I look tired.  </li>
            <li> Now they look like any one else&amp;#34;s circles, just small faded dark circles, not the refugee camp circles I used to have.  </li>
            <li> my skin looks tight and there is no puffiness at all!  </li>
            <li> Not even a little!  </li>
            <li> small size 0.5oz</li>
            <li> I have used this in the past and can tell a difference.  </li>
            <li> usually use Rodan + Fields, but decided to try Murad because of the price.  </li>
            <li> small try out originaly ordered from Murad</li>
            <li> so a 0.14 oz sample has lasted me over a month, and I use this everyday!  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m hard to please.  </li>
            <li> Plus, if you mix it with other moisturizer you get some weird sticky reaction.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> and I was getting sick and tired of trying different brands of products (not to mention spending money thinking I was saving money).</li>
            <li> At least it didn&#x27;t make my eyes itch!</li>
            <li> It is much less expensive here on Amazon which makes it a little less painful!</li>
            <li> the service was poor.</li>
            <li> Got tired of waiting over a month</li>
            <li> I was told how tired I looked and the puckering around my eyes got worse</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I ever bought any other products as they have been a waster and disappointment.</li>
            <li> but hammers the bad elements and stress we have everyday.  </li>
            <li> but that is too expensive for me.</li>
            <li> I just thought it&#x27;s a bit expensive.</li>
            <li> This stuff is extremely expensive and I didn&#x27;t feel it made any difference.  </li>
            <li> and unfortunately I don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Tried using it again and had the same terrible reaction.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know what is this in this bottle...  just random lotion.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for my skin type the Resurgence did not work at all.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I will not be repurchasing this product, I&#x27;ll stick to my cleansers from Murad.</li>
            <li> I never had a product work for my circles before, and my circles are bad.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed, but it wasn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> So disappointed in Murad.</li>
            <li> I wrote the company, paid  $20 for the return of the packages and requested my information be removed from their data base.  </li>
            <li> crap</li>
            <li> Being over 60 yrs and desert heat in Arizona can be brutal on the tender skin around eyes--</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed!</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!!!!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using this cream for 3 weeks and it &#x27;s working for the eye bags that I had</li>
            <li> Wonderful, non irritating, soothing. I love it.</li>
            <li> I Don&#x27;t feel any difference with others.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used it for long, but like it so far</li>
            <li> Best skincare product...;-)</li>
            <li> Like the product. Works very well</li>
            <li> This product is GREAT!!  I am on my second bottle, and it is the only thing that I have found that helps get rid of dark circles and puffiness under my eyes.  I&#x27;ve been looking for over 2 years for something that would work.  I recommend this to anyone with either of the above issues.  Use a tiny bit under each eye, twice daily.  My sister has also started using it and loves it too!  Well worth the money, and since you only have to use a tiny amount, it will last 4 or 5 months (15ml).</li>
            <li> I put this under my eyes for months it has done nothing for me.  I still have the same appearance I began with, so not worth the money.</li>
            <li> This Murad product actually does all it claims to do. Fine lines are no longer viseable, darker areas under eyes and the morning puffy look is gone! I used more expensive lines, such as Chanel&#x27;s Sublimage. This cream is as good or better and much less costly! This is a cream I will continue to use. The dispenser is well designed and no excessive cream is wasted. Being over 60 yrs and desert heat in Arizona can be brutal on the tender skin around eyes-- but with this cream you would never know it!</li>
            <li> The Resurgence line from Dr Murad is by far the best product line I have ever experienced.  The Renewing Eye Cream absolutely does what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> great product and fast delivery</li>
            <li> Jury is still out.  Just received the product and only used it once.</li>
            <li> I love this product and will not change it for nothing... I use it for two years now and i love it... A little goes a long way...</li>
            <li> Another great produce from Murad.  I use it morning and night.</li>
            <li> I started using Murad years ago but tried to cut costs by using only a few products and using cheaper products for my daily skin routine. Well, at 56 I just felt my skin wasn&#x27;t looking great and I was getting sick and tired of trying different brands of products (not to mention spending money thinking I was saving money). My 30 yr old daughter started using an entire line of Murad products and I noticed her skin was looking great. That was when I decided to invest in the entire Resurgence line of products. I started with the wash to day/night treatments, the mask etc. It was a costly order but the results are worth it! It is only 2 weeks since I have been using the entire Resurgence treatment and the results are amazing. Even my husband noticed the difference. Don&#x27;t waste money trying to &#x27;save&#x27; money. I will never look for any other skin care products because I don&#x27;t have to, I finally found what was right there for years!</li>
            <li> Murad are great products and if I could afford, I would get them monthly but I found the eye cream on Amazon for a lot less and now I just buy that. It is the best eye cream next to Arbon eye cream but that is too expensive for me. It is the best though!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 6 months now and I love it! Only eye cream that has been able to diminish my stubborn crows feet! I have used numerous different products and none of them come even close!! This is a must have!!</li>
            <li> Great eye cream, not greasy at all, absorbs fast and looks great under make up. I&#x27;ve only been using it for 1-2 weeks, but I see a little difference in the skin texture.&lt;br /&gt;Very small size 0.5oz but that is the only size Murad eye cream comes in with a pump. Of course you need only a drop every time so will last 60-90 days.&lt;br /&gt;The larger sizes are in a tube and I wanted the pump so I got this for now... Next time I will look for the 2 oz.size and refill the pump bottle since it&#x27;s a better deal in the long run. I still saved around $20 over Murad membership price so its worth it!...I cancelled the auto-ship from Murad.</li>
            <li> Only product I will use under my eyes.  I don&#x27;t even use the department store, but this one does not bother my sensitive skin, and it works fantastic.  I follow up with a #3 Dr. Murad sunscreen product (the orange colored bottle).  Works great.  Have reordered many times.</li>
            <li> Really great priduct, doesn&#x27;t feel caked on when on the face! Very hallo with results thus far! Happy customer :)</li>
            <li> There is something really pleasant about this product.  The way it spreads, the mild fragrance and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t make me look like I&#x27;m covered in Vaseline makes it very pleasant to use.  I also like Dr. Hauschka but the product that they recommend for my age group does look greasy to me and I just don&#x27;t like walking around like that in the evening or going to bed looking and feeling greasy.  I think this Murad eye cream does a good job in reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles and keeping the delicate skin around the eyes protected.</li>
            <li> I love this product it does exactly what Murad say it will do for your face. Thanks for the great price.</li>
            <li> One use of this cream made my eyes puffy for 3 days.  I&#x27;ve used other Murad eye creams and had no problem.  I am currently trying to get a refund from Murad.  I do NOT RECOMMEND using this product.  If you are compelled to try it, make sure nobody is going to see you for a few days in case you puff up like I did!</li>
            <li> Love this little miracle cream. I have seen changes after using this product for about 6 months.</li>
            <li> It really works. I have tried so many but this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> First tried this when a sample was given to me.  absolutely love this!!</li>
            <li> Not aure if I need more time of use but as of now I noticed only small improment. However I have been using this prduct now for over 3 weeks so I would expect to see changes sooner than later.</li>
            <li> Positively the best eye cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  It keeps the puffiness at bay and hydrates and refreshes the eye area magnificently.  And for a 65 year old woman, that&#x27;s quite an accomplishment.</li>
            <li> This product is the best eye cream I&#x27;ve ever used, I&#x27;ve noticed how it slowly reduced the puffiness and wrinkles around my eyes. I just thought it&#x27;s a bit expensive.</li>
            <li> Be careful if you order from Murad. Last October I ordered from their site to making sure I did not select  in any automatic product shipping.  I received the intro package and did not choose to reorder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In December I received an unordered package and was charged more than $100.  I received another unordered package in March with another charge for more than $100.  I wrote the company, paid  $20 for the return of the packages and requested my information be removed from their data base.  Today, I received yet another unordered package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not be bullied into keeping a product I did not order.  I have  learned these packages can be marked REFUSED and they will be returned to the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The products may be great but dealing with a company with these policies is a nightmare.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, most especially for puffiness.  Very noticeable difference from the first application.</li>
            <li> I love all of the Murad Resurgence product line, great stuff!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t help my wrinkles as much as the night cream does. Doesn&#x27;t even seem to be the same quality. I was disappointed, but it wasn&#x27;t bad. It did moisturize. It just didn&#x27;t truly work on the wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Have been using for about 2 years now. It feel good on my skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is extremely expensive and I didn&#x27;t feel it made any difference.  I will go back to my old brand of eye cream.</li>
            <li> Every winter I battle dry, scaling skin on my browbones. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different products to address the problem with minimal success. This season, I received a sample of the Murad Resurgence eye cream with another cosmetics purchase. Lucky me! I started using the sample and within just three days, the scaling had healed completely. I immediately ordered the full size and am very pleased with the product. Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> This also works great on the neck crease lines.  I have been using this on my neck crease lines and you can now barely see them.</li>
            <li> After using this product for 3 months I can honestly say my skin has changed for the better.  The true test was when I went for a facial and the esthetician remarked at how tight and smooth my skin was.</li>
            <li> This product arrived quickly, but despite previous reviews and giving it a month to work I&#x27;ve seen no improvement with puffiness or squint lines.</li>
            <li> Very nice product.  I&#x27;ve been very pleased using the Murad Resurgence Renewing Eye Cream.  It&#x27;s light and creamy but not at all greasy.  I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference in those tiny laugh lines around my eyes.  Unfortunately I still have the dark circles but one problem is better than two.  I will continue to use and make another purchase when I get low. It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Item arrived open, seal popped and half empty!  Clearly a resale.  So disappointed in Murad. I returned it the next day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 23, so my goal with this eye cream is to prevent and protect from wrinkles. But I have very dark circles and heavy bags that I constantly try to combat with heavy concealers and eye brightening makeup. You can tell this eye cream is firming, and even somewhat brightens my dark circles after a few weeks of use. I&#x27;ll definitely keep using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 29 years old, I have very fair skin, and I inherited really dark puffy circles under my eyes from my lovely and wonderful mother. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of eye creams, and most of them have been in the same price range as the Murad Resurgence. Some work better than others for me, but this one is far and away the best. I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks now, and I already notice that the skin around my eyes is much lighter and firmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it all depends on what you want to get out of your eye cream. For me, I want to manage those dark circles (seriously, left untreated, these babies make me look like I lost a bar fight, hard). I have little \\&quot;laugh lines\\&quot; around my eyes, but those don&#x27;t bother me, and they aren&#x27;t what I&#x27;m trying to treat, so I can&#x27;t really speak to this product&#x27;s effectiveness in that regard. If dark circles are a cross you have to bear, this is 100% the eye cream for you.</li>
            <li> I love the Murad cleanser, but don&#x27;t know if this particular product is really worth the money.  I&#x27;ve bought this twice and really don&#x27;t see much of a difference in the appearance of fine lines or hydration, for that matter.</li>
            <li> Great product and much much cheaper on-line than at the salon or spa.  I have seen great results and like the scent.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  Great value!&lt;br /&gt;Been using this for a very long time &amp; it works! The product is gentle but effective. I have no crows feet. I have sensitive skin/eyes &amp; tend to react to many products. This product is awesome... try it... won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price.  I hae seen no difference.</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with the acne-wrinkle line. My entire face is rejuvenated and I&#x27;ve gotten compliments specifically on my eyes, saying they look less puffy and more &amp;#34;awake.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I was hoping after 3 weeks, I would notice a difference and unfortunately I don&#x27;t.  Back to the drawing board.</li>
            <li> five starts! Great product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any visible differences as in before and after use. So, I am not sure it is any better, but it is certainly not bad.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and paying way more at the stores.  So glad this qualifies for Prime too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Murad products before and found that they exceeded my expectations. Maybe thats why I was expecting more... But I have yet to see much of a difference with my under eye circles which I&#x27;ve inherited genetically. Plus, if you mix it with other moisturizer you get some weird sticky reaction. I saw this with cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> Item was delayed bought this for my mom for a Mothers Day gift. She loves all the Murad products. WE will definitely be buying from this seller again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this definitely does help with her eye area.</li>
            <li> I have noticed less circles and darkness under my eyes. I have used it for 4 weeks and my eyes look brighter. I will order it again. Thank You! PF</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product it works well and has a nice smooth finish on her skin. This is a great product.</li>
            <li> It really tones down my under-eye puffiness.  Love the stuff.</li>
            <li> For awhile I thought this was effective, but either other products are working just as well or I do not have much of an eyelid problem as I had thought. I use it only on special occasions.</li>
            <li> I really like this product but I&#x27;ve noticed that when I purchase it at a bargain price the consistency of the cream is thinner. I pay the full price so I know I&#x27;m getting the real deal. I do find that it does make eye area a bit firmer and well moisturized if enough is used.</li>
            <li> i personally didn&#x27;t like the eye cream..it was to thick, i like a fluid serum type of eye cream, this was to sticky and didn&#x27;t sit the right way. wouldn&#x27;t buy again! like arbonne re9 much much better</li>
            <li> I have used this in the past and can tell a difference.  It works!</li>
            <li> This eye cream does not do much for your eyes.  It does not moisturize enough and it also does nothing for wrinkles.  For what the product does, the price is way too high even for Amazon!</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older, it seems the skin around my eyes has gotten quite dry. This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that moisturizers without irritating my eyes. I&#x27;ve been using it for several years now.</li>
            <li> I have not had this product long enough to see real effects with aging. I have noticed that a little goes a long way. It is very creamy and instantly moisturizes. Both oh which I like. I hope it helps with the firmness around my eye but again too soon to tell.</li>
            <li> I have used this eye cream for many years.  It has definitely helped with removing dark circles and puffy eyes.</li>
            <li> I bought this 2 days ago and am in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use Rodan + Fields, but decided to try Murad because of the price.  I needed an eye cream and looked at the reviews on this one and decided to give it a try.  So glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes my skin feel firmer instantly.  Love that I can put it on my lid as well.  My mother has droopy eyelids and I don&#x27;t want to get them.  Most products can&#x27;t be put there but this one is safe to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only fly in the ointment is the bottle.  When I squirt out a full pump it&#x27;s too much for one eye.  If I squirt out a half, it&#x27;s not enough.  There must be a sweet spot somewhere in the middle.  I&#x27;ll figure it out, and if that&#x27;s the only problem, I can live with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to a friend and will be buying more when I run out.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Fabulous.  Soft on the delicate eye but hammers the bad elements and stress we have everyday.  It works and is better than I expected and I&#x27;m hard to please.  I will buy with confidence the Murad brand.</li>
            <li> I have tried many eye creams and have never noticed a difference.  Not even a little!  With this Murad cream I noticed results the morning after I used it. In fact, I even had friends notice and ask what I had done or what I was using.  U notice a slight difference with darkness under my eyes, but mostly the difference is with the texture/lines.  It is much less expensive here on Amazon which makes it a little less painful!</li>
            <li> Best night time eye cream under $100.  And I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
            <li> This product really irritates my eyes.  After a few days of using it my eyes are very puffy and red and have welts all around my eyes.  I stopped using the product for a few days and my eyes recovered.  Tried using it again and had the same terrible reaction.</li>
            <li> Not recommended for sensitive skin, called to cancel &amp; was placed on hold several times. The representative said I should continue products with allergic reaction to see if the breakouts would go away. After canceling I received another order in the mail, the company wanted to charge me for sending it back. Even if the product worked (which it didn&#x27;t for me) the service was poor.</li>
            <li> I dont notice anything and I have been using it faithfully for months :(&lt;br /&gt;Will not order again!</li>
            <li> Finely a eye cream that does what the advertisement says it will do!!!! If dark circles and crows feet are a problem please consider purchasing this product.  You will not be disappointed!!!!  Love the way it goes on and doesn&#x27;t irritate your eyes.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have been using it for a few weeks and have noticed a difference in the skin under by eyes. I would buy this again!</li>
            <li> i have used this under eye cream for a couple of years now and i like it.  unfortunately it can not help with all of my fine lines but i think it helps</li>
            <li> I ordred this on the Murad official web site but they had run out so it was on back order.  Got tired of waiting over a month so i decided to order via Amazon which turned out to be much cheaper.  After reading the reviews I was expecting a little more from this product.  I have been using this for about 3 weeks and do not see any difference in the fine lines around my eyes, I am in my early fourties so I only have a few.  It is very creamy so I guess it is a good moisturizer.  The darkness around my eyes have diminished somewhat, aliitle does go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use, as I said it has only been 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Love my Murad! Great product for my 50 something eyes...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed some improvement to the dark circles under my eyes with almost-daily use. The improvement is enough that I could recommend the product, but not necessarily enough that I&#x27;ll be willing to pay this much for it again. It will probably depend on how long the bottle lasts &amp; if the results remain consistent.</li>
            <li> This product does not work for me. In fact I have seen more lines and deeper lines after using this product.</li>
            <li> Of course there are cheaper products out there, but not for my skin. I use this product daily along with the Murad moisturizer. I have extremely sensitive skin to any colorants/perfumes and this product never gives me any irritation. My skin is clear and luminescent. Other than the cost, I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a change in my eyes yet, but I think I just need to use it longer. It goes on nicely though and I can&#x27;t even tell I put it on at all. It&#x27;s not greasy or oily either.</li>
            <li> This is an okay eye-cream. I do not think it is anything special for the money and will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> Was delivered quickly and the product is great.  I have tried so many eyecreams and they just don&#x27;t work.  This I see a difference with my dark circles and lines.</li>
            <li> read about this product in a magazine and wanted to try it. at sephora near me it was about $30 more, out of my range of &#x27;try and see&#x27;. the mag explained two kinds of under eye darkness - and this product addresses the type i have. after using this product twice a day for about 3 weeks, the shadow under my eyes seems less noticeable, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, works well under makeup.</li>
            <li> This is not the same cream... small try out originaly ordered from Murad was more beig color and efective and creamy, yours is just simple random cream i have no efect or diferences at all.. first of all is not the same cream i have try-out package, I have before in small original package. i don&#x27;t know what is this in this bottle...  just random lotion. crap</li>
            <li> Feels nice when I apply it under my eyes, but to be honest I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in dark circle, or puffiness reduction. Then again, I have yet to find something that does help. At least it didn&#x27;t make my eyes itch! My mom, who is allergic to everything, was able to use it no problem as well. It&#x27;s a nice moisturizer at the very least, even if quite pricey.</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of eye creams, at 47 the skin around my eyes was really starting to show my age.  This cream is the only one that works, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eye area like many other creams did.  I am going to keep buying this product, it is worth the $$</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this eye cream.  I use it for night time and it is wonderful.....can be used on top of eye as well as under the eye does not burn your eyes.</li>
            <li> The product I have purchased has been great and worked out as expected or better.  I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I wake up every morning it seems with bags under my eyes. I have tried many different products over the years whether expensive or inexpensive and they never work. This product works wonders - I do my normal facial regime and put this on after my moisturizer. This product also seems to be moisturizing and does not dry out the area under the eyes. Give it some time and it&#x27;s amazing how the bags disappear!  You only need a small amount and this size lasts me 2-3 months.</li>
            <li> First introduced to this product at Sephora, very pleased.  I am 50 and noted a reduction of puffiness, lines, darkness and crepe like skin under my eyes.  My concealer/highlighter goes on well over it.  My first bottle lasted 5 months, very economical in my opinion. Well worth the retail price but enjoy paying less thru Amazon.</li>
            <li> I use this product daily and am pleased with the results and on line price.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for my skin type the Resurgence did not work at all. Maybe I have very sensitive skin around my eyes. I was told how tired I looked and the puckering around my eyes got worse, I really didn&#x27;t have any until I started using the eye cream. I also seemed to develop deeper crows feet. I have stopped using the product and have gone back to what I was using. Between that and a cucumber cream my eyes are going back to the way they were. I know people have had great results but if u have very sensitive skin this might not be the way to go. Unfortunately it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a difference but I wasn&#x27;t consistent. Used it nightly for 2 weeks. Product has a smooth application</li>
            <li> love it best eye cream ever asked if i had botox around my eyes no i will never use any other eye cream 10 out of 10</li>
            <li> Have been using this twice a day for a few weeks now; in the morning after washing my face and applying my makeup and in the evening after cleansing my face.  It does have a slight tingly feel, which is pleasant. but I cannot say that the puffiness and dark circles are gone....perhaps slightly better??..or just wishful thinking...I am giving it a few weeks more to see.</li>
            <li> Works pretty darn well compared to other products in same price range</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all for me</li>
            <li> i use it everyday and like it.</li>
            <li> Rather spendy, but would rather spend more for a product that truly works.  Have used many other brands, from inexpensive to high end eye creams.  They all ended up in the garbage!  I&#x27;m turning 70 years old &amp; have wrinkling on  my eyelid (I sleep on my side).  Also some sagging.  Murad Resurgence Renewing Eye Cream really smooths this out as well as lifts!  I will definitely reorder this product.  Don&#x27;t want to run out!  Give it a try.  Don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Love the product fast shipping</li>
            <li> I am always looking for a cheaper alternative that gives the same results, I have not found anything that helps with the circles and puffiness to compare with Murad Resurgence Renewing Eye Cream. I only use a little amount, not to go through so quickly, one drop of cream and one drop of water....great resluts.</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream. makes the eye area silky and relaxed . smells good too. NO nut oil which is a plus for me :)</li>
            <li> I &#x27;m very satisfied with Murad.  This really works for puffy eyes.  It also eliminates the fine lines around the eyes and puffiness on eye lids. it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> The best eye cream creamy and soaks into skin easily. It works great removes fine lines and brighten my eye area, and don&#x27;t cost a mint.</li>
            <li> I recently rec&#x27;d a facial that used the Murad products.  The technician recommended this eye cream.  After a couple of weeks use, I found it to be very drying  to my skin.  I&#x27;m now trying to reverse the damage it did.</li>
            <li> I am almost 65, but have pretty good skin, but I noticed some wrinkles forming from the nose to the mouth and a few more around the eyes. So I bought all the Resurgence line and a NuFace microcurrent machine, a red light and a laser. I am making great inoads with these products. I&#x27;m sorry I ever bought any other products as they have been a waster and disappointment. This eye cream very much moisturizes the eye area and I use it on the lines around my mouth too. I used a Murad product decades ago and didnt like it so I never went back. Well years of technlogy and this guy has some excellent products. I get good results with these and my regeime and recommend it all highly.</li>
            <li> Really great product!</li>
            <li> I have been using this faithfully for a month and I see no difference in the area around my eyes.  I would not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Great eye cream.  I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Noticeable difference around my eyes since I started using this product!</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have found so far to help with under-eye puffiness.  Whenever I decide to try other products to see if there&#x27;s anything better out there, I regret wasting the money and I come back to this one.</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing for me. I really like Murad products, don&#x27;t know what happened with this though.</li>
            <li> Based on my wife&#x27;s feedback, she loves this product.</li>
            <li> Great eye cream.  Dispenses just the right amount in one pump - I also dab it on my browbone and around my lip area as well.  Lasts throughout the workday.</li>
            <li> murad&#x27;s renewing eye cream is so thin and easy to use. i love the whole resurgence program and will continue it</li>
            <li> I love my Murad! Great product</li>
            <li> Not too greasy around the eyes, which I like.  It does smooth fine lines and brighten my eye area, which tends to be plagued by dark circles.  Not a miracle solution but is a nice eye cream. No over pouring smells or irritation.</li>
            <li> great product, prompt delivery, reliable seller, will buy again</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle and loving it so far.  Leaves the skin around my eyes very soft.  Still have lines but I think there is no getting around that as we age.  Definite improvement on the softness and texture of the skin around my eyes though and that makes me happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7/30/13 - About 3/4ths the way through my 2nd bottle and I am seeing a very noticeable difference with the dark circles under my eyes.  My eyes are a lot brighter now and the fine lines are starting to soften.  Totally going to keep using this eye cream!</li>
            <li> This is the best eye cream ever!!! I like it so much, I messed up on the review of Murad&#x27;s Cleansing cream which is awesome also. This eye cream is my favorite!!!</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of this in my latest sephora order but was pretty skeptical about any product that makes skin appear firmer.  I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s, so my focus is the puffiness or \\&quot;bags\\&quot; under my eyes- not sagging skin or wrinkles.  After I wash my skin and use toner I put this on and I have to say what a difference!  By the time I get to my foundation my skin looks tight and there is no puffiness at all!  I use the tiniest bit under each eye so a 0.14 oz sample has lasted me over a month, and I use this everyday!  I love how &#x27;awake&#x27; this makes me look instead of constantly being told I look tired.  GREAT product if you don&#x27;t expect plastic surgery results. I will be purchasing once this runs out.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find this product to be effective at all.  I used it as directed, and noticed no changes.  I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> It took many months to make a difference, but a difference it did make.  You only need to use a tiny drop so a bottle lasts almost a year.  I never had a product work for my circles before, and my circles are bad.  Now they look like any one else&amp;#34;s circles, just small faded dark circles, not the refugee camp circles I used to have.  So concealers finally work for me. I am pleased.</li>
            <li> This eye cream did nothing for me. I noticed no difference whatsoever and I even checked in a magnifying mirror. I started using nutrogena oil free moisturizer around my eyes and it smoothed the wrinkles and eliminated the dark circles immensely. Fraction of the price of this cream and from a drug store!</li>
            <li> Love this Resurgence eye cream.  Ordered it after my esthetician used it on me during my facials.  Amazon has the best prices and it always arrives quickly.  Granted no eye cream is going to get rid of wrinkles, but this eye cream does feel wonderful and seems to brighten up my eye area.  Needless to say, I love it and will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream.  It was suggested to me by a cosmetologist.  The pricing was excellent.  I now use the whole line of Murad and always get complements on my complexion!!!</li>
            <li> Typically I love this brand, I have been using Murad for years.  However as I am getting older and experiencing signs of aging, I was looking to them to find a solution for my under eye area for puffiness and dark circles.  I was going back and forth on whether I should purchase, but since I had enjoyed their other products for years and read the good reviews, I decided to take the plunge.  I started using it religiously every night… no reduction in puffiness or dark circles.  The reason I gave 3 stars - I do think it has helped with the suppleness under the eye and the cream absorbed nicely, however I think I can get that from many other products that are a little easier on the pocket book.  Needless to say, I will not be repurchasing this product, I&#x27;ll stick to my cleansers from Murad.</li>
            <li> This box appears to have been open but looks fine.</li>
            <li> Have used this cream every day religously, ever since I received it, but there hasn&#x27;t been an iota of difference in my under-eye puffiness and dark circles I would not recommend this product.</li>
