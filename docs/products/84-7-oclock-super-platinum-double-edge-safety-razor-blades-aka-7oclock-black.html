            <li>I have become a fan of this, as I was using the Gillette Fusion, with 4 blades, I lost count how many they added.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With the 7&#x27;Oclock blacks, I am getting smooth shaves every time and 12 shaves out of each blade!  </li>

            <li>Got some in a sampler and had to buy more.  </li>

            <li>Very good blade, reminds me of Gillette Blue and Gillette Platinum.</li>
            <li>These are the sharpest, most long-lasting double-edge blades available.  </li>
            <li>I am happy with these so far.</li>
            <li>these Indian made Blacks are every bit as good if not a slight bit better.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t know if its because of the new well crafted razor handle I bought or if the blades are dam good</li>
            <li>many others not even worth mentioning.</li>
            <li>This is an exceptionally smooth and efficient (removes stubble with ease) blade.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping on a quality product!!!</li>
            <li>I know the Japanese blades are highly regarded but I truly think these are the best blades on the market.</li>
            <li>Awesome blades that really seem to hold an edge for a long time.  </li>
            <li>I have used this blade in 3 different razors thus far, and have had excellent results in each.  </li>
            <li>They are comfortable, give a super close shave and no irritation.  </li>
            <li>All in all, he&#x27;s thrilled with these and was glad to find such a deal.</li>
            <li>Ok, but there are other Gillette blades that are just as good.</li>
            <li>Great blades, super sharp yet a fairly smooth shave.</li>
            <li>How good were the Russian blues?</li>
            <li>It is a true statement that everyone&#x27;s face is</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t even hear the hairs cut, nice soft cut and couldn&#x27;t believe how close the shave was.  </li>
            <li>The 7 O&#x27;clock super platinum are not the sharpest blades on the market</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine a blade eclipsing this India-made Gillette Super Platinum.</li>
            <li>but there&#x27;s nothing like the Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock Super Platinums.</li>
            <li>Causing me to get more nicks than normal.</li>
            <li>They easily outlast any stainless steel blades.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Exceptional quality blades that give a great shave and perform consistently even when used under less than desirable conditions (bf had to use them with regular soap as he was out of shaving soap).  </li>
            <li>This is a solid alternative for those that like platinum treated blades or liked the blues.</li>
            <li>So far I have been using the 7&#x27;Oclock Yellows and love them (made in Russia)</li>
            <li>My favorite blades by far.</li>
            <li>I have tried many brands and narrowed my top choices down to this one, another of Gillette&#x27;s and feathers...</li>
            <li>Of those, I found the Gillette black blades to be the best combination of sharp and smooth.</li>
            <li>Plenty sharp (not quite Feather-sharp) and after 1 or 2 shaves they really come into their own and give smooth shaves.</li>
            <li>This much better and shaves closer and smoother than persona brand or even Gillettes yellow pack 7 o&#x27;clocks.</li>
            <li>but I also wait several days in between shaves, which I&#x27;m sure takes a heavier toll on the blade.</li>
            <li>I have to admit, first tried it this morning</li>
            <li>I have compared these blades to a large variety of others.</li>
            <li>I normally was using Gillette FUSION with cartridges for years, but wanted to try good double edge razors and try something different.  </li>
            <li>Not as smooth as the Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock Yellows (the ultimate blade), but very close.</li>
            <li>These stay sharper much longer than a lot of blades.</li>
            <li>but they are sharp and very smooth.</li>
            <li>The cost is so much cheaper than any other blades out there for the more modern razors.</li>
            <li>I was able to get 4 shaves out of one blade (wasn&#x27;t willing to try 5 due to my semi sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Very sharp, yet very smooth.</li>
            <li>Russian Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock Super Platinums (blues) are out of production.</li>
            <li>I enjoy Personna and Derby, but they don&#x27;t stay as sharp or as smooth for nearly as long as the ninja 7 o&#x27;clock does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Better than the green 7 o;clocks.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s tried all sorts of the popularly known and expensive blades for his coarse beard, including Merkur, Feather and Astra, and these are by far his favorite.  </li>
            <li>These are sharp but smooth.</li>
            <li>These are sharp and gives smooth  shave.</li>
            <li>I have not had a problem with one blade being dell out the pack as of yet and with a new razor</li>
            <li>first started with a multi-pack of razors, that included I believe 18 different brands or styles of safety blades.  </li>
            <li>I ordered a sampler with around 15 different blades when I first started shaving with a DE razor (Edwin Jagger DE89).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried about half a dozen different DE blades and these are my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I get approximately 7-9 shapes per blade and occasionally a little more when I shave more often.</li>
            <li>I shave my whole face every day and so far I have been using only 1 blade per week.</li>
            <li>Not a harsh shave by any means.</li>
            <li>The razor and this blade complete one another for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was pleasantly surprised with the shave on these.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say how long they will last in a more aggressive razor, but my guess is that they would be on par with other high quality blades.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am curious to try other Gillette offerings (blue, yellow, goal) and if they are as good as these I may be getting them as well.</li>
            <li>And I personally only use them for 3 or 4 shaves, and then put a new one on.  </li>
            <li>I have a thick beard with sensitive skin and these blades fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m told there is a Russia-manufactured Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock Super Platinum blade; I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s a difference in feel/performance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sharp, but not harsh on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Longevity- at least a week (7 shaves) in a mild razor such as the Superspeed, Tech, etc.</li>

            <li> He&#x27;s tried all sorts of the popularly known and expensive blades for his coarse beard, including Merkur, Feather and Astra, and these are by far his favorite.  </li>
            <li> These are sharp but smooth.</li>
            <li> These are sharp and gives smooth  shave.</li>
            <li> I have not had a problem with one blade being dell out the pack as of yet and with a new razor</li>
            <li> first started with a multi-pack of razors, that included I believe 18 different brands or styles of safety blades.  </li>
            <li> I ordered a sampler with around 15 different blades when I first started shaving with a DE razor (Edwin Jagger DE89).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried about half a dozen different DE blades and these are my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I get approximately 7-9 shapes per blade and occasionally a little more when I shave more often.</li>
            <li> I shave my whole face every day and so far I have been using only 1 blade per week.</li>
            <li> Not a harsh shave by any means.</li>
            <li> The razor and this blade complete one another for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised with the shave on these.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how long they will last in a more aggressive razor, but my guess is that they would be on par with other high quality blades.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am curious to try other Gillette offerings (blue, yellow, goal) and if they are as good as these I may be getting them as well.</li>
            <li> And I personally only use them for 3 or 4 shaves, and then put a new one on.  </li>
            <li> I have a thick beard with sensitive skin and these blades fit the bill.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m told there is a Russia-manufactured Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock Super Platinum blade; I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s a difference in feel/performance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sharp, but not harsh on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Longevity- at least a week (7 shaves) in a mild razor such as the Superspeed, Tech, etc.</li>
            <li> this is by far the sharpest, but not too sharp for a newbie shaver.  </li>
            <li> This amount of blades will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> Sharp, but not so aggressive that you&#x27;ll be left bleeding after your shave.  </li>
            <li> Was using Derby blades previously and getting a lot of inconsistency from one blade to the next.  </li>
            <li> In this case razor sharp really does mean razor sharp.</li>
            <li> The 7 O&#x27;clocks are a quality family of blades I&#x27;d recommend to any wet shaver.</li>
            <li> Came as expected.</li>
            <li> The blade is called the Gillette Black, others in the series are Green and Yellow, representative of packaging colors.</li>
            <li> Sharp  and not overly agressive.</li>
            <li> These blades are almost as sharp as Feather blades, but are a lot smoother on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What can you say about DE razor blades, but they either are sharp or not.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first as I&#x27;ve been sampling and using blades for quite some time now.</li>
            <li> perhaps it&#x27;s due to the Gillette name which I associate with the inferior and overpriced 47 blade monstrosities sold at retail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sharp but forgiving.</li>
            <li> Feather Hi-Stainless blades are sharp and harsh on my skin; where these blades are sharp with no harshness.</li>
            <li> am now down to three brands and styles that I rotate between.</li>
            <li> These are very sharp but they don&#x27;t cut my face up like Feather blades do.  </li>
            <li> Very, very sharp blades.</li>
            <li> 4 and a half.</li>
            <li> They are a little less aggressive and gentler than my Feather blades</li>
            <li> While not quite as sharp as Feather blades, it doesn&#x27;t leave my face raw the way Feather does.  </li>
            <li> I would say they are a little bit sharper than silver blues, but a little less smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Feels a little scratchy</li>
            <li> /&gt;They usually keep a sharp edge for about 4 shaves for me.</li>
            <li> but I shaved with little resistance,</li>
            <li> And tried a few blades.</li>
            <li> I get up to 7 shaves with my moderately heavy beard.</li>
            <li> I usually get 3-4 shaves out of these</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure there is another blade as efficient/smooth as this one.</li>
            <li> Hard to get these in supermarkets.</li>
            <li> I also read somewhere that some people complained of glue spots on the razor from the paper wrapper.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These blades a great for my skin type!&lt;br /&gt;I get a good shave and no razor burn or nicks.</li>
            <li> I use a Mercur barber pole safety razor. And tried a few blades. This much better and shaves closer and smoother than persona brand or even Gillettes yellow pack 7 o&#x27;clocks. These stay sharper much longer than a lot of blades. Can&#x27;t believe men still forking out tons of cash on disposable cartridges. Get a good safety razor and good blades and  shaving stand and bowl and brush set and you set for life. This amount of blades will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> Really love these blades!  Sharp, but not so aggressive that you&#x27;ll be left bleeding after your shave.  I usually get 3-4 shaves out of these but I also wait several days in between shaves, which I&#x27;m sure takes a heavier toll on the blade.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a bit better than the ones I use now.  Can&#x27;t find double edge in the store any longer, had to turn here.</li>
            <li> Russian Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock Super Platinums (blues) are out of production. This is a solid alternative for those that like platinum treated blades or liked the blues. Plenty sharp (not quite Feather-sharp) and after 1 or 2 shaves they really come into their own and give smooth shaves. I find that with many platinum coated blades, they need 1 or 2 shaves to get into their zone. Not a harsh shave by any means. Amazing longevity to these blades--7 shaves per blade is not out of the question...YMMV. In order of preference I like the 7 O&#x27;clock yellows, then these blacks, and the greens taking bronze. Not to disparage the greens which are also excellent blades. The 7 O&#x27;clocks are a quality family of blades I&#x27;d recommend to any wet shaver. Buy one pack of each in the 7 O&#x27;clock family and I suspect you will find a go-to blade. I do miss the Russian blues, though. How good were the Russian blues? Miles better than these.</li>
            <li> Good blades GREAT price. Feather, Shark... You name it they are all good. But the Gillette 7 O&#x27;clocks are more forgiving to my face. Personal opinion.</li>
            <li> Love these in my safety razor.  I have been using a safety razor for going on 7 months now.  I have become a fan of this, as I was using the Gillette Fusion, with 4 blades, I lost count how many they added.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that the safety razor lessens any razor bumps that I would have gotten after a week of shaving.  I personally have to shave every business day for work.  Sometimes I get the weekend off from shaving.  But, with the newer razor I would start to end of with razor bumps, no matter the preshave oils, or shaving creams that I used.  Its all from how close they get, and that they are taking the hair below the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first started with a multi-pack of razors, that included I believe 18 different brands or styles of safety blades.  I found that some brands did not work with my face or hair.  Causing me to get more nicks than normal. I would only need one try with that blade to rule it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now down to three brands and styles that I rotate between. The Gilette 7 0&#x27;clock Platinum, Personna Platinum, and Astra Platinum.  I find all of these work wonderfully for me.  And I personally only use them for 3 or 4 shaves, and then put a new one on.  The cost is so much cheaper than any other blades out there for the more modern razors.</li>
            <li> Closest shave you can get.  No razorburn either!</li>
            <li> Ok, but there are other Gillette blades that are just as good.</li>
            <li> Awesome blades that really seem to hold an edge for a long time.  Was using Derby blades previously and getting a lot of inconsistency from one blade to the next.  With the 7&#x27;Oclock blacks, I am getting smooth shaves every time and 12 shaves out of each blade!  That&#x27;s 2 weeks per blade before they need replaced.  I am more than pleased.</li>
            <li> 4 and a half. stars. Very good DE Razors. Sharp  and not overly agressive. Feels a little scratchy but i like that for feedback. Would definitly buy again.</li>
            <li> I rate these as good as my Gillette super blues. Very smooth shave. I get up to 7 shaves with my moderately heavy beard. These are sharp but smooth.</li>
            <li> These are the best razors I have ever used and the price was outstanding. I shave my whole face every day and so far I have been using only 1 blade per week. In this case razor sharp really does mean razor sharp.</li>
            <li> Glad I tried these, great shave.</li>
            <li> Wonderful blades. If you are a DE shaver, these are a great value. I switch between these and Feathers.</li>
            <li> Great blades at a great price.</li>
            <li> I ordered a sampler with around 15 different blades when I first started shaving with a DE razor (Edwin Jagger DE89). Of those, I found the Gillette black blades to be the best combination of sharp and smooth. These blades are almost as sharp as Feather blades, but are a lot smoother on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with all things shaving, your milage may vary, so I would suggest buying a sample size pack of blades before buying in bulk.</li>
            <li> These are the sharpest, most long-lasting double-edge blades available.  They easily outlast any stainless steel blades.&lt;br /&gt;I learned 50 years ago, when Wilkenson came out with platinum blades, that platinum works best.</li>
            <li> I have tried many brands and narrowed my top choices down to this one, another of Gillette&#x27;s and feathers...many others not even worth mentioning.</li>
            <li> Best razors I&#x27;ve found yet, especially for the price. This product ships from India. .</li>
            <li> I have used this blade in 3 different razors thus far, and have had excellent results in each.  I would place these in my top 3 along with the Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock Yellows and Gillette Silver Blues.  Longevity- at least a week (7 shaves) in a mild razor such as the Superspeed, Tech, etc. I can&#x27;t say how long they will last in a more aggressive razor, but my guess is that they would be on par with other high quality blades.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping on a quality product!!!</li>
            <li> Tried these based on lots of online reviews.  They are just ok for me.  Can&#x27;t touch my silver blues for sharpness or comfort.</li>
            <li> Outstanding Baldes. What can you say about DE razor blades, but they either are sharp or not. These are the best blades I have ever used in my safety razor. I now have over 100 blades, and I switch out blades about every week, so I have many weeks of blades for the cloestest safe ever.</li>
            <li> So far I have been impressed with these razors. I get approximately 7-9 shapes per blade and occasionally a little more when I shave more often. They are a little less aggressive and gentler than my Feather blades but I&#x27;m okay with that. They still do a very good job at the price.</li>
            <li> Got some in a sampler and had to buy more.  I use it in a rotation with Astra platinum in a superspeed, flare, and tech.  While not quite as sharp as Feather blades, it doesn&#x27;t leave my face raw the way Feather does.  I enjoy Personna and Derby, but they don&#x27;t stay as sharp or as smooth for nearly as long as the ninja 7 o&#x27;clock does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am curious to try other Gillette offerings (blue, yellow, goal) and if they are as good as these I may be getting them as well.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, yet very smooth.</li>
            <li> Gillette has always been known for producing excellent razor blades. I use only double edged razor blades. I have compared these blades to a large variety of others. The 7 O&#x27;clock super platinum are not the sharpest blades on the market but they are sharp and very smooth. I get a barber shop closeness shave without razor burn.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and are the best double edged razors I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> Just what my husband wanted and there is nothing better than a happy man :)</li>
            <li> Very good blade, reminds me of Gillette Blue and Gillette Platinum.</li>
            <li> So far I have been using the 7&#x27;Oclock Yellows and love them (made in Russia) these Indian made Blacks are every bit as good if not a slight bit better. Just got done a BBS 3 pass shave without a nick or hint of razor burn using a Mekur 33C. I also read somewhere that some people complained of glue spots on the razor from the paper wrapper. Well they must have listened to the consumer for a change because my blade came double wrapped without a hint of glue or anything else on the blade</li>
            <li> Great blades, super sharp yet a fairly smooth shave. Not as smooth as the Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock Yellows (the ultimate blade), but very close. I found them slightly more aggressive than the Yellows.</li>
            <li> This is an exceptionally smooth and efficient (removes stubble with ease) blade. It&#x27;s sharp, but not harsh on my sensitive skin. Feather Hi-Stainless blades are sharp and harsh on my skin; where these blades are sharp with no harshness. Even the toughest stubble is cleaved with ease. I&#x27;ve tried all of Gillette&#x27;s 7 O&#x27;clock blades, and this one, now made in India, is the best I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using it in a Merkur 34C razor, which is an excellent double-edge razor. The razor and this blade complete one another for me. This may be the one blade I use. I&#x27;m not sure there is another blade as efficient/smooth as this one. The blade is called the Gillette Black, others in the series are Green and Yellow, representative of packaging colors. Many Gillette blades are manufactured in Russia; this high-performing 7 O&#x27;clock super-platinum blade is manufactured in India. I&#x27;m told there is a Russia-manufactured Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock Super Platinum blade; I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s a difference in feel/performance. I can&#x27;t imagine a blade eclipsing this India-made Gillette Super Platinum.</li>
            <li> Persona blades are sharper.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re razor blades and they cut. The sharpness of these blades is about a 6-7 out of 10. They&#x27;re not &amp;#34;feather&amp;#34; blades but they are better than Gillette blues.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first as I&#x27;ve been sampling and using blades for quite some time now. I&#x27;ve used Feathers, Astros, Personas, etc. etc and for some reason always avoided these blades...perhaps it&#x27;s due to the Gillette name which I associate with the inferior and overpriced 47 blade monstrosities sold at retail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised with the shave on these. With both a vintage Fatboy razor and a newer Merkur razor the shave is quite good. They aren&#x27;t as aggressive as a feather, but for my beard type which I&#x27;d rate as just below &amp;#34;heavy and thick&amp;#34; these get the job done at a great price without the weeper factor that a Feather razor can have if you&#x27;re shaving in a hurry.</li>
            <li> Came as expected.Hard to get these in supermarkets.These are sharp and gives smooth  shave.I ahave used fancy shavers,but these blades with old fashion razors suit me best.</li>
            <li> My favorite blades by far. Sharp but forgiving.</li>
            <li> Outstanding results...very smooth and comfortable shave, superb price, an excellent value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried about half a dozen different DE blades and these are my favorite.  It is a true statement that everyone&#x27;s face is different and different blades work differently for different people.  These are very sharp but they don&#x27;t cut my face up like Feather blades do.  They are comfortable, give a super close shave and no irritation.  I have a thick beard with sensitive skin and these blades fit the bill.  I recommend them without reservation.</li>
            <li> Very, very sharp blades. Definitely an excellent performer. I would say they are a little bit sharper than silver blues, but a little less smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They usually keep a sharp edge for about 4 shaves for me.</li>
            <li> Have tried dozens of different blades for my Double Edge Razor but there&#x27;s nothing like the Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock Super Platinums. They are the perfect blend of sharpness and control. Cuts close but doesn&#x27;t cut your face. I know the Japanese blades are highly regarded but I truly think these are the best blades on the market. Well done Gillette!</li>
            <li> I have nothing but good shaves with these blades. I have not had a problem with one blade being dell out the pack as of yet and with a new razor I was able to get 4 shaves out of one blade (wasn&#x27;t willing to try 5 due to my semi sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> been experimenting with blades lately..this is by far the sharpest, but not too sharp for a newbie shaver.  Better than the green 7 o;clocks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a GILLETTE guy.  I have to admit, first tried it this morning, I don&#x27;t know if its because of the new well crafted razor handle I bought or if the blades are dam good but I shaved with little resistance, didn&#x27;t even hear the hairs cut, nice soft cut and couldn&#x27;t believe how close the shave was.  Very nice blades.  I normally was using Gillette FUSION with cartridges for years, but wanted to try good double edge razors and try something different.  Blades come from INDIA.  Saw the MRP price they want in India for them, on the back of the individual package about 45 RS, converted to learn they run 70 cents a pack of 7 blades.  Or a dime a piece.  Here they ran me about double,.but try and find good razors anywhere.  These are real nice and don&#x27;t mind paying the 18 bucks for 84 blades.  You get what you pay for out there and go PLATINUM.  I am happy with these so far.</li>
            <li> Exceptional quality blades that give a great shave and perform consistently even when used under less than desirable conditions (bf had to use them with regular soap as he was out of shaving soap).  He&#x27;s tried all sorts of the popularly known and expensive blades for his coarse beard, including Merkur, Feather and Astra, and these are by far his favorite.  BF said that he was concerned that these would be different as they are made in India instead of Russia, but could find no discernible difference.  All in all, he&#x27;s thrilled with these and was glad to find such a deal.</li>
