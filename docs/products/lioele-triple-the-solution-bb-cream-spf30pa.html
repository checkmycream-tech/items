            <li>I love this stuff!!</li>
            <li>It is amazing!</li>
            <li>The coverage is amazing!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>It works amazing!</li>
            <li>When I take my makeup off my skin looks amazing!</li>
            <li>IT IS AMAZING!</li>
            <li>It is amazing!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing!</li>
            <li>I love this product because of the excellent coverage it has.</li>
            <li>My complexion is really fair and it covers me great.</li>
            <li>Great product! :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d suggest using a good primer or it&#x27;ll look a bit cakey, otherwise it has great coverage and is long-lasting.</li>
            <li>But i put a darker foundation on top and my skin looks so flawless.</li>
            <li>My favorite and the packaging is wonderful!</li>
            <li>I use this as my concealor and It blends perfectly and easily.</li>
            <li>once you apply your normal powder/mineral foundation/liquid foundation, it blends in perfectly &amp; leaves an utterly flawless complexion.</li>
            <li>AND it does not oxidize and disappear like most bb creams do which is very good for someone who needs coverage.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s also too bright for me.</li>
            <li>and you are good to go.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is fairly scented, I can see how that would be a problem for some people.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I will definately use this one up,however, coverage wise</li>
            <li>Good company and probably good product just not for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m oily skin type, and this BB cream is good for my skin.</li>
            <li>May help using a good cleanser.</li>
            <li>If you have light skin, this is perfect.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li>I loved this BB cream.</li>
            <li>Good product but not made for my skin.</li>
            <li>I loved the color and the coverage.</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved this at the beginning.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually really good.</li>
            <li>Full coverage and excellent packaging.</li>
            <li>This BB cream is amazing, full coverage, covers blemishes perfectly.</li>
            <li>Done side is its a very light shade!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased and will re-purchase.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s got good coverage, goes on nice, and stays put throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I have some hyperpigmentation but this stuff is so good there are days I can wear this on its own.</li>
            <li>The way it glides on to your face so smoothly and effortlessly it just makes your skin look so good!</li>
            <li>On top of that it came within a day!</li>
            <li>I love this BB cream, but the seller (seoulglamour) sent me a tube that was made in 2010!</li>
            <li>As for the product, I am in love!  </li>
            <li>Totally in love!</li>

            <li>This stuff is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>The coverage is absolutely amazing to me</li>
            <li>I was recommended by some amazing friends to use this.</li>
            <li>It has amazing coverage.</li>
            <li>I decided that it looked so amazing on her, great coverage, glowing and healthy looking skin, and more, that I had to buy it.</li>
            <li>It truly does have amazing coverage.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just amazing.  </li>
            <li>Its&#x27; an amazing product.</li>
            <li>I also liked that the product did not break me out at all.</li>
            <li>And after I put it on, my skin has a nice glow.</li>
            <li>The shipping  was timely and packaging nice.</li>
            <li>so I feel good putting it on in the morning, and the look of it gets better throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>so far so good and agree with all reviewers about the best packaging!</li>
            <li>I am good to go. :)</li>
            <li>, I thought it had really nice texture and coverage.</li>
            <li>but it gives me a nice dewy finish.</li>
            <li>but it really is a nice color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve Google the product and read many good review</li>
            <li>This BB cream settles in nicely</li>
            <li>&amp; I honestly would not use anything else as a primer/base.</li>
            <li>and now I am loving it.  </li>
            <li>Adjustable coverage, quick easy, flawless, not caked,</li>
            <li>What a great product and even better price, considering you get almost 50% more than most foundations.</li>
            <li>It is a very good product which really light your skin and have a fabulous coverage.</li>
            <li>This has a very strong perfume smell, and it gives me a headache when I wear it.</li>
            <li>Over all best BB Cream i have used so far!</li>
            <li>:) my skin has never looked better!</li>
            <li>Makes your face look flawless and natural!</li>
            <li>If you are fair, you should be fine.</li>
            <li>this BB cream honestly can be worn with just pressed powder on top to set it</li>
            <li>This product by far has the BEST coverage amongst BB creams, hence the 5th purchase.</li>
            <li>I have tried a couple of bb creams and this is by far one of the best ones out there.</li>
            <li>By far the best BB cream or foundation</li>
            <li>: so far so good!!</li>
            <li>It matches my skin perfectly, it leaves a finish that is so natural looking</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t sit on top of my pores and look cakey, and it blends in nicely to even out my skin tone without looking like</li>
            <li>and I feel like I got very lucky on my choice in purchasing Liole!</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t break me out despite having a strong fragrance!</li>
            <li>Great for pale skin with excellent coverage.</li>
            <li>I have very fair, sensitive, oily, acne-prone skin, and this is the first BB cream I can wear all day that stays on beautifully and doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s great for humid or hot weather.</li>
            <li>This is a good bb cream with full coverage.</li>
            <li>It went on very smoothly and blended easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As of now, there is just one VERY light color.</li>
            <li>Please please please keep in mind that I N E V E R review products on amazon, &amp; everything I&#x27;ve gotten from amazon has been really good, but if I&#x27;m giving it such accolades, I hope whoever reads this heeds my advice and buys this product for themselves, because it really will change your life, make up routine wise, &amp; happy wise.</li>
            <li>This bb cream seems to have more of a dewy finish, when compared to the Holika Holika Pore Clearing, which has a matte finish.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>and then a powder on top to finish my look.</li>
            <li>so I would never be able to wear it without something on top of it.  </li>
            <li>I really love this BB cream.</li>
            <li>I had watched my favorite You Tube Guru&#x27;s review on this product and thought I would give it a try.</li>
            <li>I love all of the benefits of BB Creams &amp; this one is no exception.</li>
            <li>I will def be ordering more when I run out ❤️</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on my makeup</li>
            <li>(maybe I need to set it better?).</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this.</li>
            <li>Authentic product</li>
            <li>i haven gotten many many compliments while wearing this.</li>
            <li>People would constantly tell me my skin was flawless (which it isn&#x27;t).</li>
            <li>i just loveeee loveeee love love loveeeeeeee this item i will repurchase again soon.</li>
            <li>Healthy glow without looking greasy.</li>
            <li>Makes you look like a porcelain doll, then you can just add bronzer on top.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been told I look much more rested.</li>

            <li>It smells SO good, like a fresh(?) floral fragrance.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite face makeup ever.</li>
            <li>love the coverage</li>
            <li>my skin tone better.</li>
            <li>and I really love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried many bb creams.</li>
            <li>found out about this BB cream from my favorite YouTube beauty guru, Shaaanxo</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I guess I stick with Missha until I find something better.</li>
            <li>I did my research before buying this product, read the reviews, watched the videos and for the most part, the product is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love Lioele triple the solution BB cream.</li>
            <li>So its okay i guess  if you dont have oily skin</li>
            <li>I love this product because its matches my skin tone</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s about it. :)</li>
            <li>I thought that was really cute and</li>
            <li>This Lioele BB cream is quite a bit more yellow/pink pigmented than SKIN79.</li>
            <li>so I figured that Triple the Solution would be even better with all the reviews I heard.</li>
            <li>She had to do a lot of extractions and remarked on how many pimples I had.</li>
            <li>I wish this weren&#x27;t the case because I love the coverage it gives.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I bought this product about 2 months ago and am absolutely in love.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only counting on reviews and blogs to tell me which is the best BB cream for oily people.</li>
            <li>and I can use this as foundation and dot more on to use as concealer.</li>
            <li>It does have more of a dewy finish.</li>
            <li>I AM IN LOVE.</li>
            <li>Totally love this because I&#x27;m so not a make-up person.  </li>
            <li>Will give it away if I still can&#x27;t get into it after a couple more attempts.</li>
            <li>got great results using a primer first, then this BB cream, a light covering of foundation, and then setting it with powder and a setting spray.</li>
            <li>I love the product it has great coverage, smells good, and doesn&#x27;t make me break out or stick to dry patches.</li>
            <li>I trusted my girl Shan and I bought a bottle of this BB cream and loved it the first two days I used it that I bought another one.</li>
            <li>The coverage is pretty good</li>
            <li>The coverage is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easily build able, which I like.</li>
            <li>, it has fabulous coverage, I love love the smell of this product</li>
            <li>It is perfect for dry skin types!</li>
            <li>Very full coverage.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to control, especially since you need the tiniest amount to get great coverage.</li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t come close to my favorite foundation Estee Lauder Doublewear and Doublewear Light.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a great bb cream or foundation replacement for those that like a natural medium finish.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try on this product, but it ended up being too light for my medium skin tone.</li>
            <li>I think it looks very nice and natural.  </li>
            <li>Works great, even if you don&#x27;t have a very light complexion you can use bronzer afterwards to shadow and darken as necessary.</li>
            <li>I think this light-ish color may be due to the spf, which is wonderful to have.  </li>
            <li>Only disadvantage, it is for one skin color, fair!</li>
            <li>Excited to use it then :)</li>
            <li>is super easy!</li>
            <li>meaning this has lasted me almost 5.5 months - not bad!</li>
            <li>It blends easily and provides a lot of coverage for what it is.</li>
            <li>and I can easily wipe it away or move it all over the place throughout the day.</li>
            <li>This is so easy to put on and keep on all day.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a decent BB cream and thought I&#x27;d try this one based on the good reviews.</li>
            <li>it isn&#x27;t strong at all...</li>
            <li>Yes, there is a slightly strong scent to it</li>
            <li>It has a strong perfumey scent which is why I gave it 4 stars (that and the color).  </li>
            <li>My favorite full coverage bb cream.</li>
            <li>This is HANDS DOWN the best foundation I have ever</li>
            <li>that bb cream was fine except i didnt like how its so ashy tone.</li>
            <li>so this didn&#x27;t prevent that, but with my foundation powder it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>one color that it comes in turns out looking a tiny bit greenish when you first put it on, but after it sets, it matches the skin tone perfectly!</li>
            <li>This product shipped so quickly within days!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re someone who needs a good but natural coverage, this product is for you!</li>
            <li>I did SOO much research upon purchasing this product, and I am so glad I did!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that I don&#x27;t break out with the SPF in this, and I&#x27;m happy to report that I have had no new acne since using this product!</li>
            <li>The fact that it has SPF30 is a huge plus for me, along with wrinkle</li>
            <li>in light beige.</li>
            <li>and it is a bit light</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s SO smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li>and it is borderline light in color for me.  </li>
            <li>It helps cover pores and imperfections, is really light weight, and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Received my product 3 weeks before estimated shipping date so that was fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It is skin toned, a light beige I would say.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I am happy with this product and plan to purchase it again.</li>
            <li>Even though I&#x27;m 27, I think using anti aging products is important.</li>
            <li>but it feels light on your skin.</li>
            <li>After another minute or so, I use a light foundation, and a light powder to finish.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I would say it has light to medium coverage, but with a couple dabs of concealer</li>
            <li>It spread well, and really made my skin feel nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light and non greasy</li>
            <li>but it is sooooo light.</li>
            <li>fragrance is light and powdery, not overpowering.</li>
            <li>so this is too light on me.</li>
            <li>This product has light to medium coverage</li>
            <li>It almost looks light gray when it comes out</li>
            <li>Great coverage but a bit drying on my skin would definitely repurchase</li>
            <li>it is to light</li>
            <li>I wish there was something on the package that said made for light skin tones.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s too light for you, try mixing it with a darker foundation or even a darker powder or bronzer.</li>
            <li>I apply it with a buffing brush and it blends the best (using my fingers looked streaky and uneven).</li>
            <li>The only con to it is the staying power isn&#x27;t so great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not cakey and it feels like moisturizer does, so its light.</li>
            <li>My skin looks smooth and glowing.  </li>
            <li>So I had seen a YouTuber using this product as her primer/concealer, if you will, &amp; after applying it, her face looked so supple and bright and alive</li>
            <li>Overall I am really happy with this BB Cream and will continue to use</li>
            <li>Coverage is fantastic and it&#x27;s not too cakey.</li>
            <li>Face feels moisturized all day &amp; so light.  </li>
            <li>I think this was too light for me..</li>
            <li>I have fair sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I am having a love affair with this BB Cream right now.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it I was moving out out of residence and hauling stuff in the GA heat in June!!</li>
            <li>I loveeeee this product so much!!!</li>
            <li>I would say that the whitening definitely works because my face has a very bright pretty complexion now.</li>
            <li>this has a nice pinkish neutral tone and looks very natural!</li>
            <li>Highly would recommend!! :)</li>
            <li>I had seen many reviews of it on Youtube and figured it would be the first for me to try.</li>
            <li>Definitely leans more towards the yellow side which is perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>so yes its worth it!</li>
            <li>I am so excited about this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a bit drying on its own without any moisturizer (even for me!)</li>
            <li>Comes in a squeezable pump bottle with a cap, and is travel friendly.</li>
            <li>I love this BB cream, this is probably the only BB cream/foundation that I am most satisfied with.</li>
            <li>product is totally worth it!</li>
            <li>but it has this light, sweet smell to it</li>
            <li>Wanted to love this product and did for the first couple weeks.</li>
            <li>when i put them side by side and compared them together i can tell liole triple solution had more color and was more natural to my skin when i put it on.</li>
            <li>is, I just apply and use a baby wipe to clean it off of my fingers.</li>
            <li>Lioele&#x27;s TTS is more &#x27;naturally&#x27; colored than those BB creams and provide better coverage for</li>
            <li>Although that may be a turn off to some, i actually love it because I have a lot of natural redness in my cheeks &amp; it does a fabulous job at covering it up!</li>
            <li>The coverage is great, I have dry skin</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s super light.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast!!!</li>
            <li>I have used 3 other BB creams, all wonderful, and they have never broken me out</li>
            <li>So, to me the price is right!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the type of person that loves full coverage and</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite bb cream.</li>
            <li>So i tried it today and it was so nice and natural.</li>
            <li>I love this so much.</li>
            <li>This is, without a doubt, my absolute favorite cosmetic item in the world.</li>
            <li>(I use a full pump every day) and always keep one in my purse, cosmetic bag, and one</li>
            <li>and I needed a full coverage because of my acne</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s not at all true for me.</li>
            <li>Which is saying a lot for me because I am a full coverage girl.</li>
            <li>I recently tried laniege bb cushion and loved it.</li>
            <li>Nice coverage, natural tint.</li>
            <li>I just love it so much.</li>
            <li>It has fuller coverage to the point where I won&#x27;t really even need a concealer most days.</li>
            <li>I have used up to 2 pumps on days when I&#x27;m trying to get full coverage, and 1 pump on days where I just want a medium coverage.  </li>
            <li>I will mention that I have oily skin on my T-zone, so I did have to touch up twice throughout the day, but honestly that doesn&#x27;t bother me since the finish is so natural looking with this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just love how this finishes, I have yellow undertones, kind of fair, and dry skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for very light to medium skin tones and all skin types.</li>
            <li>This is seriously the best foundation I have/will ever use!</li>
            <li>I like the product and the quick shipping that I received from soulglamour both times I ordered from them.</li>
            <li>Also, I apply my with foundation with my fingers and this is not impossible to wash off of my fingers like Revlon Colorstay</li>
            <li>Overall, the bb cream is pretty nice!</li>
            <li>It is mildly moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I have mild acne from time to time and concequently I get discoloration  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery though.</li>
            <li>I love this BB cream and would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>First, I&#x27;m light to medium complexion</li>
            <li>The cream goes on smoothly and covers pretty well.</li>
            <li>This product held up, even though I got super hot and sweaty!</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite product to replace my foundation.</li>
            <li>It seems to be a very nice BB cream, but it was too dark for my skin tone.</li>
            <li>When I am my normal pale self it is a perfect match</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be back to re-stock for more!</li>
            <li>I excitedly opened the package applied it to my bare face and in my dimly lit room it looked good.</li>
            <li>This is only available in one color choice, the color looks somewhat darker when freshly pumped from the bottle, but when applied/blended in to the skin it&#x27;s very light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little tacky after you first apply it but sets beautifully.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is smooth, moisturizing, and has very high coverage.</li>
            <li>I it would be much too light.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very creamy and goes on smooth but again not for me.</li>
            <li>It is really a bit too light for me.</li>
            <li>feels light on skin and covers very well.</li>
            <li>Though when I looked at my face in a brighter light, it was very cakey</li>
            <li>On it&#x27;s own, I find these bb creams aren&#x27;t that longer lasting, but again, it could be because of my skin type.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny and lasts forever.</li>
            <li>With that said, I want to make it clear to those who are hesitating this is very much authentic.</li>
            <li>I bought it for the 3 in 1 action, but the SPF is for sure expired.</li>
            <li>Hopefully it will not break out my sensitive skin, but I love the way it feels.</li>
            <li>Upon first application, it gives a medium to full coverage.</li>
            <li>can also be used on its own, if you don&#x27;t need the extra coverage.  </li>
            <li>Unlike the Garnier one, it is completely oil-free, It gives a healthy skin look and a matte finish.</li>
            <li>I had to use a darker powder and bronzer in order for it to look more natural.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth the price and money.</li>
            <li>Here in Hawaii, that&#x27;s not possible &amp; it would have been nice if I could get 1 shade darker.  </li>
            <li>i liked it and definitely evened out my skin tone</li>
            <li>After reading such great reviews on this and also hearing directly from a friend, I knew I had to try this.  </li>
            <li>am 100% dutch and very fair skinned with pink undertones, I was nervous that this (being only available in one shade) would not be right for me.  </li>
            <li>I do have some fine lines underneath my eyes already, and this BB cream does a decent job of not caking in the wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I love this bb cream, originally I used this under my regular makeup</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin then I highly recommend Lioele, because it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>right now I&#x27;m way to tan for it.</li>
            <li>So if you have oily skin, it might not be right for you.  </li>
            <li>love it and will continue to use it as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li>Usually I buy make-up with words like &#x27;fair&#x27;, &#x27;porcelain&#x27;, &#x27;light&#x27;, etc.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive and oily skin, so I break out and irritate easily.</li>
            <li>I enjoy trying new foundations</li>
            <li>Absolute favorite makeup product by far.</li>
            <li>have sensitive, combination/oily skin, and so far I have had no luck with any kind of foundation.</li>
            <li>very well \\&quot;I&#x27;m super pale\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Other BB creams can be light coverage or too pale to the skin, but this Lioele one is the best.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this product because it actually does what it says and it is easy on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I love this BB cream, on days where my skin is super dry or breaking out I can go without foundation and just use the BB cream.</li>
            <li>and I noticed that it held up pretty well if I applied a primer and set it with powder.</li>
            <li>I feel confident enough to just go out with this on my face.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s my first time purchasing it from amazon.</li>
            <li>For anyone interested in what I use for the summer time (for oily/combination skins), I use the holika holika aqua petit jelly in #01</li>
            <li>I wish it  came in unscented as it covers pretty well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does have that &#x27;dewy&#x27; feeling at first</li>
            <li>Yes, it never fail me.</li>
            <li>I received my first tube at the beginning of October</li>
            <li>it really soon after I ordered which is a plus!</li>
            <li>, I think it&#x27;s one of the higher quality ones out there.</li>
            <li>this is my first time ever using a BB cream.  </li>
            <li>I also broke out the first week of using it which may have just been a coincidence.</li>
            <li>Will order again if their prices continue to stay consistently</li>
            <li>I will definitely order again :)</li>
            <li>First I will start by saying that shipping was extremely fast coming from another country!  </li>
            <li>It has not broken me out, which if you need to know if a product would break you out, my face is the one to test it out on!  </li>
            <li>first time using bb cream</li>
            <li>It has a pretty, dewy finish and doesn&#x27;t look too greasy/oily.</li>
            <li>find the product to have adequate coverage, particularly because the undertone is pinkish-yellowish and matches my skin well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my first bottle for over a year now</li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t buy this again and have not used it after my first try.</li>
            <li>I purchased my second tube already, just to make sure I don&#x27;t have to go with out</li>
            <li>I have been experimenting with Korean makeup as of late, and this BB cream has a great finish.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever reviewed a product here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a couple BB cream before I came across this one reading a review about a different BB cream someone said they had love.</li>
            <li>This product really works!</li>
            <li>I sometimes use this as my primer, concealer and foundation and only top it off with powder then bronzer.</li>
            <li>(most consider me mixed</li>
            <li>It mixes well with my regular foundation to get a better color for me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;We will see if the summer weather makes me change my mind again ;)</li>
            <li>and I honestly really like it!</li>
            <li>I only wish this came in more colors</li>
            <li>I find that even though it is a bit thick, it blends easily and has a nice looking finish.  </li>
            <li>Lasting power isn&#x27;t that great, but then again, I have extremely oily skin, but overall I love it so much!</li>
            <li>:) I love how thick this BB cream is.</li>
            <li>However, this is the only one that I really liked and made my face look natural</li>
            <li>I have a lot of pink acne marks on my face and this does a great job of covering them without looking &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34;, although its full coverage its natural looking at the same time.</li>
            <li>Most days I just wear this by itself with a little bronzed but it also works amazing as a primer for my MAC studio fix fluid.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin, and I live in tropical weather year round, so you can only imagine how my skin does with makeup, but this bb cream works GREAT and LASTS!</li>
            <li>It easily hides my red areas and most of my blemishes (not the super dark ones but good enough) and overall evens out my skin tone.</li>
            <li>It is the right shade for my skin (pale but warm under-toned so it would suit a lot of people).</li>
            <li>The color isn&#x27;t perfect, but it&#x27;s not as bad as I originally thought.  </li>
            <li>It has a thick consistency and feels like foundation because of the amazing coverage, but it&#x27;s not!</li>
            <li>However, this BB cream I find is thicker than most and a lot goes a long way.</li>
            <li>This is the first BB cream I&#x27;ve tried, so I can&#x27;t really compare it to others.  </li>
            <li>Being 56 &amp; fair skinned, I have never had luck using foundations or powders to conceal the usual sun-damage spots and spidery veins on my face.</li>
            <li>Always a plus for easy and mess free application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am very lucky because this color matches my skin immensely well</li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about this product it that it transfers from the skin easily; (ie.</li>
            <li>It makes you look more awake and youthful instead of looking dry and</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t dry it out more nor does has it caused me to break out with acne.</li>
            <li>This product is 100% amazing and coming from only purchasing high quality foundations, this is my go to item when wanting to use something similar to foundation but not want to have to keep purchasing it because it pretty much melts off because of the humidity!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s fine with me anyway because I don&#x27;t mind the extra sun protection.</li>
            <li>overall id say if you were wanting just night out cream its fine but not an all day</li>
            <li>I enjoy trying different brands off BB cream and previously had a Missha BB cream that I really liked.</li>
            <li>I really like the coverage it provides, but gave it only 4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t appear to come in any other shades, and this one is definitely too light for me--even though I have pretty fair skin.  </li>
            <li>I even used a little on my sister who has more pink undertones and it looked nice on her as well.</li>
            <li>Curious, and almost out of foundation, I decided to order this up and give it a try despite not being able to read much of anything on the packaging.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin looking real smooth but not something I would wear all day because I get oily and my makeup starts to rub off after a few hours of using this product under my skin.</li>
            <li>I bought this from the seller EmpireCosmeticDepot and the shipping was incredibly fast.</li>
            <li>and I become very greasy</li>
            <li>I wanted to give it a couple weeks before writing a review, as I have very breakout prone skin.</li>
            <li>The smell doesn&#x27;t really fade, but I don&#x27;t notice it when it&#x27;s on my face.</li>
            <li>I really like it; but it has a bit of a grayish cast.</li>
            <li>It shipped really fast too.</li>
            <li>The Lioele BB cream is very moisturizing without making me greasy.</li>
            <li>The product was whatever really.</li>
            <li>But during the day it starts to look chalky and that really bothers me.</li>
            <li>If you have a pink-based skin tone, it might not match very well.  </li>
            <li>, REALLY oily skin and this products works very well.</li>
            <li>I am a combo skin with a very oily t-zone, so I put some powder or this</li>
            <li>I was absolutely blown</li>
            <li>really badly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>really well</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very oily as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Blends well: I was concerned that since this is one shade product, it wouldn&#x27;t blend very well, but I needn&#x27;t have worried.</li>
            <li>It also got a very &#x27;powdery&#x27; appearance even though I do not powder my makeup.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve successfully accomplished this with over foundations like the TruBlend by Covergirl, but I can&#x27;t manage it with this product.</li>
            <li>Put it on after cleaning and moisturizing and you are ready to go, it lasts all day for me, in the cooler weather.  </li>
            <li>But I guess if you put your foundation over it it won&#x27;t matter as much.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast as well.</li>
            <li>I really like the consistency of this stuff.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very buildable.</li>
            <li>Product arrived in reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only tried this BB cream out for a few days now, but I can already say that I love it and am 100% satisfied with this</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely recommend for anybody that wants fuller coverage.</li>
            <li>This stuff works really well.</li>
            <li>I bought Beyond the Solution on accident, but ended up really liking it</li>
            <li>this stuff ends up looking really powdery and cakey on me...</li>
            <li>I was hesistant, however, because I have really tan skin</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s a real plus.  </li>
            <li>It lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t sink into my wrinkles unless I really pack it on.  </li>
            <li>Since using it my skin has become so much smoother and healthier.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this, I just didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re very oily you probably don&#x27;t need a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It is quite thick and offers great coverage.  </li>
            <li>it came reaallyyy late and the consitency was good but it broke me out.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I caused it in some way or if it&#x27;s because of the temperature, but the cream eventually made my face more oily (and my face is already naturally oily, especially in the T-Zone).</li>
            <li>They go on so quickly and easily that I just can&#x27;t go back to regular foundation.</li>
            <li>It took a little while to come in, but it was packaged really tightly and even came with the most precious note from the seller!</li>
            <li>It is more fragrant than other bb&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first (like I am about most skin care products), but after seeing so many recommendations for this product I had to give it</li>
            <li>I like this a lot, but find I like it better when I mix a bit with other foundations.</li>
            <li>If you are usually shade 1 or 2 in most brands of foundation, give this a shot!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve looked years for a way to get full coverage,  and I&#x27;ve finally found a product that helps in that, so much.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much of a smell, and I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to scent.</li>
            <li>, I am hispanic and middle eastern nc 35 in mac if that helps and this BB cream blends good, I just use a bit of bronzer or blush and blend the cream down my neck.</li>
            <li>Right now I&#x27;m using it as my foundation, since it has been so hot, with my regular routine-</li>
            <li>The shade is slightly paler than my complexion (Asian), but it does make me look like I have good skin.  </li>
            <li>I am now 38 years old and notice that my skin is drier and looks even more dry when I apply foundation.</li>
            <li>This bb cream is medium coverage for me, and can be full if you apply a second layer.</li>
            <li>I guess I can put bronzer to make my face more dark.</li>
            <li>It did not look natural and seemed to accentuate my larger pores and fine lines.</li>
            <li>It would&#x27;ve been better if there was an option for other shades!</li>
            <li>But I will def be buying a new tube once this one runs out!</li>
            <li>With previous BB creams it feels as if the cream just sits on top my skin</li>
            <li>I would say it&#x27;s more on the matte side, but not super matte.  </li>
            <li>Semi decent coverage.  </li>
            <li>After trying many American bb creams that were just tinted moisturizers, I finally decided to infest in this bb cream.</li>
            <li>I was very nervous to order online since I am not incredibly light like most bb creams seem to be...</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;m not black at all) &amp; the product only comes in one shade- light beige.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re wondering which bb cream to try, I highly recommend Lioele.</li>
            <li>This was highly recommended, and I understand why.  </li>
            <li>This is a high coverage bb cream and does well to conceal imperfections.</li>
            <li>I have used primers and high quality setting powders, but by the end of the day you can see my acne spots exposed.</li>
            <li>texture too heavy for a BB and very light in color.</li>
            <li>I think even if you are lighter or little darker than this color you should still be able to use it as your BB cream because you&#x27;re going to use foundation powder or it anyways.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of acne scars on my cheek areas and this has helped covered it completely!!</li>
            <li>i love how it literally covers my acne and spots but its a little on the greasy side.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Skin79&#x27;s Gold and Hot Pink as well as Missha&#x27;s Perfect Cover, and those were soooo grey and looked super weird on my skin.</li>
            <li>It covers very well but natural looking.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite everyday BB creams.</li>
            <li>The price fluctuates a lot (was $22 when I bought it; $14 5 days later), but it was still worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t like scented products</li>
            <li>I have normal skin too.</li>
            <li>It has the consistency of a nice foundation, not too thick and not too watery, it covered all my blemishes and face with one pump.</li>
            <li>Even with just one pump, this bb cream really blurs acne scars, dark circles and really evens out the complexion!!!</li>
            <li>I love that it has SPF too - one less step for me!  </li>
            <li>:) Oh and this BB cream does come in one shade, its very pale and I am obviously not Caucasian or super faired skin</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t figure out what was going on because I hadn&#x27;t changed my routine except for the new BB cream.</li>
            <li>I did a lot of research on this new trend via Google.  </li>
            <li>i love it and its natural and it doesnt feel heavy.</li>
            <li>Every morning, I use a small-than-pea-sized amount and it&#x27;s good enough to provide coverage for my entire face and even slightly beyond my jawline.</li>
            <li>I put it on with a fluffy blending brush that kind of looks like a big eyeshadow brush.</li>
            <li>I have tried a few and this one offers more coverage and does not have a gray cast or tint to it.</li>
            <li>After I set it with powder, it has a very natural skin look.</li>
            <li>It does have good coverage, thicker formula &amp;#34;yogurt&amp;#34; which is a little more difficult to blend and may appear cakey if not blended well.  </li>
            <li>I tried my old foundation the other day (one for people with acne) and by the end of the day I had a huge pimple on my chin.</li>
            <li>It looks so natural too!</li>
            <li>This does it all - protects your skin from the sun, brightens, and makes your skin soft!</li>
            <li>This is my first Asian BB Cream</li>
            <li>This one has sheer-medium can maybe even build to full, but gotta be careful or it&#x27;ll look cakey.</li>
            <li>Sensitive with super oily in the T-zone and around nose with dry around corners of my lips.  </li>
            <li>I got a facial today and my aesthetician remarked on how my usual healthy and clear skin was very congested and clogged up!</li>
            <li>From freshly washed face, fully dry face, after moisturizer, without moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Be aware that delivery takes several weeks though, as it ships directly from China.</li>
            <li>I typically dab tiny dots all over my face to give a more even coverage with spreading out the product.</li>
            <li>It also is a little light for my skin tone  </li>
            <li>I am a fair skinned lady and this is just a -tad- too dark but nothing a little setting powder cant fix!     </li>
            <li>I am combo/oily for reference and it doesn&#x27;t accentuate my dry spots, or melt off my T zone like many other BB Creams.</li>
            <li>I use this with my combination dry skin (love it), and my mom uses it with her extremely oily skin (she LOVES it!).&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Really great coverage, a little goes a long way and this package last you for a really long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m white and fair-skinned, and it adjusts to my skin tone very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m prone to break outs, but so far no break outs for 2 weeks using it.</li>
            <li>I was even surprised that this seemed to match my skin tone</li>
            <li>but it does so in a natural looking way.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive acne prone skin</li>
            <li>With a primer and setting spray, this effect was reduced, but I was always too nervous to wear it for the long or hot days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Far away.</li>
            <li>, it looked totally natural on my skin, but I can&#x27;t comment on how it would work on darker skin tones.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d also suggest this to others with the same skin type since I think it&#x27;s very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing and just overall</li>
            <li>I once put on mineral veil (bare escentuals powder) afterwards, and it brought out every line and wrinkle on my face!!!  </li>
            <li>It does smell a lot better than Beyond the Solution, but when it comes to the formula and the final look, I prefer the plain Beyond the Solution.</li>
            <li>Color is too light and drab and can make a pale persob look washed out.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Longevity: When I get a new product I always try it out on bare skin with no primer and no setting spray.</li>
            <li>My skin has some very slight redness, so how I use this product is by layering some light moisturizer, a primer, then after waiting 2 or 3 minutes, I use 1 to 1 and 1/2 pumps of the Lioele triple the solution cream.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m a normal skin type (not oily, not dry).  </li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way :)</li>
            <li>It is a little too light for my skin but just barely.</li>
            <li>A very small amount, and a bit more than that.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think anything can beat this, especially with the decent pricing.</li>
            <li>It he tube definitely lasts and is pretty big</li>
            <li>On top of all that I found it hard to remove completely with regular face wash and it smelled powdery, like an old lady.</li>
            <li>There are no other colors!</li>
            <li>The reason why I don&#x27;t like this formula as much is because it doesn&#x27;t spread so easily and the finishing look reveals an unappealing look.</li>
            <li>It should cover your dark circles, but because I naturally have small bumps under my eyes if I use any kind of foundation or concealer under there</li>
            <li>recently found this in my drawer after running out of my normal foundation, I used it again</li>
            <li>It has a odd smell at first, but WHO CARES!</li>
            <li>but considering how far this traveled to get to me, wasn&#x27;t worth the return, when I used it a few times to see if it would grow on me.</li>
            <li>I noticed how thick it was when it doesn&#x27;t easily come off with soap and water from your fingers after you are done.  </li>
            <li>Also it looks super cakey and heavy while managing not to give any coverage at all</li>
            <li>The color does have a yellow base so probably not the best shade for everyone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely pale, and it doesn&#x27;t really cover up that much on me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Irish, already very paled skin so this matches my skin tone pretty well when I&#x27;m glow in the dark white.</li>
            <li>It is a little pricy but for what you get it is worth the investment.</li>
            <li>I generally use this as after my moisturizer and primer.</li>
            <li>I use Bare Minerals along with this product</li>
            <li>it&#x27;ll just look way for visible, so I barely use any under my eyes.</li>
            <li>It covers well but be careful to not apply too much.</li>
            <li>I work 8-9 a day and so far it has lasted the entire day.</li>
            <li>if you have ever tried Skin79 BB Cream in the pink bottle, the finish is very similar to that in how pretty it looks however this one lasts longer on my t zone.  </li>
            <li>at first application, my face looks cakey but after a few hours, it blends in like my natural color.  </li>
            <li>This BB cream is light colored and thick.</li>
            <li>With every facial I get I never require too many extractions, she said the blackheads were big and thick.</li>
            <li>I apply it with a foundation brush which I hadn&#x27;t before, and this seems to blend it better and make it feel less heavy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m going to be able to use this long-term due to the smell.</li>
            <li>For all of the Caucasian women (or men) out there who have tried other Asian BB Creams that carry too much of a &amp;#34;gray&amp;#34; cast, this is one to try!  </li>
            <li>At first when I was using this, I notice that it transfers onto clothes as bit, but after coming back to it after using other foundations, I didn&#x27;t see it transfer</li>
            <li>It covers your flaws very well and doesn&#x27;t have that greyish look to it, like some of the other bb creams.</li>
            <li>stuff is extremely moisturizing and leaves you with a  very dewy-finish.  </li>
            <li>I rarely get more than a pimple and this was painful acne all over my chin.</li>
            <li>My only issues is that the product didn&#x27;t come with the case cover so it makes it hard to tell if it&#x27;s the original or just a replica of Lioele.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve completely replaced my high end foundations such as Kevyn Aucoin, Bobbi Brown, Dior and Chanel simply because I haven&#x27;t found a product other than Korean bb creams that will give me that &amp;</li>
            <li>And dark spots around my cheeks and using this product it hides it very well</li>
            <li>Oh well, not the first $30 I&#x27;ve ever wasted.</li>
            <li>I did feel like i broke out the first few weeks</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too liquidy like some other BB creams and has more of a gel like texture, but not to the point that it feels thick.</li>
            <li>It has a floral scent which i was worried would break me out since i have extremely sensitive, dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, dry, acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li>It covers red scabby acne and dark under eye circles very well.</li>
            <li>The one complaint I have with the product is it doesn&#x27;t set quickly on my skin.</li>
            <li>I first tried this BB Cream last summer and immediately disliked it.  </li>

            <li> Great coverage &amp; my skin did not react.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the purchase and would buy again.</li>
            <li> It does provide great sun protection.  </li>
            <li> but I can not use it because it broke my up with huge pimples!!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> It is amazing!</li>
            <li> The coverage is amazing!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> It works amazing!</li>
            <li> When I take my makeup off my skin looks amazing!</li>
            <li> IT IS AMAZING!</li>
            <li> It is amazing!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!</li>
            <li> I love this product because of the excellent coverage it has.</li>
            <li> My complexion is really fair and it covers me great.</li>
            <li> Great product! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d suggest using a good primer or it&#x27;ll look a bit cakey, otherwise it has great coverage and is long-lasting.</li>
            <li> But i put a darker foundation on top and my skin looks so flawless.</li>
            <li> My favorite and the packaging is wonderful!</li>
            <li> I use this as my concealor and It blends perfectly and easily.</li>
            <li> once you apply your normal powder/mineral foundation/liquid foundation, it blends in perfectly &amp; leaves an utterly flawless complexion.</li>
            <li> AND it does not oxidize and disappear like most bb creams do which is very good for someone who needs coverage.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s also too bright for me.</li>
            <li> and you are good to go.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is fairly scented, I can see how that would be a problem for some people.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I will definately use this one up,however, coverage wise</li>
            <li> Good company and probably good product just not for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m oily skin type, and this BB cream is good for my skin.</li>
            <li> May help using a good cleanser.</li>
            <li> If you have light skin, this is perfect.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li> I loved this BB cream.</li>
            <li> Good product but not made for my skin.</li>
            <li> I loved the color and the coverage.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this at the beginning.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually really good.</li>
            <li> Full coverage and excellent packaging.</li>
            <li> This BB cream is amazing, full coverage, covers blemishes perfectly.</li>
            <li> Done side is its a very light shade!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased and will re-purchase.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s got good coverage, goes on nice, and stays put throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I have some hyperpigmentation but this stuff is so good there are days I can wear this on its own.</li>
            <li> The way it glides on to your face so smoothly and effortlessly it just makes your skin look so good!</li>
            <li> On top of that it came within a day!</li>
            <li> I love this BB cream, but the seller (seoulglamour) sent me a tube that was made in 2010!</li>
            <li> As for the product, I am in love!  </li>
            <li> Totally in love!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I thought it was the best BB cream I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> Love everything about this product!</li>

            <li> I LOVE this BB cream!</li>
            <li> LOVE the pump on this product!</li>
            <li> Lioele was the first BB cream that I tried, and I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m extraordinarily impressed.</li>
            <li> I love this  BBQ cream!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> makes your skin feel and look healthy!</li>
            <li> To be honest my skin has never looked better!</li>
            <li> I take very good care of my skin and rarely break out.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> Coverage on those are amazing.</li>
            <li> I find that it doesn&#x27;t look cakey at all, and it lasts all day and gives amazing coverage.</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> The coverage is absolutely amazing to me</li>
            <li> I was recommended by some amazing friends to use this.</li>
            <li> It has amazing coverage.</li>
            <li> I decided that it looked so amazing on her, great coverage, glowing and healthy looking skin, and more, that I had to buy it.</li>
            <li> It truly does have amazing coverage.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just amazing.  </li>
            <li> Its&#x27; an amazing product.</li>
            <li> I also liked that the product did not break me out at all.</li>
            <li> And after I put it on, my skin has a nice glow.</li>
            <li> The shipping  was timely and packaging nice.</li>
            <li> so I feel good putting it on in the morning, and the look of it gets better throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> so far so good and agree with all reviewers about the best packaging!</li>
            <li> I am good to go. :)</li>
            <li> , I thought it had really nice texture and coverage.</li>
            <li> but it gives me a nice dewy finish.</li>
            <li> but it really is a nice color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve Google the product and read many good review</li>
            <li> This BB cream settles in nicely</li>
            <li> &amp; I honestly would not use anything else as a primer/base.</li>
            <li> and now I am loving it.  </li>
            <li> Adjustable coverage, quick easy, flawless, not caked,</li>
            <li> What a great product and even better price, considering you get almost 50% more than most foundations.</li>
            <li> It is a very good product which really light your skin and have a fabulous coverage.</li>
            <li> This has a very strong perfume smell, and it gives me a headache when I wear it.</li>
            <li> Over all best BB Cream i have used so far!</li>
            <li> :) my skin has never looked better!</li>
            <li> Makes your face look flawless and natural!</li>
            <li> If you are fair, you should be fine.</li>
            <li> this BB cream honestly can be worn with just pressed powder on top to set it</li>
            <li> This product by far has the BEST coverage amongst BB creams, hence the 5th purchase.</li>
            <li> I have tried a couple of bb creams and this is by far one of the best ones out there.</li>
            <li> By far the best BB cream or foundation</li>
            <li> : so far so good!!</li>
            <li> It matches my skin perfectly, it leaves a finish that is so natural looking</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t sit on top of my pores and look cakey, and it blends in nicely to even out my skin tone without looking like</li>
            <li> and I feel like I got very lucky on my choice in purchasing Liole!</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t break me out despite having a strong fragrance!</li>
            <li> Great for pale skin with excellent coverage.</li>
            <li> I have very fair, sensitive, oily, acne-prone skin, and this is the first BB cream I can wear all day that stays on beautifully and doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s great for humid or hot weather.</li>
            <li> This is a good bb cream with full coverage.</li>
            <li> It went on very smoothly and blended easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As of now, there is just one VERY light color.</li>
            <li> Please please please keep in mind that I N E V E R review products on amazon, &amp; everything I&#x27;ve gotten from amazon has been really good, but if I&#x27;m giving it such accolades, I hope whoever reads this heeds my advice and buys this product for themselves, because it really will change your life, make up routine wise, &amp; happy wise.</li>
            <li> This bb cream seems to have more of a dewy finish, when compared to the Holika Holika Pore Clearing, which has a matte finish.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> and then a powder on top to finish my look.</li>
            <li> so I would never be able to wear it without something on top of it.  </li>
            <li> I really love this BB cream.</li>
            <li> I had watched my favorite You Tube Guru&#x27;s review on this product and thought I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> I love all of the benefits of BB Creams &amp; this one is no exception.</li>
            <li> I will def be ordering more when I run out ❤️</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on my makeup</li>
            <li> (maybe I need to set it better?).</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this.</li>
            <li> Authentic product</li>
            <li> i haven gotten many many compliments while wearing this.</li>
            <li> People would constantly tell me my skin was flawless (which it isn&#x27;t).</li>
            <li> i just loveeee loveeee love love loveeeeeeee this item i will repurchase again soon.</li>
            <li> Healthy glow without looking greasy.</li>
            <li> Makes you look like a porcelain doll, then you can just add bronzer on top.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been told I look much more rested.</li>
            <li> Love it :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this BB cream.  </li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> Love the coverage, blends well with my skin.</li>
            <li> this is my absolutely favorite.  </li>
            <li> It smells SO good, like a fresh(?) floral fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite face makeup ever.</li>
            <li> love the coverage</li>
            <li> my skin tone better.</li>
            <li> and I really love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried many bb creams.</li>
            <li> found out about this BB cream from my favorite YouTube beauty guru, Shaaanxo</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I guess I stick with Missha until I find something better.</li>
            <li> I did my research before buying this product, read the reviews, watched the videos and for the most part, the product is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I love Lioele triple the solution BB cream.</li>
            <li> So its okay i guess  if you dont have oily skin</li>
            <li> I love this product because its matches my skin tone</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s about it. :)</li>
            <li> I thought that was really cute and</li>
            <li> This Lioele BB cream is quite a bit more yellow/pink pigmented than SKIN79.</li>
            <li> so I figured that Triple the Solution would be even better with all the reviews I heard.</li>
            <li> She had to do a lot of extractions and remarked on how many pimples I had.</li>
            <li> I wish this weren&#x27;t the case because I love the coverage it gives.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product about 2 months ago and am absolutely in love.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only counting on reviews and blogs to tell me which is the best BB cream for oily people.</li>
            <li> and I can use this as foundation and dot more on to use as concealer.</li>
            <li> It does have more of a dewy finish.</li>
            <li> I AM IN LOVE.</li>
            <li> Totally love this because I&#x27;m so not a make-up person.  </li>
            <li> Will give it away if I still can&#x27;t get into it after a couple more attempts.</li>
            <li> got great results using a primer first, then this BB cream, a light covering of foundation, and then setting it with powder and a setting spray.</li>
            <li> I love the product it has great coverage, smells good, and doesn&#x27;t make me break out or stick to dry patches.</li>
            <li> I trusted my girl Shan and I bought a bottle of this BB cream and loved it the first two days I used it that I bought another one.</li>
            <li> The coverage is pretty good</li>
            <li> The coverage is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easily build able, which I like.</li>
            <li> , it has fabulous coverage, I love love the smell of this product</li>
            <li> It is perfect for dry skin types!</li>
            <li> Very full coverage.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to control, especially since you need the tiniest amount to get great coverage.</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t come close to my favorite foundation Estee Lauder Doublewear and Doublewear Light.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a great bb cream or foundation replacement for those that like a natural medium finish.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try on this product, but it ended up being too light for my medium skin tone.</li>
            <li> I think it looks very nice and natural.  </li>
            <li> Works great, even if you don&#x27;t have a very light complexion you can use bronzer afterwards to shadow and darken as necessary.</li>
            <li> I think this light-ish color may be due to the spf, which is wonderful to have.  </li>
            <li> Only disadvantage, it is for one skin color, fair!</li>
            <li> Excited to use it then :)</li>
            <li> is super easy!</li>
            <li> meaning this has lasted me almost 5.5 months - not bad!</li>
            <li> It blends easily and provides a lot of coverage for what it is.</li>
            <li> and I can easily wipe it away or move it all over the place throughout the day.</li>
            <li> This is so easy to put on and keep on all day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a decent BB cream and thought I&#x27;d try this one based on the good reviews.</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t strong at all...</li>
            <li> Yes, there is a slightly strong scent to it</li>
            <li> It has a strong perfumey scent which is why I gave it 4 stars (that and the color).  </li>
            <li> My favorite full coverage bb cream.</li>
            <li> This is HANDS DOWN the best foundation I have ever</li>
            <li> that bb cream was fine except i didnt like how its so ashy tone.</li>
            <li> so this didn&#x27;t prevent that, but with my foundation powder it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> one color that it comes in turns out looking a tiny bit greenish when you first put it on, but after it sets, it matches the skin tone perfectly!</li>
            <li> This product shipped so quickly within days!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re someone who needs a good but natural coverage, this product is for you!</li>
            <li> I did SOO much research upon purchasing this product, and I am so glad I did!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that I don&#x27;t break out with the SPF in this, and I&#x27;m happy to report that I have had no new acne since using this product!</li>
            <li> The fact that it has SPF30 is a huge plus for me, along with wrinkle</li>
            <li> in light beige.</li>
            <li> and it is a bit light</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s SO smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li> and it is borderline light in color for me.  </li>
            <li> It helps cover pores and imperfections, is really light weight, and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Received my product 3 weeks before estimated shipping date so that was fantastic.  </li>
            <li> It is skin toned, a light beige I would say.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I am happy with this product and plan to purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Even though I&#x27;m 27, I think using anti aging products is important.</li>
            <li> but it feels light on your skin.</li>
            <li> After another minute or so, I use a light foundation, and a light powder to finish.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I would say it has light to medium coverage, but with a couple dabs of concealer</li>
            <li> It spread well, and really made my skin feel nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so light and non greasy</li>
            <li> but it is sooooo light.</li>
            <li> fragrance is light and powdery, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> so this is too light on me.</li>
            <li> This product has light to medium coverage</li>
            <li> It almost looks light gray when it comes out</li>
            <li> Great coverage but a bit drying on my skin would definitely repurchase</li>
            <li> it is to light</li>
            <li> I wish there was something on the package that said made for light skin tones.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s too light for you, try mixing it with a darker foundation or even a darker powder or bronzer.</li>
            <li> I apply it with a buffing brush and it blends the best (using my fingers looked streaky and uneven).</li>
            <li> The only con to it is the staying power isn&#x27;t so great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cakey and it feels like moisturizer does, so its light.</li>
            <li> My skin looks smooth and glowing.  </li>
            <li> So I had seen a YouTuber using this product as her primer/concealer, if you will, &amp; after applying it, her face looked so supple and bright and alive</li>
            <li> Overall I am really happy with this BB Cream and will continue to use</li>
            <li> Coverage is fantastic and it&#x27;s not too cakey.</li>
            <li> Face feels moisturized all day &amp; so light.  </li>
            <li> I think this was too light for me..</li>
            <li> I have fair sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I am having a love affair with this BB Cream right now.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it I was moving out out of residence and hauling stuff in the GA heat in June!!</li>
            <li> I loveeeee this product so much!!!</li>
            <li> I would say that the whitening definitely works because my face has a very bright pretty complexion now.</li>
            <li> this has a nice pinkish neutral tone and looks very natural!</li>
            <li> Highly would recommend!! :)</li>
            <li> I had seen many reviews of it on Youtube and figured it would be the first for me to try.</li>
            <li> Definitely leans more towards the yellow side which is perfect for me.  </li>
            <li> so yes its worth it!</li>
            <li> I am so excited about this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a bit drying on its own without any moisturizer (even for me!)</li>
            <li> Comes in a squeezable pump bottle with a cap, and is travel friendly.</li>
            <li> I love this BB cream, this is probably the only BB cream/foundation that I am most satisfied with.</li>
            <li> product is totally worth it!</li>
            <li> but it has this light, sweet smell to it</li>
            <li> Wanted to love this product and did for the first couple weeks.</li>
            <li> when i put them side by side and compared them together i can tell liole triple solution had more color and was more natural to my skin when i put it on.</li>
            <li> is, I just apply and use a baby wipe to clean it off of my fingers.</li>
            <li> Lioele&#x27;s TTS is more &#x27;naturally&#x27; colored than those BB creams and provide better coverage for</li>
            <li> Although that may be a turn off to some, i actually love it because I have a lot of natural redness in my cheeks &amp; it does a fabulous job at covering it up!</li>
            <li> The coverage is great, I have dry skin</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s super light.</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast!!!</li>
            <li> I have used 3 other BB creams, all wonderful, and they have never broken me out</li>
            <li> So, to me the price is right!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the type of person that loves full coverage and</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite bb cream.</li>
            <li> So i tried it today and it was so nice and natural.</li>
            <li> I love this so much.</li>
            <li> This is, without a doubt, my absolute favorite cosmetic item in the world.</li>
            <li> (I use a full pump every day) and always keep one in my purse, cosmetic bag, and one</li>
            <li> and I needed a full coverage because of my acne</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s not at all true for me.</li>
            <li> Which is saying a lot for me because I am a full coverage girl.</li>
            <li> I recently tried laniege bb cushion and loved it.</li>
            <li> Nice coverage, natural tint.</li>
            <li> I just love it so much.</li>
            <li> It has fuller coverage to the point where I won&#x27;t really even need a concealer most days.</li>
            <li> I have used up to 2 pumps on days when I&#x27;m trying to get full coverage, and 1 pump on days where I just want a medium coverage.  </li>
            <li> I will mention that I have oily skin on my T-zone, so I did have to touch up twice throughout the day, but honestly that doesn&#x27;t bother me since the finish is so natural looking with this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just love how this finishes, I have yellow undertones, kind of fair, and dry skin.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for very light to medium skin tones and all skin types.</li>
            <li> This is seriously the best foundation I have/will ever use!</li>
            <li> I like the product and the quick shipping that I received from soulglamour both times I ordered from them.</li>
            <li> Also, I apply my with foundation with my fingers and this is not impossible to wash off of my fingers like Revlon Colorstay</li>
            <li> Overall, the bb cream is pretty nice!</li>
            <li> It is mildly moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I have mild acne from time to time and concequently I get discoloration  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery though.</li>
            <li> I love this BB cream and would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;m light to medium complexion</li>
            <li> The cream goes on smoothly and covers pretty well.</li>
            <li> This product held up, even though I got super hot and sweaty!</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite product to replace my foundation.</li>
            <li> It seems to be a very nice BB cream, but it was too dark for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> When I am my normal pale self it is a perfect match</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be back to re-stock for more!</li>
            <li> I excitedly opened the package applied it to my bare face and in my dimly lit room it looked good.</li>
            <li> This is only available in one color choice, the color looks somewhat darker when freshly pumped from the bottle, but when applied/blended in to the skin it&#x27;s very light.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little tacky after you first apply it but sets beautifully.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is smooth, moisturizing, and has very high coverage.</li>
            <li> I it would be much too light.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very creamy and goes on smooth but again not for me.</li>
            <li> It is really a bit too light for me.</li>
            <li> feels light on skin and covers very well.</li>
            <li> Though when I looked at my face in a brighter light, it was very cakey</li>
            <li> On it&#x27;s own, I find these bb creams aren&#x27;t that longer lasting, but again, it could be because of my skin type.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny and lasts forever.</li>
            <li> With that said, I want to make it clear to those who are hesitating this is very much authentic.</li>
            <li> I bought it for the 3 in 1 action, but the SPF is for sure expired.</li>
            <li> Hopefully it will not break out my sensitive skin, but I love the way it feels.</li>
            <li> Upon first application, it gives a medium to full coverage.</li>
            <li> can also be used on its own, if you don&#x27;t need the extra coverage.  </li>
            <li> Unlike the Garnier one, it is completely oil-free, It gives a healthy skin look and a matte finish.</li>
            <li> I had to use a darker powder and bronzer in order for it to look more natural.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth the price and money.</li>
            <li> Here in Hawaii, that&#x27;s not possible &amp; it would have been nice if I could get 1 shade darker.  </li>
            <li> i liked it and definitely evened out my skin tone</li>
            <li> After reading such great reviews on this and also hearing directly from a friend, I knew I had to try this.  </li>
            <li> am 100% dutch and very fair skinned with pink undertones, I was nervous that this (being only available in one shade) would not be right for me.  </li>
            <li> I do have some fine lines underneath my eyes already, and this BB cream does a decent job of not caking in the wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I love this bb cream, originally I used this under my regular makeup</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin then I highly recommend Lioele, because it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> right now I&#x27;m way to tan for it.</li>
            <li> So if you have oily skin, it might not be right for you.  </li>
            <li> love it and will continue to use it as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> Usually I buy make-up with words like &#x27;fair&#x27;, &#x27;porcelain&#x27;, &#x27;light&#x27;, etc.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive and oily skin, so I break out and irritate easily.</li>
            <li> I enjoy trying new foundations</li>
            <li> Absolute favorite makeup product by far.</li>
            <li> have sensitive, combination/oily skin, and so far I have had no luck with any kind of foundation.</li>
            <li> very well \\&quot;I&#x27;m super pale\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Other BB creams can be light coverage or too pale to the skin, but this Lioele one is the best.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this product because it actually does what it says and it is easy on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love this BB cream, on days where my skin is super dry or breaking out I can go without foundation and just use the BB cream.</li>
            <li> and I noticed that it held up pretty well if I applied a primer and set it with powder.</li>
            <li> I feel confident enough to just go out with this on my face.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s my first time purchasing it from amazon.</li>
            <li> For anyone interested in what I use for the summer time (for oily/combination skins), I use the holika holika aqua petit jelly in #01</li>
            <li> I wish it  came in unscented as it covers pretty well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have that &#x27;dewy&#x27; feeling at first</li>
            <li> Yes, it never fail me.</li>
            <li> I received my first tube at the beginning of October</li>
            <li> it really soon after I ordered which is a plus!</li>
            <li> , I think it&#x27;s one of the higher quality ones out there.</li>
            <li> this is my first time ever using a BB cream.  </li>
            <li> I also broke out the first week of using it which may have just been a coincidence.</li>
            <li> Will order again if their prices continue to stay consistently</li>
            <li> I will definitely order again :)</li>
            <li> First I will start by saying that shipping was extremely fast coming from another country!  </li>
            <li> It has not broken me out, which if you need to know if a product would break you out, my face is the one to test it out on!  </li>
            <li> first time using bb cream</li>
            <li> It has a pretty, dewy finish and doesn&#x27;t look too greasy/oily.</li>
            <li> find the product to have adequate coverage, particularly because the undertone is pinkish-yellowish and matches my skin well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my first bottle for over a year now</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t buy this again and have not used it after my first try.</li>
            <li> I purchased my second tube already, just to make sure I don&#x27;t have to go with out</li>
            <li> I have been experimenting with Korean makeup as of late, and this BB cream has a great finish.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever reviewed a product here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple BB cream before I came across this one reading a review about a different BB cream someone said they had love.</li>
            <li> This product really works!</li>
            <li> I sometimes use this as my primer, concealer and foundation and only top it off with powder then bronzer.</li>
            <li> (most consider me mixed</li>
            <li> It mixes well with my regular foundation to get a better color for me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;We will see if the summer weather makes me change my mind again ;)</li>
            <li> and I honestly really like it!</li>
            <li> I only wish this came in more colors</li>
            <li> I find that even though it is a bit thick, it blends easily and has a nice looking finish.  </li>
            <li> Lasting power isn&#x27;t that great, but then again, I have extremely oily skin, but overall I love it so much!</li>
            <li> :) I love how thick this BB cream is.</li>
            <li> However, this is the only one that I really liked and made my face look natural</li>
            <li> I have a lot of pink acne marks on my face and this does a great job of covering them without looking &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34;, although its full coverage its natural looking at the same time.</li>
            <li> Most days I just wear this by itself with a little bronzed but it also works amazing as a primer for my MAC studio fix fluid.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, and I live in tropical weather year round, so you can only imagine how my skin does with makeup, but this bb cream works GREAT and LASTS!</li>
            <li> It easily hides my red areas and most of my blemishes (not the super dark ones but good enough) and overall evens out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> It is the right shade for my skin (pale but warm under-toned so it would suit a lot of people).</li>
            <li> The color isn&#x27;t perfect, but it&#x27;s not as bad as I originally thought.  </li>
            <li> It has a thick consistency and feels like foundation because of the amazing coverage, but it&#x27;s not!</li>
            <li> However, this BB cream I find is thicker than most and a lot goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is the first BB cream I&#x27;ve tried, so I can&#x27;t really compare it to others.  </li>
            <li> Being 56 &amp; fair skinned, I have never had luck using foundations or powders to conceal the usual sun-damage spots and spidery veins on my face.</li>
            <li> Always a plus for easy and mess free application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am very lucky because this color matches my skin immensely well</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about this product it that it transfers from the skin easily; (ie.</li>
            <li> It makes you look more awake and youthful instead of looking dry and</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t dry it out more nor does has it caused me to break out with acne.</li>
            <li> This product is 100% amazing and coming from only purchasing high quality foundations, this is my go to item when wanting to use something similar to foundation but not want to have to keep purchasing it because it pretty much melts off because of the humidity!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s fine with me anyway because I don&#x27;t mind the extra sun protection.</li>
            <li> overall id say if you were wanting just night out cream its fine but not an all day</li>
            <li> I enjoy trying different brands off BB cream and previously had a Missha BB cream that I really liked.</li>
            <li> I really like the coverage it provides, but gave it only 4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t appear to come in any other shades, and this one is definitely too light for me--even though I have pretty fair skin.  </li>
            <li> I even used a little on my sister who has more pink undertones and it looked nice on her as well.</li>
            <li> Curious, and almost out of foundation, I decided to order this up and give it a try despite not being able to read much of anything on the packaging.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin looking real smooth but not something I would wear all day because I get oily and my makeup starts to rub off after a few hours of using this product under my skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this from the seller EmpireCosmeticDepot and the shipping was incredibly fast.</li>
            <li> and I become very greasy</li>
            <li> I wanted to give it a couple weeks before writing a review, as I have very breakout prone skin.</li>
            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t really fade, but I don&#x27;t notice it when it&#x27;s on my face.</li>
            <li> I really like it; but it has a bit of a grayish cast.</li>
            <li> It shipped really fast too.</li>
            <li> The Lioele BB cream is very moisturizing without making me greasy.</li>
            <li> The product was whatever really.</li>
            <li> But during the day it starts to look chalky and that really bothers me.</li>
            <li> If you have a pink-based skin tone, it might not match very well.  </li>
            <li> , REALLY oily skin and this products works very well.</li>
            <li> I am a combo skin with a very oily t-zone, so I put some powder or this</li>
            <li> I was absolutely blown</li>
            <li> really badly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> really well</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very oily as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Blends well: I was concerned that since this is one shade product, it wouldn&#x27;t blend very well, but I needn&#x27;t have worried.</li>
            <li> It also got a very &#x27;powdery&#x27; appearance even though I do not powder my makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve successfully accomplished this with over foundations like the TruBlend by Covergirl, but I can&#x27;t manage it with this product.</li>
            <li> Put it on after cleaning and moisturizing and you are ready to go, it lasts all day for me, in the cooler weather.  </li>
            <li> But I guess if you put your foundation over it it won&#x27;t matter as much.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast as well.</li>
            <li> I really like the consistency of this stuff.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very buildable.</li>
            <li> Product arrived in reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried this BB cream out for a few days now, but I can already say that I love it and am 100% satisfied with this</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely recommend for anybody that wants fuller coverage.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well.</li>
            <li> I bought Beyond the Solution on accident, but ended up really liking it</li>
            <li> this stuff ends up looking really powdery and cakey on me...</li>
            <li> I was hesistant, however, because I have really tan skin</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s a real plus.  </li>
            <li> It lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t sink into my wrinkles unless I really pack it on.  </li>
            <li> Since using it my skin has become so much smoother and healthier.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this, I just didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re very oily you probably don&#x27;t need a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It is quite thick and offers great coverage.  </li>
            <li> it came reaallyyy late and the consitency was good but it broke me out.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I caused it in some way or if it&#x27;s because of the temperature, but the cream eventually made my face more oily (and my face is already naturally oily, especially in the T-Zone).</li>
            <li> They go on so quickly and easily that I just can&#x27;t go back to regular foundation.</li>
            <li> It took a little while to come in, but it was packaged really tightly and even came with the most precious note from the seller!</li>
            <li> It is more fragrant than other bb&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first (like I am about most skin care products), but after seeing so many recommendations for this product I had to give it</li>
            <li> I like this a lot, but find I like it better when I mix a bit with other foundations.</li>
            <li> If you are usually shade 1 or 2 in most brands of foundation, give this a shot!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked years for a way to get full coverage,  and I&#x27;ve finally found a product that helps in that, so much.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much of a smell, and I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to scent.</li>
            <li> , I am hispanic and middle eastern nc 35 in mac if that helps and this BB cream blends good, I just use a bit of bronzer or blush and blend the cream down my neck.</li>
            <li> Right now I&#x27;m using it as my foundation, since it has been so hot, with my regular routine-</li>
            <li> The shade is slightly paler than my complexion (Asian), but it does make me look like I have good skin.  </li>
            <li> I am now 38 years old and notice that my skin is drier and looks even more dry when I apply foundation.</li>
            <li> This bb cream is medium coverage for me, and can be full if you apply a second layer.</li>
            <li> I guess I can put bronzer to make my face more dark.</li>
            <li> It did not look natural and seemed to accentuate my larger pores and fine lines.</li>
            <li> It would&#x27;ve been better if there was an option for other shades!</li>
            <li> But I will def be buying a new tube once this one runs out!</li>
            <li> With previous BB creams it feels as if the cream just sits on top my skin</li>
            <li> I would say it&#x27;s more on the matte side, but not super matte.  </li>
            <li> Semi decent coverage.  </li>
            <li> After trying many American bb creams that were just tinted moisturizers, I finally decided to infest in this bb cream.</li>
            <li> I was very nervous to order online since I am not incredibly light like most bb creams seem to be...</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m not black at all) &amp; the product only comes in one shade- light beige.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re wondering which bb cream to try, I highly recommend Lioele.</li>
            <li> This was highly recommended, and I understand why.  </li>
            <li> This is a high coverage bb cream and does well to conceal imperfections.</li>
            <li> I have used primers and high quality setting powders, but by the end of the day you can see my acne spots exposed.</li>
            <li> texture too heavy for a BB and very light in color.</li>
            <li> I think even if you are lighter or little darker than this color you should still be able to use it as your BB cream because you&#x27;re going to use foundation powder or it anyways.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of acne scars on my cheek areas and this has helped covered it completely!!</li>
            <li> i love how it literally covers my acne and spots but its a little on the greasy side.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Skin79&#x27;s Gold and Hot Pink as well as Missha&#x27;s Perfect Cover, and those were soooo grey and looked super weird on my skin.</li>
            <li> It covers very well but natural looking.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite everyday BB creams.</li>
            <li> The price fluctuates a lot (was $22 when I bought it; $14 5 days later), but it was still worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t like scented products</li>
            <li> I have normal skin too.</li>
            <li> It has the consistency of a nice foundation, not too thick and not too watery, it covered all my blemishes and face with one pump.</li>
            <li> Even with just one pump, this bb cream really blurs acne scars, dark circles and really evens out the complexion!!!</li>
            <li> I love that it has SPF too - one less step for me!  </li>
            <li> :) Oh and this BB cream does come in one shade, its very pale and I am obviously not Caucasian or super faired skin</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t figure out what was going on because I hadn&#x27;t changed my routine except for the new BB cream.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research on this new trend via Google.  </li>
            <li> i love it and its natural and it doesnt feel heavy.</li>
            <li> Every morning, I use a small-than-pea-sized amount and it&#x27;s good enough to provide coverage for my entire face and even slightly beyond my jawline.</li>
            <li> I put it on with a fluffy blending brush that kind of looks like a big eyeshadow brush.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few and this one offers more coverage and does not have a gray cast or tint to it.</li>
            <li> After I set it with powder, it has a very natural skin look.</li>
            <li> It does have good coverage, thicker formula &amp;#34;yogurt&amp;#34; which is a little more difficult to blend and may appear cakey if not blended well.  </li>
            <li> I tried my old foundation the other day (one for people with acne) and by the end of the day I had a huge pimple on my chin.</li>
            <li> It looks so natural too!</li>
            <li> This does it all - protects your skin from the sun, brightens, and makes your skin soft!</li>
            <li> This is my first Asian BB Cream</li>
            <li> This one has sheer-medium can maybe even build to full, but gotta be careful or it&#x27;ll look cakey.</li>
            <li> Sensitive with super oily in the T-zone and around nose with dry around corners of my lips.  </li>
            <li> I got a facial today and my aesthetician remarked on how my usual healthy and clear skin was very congested and clogged up!</li>
            <li> From freshly washed face, fully dry face, after moisturizer, without moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Be aware that delivery takes several weeks though, as it ships directly from China.</li>
            <li> I typically dab tiny dots all over my face to give a more even coverage with spreading out the product.</li>
            <li> It also is a little light for my skin tone  </li>
            <li> I am a fair skinned lady and this is just a -tad- too dark but nothing a little setting powder cant fix!     </li>
            <li> I am combo/oily for reference and it doesn&#x27;t accentuate my dry spots, or melt off my T zone like many other BB Creams.</li>
            <li> I use this with my combination dry skin (love it), and my mom uses it with her extremely oily skin (she LOVES it!).&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Really great coverage, a little goes a long way and this package last you for a really long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m white and fair-skinned, and it adjusts to my skin tone very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m prone to break outs, but so far no break outs for 2 weeks using it.</li>
            <li> I was even surprised that this seemed to match my skin tone</li>
            <li> but it does so in a natural looking way.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive acne prone skin</li>
            <li> With a primer and setting spray, this effect was reduced, but I was always too nervous to wear it for the long or hot days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Far away.</li>
            <li> , it looked totally natural on my skin, but I can&#x27;t comment on how it would work on darker skin tones.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d also suggest this to others with the same skin type since I think it&#x27;s very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing and just overall</li>
            <li> I once put on mineral veil (bare escentuals powder) afterwards, and it brought out every line and wrinkle on my face!!!  </li>
            <li> It does smell a lot better than Beyond the Solution, but when it comes to the formula and the final look, I prefer the plain Beyond the Solution.</li>
            <li> Color is too light and drab and can make a pale persob look washed out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Longevity: When I get a new product I always try it out on bare skin with no primer and no setting spray.</li>
            <li> My skin has some very slight redness, so how I use this product is by layering some light moisturizer, a primer, then after waiting 2 or 3 minutes, I use 1 to 1 and 1/2 pumps of the Lioele triple the solution cream.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a normal skin type (not oily, not dry).  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way :)</li>
            <li> It is a little too light for my skin but just barely.</li>
            <li> A very small amount, and a bit more than that.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think anything can beat this, especially with the decent pricing.</li>
            <li> It he tube definitely lasts and is pretty big</li>
            <li> On top of all that I found it hard to remove completely with regular face wash and it smelled powdery, like an old lady.</li>
            <li> There are no other colors!</li>
            <li> The reason why I don&#x27;t like this formula as much is because it doesn&#x27;t spread so easily and the finishing look reveals an unappealing look.</li>
            <li> It should cover your dark circles, but because I naturally have small bumps under my eyes if I use any kind of foundation or concealer under there</li>
            <li> recently found this in my drawer after running out of my normal foundation, I used it again</li>
            <li> It has a odd smell at first, but WHO CARES!</li>
            <li> but considering how far this traveled to get to me, wasn&#x27;t worth the return, when I used it a few times to see if it would grow on me.</li>
            <li> I noticed how thick it was when it doesn&#x27;t easily come off with soap and water from your fingers after you are done.  </li>
            <li> Also it looks super cakey and heavy while managing not to give any coverage at all</li>
            <li> The color does have a yellow base so probably not the best shade for everyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely pale, and it doesn&#x27;t really cover up that much on me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Irish, already very paled skin so this matches my skin tone pretty well when I&#x27;m glow in the dark white.</li>
            <li> It is a little pricy but for what you get it is worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I generally use this as after my moisturizer and primer.</li>
            <li> I use Bare Minerals along with this product</li>
            <li> it&#x27;ll just look way for visible, so I barely use any under my eyes.</li>
            <li> It covers well but be careful to not apply too much.</li>
            <li> I work 8-9 a day and so far it has lasted the entire day.</li>
            <li> if you have ever tried Skin79 BB Cream in the pink bottle, the finish is very similar to that in how pretty it looks however this one lasts longer on my t zone.  </li>
            <li> at first application, my face looks cakey but after a few hours, it blends in like my natural color.  </li>
            <li> This BB cream is light colored and thick.</li>
            <li> With every facial I get I never require too many extractions, she said the blackheads were big and thick.</li>
            <li> I apply it with a foundation brush which I hadn&#x27;t before, and this seems to blend it better and make it feel less heavy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m going to be able to use this long-term due to the smell.</li>
            <li> For all of the Caucasian women (or men) out there who have tried other Asian BB Creams that carry too much of a &amp;#34;gray&amp;#34; cast, this is one to try!  </li>
            <li> At first when I was using this, I notice that it transfers onto clothes as bit, but after coming back to it after using other foundations, I didn&#x27;t see it transfer</li>
            <li> It covers your flaws very well and doesn&#x27;t have that greyish look to it, like some of the other bb creams.</li>
            <li> stuff is extremely moisturizing and leaves you with a  very dewy-finish.  </li>
            <li> I rarely get more than a pimple and this was painful acne all over my chin.</li>
            <li> My only issues is that the product didn&#x27;t come with the case cover so it makes it hard to tell if it&#x27;s the original or just a replica of Lioele.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve completely replaced my high end foundations such as Kevyn Aucoin, Bobbi Brown, Dior and Chanel simply because I haven&#x27;t found a product other than Korean bb creams that will give me that &amp;</li>
            <li> And dark spots around my cheeks and using this product it hides it very well</li>
            <li> Oh well, not the first $30 I&#x27;ve ever wasted.</li>
            <li> I did feel like i broke out the first few weeks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too liquidy like some other BB creams and has more of a gel like texture, but not to the point that it feels thick.</li>
            <li> It has a floral scent which i was worried would break me out since i have extremely sensitive, dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, dry, acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li> It covers red scabby acne and dark under eye circles very well.</li>
            <li> The one complaint I have with the product is it doesn&#x27;t set quickly on my skin.</li>
            <li> I first tried this BB Cream last summer and immediately disliked it.  </li>
            <li> My skin is pale and this bb cream fits my color very well and brightened it up.</li>
            <li> I will be going back to my other products and back to my clear non irritated skin.</li>
            <li> My only problem with this is that even after waiting for it to oxidize, it&#x27;s still a tad too dark for me, but I&#x27;m super ghostly pale.</li>
            <li> Definitely thick in consistency, so a little goes a long way :)</li>
            <li> This stuff went on smoothly, didn&#x27;t look dry or cake-y since you only need a thin layer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long enough lasting and doesn&#x27;t look too cake-like (which some concealers can do).  </li>
            <li> I have combination skin, and it covered all of my trouble spots (sun damage, under eyes, and decent on acne).</li>
            <li> It is heavily perfumed and reeks to high heaven.</li>
            <li> Otherwise,  any dry flakes you may have are accentuated and spreading the product becomes more difficult if your skin isn&#x27;t moist.</li>
            <li> Not sure how it would look on someone who has really tan skin.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t last on my skin as long.</li>
            <li> it just shows how long a bottle can last!</li>
            <li> And most important of all, THIS hasn&#x27;t broken me out at all!!!!</li>
            <li> In fact it almost dries to a dry finish which I finish out with an HD finishing powder from Sephora (it&#x27;s white in color</li>
            <li> saw it once being used on a youtube video and was pretty shocked by how full coverage</li>
            <li> I know there are other Asian BB Creams that have multiple tints and no whitening, but I decided with this one because of the reviews I have seen.</li>
            <li> Nothing a little Q-tip action can&#x27;t handle.  </li>
            <li> It does have a smell, but since I&#x27;m not really sensitive to that, it&#x27;s not a problem for me.</li>
            <li> It is not grey color like other BB creams.</li>
            <li> But for some reason this 2nd tube is not really impressing me.</li>
            <li> This review is long overdue because I&#x27;ve been using Lioele&#x27;s Triple the Solution for over a year now</li>
            <li> look (as in a grey skin).</li>
            <li> grey cast</li>
            <li> I believe this would work well with all skin types as long as you apply a good base beforehand (exfoliate, moisturize, primer, etc).</li>
            <li> The BB Cream is not a true or close match to my Chinese American tan skin</li>
            <li> The other issue was after a couple of weeks, I started developing bumps and white heads.</li>
            <li> When it dries completely, it is not orangey on my pale white European skin at all</li>
            <li> and I have not gone tanning for a very long time</li>
            <li> , I found that it takes quite awhile for the product to dry.</li>
            <li> Then I let it dry and reapply where thicker coverage is needed.</li>
            <li> When I wash it off at the end of the day, my face isn&#x27;t too dry like it was getting with the Revlon Colorstay in the winter.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t do well for the dry areas at all.</li>
            <li> I did not notice any dry flaky skin at the end of the day and the coverage (which is buildable to medium) still held up throughout my work day.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have that same heavy feeling that a lot of american foundations have either.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Granted I&#x27;ve only tried this a few days, but I&#x27;m already thinking that I will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s too dark for me during the winter which is the only downside.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m NC20, and this is just a tiny bit too dark for me, and it made my skin look a bit muddy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit, it is just a tad too dark and is definitely yellow based, but if I just mix it with my too-light foundation, it&#x27;s perfect!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am Asian and my skin isn&#x27;t dark</li>
            <li> The color I got was a bit too dark for me, but I just added a bit of sunscreen and mixed it</li>
            <li> so I use a moisturizer and set it with loose powder in the T-zone.</li>
            <li> (I am fairly pale and this was barely lighter).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I use ALOT less than I used to because this product provides enough coverage for my skin.</li>
            <li> so no worries about a fake, and overall I will absolutely be repurchasing this when I run out!  </li>
            <li> Ideally, no one really notices I&#x27;ve got makeup on, which means I sheer my foundation out to look like skin.</li>
            <li> 2/5  update half a year later:  </li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing, it&#x27;s a thick cream and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> In the winter, the air becomes very dry</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> Product itself was too grey and pale for my relatively tan skin.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it that long to notice all the other things its supposed to do (anti-wrinkle, moisturizing, whitening)</li>
            <li> It can look a little white when taking pictures though.</li>
            <li> I wash and moisturize my skin and then use this product with a little foundation mixed in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try this for a while and finally broke down and bought it!</li>
            <li> Plus, you use such a small amount that the product lasts for a long time...</li>
            <li> Offers at least a medium coverage.</li>
            <li> Coverage was lighter than expected and the product made me oily.</li>
            <li> The product arrived as on the expected day.</li>
            <li> It was so uneven and red before!</li>
            <li> bought this product to compare it to SKIN79 pink BB cream.</li>
            <li> Ladies with darker tones, yes, it does go on pale (almost white) and it scares you, but</li>
            <li> Before I purchased this, I&#x27;ve read a comment saying this product is not authentic but the positive feedbacks outweighed the one negative comment</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried the bb cream long enough to know if it will cause a reaction later but after 3 days of trying the bb cream I have not yet broken out.</li>
            <li> Surely enough, AMAZINGzon had it &amp; for a little cheaper !</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, a little goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> A little bit of this stuff goes a long way.</li>
            <li> As some other reviews noted, it does have a perfumed smell--it doesn&#x27;t smell bad or too strong, but I&#x27;m not really looking for scent when I purchase a BB cream.</li>
            <li> Also, some of the other ones break me out,specifically skin79, but Lioele does not.</li>
            <li> and I have extreme redness on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely acne prone and everything under the sun breaks me out.  </li>
            <li> I have tried 3 other BB Cream before and...</li>
            <li> I would buy this again and recommend it to others, but I think I&#x27;ll try out some other bb creams before sticking to this one.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long waaay!</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin, and it caused this product to oxidize.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This BB cream works extremely well for me.</li>
            <li> SKIN79 on the other and asked my SO which side I was wearing makeup.</li>
            <li> and I only put on a small amount.</li>
            <li> No new acne whatsoever!!!</li>
            <li> Not bad terrible though, but not my first pick.</li>
            <li> The only downside I can see is that if you have tan or darker skin, it won&#x27;t work for you because it&#x27;s very pale in color.</li>
            <li> but could definitely tell i it was not the right shade which is too bad considering all the benefits.and no bronzer didn&#x27;t help</li>
            <li> It goes on with heavy coverage and looks extremely dewy, or wet, if you don&#x27;t set it with a powder.</li>
            <li> It looks so much better on my skin than any other base product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> a little lighter than expected</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely hard to sheer</li>
            <li> /&gt;To start off, I am a very pale Caucasian with slight yellow undertones.</li>
            <li> I add a bit of dark foundation to make it a closer match to my skin</li>
            <li> and my dark spots are disappearing.</li>
            <li> The ony negative thing I can say is that it is very white</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that it looks most flawless/evenly when applied with a makeup sponge and a cc cream base.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is the odd scent.</li>
            <li> I have very pale skin with very dark red acne scars</li>
            <li> but I did break out slightly after it&#x27;s usage.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To compare the two, I put Lioele on one half of my face, and</li>
            <li> I put one coat all over my face, let it set, and the go over my little dark spots or imperfections.</li>
            <li> Was way too dark for my pale skin.</li>
            <li> dry, or too thick</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this has been my go-to foundation for a little over a year</li>
            <li> and that is why I mix in a little foundation, to add some color.</li>
            <li> I still put a little blush on afterwards to add some color</li>
            <li> It cuts my morning routine down by like 20 minutes because you don&#x27;t need to moisturize &amp; prime your face seperately in preparation for foundation, as this acts likes your moisturizer, primer, &amp; foundation !</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for coverage but horrible with clogging pores and irritating skin.</li>
            <li> I have got a few others hooked on this also.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and it has already lasted me 2 months.</li>
            <li> Does have medium to heavy coverage</li>
            <li> /&gt;Coverage: This gives a medium to heavy coverage.</li>
            <li> This product provides medium to heavy coverage.</li>
            <li> You have no choice but to wear a medium to heavy coverage.</li>
            <li> you can stand the smell and like medium to heavy coverage, I would say go ahead and give this product a try.</li>
            <li> However, if heavily perfumed products bother you, stay away.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted $20.</li>
            <li> if you are like me and avoid heavy looking make-up, this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t heavy on my face</li>
            <li> and it felt too heavy.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely pale skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kinda pale so that&#x27;s saying something.</li>
            <li> have pale</li>
            <li> I want to start by saying I&#x27;m caucasian with pale skin tone</li>
            <li> or else I&#x27;d look too pale, but I was expecting to do that.  </li>
            <li> Except that this bb cream is so thick that I suggest using less than the pump distributes Or using a brush because you&#x27;ll still have bb cream on your hands even after you spread it throughout the face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I used it as a concealer, but it is a little bit thick.</li>
            <li> its not invisible at all, looks like a mask :/</li>
            <li> so Im not sure if it would work for all skin tones.  </li>
            <li> Makes one look paler than usual.</li>
            <li> I want to like it and with keep playing with it till I figure out how to apply it on my type of skin out if I don&#x27;t find a way than I won&#x27;t be repurchasing :/</li>
            <li> coverage than usual for a BB cream</li>
            <li> It spreads well when you put it on, but tends to fill in small wrinkles and pores giving a cakey</li>
            <li> However, very few products do.</li>
            <li> I kept adding extra coverage around my chin, and it kept getting worse and worse.</li>
            <li> Very pale but moisturizing cream colors all blemishes but wouldn&#x27;t recommend for darker skin tones or tans</li>
            <li> I did not find this BB cream made me appear like a ghost, but take into fact that I&#x27;m already very pale.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used BB Cream before (all Western type), but never found one that didn&#x27;t leave a greasy or dirty feeling on my face; nor did I find the coverage I was wanting.</li>
            <li> Too thick</li>
            <li> It can be time consuming to apply, but nothing ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical since amazon sometimes sells replicas from bags to clothings to make up even.</li>
            <li> It is not emphasized enough in these reviews; this product smells bad.</li>
            <li> The oxidation wasn&#x27;t bad, but it was definitely a different color.</li>
            <li> My skin just hates foundation for some reason, which is annoying because I do have dark circles and some uneven</li>
            <li> The solution is also very thick and doesn&#x27;t coat evenly on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use the secret pore balm  under this BB cream.  </li>
            <li> I am a 24-y/o Caucasian with a slightly yellow skin color base.</li>
            <li> Skin match might be a bit difficult, I am fair/medium</li>
            <li> ill keep looking for others.</li>
            <li> Not impressed, and will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Ill put some of this</li>
            <li> so this was a bit disappointing.</li>
            <li> The product that i got is so difficult to spread on the face that i literally hate it.</li>
            <li> If my breakouts are bad I still need to use concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait for it to come in because I&#x27;m really sick of the foundation I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li> Try it, you will not be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Slightly disappointed.</li>
            <li> so I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I also sometimes use this as a base under my foundation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always hated bb cream</li>
            <li> That God awful smell will stick with you until the end of time, even when you remove it.</li>
            <li> Then I tried it and it was horrible.  </li>
            <li> Terrible product.</li>
            <li> However this product gave me a rash and made me break out horribly.</li>
            <li> She had a lot of work to do today on me and it was awful.</li>
            <li> It has an insane amount of coverage.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> One of my favorite everyday BB creams.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product! I watched numerous YouTube videos and read multiple reviews on this product before I decided to buy. I use Bare Minerals along with this product but I use ALOT less than I used to because this product provides enough coverage for my skin. I have combination skin and this stuff really lasts without making me glow like a lightbulb after a few minutes. I swear when I tell you it lasts all day! The first time I tried it I was moving out out of residence and hauling stuff in the GA heat in June!! This product held up, even though I got super hot and sweaty! Plus, you use such a small amount that the product lasts for a long time... So, to me the price is right! I have already recommended it to my friends! Highly would recommend!! :)</li>
            <li> I love this BB cream and would highly recommend it.  If you use BB creams, give this one a try.</li>
            <li> I love this product because of the excellent coverage it has. This bb cream is medium coverage for me, and can be full if you apply a second layer. This bb cream seems to have more of a dewy finish, when compared to the Holika Holika Pore Clearing, which has a matte finish. I have oily/combination skin and I noticed that it held up pretty well if I applied a primer and set it with powder. On it&#x27;s own, I find these bb creams aren&#x27;t that longer lasting, but again, it could be because of my skin type. I have some acne scarring, and I noticed that with 3 weeks of consecutive use, they seem to be diminishing a bit. I also liked that the product did not break me out at all.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I&#x27;m the type of person that loves full coverage and this BB cream honestly can be worn with just pressed powder on top to set it and you are good to go.  I can&#x27;t get over the fact how awesome this product is. On top of that it came within a day! How awesome is that. I&#x27;ll be back to re-stock for more!</li>
            <li> the box was damaged when i got it but product okay</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite bb cream. I am fair skinned and it matches perfectly. I feel confident enough to just go out with this on my face. I have got a few others hooked on this also. It&#x27;s worth every penny and lasts forever. I will continue to use this!</li>
            <li> great coverage for acne, tho I work 10 hours shift and does cake at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I like using this as a substitute for my liquid foundation. Really great coverage, a little goes a long way and this package last you for a really long time. I use a primer to start then use this BB cream and then a powder on top to finish my look.</li>
            <li> So i tried it today and it was so nice and natural. I used to wear missha perfect cover. in light beige. that bb cream was fine except i didnt like how its so ashy tone. when i put them side by side and compared them together i can tell liole triple solution had more color and was more natural to my skin when i put it on. This is probably my BB cream for now i love it and its natural and it doesnt feel heavy. it covers up my redness and blemishes well.</li>
            <li> It just mixes with ur skin tone and no smell whatsoever perfect for every day to use it without anybody noticing it as well</li>
            <li> This will be my 5th tube of Lioele Triple the solution BB Cream and it&#x27;s my first time purchasing it from amazon. I was a little skeptical since amazon sometimes sells replicas from bags to clothings to make up even. Before I purchased this, I&#x27;ve read a comment saying this product is not authentic but the positive feedbacks outweighed the one negative comment so I went for it. With that said, I want to make it clear to those who are hesitating this is very much authentic. I&#x27;ve used 5 tubes already and this one is no different from every one of them. I bought this from the seller EmpireCosmeticDepot and the shipping was incredibly fast. A LOT faster than prettyandcute.com which is where I used to buy this from (takes 3-4 weeks).  Now going into the product itself... I believe this only comes in ONE color so I was told. I am NC 15-20 in MAC&#x27;s foundation and this BB blends in perfectly with my skin tone. This product by far has the BEST coverage amongst BB creams, hence the 5th purchase. HOWEVER (!!!), I have oily to combination skin and this product is only helpful in the winter time. As much as I want to use this all year round, it will slip and slide off my face in the summer and I become very greasy and I will start to break out. In the winter, the air becomes very dry and so this product helps my skin from flaking or drying out with it&#x27;s moisture qualities. I&#x27;ve completely replaced my high end foundations such as Kevyn Aucoin, Bobbi Brown, Dior and Chanel simply because I haven&#x27;t found a product other than Korean bb creams that will give me that &amp;#34;no make up make up&amp;#34; look.  For anyone interested in what I use for the summer time (for oily/combination skins), I use the holika holika aqua petit jelly in #01 and it&#x27;s perfection. It does not move on my face even in the hottest days of summer!!</li>
            <li> I am totally hooked on BB Creams. Skin79, is my fav, but this is a close second.&lt;br /&gt;Very creamy, awesome coverage, superior staying power, and great oil control.&lt;br /&gt;Its a bit on the yellow side. I add a bit of dark foundation to make it a closer match to my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;I have never had any breakouts or complications from using this. In fact it makes my skin look flawless.&lt;br /&gt;I would definetly buy this again!</li>
            <li> This has a very strong perfume smell, and it gives me a headache when I wear it. I wish it  came in unscented as it covers pretty well. It also is a little light for my skin tone  so I would never be able to wear it without something on top of it.  I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m going to be able to use this long-term due to the smell.</li>
            <li> I really love this BB cream. I wanted to give it a couple weeks before writing a review, as I have very breakout prone skin. I can now say this product does not cause me to breakout and it matches my skin perfectly! To be honest my skin has never looked better! I will def. be repurchasing this over and over.</li>
            <li> One pump is enough to cover the skin, then some extra to cover those problem spots.&lt;br /&gt;It is fairly scented, I can see how that would be a problem for some people.&lt;br /&gt;It does have that &#x27;dewy&#x27; feeling at first, I found that it takes quite awhile for the product to dry. I just apply a powder finish to help it settle. Doesn&#x27;t have that same heavy feeling that a lot of american foundations have either. I&#x27;ve found that it looks most flawless/evenly when applied with a makeup sponge and a cc cream base.</li>
            <li> its not invisible at all, looks like a mask :/</li>
            <li> I had watched my favorite You Tube Guru&#x27;s review on this product and thought I would give it a try. It is one color and it is a bit light so if you are a medium skin tone I it would be much too light.  Product blends well and it has very good coverage. I enjoy trying new foundations and I will definately use this one up,however, coverage wise, it doesn&#x27;t come close to my favorite foundation Estee Lauder Doublewear and Doublewear Light.  Coverage on those are amazing.</li>
            <li> This BB Cream lives up to all it&#x27;s hype, it&#x27;s got good coverage, goes on nice, and stays put throughout the day. It does have a smell, but since I&#x27;m not really sensitive to that, it&#x27;s not a problem for me. The smell doesn&#x27;t really fade, but I don&#x27;t notice it when it&#x27;s on my face. My only problem with this is that even after waiting for it to oxidize, it&#x27;s still a tad too dark for me, but I&#x27;m super ghostly pale.</li>
            <li> I love this so much. It&#x27;s moisturizing and has great coverage. I have a lot of redness to my skin and some post-acne marks, so I definitely appreciate the coverage. I generally use this as after my moisturizer and primer. I&#x27;ll use my fingers to apply it to my face one section at a time. I&#x27;ll then use a layer of foundation over it and set with a translucent powder. I find that it doesn&#x27;t look cakey at all, and it lasts all day and gives amazing coverage.</li>
            <li> Yes, it never fail me. Remember to put 1 layer only! Or else yo</li>
            <li> Oh my. I&#x27;ve struck gold! I&#x27;ve become a BIG fan of bb cream. They go on so quickly and easily that I just can&#x27;t go back to regular foundation. I can&#x27;t speak for American BB creams; I&#x27;ve only used the Korean ones. It&#x27;s where bb creams originated, and I&#x27;ve discovered that Korea makes great cosmetics!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using a different brand, but I received a sample of this with a different order. This stuff is heaven. It&#x27;s SO smooth and creamy. I&#x27;m white and fair-skinned, and it adjusts to my skin tone very well. One of the best things about it is that it contains hyaluronic acid, which fills in wrinkles and makes the skin look plump throughout the day. And after I put it on, my skin has a nice glow. I deal with breakouts, and I would say this has moderate coverage. If my breakouts are bad I still need to use concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After putting on facial lotion, I put 1 1/2 pumps on my fingertips and spread over forehead, nose, and chin. Then I begin to spread it out over my face and dab around my eyes. I received my first tube at the beginning of October and I started on my second tube today - meaning this has lasted me almost 5.5 months - not bad!</li>
            <li> This product shipped so quickly within days! This is my new favorite product to replace my foundation. It has excellent coverage, minimizes pores, and skin looks flawless. It definitely is sweatproof so it&#x27;s great for humid or hot weather. I will buy this product again from this seller.</li>
            <li> excellent produit  couvrante&lt;br /&gt;je recommande</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the missha BB cream in #23 &amp; it is a great match with SPF 42. I really like it; but it has a bit of a grayish cast. The lioele triple the solution bb cream is awesome b/c it doesn&#x27;t have a gray cast &amp; has a fuller coverage than the Missha. The only downfall of this product is the color. When I am my normal pale self it is a perfect match BUT if I have a tan I have to mix it with a darker foundation. I love all of the benefits of BB Creams &amp; this one is no exception. GREAT STUFF!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing product!! I will def be ordering more when I run out ❤️</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing. I don&#x27;t even have to use concealor with it. It shipped really fast too.</li>
            <li> It literally pains me to only give this 3 stars instead of 5. This BB cream is amazing, full coverage, covers blemishes perfectly. However, about a month ago I started breaking out on my chin. I rarely get more than a pimple and this was painful acne all over my chin. I couldn&#x27;t figure out what was going on because I hadn&#x27;t changed my routine except for the new BB cream. I have used 3 other BB creams, all wonderful, and they have never broken me out so I assumed that this BB cream wasn&#x27;t the problem. I kept adding extra coverage around my chin, and it kept getting worse and worse. I finally switched back to my Skinfood BB cream, and the acne immediately started fading. If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin then I highly recommend Lioele, because it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this BB Cream. It is the right shade for my skin (pale but warm under-toned so it would suit a lot of people). It blends easily and provides a lot of coverage for what it is. Only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell.&lt;br /&gt;Got it really soon after I ordered which is a plus!</li>
            <li> Great bb cream. I bought this two years ago and there&#x27;s still alot left.</li>
            <li> This BB cream is amazing!!  Try it, you will not be disappointed.  It is quite thick and offers great coverage.  Skin match might be a bit difficult, I am fair/medium and it is borderline light in color for me.  I think this light-ish color may be due to the spf, which is wonderful to have.  Beautiful product, great seller!</li>
            <li> This is, without a doubt, my absolute favorite cosmetic item in the world. I order it every 5 months or so (I use a full pump every day) and always keep one in my purse, cosmetic bag, and one as back up. I can&#x27;t go without this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;It is smooth, moisturizing, and has very high coverage. Perfect for my NC15-NC20 skin. If you&#x27;re thinking of trying it, PLEASE do! I get so many compliments on my makeup and this is the reason why.</li>
            <li> It does have good coverage, thicker formula &amp;#34;yogurt&amp;#34; which is a little more difficult to blend and may appear cakey if not blended well.  I noticed how thick it was when it doesn&#x27;t easily come off with soap and water from your fingers after you are done.  The shade is slightly paler than my complexion (Asian), but it does make me look like I have good skin.  It is more fragrant than other bb&#x27;s I&#x27;ve tried, but the fragrance goes away after 30 min.  I do have oily skin and find it melting/caking in some areas by the end of the day (maybe I need to set it better?). Overall, I do like the coverage, and like the fact it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, I have a lot of problems with bb&#x27;s and eye irritation</li>
            <li> I have tried a couple of bb creams and this is by far one of the best ones out there. It covers your flaws very well and doesn&#x27;t have that greyish look to it, like some of the other bb creams. Also, some of the other ones break me out,specifically skin79, but Lioele does not. If you&#x27;re wondering which bb cream to try, I highly recommend Lioele. You won&#x27;t regret it, I think it&#x27;s one of the higher quality ones out there.</li>
            <li> If you buy this product in-store it is twice the price, so I always buy online. My complexion is really fair and it covers me great. Only disadvantage, it is for one skin color, fair! There are no other colors!</li>
            <li> Good coverage - sometimes powdery  MUST MOISTURIZE AND PRIME BEFORE USING THIS!</li>
            <li> I loveeeee this product so much!!! From the packaging, to the smell, to the coverage it provides :) it is definitely not for all skin tone, unfortunately. This product is designed for fairer side of the skin color spectrum, keep that in mind before ordering. Definitely thick in consistency, so a little goes a long way :)</li>
            <li> this is my first time ever using a BB cream.  I just saw a lot of reviews on this specific one on YouTube and I needed a full coverage because of my acne and I have extreme redness on my cheeks.  I use the secret pore balm  under this BB cream.  The coverage is absolutely amazing to me it&#x27;s like I just put foundation on my face.  I am very lucky because this color matches my skin immensely well and so I stopped using liquid foundation and I just apply this cream some highlighter and powder.  I think even if you are lighter or little darker than this color you should still be able to use it as your BB cream because you&#x27;re going to use foundation powder or it anyways.</li>
            <li> Semi decent coverage.  Color is too light and drab and can make a pale persob look washed out.  It got greasy and did not set well.  I also broke out the first week of using it which may have just been a coincidence.</li>
            <li> I love this BB cream, but the seller (seoulglamour) sent me a tube that was made in 2010! I bought it for the 3 in 1 action, but the SPF is for sure expired. Slightly disappointed. Would buy this item again, but from a different seller. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about this product it that it transfers from the skin easily; (ie. blowing nose) literally takes everything off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller contacted me to ensure me that the product is not expired and doesn&#x27;t expire until 2014.  I like the product and the quick shipping that I received from soulglamour both times I ordered from them. Will order again if their prices continue to stay consistently competitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this every day since I bought it and will never use another BB cream. Great coverage and it didn&#x27;t break me out despite having a strong fragrance!</li>
            <li> I love this BB cream, on days where my skin is super dry or breaking out I can go without foundation and just use the BB cream. I have a lot of pink acne marks on my face and this does a great job of covering them without looking &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34;, although its full coverage its natural looking at the same time. I also sometimes use this as a base under my foundation. :) Oh and this BB cream does come in one shade, its very pale and I am obviously not Caucasian or super faired skin but somehow it blends well, I am hispanic and middle eastern nc 35 in mac if that helps and this BB cream blends good, I just use a bit of bronzer or blush and blend the cream down my neck.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this. I read the reviews and watched the youtube reviews. So I gave it  a try. Now I have tried it every which way. From freshly washed face, fully dry face, after moisturizer, without moisturizer. A very small amount, and a bit more than that. It did not go on the way I thought it should. It did not look natural and seemed to accentuate my larger pores and fine lines. On top of all that I found it hard to remove completely with regular face wash and it smelled powdery, like an old lady. The shipping  was timely and packaging nice. Good company and probably good product just not for me. Oh well, not the first $30 I&#x27;ve ever wasted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m oily skin type, and this BB cream is good for my skin. And I used it as a concealer, but it is a little bit thick.</li>
            <li> After trying many American bb creams that were just tinted moisturizers, I finally decided to infest in this bb cream. I had seen many reviews of it on Youtube and figured it would be the first for me to try. It is amazing! It helps cover pores and imperfections, is really light weight, and moisturizing. I would say that the whitening definitely works because my face has a very bright pretty complexion now. This cream is really great!</li>
            <li> Best BB cream ever. Very full coverage.  I am very fair skinned so Im not sure if it would work for all skin tones.  I did feel like i broke out the first few weeks but it stopped. I am purchasing another to keep on hand.</li>
            <li> Yes. No doubt buy it.&lt;br /&gt;Works like magic.&lt;br /&gt;Use it daily!</li>
            <li> Awesome coverage! I will definitely order again :)</li>
            <li> a little lighter than expected</li>
            <li> First I will start by saying that shipping was extremely fast coming from another country!  Received my product 3 weeks before estimated shipping date so that was fantastic.  As for the product, I am in love!  For all of the Caucasian women (or men) out there who have tried other Asian BB Creams that carry too much of a &amp;#34;gray&amp;#34; cast, this is one to try!  It is skin toned, a light beige I would say.  Definitely leans more towards the yellow side which is perfect for me.  I am an NC 20-25 in Mac terms if this helps.  Has a beautiful finish, not matte but not overly dewy either.  It&#x27;s a little tacky after you first apply it but sets beautifully.  It has not broken me out, which if you need to know if a product would break you out, my face is the one to test it out on!  I&#x27;m extremely acne prone and everything under the sun breaks me out.  It contains wonderful ingredients so I feel good putting it on in the morning, and the look of it gets better throughout the day.  I am combo/oily for reference and it doesn&#x27;t accentuate my dry spots, or melt off my T zone like many other BB Creams. if you have ever tried Skin79 BB Cream in the pink bottle, the finish is very similar to that in how pretty it looks however this one lasts longer on my t zone.  Authentic product so no worries about a fake, and overall I will absolutely be repurchasing this when I run out!  A+++++</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00356UHT0 Lioele Triple the Solution BB Cream (SPF30/PA++)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says that this would have a dewy finish and that it speads like a yogurt on the tube but that&#x27;s not at all true for me. The product that i got is so difficult to spread on the face that i literally hate it. The spread is uneven and very dry.&lt;br /&gt;I have to combine this with some moisturizer or liquid foundation to make it spread evenly.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research on this new trend via Google.  This was highly recommended, and I understand why.  It does put a creamy layer of coverage on your skin. I have combination skin, and it covered all of my trouble spots (sun damage, under eyes, and decent on acne). I did not use a layer of powder over the cream, but it would be helpful to prevent some oil.  Wear time is 4-5 hours without any touchups.  Hopefully it will not break out my sensitive skin, but I love the way it feels.</li>
            <li> I was recommended by some amazing friends to use this. I will never go back to anything else. I LOVE this product because it actually does what it says and it is easy on my sensitive skin. I have rosecea</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product. My only issues is that the product didn&#x27;t come with the case cover so it makes it hard to tell if it&#x27;s the original or just a replica of Lioele.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always hated bb cream but i have been using this one for awhile! Totally in love! The coverage is amazing! Haven&#x27;t used it that long to notice all the other things its supposed to do (anti-wrinkle, moisturizing, whitening) but the coverage is good! I have very dry skin and this didn&#x27;t make my skin look flaky or anything! i haven gotten many many compliments while wearing this. People would constantly tell me my skin was flawless (which it isn&#x27;t). Over all best BB Cream i have used so far!</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd tube. The first time I used it, I thought it was the best BB cream I have ever used. The color and consistency were great for combination skin. It is not grey color like other BB creams. But for some reason this 2nd tube is not really impressing me.</li>
            <li> I am having a love affair with this BB Cream right now. I have some hyperpigmentation but this stuff is so good there are days I can wear this on its own. Which is saying a lot for me because I am a full coverage girl. The one complaint I have with the product is it doesn&#x27;t set quickly on my skin. However, very few products do. Overall, I am happy with this product and plan to purchase it again.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m very impressed. It covers red scabby acne and dark under eye circles very well. It brightens and evens well, too.  Upon first application, it gives a medium to full coverage. Then I let it dry and reapply where thicker coverage is needed. When it dries completely, it is not orangey on my pale white European skin at all (I got the lightest shade they have). It also dries matte with no oily finish. In fact it almost dries to a dry finish which I finish out with an HD finishing powder from Sephora (it&#x27;s white in color but for all skin shades). I don&#x27;t get oily throughout the day with this product either, and I also use an anti aging serum and moisturizer underneath the BB cream, too (L&#x27;Occitane Divine to be specific). Even though I&#x27;m 27, I think using anti aging products is important. I do have some fine lines underneath my eyes already, and this BB cream does a decent job of not caking in the wrinkles. I&#x27;m glad that I don&#x27;t break out with the SPF in this, and I&#x27;m happy to report that I have had no new acne since using this product! Also, I got this from a supplier in Texas, so it doesn&#x27;t take a month for my stuff to be delivered!  That&#x27;s a big plus! Happy happy happy!</li>
            <li> i just loveeee loveeee love love loveeeeeeee this item i will repurchase again soon. it lasted me about 4months and i use make up on a daily basis. so yes its worth it!</li>
            <li> Covers well. Offers at least a medium coverage. Best to blend it in with fingers. Healthy glow without looking greasy. I&#x27;m prone to break outs, but so far no break outs for 2 weeks using it. May help using a good cleanser. I&#x27;m NC15 in MAC. Sensitive with super oily in the T-zone and around nose with dry around corners of my lips.  I do blot about twice in 12hrs. I didn&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;beyond the solution&amp;#34;. But 5 stars for the &amp;#34;triple the solution&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is my go to foundation now. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 9 months now. I was previously using Revlon Colorstay because I like a heavy coverage, however it was clinging to my dry patches and making my face more dry. The Lioele BB cream is very moisturizing without making me greasy. It goes on with heavy coverage and looks extremely dewy, or wet, if you don&#x27;t set it with a powder. After I set it with powder, it has a very natural skin look. When I wash it off at the end of the day, my face isn&#x27;t too dry like it was getting with the Revlon Colorstay in the winter. Also, I apply my with foundation with my fingers and this is not impossible to wash off of my fingers like Revlon Colorstay is, I just apply and use a baby wipe to clean it off of my fingers.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t last on my skin as long. i&#x27;m current using misha and i think i like misha over this. it&#x27;s also too bright for me. ill keep looking for others.</li>
            <li> Excellent product ! I recoment it! Its like pancake foundation but it feels light on your skin. Controls the oil and shine. I was very happy with this product! from 1-9 I give 9.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product! My skin has some very slight redness, so how I use this product is by layering some light moisturizer, a primer, then after waiting 2 or 3 minutes, I use 1 to 1 and 1/2 pumps of the Lioele triple the solution cream. After another minute or so, I use a light foundation, and a light powder to finish.&lt;br /&gt;This can also be used on its own, if you don&#x27;t need the extra coverage.  I&#x27;ve looked years for a way to get full coverage,  and I&#x27;ve finally found a product that helps in that, so much.</li>
            <li> My favorite full coverage bb cream. I am a nc25 from Mac and it matches me well.</li>
            <li> Love everything about this product!</li>
            <li> first time using bb cream and I feel like I got very lucky on my choice in purchasing Liole! I was very nervous to order online since I am not incredibly light like most bb creams seem to be... this has a nice pinkish neutral tone and looks very natural! so far so good and agree with all reviewers about the best packaging!</li>
            <li> This will be perfect shade for me in winter right now I&#x27;m way to tan for it. Excited to use it then :)</li>
            <li> I saw this in a youtube video for covering up acne and acne scars- it looked great in the video. However, the product does not do that. I&#x27;m extremely pale, and it doesn&#x27;t really cover up that much on me. Not impressed, and will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I have very fair, sensitive, oily, acne-prone skin, and this is the first BB cream I can wear all day that stays on beautifully and doesn&#x27;t make me break out. I am so excited about this product. The price fluctuates a lot (was $22 when I bought it; $14 5 days later), but it was still worth every penny. I would say it has light to medium coverage, but with a couple dabs of concealer I am good to go. :)</li>
            <li> By far the best BB cream or foundation I&#x27;ve ever used! It has amazing coverage. It covers my severe acne and scarring with just one pump. I have extremely pale skin and it&#x27;s too dark for me during the winter which is the only downside. I just ordered my second bottle. It looks so much better on my skin than any other base product I&#x27;ve used. I can&#x27;t wait for it to come in because I&#x27;m really sick of the foundation I&#x27;ve been using. I don&#x27;t think anything can beat this, especially with the decent pricing.</li>
            <li> Amazing!! If you have light skin, this is perfect. Makes you look like a porcelain doll, then you can just add bronzer on top. Hides flaws and moisturizes too.  Adjustable coverage, quick easy, flawless, not caked, no make-up look and it actually improves your skin too.</li>
            <li> This product works wonders, I almost feel as if it decreases my acne when used! It looks so natural too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m NC20, and this is just a tiny bit too dark for me, and it made my skin look a bit muddy. So, I would think if you are NC25-30 it might be perfect for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I thought it had really nice texture and coverage. It spread well, and really made my skin feel nice. I didn&#x27;t notice much of a smell, and I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a decent BB cream and thought I&#x27;d try this one based on the good reviews. I love it. Just enough coverage without looking made up. Only complaint is the odd scent. I&#x27;ve grown used to it after using the product for 2 weeks. It does even out my skin tone and I&#x27;ve been told I look much more rested.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!!! Love it :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this BB cream.  Other BB creams can be light coverage or too pale to the skin, but this Lioele one is the best.  I have a lot of acne scars on my cheek areas and this has helped covered it completely!! It&#x27;s so light and non greasy I will so buy it again! Plus its SPF 30 which will help diminish the discoloration.  LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;Check out my review/swatches on this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> The product was whatever really. Coverage was lighter than expected and the product made me oily.</li>
            <li> Covers my flaws but a bit too white. I have oily skin so this didn&#x27;t prevent that, but with my foundation powder it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Makes one look paler than usual. It should oxidize to skin tone, but definitely on the lighter side. Which is a change if you want. Very good coverage, but I did break out slightly after it&#x27;s usage.</li>
            <li> Love the coverage, blends well with my skin. But during the day it starts to look chalky and that really bothers me. I want to like it and with keep playing with it till I figure out how to apply it on my type of skin out if I don&#x27;t find a way than I won&#x27;t be repurchasing :/</li>
            <li> I use this for base,I got combination skin type and does an excellent job,I&#x27;m very happy with the product</li>
            <li> It is a very good product which really light your skin and have a fabulous coverage. I will keep using it.</li>
            <li> The shade of this BB Cream match my face perfectly.  I have tried 3 other BB Cream before and...this is my absolutely favorite.  This bb cream is yellow-based..great for asian skin tone.  If you have a pink-based skin tone, it might not match very well.  The finish is not matte but not too shiny either. I think it looks very nice and natural.  I&#x27;ve been using laura mercier tinted moisturizer..but I will def give this BB Cream a try from now on.</li>
            <li> Best BB Cream I have ever used! Will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> Very pale but moisturizing cream colors all blemishes but wouldn&#x27;t recommend for darker skin tones or tans</li>
            <li> Overall, the bb cream is pretty nice! This is a high coverage bb cream and does well to conceal imperfections. It has a pretty, dewy finish and doesn&#x27;t look too greasy/oily. It smells SO good, like a fresh(?) floral fragrance. My skin is pale and this bb cream fits my color very well and brightened it up. It is mildly moisturizing. After about 7 hours of wearing it, my skin still looked dewy and my acne was concealed. I don&#x27;t know how it would be on oily skin because my skin is on the dry/sensitive side.The only downside to this is that you have to blend A LOT. I&#x27;m talking a s*** ton of blending lol. It can be time consuming to apply, but nothing ridiculous. I would buy this again and recommend it to others, but I think I&#x27;ll try out some other bb creams before sticking to this one.</li>
            <li> The product arrived as on the expected day. However, the package label of the product threw me off. It said the manufacturing date was march 25, 2014 but the expiration date was march 24, 2014. It probably was just a typo but I&#x27;m not taking the risk. Plus it&#x27;s already December of 2014 and it&#x27;s close to the expiration date anyway. So, I decided to return it and just ordered the same product from another seller.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite face makeup ever. Will definitely buy again and again. Great coverage and texture.</li>
            <li> Will continue to buy, love this concealer!</li>
            <li> really great BB cream, esp if you need a bit extra coverage.</li>
            <li> love the coverage but it is sooooo light. I&#x27;m kinda pale so that&#x27;s saying something. I know that&#x27;s the style in Korea but I&#x27;m going to have to go with a bb cream the matches my skin tone better. I recently tried laniege bb cushion and loved it.</li>
            <li> This review is long overdue because I&#x27;ve been using Lioele&#x27;s Triple the Solution for over a year now and I really love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, a little goes a LONG way. Every morning, I use a small-than-pea-sized amount and it&#x27;s good enough to provide coverage for my entire face and even slightly beyond my jawline. I typically dab tiny dots all over my face to give a more even coverage with spreading out the product. I dab LIGHTLY extra product or follow with concealer for extra coverage on hyperpigmentation. Try not to do a second coverage because you WILL look cakey. Follow-up with finishing powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have pale, REALLY oily skin and this products works very well. It&#x27;s definitely a bit drying on its own without any moisturizer (even for me!) so I recommend using a moisturizing sunscreen under this (I use La Roche Posay&#x27;s SPF 15). Otherwise,  any dry flakes you may have are accentuated and spreading the product becomes more difficult if your skin isn&#x27;t moist. SIDENOTE: ALWAYS wear sunscreen because your foundation/BB cream will not provide enough sun protection!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the product to have adequate coverage, particularly because the undertone is pinkish-yellowish and matches my skin well. I&#x27;ve tried Skin79&#x27;s Gold and Hot Pink as well as Missha&#x27;s Perfect Cover, and those were soooo grey and looked super weird on my skin. Lioele&#x27;s TTS is more &#x27;naturally&#x27; colored than those BB creams and provide better coverage for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is light and powdery, not overpowering. Comes in a squeezable pump bottle with a cap, and is travel friendly. I&#x27;ve had my first bottle for over a year now and there&#x27;s still a bit left, so it just shows how long a bottle can last!</li>
            <li> Nice coverage, natural tint.</li>
            <li> I loveee it! Its great! Very good coveragee! A little goes a long waaay! Done side is its a very light shade! NC 15 range ! Best bb creaam ever!</li>
            <li> I love this BB cream, this is probably the only BB cream/foundation that I am most satisfied with. Others I&#x27;ve tried are to transferable, make my face look too shiny/oily, are not waterproof/sweatproof (I don&#x27;t want my face to melt off), and do not have enough coverage. This one has sheer-medium can maybe even build to full, but gotta be careful or it&#x27;ll look cakey. I am a combo skin with a very oily t-zone, so I put some powder or this and I&#x27;m good to go. At first when I was using this, I notice that it transfers onto clothes as bit, but after coming back to it after using other foundations, I didn&#x27;t see it transfer (I check people&#x27;s clothes after I hug them LOL)! It easily hides my red areas and most of my blemishes (not the super dark ones but good enough) and overall evens out my skin tone. Has a bit of a smell, but I like it. It should cover your dark circles, but because I naturally have small bumps under my eyes if I use any kind of foundation or concealer under there it&#x27;ll just look way for visible, so I barely use any under my eyes. Doesn&#x27;t break me out. Basically, I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this!!! It works amazing! I have oily skin. But this doesn&#x27;t seem to bother it. I use two pumps. When I take my makeup off my skin looks amazing! It was so uneven and red before! I follow with Mac studio fix powder and my skin looks air brushed!!! Will buy again!!! Shipping was super fast!!!</li>
            <li> This is HANDS DOWN the best foundation I have ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw it once being used on a youtube video and was pretty shocked by how full coverage it looked for being called a BB cream.  Curious, and almost out of foundation, I decided to order this up and give it a try despite not being able to read much of anything on the packaging.  Let me just say, I was absolutely blown away!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 100% dutch and very fair skinned with pink undertones, I was nervous that this (being only available in one shade) would not be right for me.  I&#x27;ll admit, it is just a tad too dark and is definitely yellow based, but if I just mix it with my too-light foundation, it&#x27;s perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is extremely moisturizing and leaves you with a  very dewy-finish.  So if you have oily skin, it might not be right for you.  It&#x27;s great for the winter time skin!  It makes you look more awake and youthful instead of looking dry and cakey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this has been my go-to foundation for a little over a year and I don&#x27;t plan on buying anything different any time soon.  Give it a try!!</li>
            <li> I loved this BB cream. Its the second one Ive tried and Im stickin to it. I put one coat all over my face, let it set, and the go over my little dark spots or imperfections. I use this as my concealor and It blends perfectly and easily. I have mild acne from time to time and concequently I get discoloration  but this BB cream covers it all up. I set it with la mer powder and my face looks flawless without looking cakey. It can look a little white when taking pictures though. Havent seen any whitening yet. I doubt itll happen but I dont care. this makeup is a lifesaver.</li>
            <li> I got this product because the BB cream that I&#x27;ve bought in America made my skin break out really badly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is pasty and made me look like a ghost. I am Asian and my skin isn&#x27;t dark and I have not gone tanning for a very long time so this was a bit disappointing. You can see the obvious color difference between my neck and face. The solution is also very thick and doesn&#x27;t coat evenly on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again and have not used it after my first try.</li>
            <li> I have tried many bb creams. Garnier, Smashbox, TooFaced... But NONE of them compare to the Lioele Triple the Solution BB Cream!&lt;br /&gt;I found out about this BB cream from my favorite YouTube beauty guru, Shaaanxo (check her out!!). She uses it all the time under her foundation as a primer or alone. I decided that it looked so amazing on her, great coverage, glowing and healthy looking skin, and more, that I had to buy it. I trusted my girl Shan and I bought a bottle of this BB cream and loved it the first two days I used it that I bought another one. IT IS AMAZING! Unlike the Garnier one, it is completely oil-free, It gives a healthy skin look and a matte finish. I use this with my combination dry skin (love it), and my mom uses it with her extremely oily skin (she LOVES it!).&lt;br /&gt;The one color that it comes in turns out looking a tiny bit greenish when you first put it on, but after it sets, it matches the skin tone perfectly! I highly recommend it for very light to medium skin tones and all skin types.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a god sent! I kid you not this stuff is my holy grail in my makeup routine. The way it glides on to your face so smoothly and effortlessly it just makes your skin look so good! I am a fair skinned lady and this is just a -tad- too dark but nothing a little setting powder cant fix!     I use this everyday and it has already lasted me 2 months. But I will def be buying a new tube once this one runs out!</li>
            <li> This is seriously the best foundation I have/will ever use! I don&#x27;t think I will ever use anything else again. This does it all - protects your skin from the sun, brightens, and makes your skin soft! I was so impressed that the color matches my light/olive skin perfectly :) my skin has never looked better! I use it once (sometimes twice) a day, and it&#x27;s almost been three months on the same tube! A little bit goes a long way :) I purchased my second tube already, just to make sure I don&#x27;t have to go with out it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is totally worth it!</li>
            <li> Works great, even if you don&#x27;t have a very light complexion you can use bronzer afterwards to shadow and darken as necessary. Hides just about everything and evens skin tone.</li>
            <li> It the best bb cream ever... all i have to do is set it with a powder and it last all day!!!!</li>
            <li> I saw this product used in a YouTube video and it looked like it had great coverage so I decided to give it a try. It truly does have amazing coverage. As some other reviews noted, it does have a perfumed smell--it doesn&#x27;t smell bad or too strong, but I&#x27;m not really looking for scent when I purchase a BB cream. I was even surprised that this seemed to match my skin tone really well (I am fairly pale and this was barely lighter).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got great results using a primer first, then this BB cream, a light covering of foundation, and then setting it with powder and a setting spray.</li>
            <li> at first application, my face looks cakey but after a few hours, it blends in like my natural color.  everyone thinks I only have powder.  I will definitely buy this again</li>
            <li> Pro: Really good for someone (like me) with lots of imperfections that needs covering! Even with just one pump, this bb cream really blurs acne scars, dark circles and really evens out the complexion!!! Compared to Skin79 bb creams, the Lioele bb cream does NOT give you the &amp;#34;dead&amp;#34; look (as in a grey skin). AND it does not oxidize and disappear like most bb creams do which is very good for someone who needs coverage. And most important of all, THIS hasn&#x27;t broken me out at all!!!! No new acne whatsoever!!! And this bb cream also makes your pores disappear in an instant!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: so far so good!! Except that this bb cream is so thick that I suggest using less than the pump distributes Or using a brush because you&#x27;ll still have bb cream on your hands even after you spread it throughout the face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SOOOOO!!!!!! If you&#x27;re someone who needs a good but natural coverage, this product is for you! AND USE A GOOD CLEANSER WHEN REMOVING MAKEUP!!! I use the Skin79 bb cleanser!!!!</li>
            <li> Good product but not made for my skin. It&#x27;s very creamy and goes on smooth but again not for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try this for a while and finally broke down and bought it! I LOVE this BB cream! I have a lot of scarring from&lt;br /&gt;Acne and I&#x27;m very oily as well. This covers EVERYTHING with just one pump. If I wear a Matte primer underneath I don&#x27;t even have to use setting powder. It&#x27;s also evened out my skin tone in the 3 weeks I&#x27;ve had it.</li>
            <li> I have been experimenting with Korean makeup as of late, and this BB cream has a great finish. I&#x27;m NW 25 in MAC foundation, and this matches my skin perfectly. Love it.</li>
            <li> Makes your face look flawless and natural! Does have medium to heavy coverage but it does so in a natural looking way.</li>
            <li> medium consistency,&lt;br /&gt;no grey cast&lt;br /&gt;blends great&lt;br /&gt;moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;Not dry, or too thick&lt;br /&gt;More coverage than usual for a BB cream</li>
            <li> This BB cream is light colored and thick. It covers well but be careful to not apply too much. LOVE the pump on this product! It is very easy to control, especially since you need the tiniest amount to get great coverage. It has a floral scent which i was worried would break me out since i have extremely sensitive, dry skin. Haven&#x27;t tried the bb cream long enough to know if it will cause a reaction later but after 3 days of trying the bb cream I have not yet broken out. It is a little pricy but for what you get it is worth the investment. Will update if I have a reaction to the product in weeks to come.</li>
            <li> It seems to be a very nice BB cream, but it was too dark for my skin tone. It would&#x27;ve been better if there was an option for other shades!</li>
            <li> This is a good bb cream with full coverage. I do not like the scent. I use this when I am in a rush and do not have enough time to apply foundation.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product after the youtube video reviews but unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work for me. First, I&#x27;m light to medium complexion so this is too light on me. I had to use a darker powder and bronzer in order for it to look more natural. If you are fair, you should be fine. The other issue was after a couple of weeks, I started developing bumps and white heads. I have sensitive acne prone skin and it just didn&#x27;t agree with this BB Cream. I guess I stick with Missha until I find something better.</li>
            <li> Lioele was the first BB cream that I tried, and I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m extraordinarily impressed. I did my research before buying this product, read the reviews, watched the videos and for the most part, the product is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blends well: I was concerned that since this is one shade product, it wouldn&#x27;t blend very well, but I needn&#x27;t have worried. It went on very smoothly and blended easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coverage: This gives a medium to heavy coverage. If you&#x27;ve got it, this will probably cover it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging: Even though this is a squeeze tube, there is a pump. Always a plus for easy and mess free application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell.&lt;br /&gt;The smell.&lt;br /&gt;The smell.&lt;br /&gt;The smell: It is not emphasized enough in these reviews; this product smells bad. It is heavily perfumed and reeks to high heaven. I&#x27;ve used perfumed products before, but the initial smell always fades after a while. Not this product. That God awful smell will stick with you until the end of time, even when you remove it. The smell is the reason I give this product three stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Longevity: When I get a new product I always try it out on bare skin with no primer and no setting spray. This did not hold up well. I have extremely oily skin, and it caused this product to oxidize. The oxidation wasn&#x27;t bad, but it was definitely a different color. It also got a very &#x27;powdery&#x27; appearance even though I do not powder my makeup. With a primer and setting spray, this effect was reduced, but I was always too nervous to wear it for the long or hot days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Coverage: I know I put this as a pro, but it&#x27;s a con too. This product provides medium to heavy coverage. I prefer my makeup to look as nude as possible. Ideally, no one really notices I&#x27;ve got makeup on, which means I sheer my foundation out to look like skin. I&#x27;ve successfully accomplished this with over foundations like the TruBlend by Covergirl, but I can&#x27;t manage it with this product. You have no choice but to wear a medium to heavy coverage. It&#x27;s extremely hard to sheer out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can stand the smell and like medium to heavy coverage, I would say go ahead and give this product a try. However, if heavily perfumed products bother you, stay away. Far away.</li>
            <li> This BB cream is very good to conceal and correct imperfections! I like it but I can not use it because it broke my up with huge pimples!!!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever reviewed a product here on Amazon.  I want to start by saying I&#x27;m caucasian with pale skin tone and I&#x27;m a normal skin type (not oily, not dry).  I absolutely LOVE this stuff.  It matches my skin perfectly, it leaves a finish that is so natural looking it&#x27;s just amazing.  I can&#x27;t yet comment on whether or not it helps with wrinkles or pigmentation.  It is very moisturizing, it&#x27;s a thick cream and a little goes a long way.  It&#x27;s so pigmented that I use it as a concealer as well (making my morning \\&quot;get read time\\&quot; reduced).  I&#x27;m soooooooooo happy I found this!  I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
            <li> I love this bb cream, originally I used this under my regular makeup but recently I&#x27;ve been using it as my foundation. I just love how this finishes, I have yellow undertones, kind of fair, and dry skin. This product has light to medium coverage but it gives me a nice dewy finish. I normally don&#x27;t like scented products but it has this light, sweet smell to it I actually like. It almost looks light gray when it comes out but it really is a nice color. I even used a little on my sister who has more pink undertones and it looked nice on her as well. I hope they never stop making this!</li>
            <li> Great coverage but a bit drying on my skin would definitely repurchase</li>
            <li> My wife loves it, great product</li>
            <li> Being 56 &amp; fair skinned, I have never had luck using foundations or powders to conceal the usual sun-damage spots and spidery veins on my face. ( I also tend to get very red in the face after a glass of wine!) I always looked pasty or like a made-up clown.  This stuff went on smoothly, didn&#x27;t look dry or cake-y since you only need a thin layer.  I have no problem with the color, it looked totally natural on my skin, but I can&#x27;t comment on how it would work on darker skin tones.&lt;br /&gt;  Put it on after cleaning and moisturizing and you are ready to go, it lasts all day for me, in the cooler weather.  Summer may be a different story, can&#x27;t tell yet.</li>
            <li> Best BB cream ever. The shipping takes forever but it&#x27;s worth the price and money. It covers a lot of your imperfections and evens out your skin.. Not sure how it would look on someone who has really tan skin. But I guess if you put your foundation over it it won&#x27;t matter as much. Great product! :)</li>
            <li> I love Lioele triple the solution BB cream. I&#x27;ve tried a couple BB cream before I came across this one reading a review about a different BB cream someone said they had love. I&#x27;ve Google the product and read many good review so I decided to try it. Im a believer! This product really works! I have fair sensitive skin. And dark spots around my cheeks and using this product it hides it very well and I&#x27;ve been using this 3 weeks now and my dark spots are disappearing. I just love it so much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d suggest using a good primer or it&#x27;ll look a bit cakey, otherwise it has great coverage and is long-lasting.</li>
            <li> I had to wait forever for this product from overseas.  Then I tried it and it was horrible.  Too thick and I don&#x27;t like to wear a lot of stuff on my face but it felt caked on.  I had to wash my face and start over with something else.</li>
            <li> Full coverage and excellent packaging.</li>
            <li> Great for pale skin with excellent coverage. Covers up redness and balances skin tone. Could use this alone without foundation if you had to. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Believe the hype! :) I love how thick this BB cream is. Although that may be a turn off to some, i actually love it because I have a lot of natural redness in my cheeks &amp; it does a fabulous job at covering it up! It cuts my morning routine down by like 20 minutes because you don&#x27;t need to moisturize &amp; prime your face seperately in preparation for foundation, as this acts likes your moisturizer, primer, &amp; foundation ! Lasting power isn&#x27;t that great, but then again, I have extremely oily skin, but overall I love it so much! I will definitely re-purchase &amp; recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> Absolute favorite makeup product by far. Has excellent coverage and application is super easy! Shipping was fast as well.</li>
            <li> Its&#x27; an amazing product. The color and the texture, everything suit my skin. Makes my skin glow</li>
            <li> This is not a universal BB cream at all. Was way too dark for my pale skin. Also it looks super cakey and heavy while managing not to give any coverage at all, I didn&#x27;t even think that was possible. Terrible product.</li>
            <li> I really like the consistency of this stuff. It&#x27;s not too liquidy like some other BB creams and has more of a gel like texture, but not to the point that it feels thick. A little bit of this stuff goes a long way. The color I got was a bit too dark for me, but I just added a bit of sunscreen and mixed it and it was the perfect color. That&#x27;s fine with me anyway because I don&#x27;t mind the extra sun protection. The coverage is pretty good and it&#x27;s very buildable.</li>
            <li> Products feels great on the skin and is easily.blended it is to light so I mix it with another foundation and get a great result!</li>
            <li> i love how it literally covers my acne and spots but its a little on the greasy side. leaves my face feeling oily and i am not a big fan of that. overall id say if you were wanting just night out cream its fine but not an all day</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try on this product, but it ended up being too light for my medium skin tone. I wish there was something on the package that said made for light skin tones. I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted $20.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! I feel like it has actually improved my skin. I wash and moisturize my skin and then use this product with a little foundation mixed in. It covers very well but natural looking. The ony negative thing I can say is that it is very white and that is why I mix in a little foundation, to add some color. I am now 38 years old and notice that my skin is drier and looks even more dry when I apply foundation. Using this does not do that! I am very pleased and will re-purchase.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product by my sister. To me it gives you very flawless looking results. I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> it came reaallyyy late and the consitency was good but it broke me out. So its okay i guess  if you dont have oily skin</li>
            <li> Product arrived in reasonable amount of time. Product itself was too grey and pale for my relatively tan skin. I guess I can put bronzer to make my face more dark. The BB Cream is not a true or close match to my Chinese American tan skin so I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great coverage &amp; lasts all day.  I used to get microdermabrasion once a month &amp; used this for the 5 days follwing the treatment.  Great coverage &amp; my skin did not react.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that it only comes in 1 shade.  This shade is for Asian skin that does not have ANY sun exposure.  Here in Hawaii, that&#x27;s not possible &amp; it would have been nice if I could get 1 shade darker.  I use it as a concealer for my hyperpigmentation spots.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first (like I am about most skin care products), but after seeing so many recommendations for this product I had to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive, combination/oily skin, and so far I have had no luck with any kind of foundation. They always leave me either still shiny or cakey-looking. My skin just hates foundation for some reason, which is annoying because I do have dark circles and some uneven coloring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This BB cream works extremely well for me. It doesn&#x27;t sit on top of my pores and look cakey, and it blends in nicely to even out my skin tone without looking like I&#x27;m wearing a ton of makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it and will continue to use it as long as it&#x27;s available. The only downside I can see is that if you have tan or darker skin, it won&#x27;t work for you because it&#x27;s very pale in color.</li>
            <li> I love this product because its matches my skin tone very well \\&quot;I&#x27;m super pale\\&quot;, it has fabulous coverage, I love love the smell of this product it isn&#x27;t strong at all... It leaves my skin looking real smooth but not something I would wear all day because I get oily and my makeup starts to rub off after a few hours of using this product under my skin. Ill put some of this on If I have some guest over and apply some powder on for a finish look that&#x27;s about it. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried this BB cream out for a few days now, but I can already say that I love it and am 100% satisfied with this purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To start off, I am a very pale Caucasian with slight yellow undertones. Usually I buy make-up with words like &#x27;fair&#x27;, &#x27;porcelain&#x27;, &#x27;light&#x27;, etc. I did not find this BB cream made me appear like a ghost, but take into fact that I&#x27;m already very pale. I enjoy trying different brands off BB cream and previously had a Missha BB cream that I really liked. However, this BB cream I find is thicker than most and a lot goes a long way. It has fuller coverage to the point where I won&#x27;t really even need a concealer most days. It&#x27;s also easily build able, which I like. Yes, there is a slightly strong scent to it but it fades and soon you don&#x27;t notice it at all. I wouldn&#x27;t take off any points to it because of that. I work 8-9 a day and so far it has lasted the entire day. Also, it doesn&#x27;t make my face look cakey at all and it doesn&#x27;t &#x27;smudge&#x27;. With previous BB creams it feels as if the cream just sits on top my skin and I can easily wipe it away or move it all over the place throughout the day. This BB cream settles in nicely and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m sweating it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted I&#x27;ve only tried this a few days, but I&#x27;m already thinking that I will definitely purchase again! It took a little while to come in, but it was packaged really tightly and even came with the most precious note from the seller! I thought that was really cute and nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend for anybody that wants fuller coverage. If it&#x27;s too light for you, try mixing it with a darker foundation or even a darker powder or bronzer.</li>
            <li> I am a 24-y/o Caucasian with a slightly yellow skin color base. My goal in make-up is to never make it obvious I&#x27;m wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product to compare it to SKIN79 pink BB cream. This Lioele BB cream is quite a bit more yellow/pink pigmented than SKIN79. It spreads well when you put it on, but tends to fill in small wrinkles and pores giving a cakey look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To compare the two, I put Lioele on one half of my face, and SKIN79 on the other and asked my SO which side I was wearing makeup. He immediately chose the Lioele side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR if you are like me and avoid heavy looking make-up, this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well. I&#x27;m Irish, already very paled skin so this matches my skin tone pretty well when I&#x27;m glow in the dark white. I sometimes use this as my primer, concealer and foundation and only top it off with powder then bronzer. The coverage is great, I have dry skin and it doesn&#x27;t dry it out more nor does has it caused me to break out with acne. It&#x27;s long enough lasting and doesn&#x27;t look too cake-like (which some concealers can do).  I apply it with a buffing brush and it blends the best (using my fingers looked streaky and uneven). I&#x27;m happy with the purchase and would buy again.</li>
            <li> I love the product it has great coverage, smells good, and doesn&#x27;t make me break out or stick to dry patches. The only con to it is the staying power isn&#x27;t so great. I have used primers and high quality setting powders, but by the end of the day you can see my acne spots exposed.</li>
            <li> I love this  BBQ cream!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used BB Cream before (all Western type), but never found one that didn&#x27;t leave a greasy or dirty feeling on my face; nor did I find the coverage I was wanting. I have very sensitive and oily skin, so I break out and irritate easily. This is my first Asian BB Cream and I have fallen in looooove.&lt;br /&gt;  It has the consistency of a nice foundation, not too thick and not too watery, it covered all my blemishes and face with one pump. It&#x27;s not cakey and it feels like moisturizer does, so its light. Right now I&#x27;m using it as my foundation, since it has been so hot, with my regular routine- it isn&#x27;t heavy on my face and it doesn&#x27;t feel like my face is melting off like it does when I where regular foundation. The fact that it has SPF30 is a huge plus for me, along with wrinkle improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downsides I could see is that it comes in one shade-but I resolved this with a touch of bronzer- and that it whitens-but I&#x27;m use to that.&lt;br /&gt;  I know there are other Asian BB Creams that have multiple tints and no whitening, but I decided with this one because of the reviews I have seen.</li>
            <li> This is the first BB cream I&#x27;ve tried, so I can&#x27;t really compare it to others.  I really like the coverage it provides, but gave it only 4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t appear to come in any other shades, and this one is definitely too light for me--even though I have pretty fair skin.  It does provide great sun protection.  Be aware that delivery takes several weeks though, as it ships directly from China.</li>
            <li> I bought Beyond the Solution on accident, but ended up really liking it so I figured that Triple the Solution would be even better with all the reviews I heard. The reason why I don&#x27;t like this formula as much is because it doesn&#x27;t spread so easily and the finishing look reveals an unappealing look. I have dry/normal combination skin and it doesn&#x27;t do well for the dry areas at all. Rather than improving the look of my skin, I feel that it makes my skin look drier. When using this formula I also need to mix it with a moisturizer so that it&#x27;s easier to spread. It does smell a lot better than Beyond the Solution, but when it comes to the formula and the final look, I prefer the plain Beyond the Solution. Not bad terrible though, but not my first pick.</li>
            <li> Wanted to love this product and did for the first couple weeks. I loved the color and the coverage. I have Melasma and there is nothing on the market that works to cover it as well as this product does/did. However this product gave me a rash and made me break out horribly. I got a facial today and my aesthetician remarked on how my usual healthy and clear skin was very congested and clogged up! She had to do a lot of extractions and remarked on how many pimples I had. I take very good care of my skin and rarely break out. With every facial I get I never require too many extractions, she said the blackheads were big and thick. So gross! She had a lot of work to do today on me and it was awful. I realized that it must be this product because I saw my aesthetician in December before starting to use this product. A month later after using this stuff for 3 weeks my skin is wrecked. This stuff is great for coverage but horrible with clogging pores and irritating skin. I will be going back to my other products and back to my clear non irritated skin.</li>
            <li> It seems no matter what I do this stuff ends up looking really powdery and cakey on me...I have normal skin too. I wish this weren&#x27;t the case because I love the coverage it gives.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I am tan since it is summer time. But i put a darker foundation on top and my skin looks so flawless. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  Goes on and stays all day.  My skin looks smooth and glowing.  The color does have a yellow base so probably not the best shade for everyone.</li>
            <li> So I had seen a YouTuber using this product as her primer/concealer, if you will, &amp; after applying it, her face looked so supple and bright and alive that I thought I just HAD to have this product no matter what. Upon looking for it on the website she&#x27;d purchased it from, I wondered if amazon had it. Surely enough, AMAZINGzon had it &amp; for a little cheaper ! I was hesistant, however, because I have really tan skin (most consider me mixed but i&#x27;m not black at all) &amp; the product only comes in one shade- light beige. I went out on a limb, though, and bought the product. The day it came in, I wore it all day and omg I don&#x27;t even know where to begin. 1) You can immediately start noticing changes in your face&#x27;s texture within the first few hours ! 2) Ladies with darker tones, yes, it does go on pale (almost white) and it scares you, but once you apply your normal powder/mineral foundation/liquid foundation, it blends in perfectly &amp; leaves an utterly flawless complexion. It&#x27;s now been three days that I&#x27;ve been using this BB cream &amp; I honestly would not use anything else as a primer/base. Please please please keep in mind that I N E V E R review products on amazon, &amp; everything I&#x27;ve gotten from amazon has been really good, but if I&#x27;m giving it such accolades, I hope whoever reads this heeds my advice and buys this product for themselves, because it really will change your life, make up routine wise, &amp; happy wise.</li>
            <li> The cream goes on smoothly and covers pretty well. It is lightweight and evens out my complexion. I wish that it came in different shades though. It is really a bit too light for me. If it came in a darker shade I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I like this a lot, but find I like it better when I mix a bit with other foundations. I will probably repurchase!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, dry, acne prone skin.  I first tried this BB Cream last summer and immediately disliked it.  The color was way off and it felt too heavy.  I gave it another shot this winter and now I am loving it.  The color isn&#x27;t perfect, but it&#x27;s not as bad as I originally thought.  It mixes well with my regular foundation to get a better color for me.  I apply it with a foundation brush which I hadn&#x27;t before, and this seems to blend it better and make it feel less heavy.  It has a strong perfumey scent which is why I gave it 4 stars (that and the color).  The coverage is pretty good.  I have used up to 2 pumps on days when I&#x27;m trying to get full coverage, and 1 pump on days where I just want a medium coverage.  I find that even though it is a bit thick, it blends easily and has a nice looking finish.  I would say it&#x27;s more on the matte side, but not super matte.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it breaking me out or anything so that&#x27;s a real plus.  It lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t sink into my wrinkles unless I really pack it on.  Nothing a little Q-tip action can&#x27;t handle.  Overall I am really happy with this BB Cream and will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;We will see if the summer weather makes me change my mind again ;)</li>
            <li> I bought this product about 2 months ago and am absolutely in love. I have combination/oily skin and it covers all my flaws perfectly. Most days I just wear this by itself with a little bronzed but it also works amazing as a primer for my MAC studio fix fluid. It is a little too light for my skin but just barely. Since using it my skin has become so much smoother and healthier.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this at the beginning. I don&#x27;t know if I caused it in some way or if it&#x27;s because of the temperature, but the cream eventually made my face more oily (and my face is already naturally oily, especially in the T-Zone). So if you are an oily skin type, this might not be for you. However, this is the only one that I really liked and made my face look natural so I&#x27;m keeping it. Don&#x27;t have enough money or courage to try any others! I&#x27;m only counting on reviews and blogs to tell me which is the best BB cream for oily people.</li>
            <li> Covers my scarring and blemishes but it&#x27;s super light. You definitely need powder to put over this product. It he tube definitely lasts and is pretty big</li>
            <li> feels light on skin and covers very well. I have oily skin and use this product on my trip to puerto rico. stayed all day even with sweat and outdoor climate .</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this, I just didn&#x27;t. I excitedly opened the package applied it to my bare face and in my dimly lit room it looked good. Though when I looked at my face in a brighter light, it was very cakey and I only put on a small amount. Bottom line is I do not like it, it just sits in a drawer. 2/5  update half a year later:  recently found this in my drawer after running out of my normal foundation, I used it again and I honestly really like it! I don&#x27;t know what it was before that I didn&#x27;t like it. It&#x27;s actually really good. Coverage is fantastic and it&#x27;s not too cakey. 4/5</li>
            <li> I will never ever wear foundation again! I heard about this product from a youtube video featuring a girl with severe acne. It covered hers so well and didn&#x27;t break her out so I gave it a shot. It is amazing! I have very pale skin with very dark red acne scars and I can use this as foundation and dot more on to use as concealer. It has an insane amount of coverage. I put it on with a fluffy blending brush that kind of looks like a big eyeshadow brush. It does have more of a dewy finish. If you&#x27;re very oily you probably don&#x27;t need a moisturizer. I am combo/dry so I use a moisturizer and set it with loose powder in the T-zone. I tried my old foundation the other day (one for people with acne) and by the end of the day I had a huge pimple on my chin. Will never go back to wearing it again! I only wish this came in more colors so I could get all my friends to try it. As of now, there is just one VERY light color. If you&#x27;re darker than the girl on the packaging, it probably won&#x27;t work for you. If you are usually shade 1 or 2 in most brands of foundation, give this a shot!</li>
            <li> What a great product and even better price, considering you get almost 50% more than most foundations. This is only available in one color choice, the color looks somewhat darker when freshly pumped from the bottle, but when applied/blended in to the skin it&#x27;s very light. Thankfully I have a lighter neutral skin tone and this matches me perfectly. I have combination skin and I&#x27;d also suggest this to others with the same skin type since I think it&#x27;s very moisturizing. I did not notice any dry flaky skin at the end of the day and the coverage (which is buildable to medium) still held up throughout my work day. I will mention that I have oily skin on my T-zone, so I did have to touch up twice throughout the day, but honestly that doesn&#x27;t bother me since the finish is so natural looking with this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great bb cream or foundation replacement for those that like a natural medium finish. I believe this would work well with all skin types as long as you apply a good base beforehand (exfoliate, moisturize, primer, etc).</li>
            <li> This is a great BB Cream! I have tried a few and this one offers more coverage and does not have a gray cast or tint to it. It is very moisturizing and just overall makes your skin feel and look healthy! I would definitely buy it again it is going to be a staple product for me from now on!</li>
            <li> I AM IN LOVE. This product is amazing! It is perfect for dry skin types! Great coverage for being a BB cream! My favorite and the packaging is wonderful!</li>
            <li> i liked it and definitely evened out my skin tone but could definitely tell i it was not the right shade which is too bad considering all the benefits.and no bronzer didn&#x27;t help</li>
            <li> I would have never thought that I would replace ALL my foundations for a BB Cream, but I did when I found this product! I did SOO much research upon purchasing this product, and I am so glad I did! I have very oily skin, and I live in tropical weather year round, so you can only imagine how my skin does with makeup, but this bb cream works GREAT and LASTS! It has a thick consistency and feels like foundation because of the amazing coverage, but it&#x27;s not!♡ It has a odd smell at first, but WHO CARES! This product is 100% amazing and coming from only purchasing high quality foundations, this is my go to item when wanting to use something similar to foundation but not want to have to keep purchasing it because it pretty much melts off because of the humidity!</li>
            <li> After reading such great reviews on this and also hearing directly from a friend, I knew I had to try this.  Totally love this because I&#x27;m so not a make-up person.  I spend about 5 minutes on my face in the morning.  This is so easy to put on and keep on all day.  And you only need a dab to cover your entire face &amp; neck.  Face feels moisturized all day &amp; so light.  I love that it has SPF too - one less step for me!  I use the beauty blender to put this on -- bought that on Amazon too.  I still put a little blush on afterwards to add some color or else I&#x27;d look too pale, but I was expecting to do that.  I once put on mineral veil (bare escentuals powder) afterwards, and it brought out every line and wrinkle on my face!!!  Turns out I don&#x27;t need the veil.</li>
            <li> I think this was too light for me.. but considering how far this traveled to get to me, wasn&#x27;t worth the return, when I used it a few times to see if it would grow on me. texture too heavy for a BB and very light in color. Quick delivery though. Will give it away if I still can&#x27;t get into it after a couple more attempts.</li>
    </ol>
