            <li>Great for problematic skin.</li>
            <li>Great Face wash -</li>
            <li>I have nothing good to say about this product.</li>
            <li>but when you rub the soap in your hands you get good</li>
            <li>This is a good product but is too liquidy.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I used salicylic acid on my skin for years and never got the kind of results I get from tea tree oil products.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell so nice, but I don&#x27;t mind</li>
            <li>say if you&#x27;re oily and want to dabble in the natural skincare this is a great staple!</li>
            <li>I threw out my Neutrogena and Clearasil and my skin is thanking me. :)</li>
            <li>And I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;ve all worked relatively ok.</li>
            <li>I gave it two stars instead of one because I thought this might be a good product for someone with very oily skin.</li>
            <li>I should warn, and others have alluded to this, that tea tree oil does have a strong smell, and it can sting on the skin and/or in the eyes.</li>
            <li>It feels and works great to clean and clear up skin.    </li>
            <li>Leaves face refreshed and smooth.</li>
            <li>It leaves me feeling clean and refreshed and takes off all my makeup.</li>
            <li>This cleanser literally leaves your skin SQUEAKY clean.</li>
            <li>far, this face wash has made me break out more!</li>
            <li>it is easy to get in your eyes since it runs right off your face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little smelly but works great on my skin.</li>
            <li>have oily combo skin and get a break out about once a month and this soap really does the trick of keeping my skin acne free and feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>Great for after a long day of wearing makeup and need to take off makeup quickly without any extra routine.</li>
            <li>I will most definitely buy this face wash again.  </li>
            <li>I may come back and update this review if I see better results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(just keep your eyes closed while washing your face) and it&#x27;s very watery but foams up nicely</li>
            <li>If that&#x27;s not what you like, I don&#x27;t know if this is good for you especially those with dry skin.</li>
            <li>Although shipping was fast from the seller (Amazon retailer), the bottle arrived leaking in the package.</li>
            <li>The soap is VERY then and watery, and doesn&#x27;t lather up much at all.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it much at all.</li>
            <li>I expected more from Dessert Essence.    </li>
            <li>Very drying.  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t like the smell of this product.    </li>
            <li>This came really fast.</li>
            <li>This product has made me want to look forward to washing up because it really does leave you feeling stripped of dirt and unwanted resudue.</li>
            <li>But it wasn&#x27;t until I really did the research into how skin works that I saw results that I wanted</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and living in the high mountain desert most face washes dry my face</li>
            <li>I pretty much use this as a natural antiseptic for everything.  </li>
            <li>It does not seem to clean pores, only surface oil.  </li>
            <li>I love the Desert Essence line in general, but use it only once a day because tea tree oil can be drying.</li>
            <li>It can FEEL pretty harsh sometimes, but that is true of any tea tree oil product, and it&#x27;s still worth using despite that.</li>
            <li>Tea tree oil has strong anti-bacterial properties, and a little stinging is a small price to pay for good skin.    </li>
            <li>Their moisturizer is fantastic, too; sinks in and is very lightweight.</li>
            <li>Just a few pumps is more than enuff and as a bonus it has a pleasing odor.</li>
            <li>the dispenser was sadly broken, but still a good product...</li>
            <li>but I really hit the jackpot when I scored the large 32 oz refill bottle for only $7 at Bargain Hunt!</li>
            <li>and I unintentionally bought all natural organic products!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used just about every acne medication out there, including some of the more expensive ones, but they are all pretty much a combination of chemicals and one of two main acne ingredients: Salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li>really do love this soap though, and would recommend it (with maybe a little moisturizer infused if possible!!)</li>
            <li>This product has helped clear up my skin.  </li>
            <li>I found that it didn&#x27;t really clean my skin, just left my skin extremely, extremely dry.</li>
            <li>No breakouts so far, and</li>
            <li>This could last you 4-10 months depending on how much you use it.</li>
            <li>Overall, I really like it and will order again.</li>
            <li>DIdn&#x27;t care for the smell, seems to work ok but not better than regular face wash...</li>
            <li>However I personally like that feeling because unlike other cleansers that leave you squeaky clean, this cleanser doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel stripped or like it&#x27;s gonna start cracking.</li>
            <li>So basically I needed a new facial wash since my old one was discontinued.</li>
            <li>The former doesn&#x27;t seem to work at all on me, and the latter works while giving me super dry, scaley skin.</li>
            <li>The only thing that has completely cleared my skin was Proactiv and hormonal birth control.  </li>
            <li>After about three weeks of using this, my acne got worse; I kept getting huge pimples and whiteheads all over my face.  </li>

            <li> What I like about this product is that it really cleans, I mean like, you can feel all the dirt and oil being washed</li>

            <li> so dry</li>
            <li> But do remember to moisturize as it can leave your skin feeling quite dry.</li>
            <li> My face hasn&#x27;t been too dry, but I always use a spf/moisturizer</li>
            <li> The Desrt Essence face wash with awapuhi cleans my face and doesnt leave the dry feeling.</li>
            <li> and my hands are dry so that means winter&#x27;s is probably going to be rough.</li>
            <li> My skin feels really dry and stretched tight after using this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to mix it with another face cleaner that is thicker so that its not a total waste.</li>
            <li> Life&#x27;s unfair, right?</li>
            <li> I have used other Dessert Essence products before, and was suprised by this one.  </li>
            <li> If this facewash seems too drying, try using it every other day rather than every day.</li>
            <li> Since I started using this product, I have not had a single pimple!!!</li>
            <li> It leaks all over the place when you use the pump and half of it goes all over the counter when I use it.</li>
            <li> so it seems tight or itchy.</li>
            <li> Saw no significant improvement in acne.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Thankfully, it was only a small amount, but not a good sign.    </li>
            <li> There are a few issues I have with this product.  </li>
            <li> If I ever got some on my lips while washing my face, I would have dried out, cracked lips soon afterwards.    </li>
            <li> I will order again, hopefully the next one will not be broken though!</li>
            <li> Hormonal birth control is not good for your body either, so I tried to go organic.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> (Sad day indeed)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Never has this routine failed</li>
            <li> Proactiv is horrible for your skin and would dry mine out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell isn&#x27;t so bad.</li>
            <li> At the moment, I&#x27;m somewhat disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I began using this about a month ago.  I have had issues with acne since I hit puberty.  The only thing that has completely cleared my skin was Proactiv and hormonal birth control.  Proactiv is horrible for your skin and would dry mine out.  Hormonal birth control is not good for your body either, so I tried to go organic.  After about three weeks of using this, my acne got worse; I kept getting huge pimples and whiteheads all over my face.  I guess I will just have to keep looking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 28, and I was complaining until a couple of months ago, until I started using this product, that I was STILL getting some cystic acne.. while starting to get a couple of gray hairs. Life&#x27;s unfair, right? I&#x27;ve used just about every acne medication out there, including some of the more expensive ones, but they are all pretty much a combination of chemicals and one of two main acne ingredients: Salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide. The former doesn&#x27;t seem to work at all on me, and the latter works while giving me super dry, scaley skin. So I tried this after I found it at Trader Joes, and I&#x27;ve been using it exclusively for about two months. No breakouts so far, and I think that&#x27;s the longest I&#x27;ve gone in about 15 years without a breakout! The product itself IS watery compared to the gel or creams in other products, but I think part of my problem was the chemicals used in those products irritated my skin and actually MADE me break out, so I don&#x27;t mind. I use it twice a day and my bottle is only halfway gone, so for the people complaining about the price, why? This could last you 4-10 months depending on how much you use it. Love it! I threw out my Neutrogena and Clearasil and my skin is thanking me. :)</li>
            <li> This product has helped clear up my skin.  It can be a bit drying though.  If I feel too dry, I just skip this cleanser one day, then go back to it the next.  Overall, I really like it and will order again.</li>
            <li> I use this soap on cuts, athletes foot, oily skin...I pretty much use this as a natural antiseptic for everything.  It&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> Although shipping was fast from the seller (Amazon retailer), the bottle arrived leaking in the package. Thankfully, it was only a small amount, but not a good sign.    I have used other Dessert Essence products before, and was suprised by this one.  The soap is VERY then and watery, and doesn&#x27;t lather up much at all. It leaks all over the place when you use the pump and half of it goes all over the counter when I use it. I don&#x27;t use it much at all. I expected more from Dessert Essence.    Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent. It feels and works great to clean and clear up skin.    I should warn, and others have alluded to this, that tea tree oil does have a strong smell, and it can sting on the skin and/or in the eyes. It can FEEL pretty harsh sometimes, but that is true of any tea tree oil product, and it&#x27;s still worth using despite that. Tea tree oil has strong anti-bacterial properties, and a little stinging is a small price to pay for good skin.    Also note that tea tree oil can be drying, so some might want to use a moisturizer after using this.</li>
            <li> Very drying.  My skin feels really dry and stretched tight after using this product.  It leaves my skin so dry it&#x27;s uncomfortable.  It does not seem to clean pores, only surface oil.  I gave it two stars instead of one because I thought this might be a good product for someone with very oily skin.</li>
            <li> I used salicylic acid on my skin for years and never got the kind of results I get from tea tree oil products. I love the Desert Essence line in general, but use it only once a day because tea tree oil can be drying. Great for problematic skin. Their moisturizer is fantastic, too; sinks in and is very lightweight. If this facewash seems too drying, try using it every other day rather than every day.</li>
            <li> Leaves face refreshed and smooth. Saw no significant improvement in acne.&lt;br /&gt;This is what i&#x27;m using now: &amp;#34;Peter Thomas Roth Blemish Buffing Beads 8.5 fl oz&amp;#34;- very good stuff !</li>
            <li> Great Face wash - the dispenser was sadly broken, but still a good product...I will order again, hopefully the next one will not be broken though!</li>
            <li> I would not buy from this seller. I ordered product from them and I did not receive it when promised. I then e-mailed them asking for help and information with no response.</li>
            <li> I have nothing good to say about this product. I bought it recently and ended up pouring out 90% of it.  There are a few issues I have with this product.  1. It doesn&#x27;t work. I found that it didn&#x27;t really clean my skin, just left my skin extremely, extremely dry. If I ever got some on my lips while washing my face, I would have dried out, cracked lips soon afterwards.    2. I really didn&#x27;t like the smell of this product.    3. I got a drop of it in my eye on accident. It was like liquid fire! It took over 24 hours before my eye stopped hurting!    Avoid this product!</li>
            <li> This came really fast. And I absolutely love this product. It leaves me feeling clean and refreshed and takes off all my makeup. This product has made me want to look forward to washing up because it really does leave you feeling stripped of dirt and unwanted resudue. Great for after a long day of wearing makeup and need to take off makeup quickly without any extra routine. But do remember to moisturize as it can leave your skin feeling quite dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little smelly but works great on my skin.</li>
            <li> So basically I needed a new facial wash since my old one was discontinued. (Sad day indeed)&lt;br /&gt;I have oily combo skin and get a break out about once a month and this soap really does the trick of keeping my skin acne free and feeling fresh. What I like about this product is that it really cleans, I mean like, you can feel all the dirt and oil being washed away.&lt;br /&gt;The smell isn&#x27;t so bad. I actually kinda like it. It&#x27;s a tad watery but when you rub the soap in your hands you get good bubbles.&lt;br /&gt;Just the one thing I don&#x27;t like is that it dries out your hands. You definitely need to constantly moisturize. It&#x27;s the summer and my hands are dry so that means winter&#x27;s is probably going to be rough. My face hasn&#x27;t been too dry, but I always use a spf/moisturizer so maybe that&#x27;s the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really do love this soap though, and would recommend it (with maybe a little moisturizer infused if possible!!)</li>
            <li> The product is watery, but it works great!  I will most definitely buy this face wash again.  I don&#x27;t have acne but I do get a pimple or two a couple times a month.  Since I started using this product, I have not had a single pimple!!!</li>
            <li> This is a good product but is too liquidy. It needs to be thicker. When you press the pump its almost like water and you can&#x27;t keep it in your hand. It sloshes out. Because of the consistancey( or lack of) it is easy to get in your eyes since it runs right off your face. I&#x27;m going to mix it with another face cleaner that is thicker so that its not a total waste.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and living in the high mountain desert most face washes dry my face so it seems tight or itchy. The Desrt Essence face wash with awapuhi cleans my face and doesnt leave the dry feeling. Just a few pumps is more than enuff and as a bonus it has a pleasing odor. I recommend it to people in this area all the time.</li>
            <li> This bottle has lasted me 6 months but I really hit the jackpot when I scored the large 32 oz refill bottle for only $7 at Bargain Hunt! Even if I didn&#x27;t find the refill bottle, I still would have reordered it from Amazon. I have oily acne prone skin and this cleanser is my holy grail! Over the years I&#x27;ve tried proactiv, drugstore cleansers, even dermatologist cleansers and they&#x27;ve all worked relatively ok. But it wasn&#x27;t until I really did the research into how skin works that I saw results that I wanted and I unintentionally bought all natural organic products! (They had the best reviews!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This cleanser literally leaves your skin SQUEAKY clean. If that&#x27;s not what you like, I don&#x27;t know if this is good for you especially those with dry skin. However I personally like that feeling because unlike other cleansers that leave you squeaky clean, this cleanser doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel stripped or like it&#x27;s gonna start cracking. It kinda the perfect balance for us oily people. I also follow with an apple cider vinegar toner (try it!) and the Naked Bee daily facial moisturizer, though I&#x27;m currently looking into trying a different one. Never has this routine failed me!&lt;br /&gt;I say if you&#x27;re oily and want to dabble in the natural skincare this is a great staple!</li>
            <li> I may come back and update this review if I see better results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, this face wash has made me break out more! I just started using it about a month ago, so I hope this is the &amp;#34;detox&amp;#34; part of using this face wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It hasn&#x27;t burned my eyes (just keep your eyes closed while washing your face) and it&#x27;s very watery but foams up nicely so it&#x27;s watery nature is not a problem. It doesn&#x27;t smell so nice, but I don&#x27;t mind it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope I soon start getting the desired results. At the moment, I&#x27;m somewhat disappointed.</li>
            <li> DIdn&#x27;t care for the smell, seems to work ok but not better than regular face wash...</li>
