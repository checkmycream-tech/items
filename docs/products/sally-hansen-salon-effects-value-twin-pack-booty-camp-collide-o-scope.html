    <ol>
            <li>so these are perfect!</li>
            <li>Best to use remover with acetone.</li>

            <li>/&gt;They were very easy to apply and look great.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>

            <li>Omg I love love love these!</li>
            <li>I will order more of these for sure.</li>
            <li>No way were they going to fit or \\&quot;shape\\&quot; nicely.</li>
            <li>I finish with two coats of top coat to add shine and protection.</li>
            <li>Nails are left in great condition!</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Love these!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought these might work better, but they don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>LOVE THESE!&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li>Got it quick and love the designs!  </li>
            <li>Plus... how fun?!?!</li>
            <li>These salon effects are perfect for a quick manicure and pedicure, very simple and easy to do and they work great for anyone who wants to do their nails for any event.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use the blunt end to smooth the strip to avoid wrinkles and bubbles.</li>
            <li>These are surprisingly easy to apply.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Does not remove easily with remover on cotton balls or pre-soaked sheets, MUST use a dip and twist style remover.  </li>
            <li>Just follow the directions and make sure you buff lightly and clean your nails thoroughly with nail polish remover before attaching the strips.</li>
            <li>It seems like a great idea, so I tried a Collide-O-Scope pack from a local drugstore.</li>
            <li>because I love them and Two because the delivery was so fast :)</li>
            <li>The one thing to note is that color combinations with a large amount of white in them take a great deal more effort to remove.  </li>
            <li>and it was worth it!</li>
            <li>I was really excited</li>
            <li>So finding them on amazon for this price I was excited.</li>
            <li>They go on so easy and you can do dishes right afterward.</li>
            <li>When I received these I was super excited.</li>
            <li>They are soo easy to use and can last more than two weeks!</li>
            <li>I realized that the reason I wasn&#x27;t having a good experience was probably because I hadn&#x27;t prepped properly.</li>
            <li>It all looks like the cheap drugstore items that rarely, if ever, do what they purport to do.ll not have tried...</li>
            <li>It all looks like the cheap drugstore items that rarely, if ever, do what they purport to do.</li>
            <li>I spent $13 on one box of these Salon Effects at a local drug store, so being able to get a twin pack at such a great price was great.  </li>
            <li>And they came in the mail so quickly.  </li>
            <li>but the pattern is hot!</li>
            <li>and they didn&#x27;t fit me very well</li>
            <li>I got these for my Mom who has breast cancer and is undergoing a year&#x27;s worth of chemo.</li>
            <li>It also makes you much more sensitive to smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They take a bit of time to apply (about an hour) but once they are on, I top them with a clear coat</li>
            <li>I wore them on the beach, in and out of the ocean, for 10 days and they looked freshly applied.</li>
            <li>the nail strip was stuck to the clear plastic top piece.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are so cute and a nice change from just plain polish.</li>
            <li>RIGHT NOW,</li>
            <li>And I kept them stored nicely and neatly inside their original package in a bathroom drawer, so it&#x27;s not as if I mistreated the things by storing them in some harsh, unfriendly environment or anything of that</li>
            <li>This product is great for easy application &amp; long wear without having to mess with nail polish.</li>
            <li>I was much more generous with the nail polish remover for the final pass.</li>
            <li>I ordered it online because I really wanted the colorful rainbow print.</li>
            <li>so I decided to try on the Booty Camp style first.</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>Did not last more than 2 days.  </li>
            <li>Colorful, vibrant &amp;#34;polish&amp;#34; without the bottle.</li>
            <li>I understood how to follow the directions, but my first try at using Sally Hansen Salon Effects Real Nail Polish Strips did not go as well as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>I am really satisfied with them, and highly recommend them: especially for women who can&#x27;t apply liquid polish for any reason.</li>
            <li>Mom really likes these alot.</li>
            <li>I REALLY HAVENT USED YET, IM GOING THRU ALL MY LAYLA NAIL POLISH COLORS</li>
            <li>They are a whole lot cheaper than a manicure</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this product to anyone, I honestly believe I wasted my money, if you want your nails designed go to the nail salon</li>
            <li>That stuff is relatively easy to apply and quick to dry, but not worth it; luckily I&#x27;m almost most, so I&#x27;ll finish off the bottle just because I like the blue gel. &#x3D;</li>
            <li>Good for one time use lasts about 4-5 days on active hands, possibly longer if non-active diva.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, no wait time needed to dry.  </li>
            <li>They last almost a full two weeks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not very good at painting my own nails</li>
            <li>I would recommend them highly.</li>
            <li>My nail beds are small so the strips were a bit large, but I was able to remove excess from the sides with the pointed tip of the orange stick that&#x27;s included.</li>
            <li>These are ok, I just have trouble with any polish.  </li>
            <li>I had bought some previously from a local store and really liked them.</li>
            <li>A few months of using their Vitasurge strength gel, and my nails still peel, splinter, crack, break, and tear off as easily as ever.</li>
            <li>Though my nails are somewhat long, I was able to do both hands with one set, leaving me enough for a future application.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t comment on whether this batch of Salon Effects sticks or not, but my daughter uses Salon Effects frequently.  </li>
            <li>Maybe the product that was sold to me was old?</li>
            <li>my Mom and I found that they last longer and adhere better if, after you apply them, you avoid immersing your hands in warm/hot water, even with rubber gloves on, for a few hours after applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are fairly easy to use and though they do have a bit of polish smell, it&#x27;s lots less than regular nail polish</li>
            <li>One more silly nail product I mistakenly picked up, thinking it would be cool, but which is totally unusable and probably may as well get</li>
            <li>One more silly nail product I mistakenly picked up, thinking it would be cool, but which is totally unusable and probably may as well get</li>
            <li>Not that I would really want long nails</li>
            <li>She finds the glitter ones hard to use, but the non-glitter ones are easy to put on (she is 11 and does it herself) and they stay on longer than polish.</li>
            <li>Once you use them a few times and get used to how they have to be applied, they go on fairly quickly with the added bonus of no drying time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The polish is very convenient to apply and is long lasting.</li>
            <li>T. Firstly, the pieces were very oddly shaped and distributed.</li>

            <li> T. Firstly, the pieces were very oddly shaped and distributed.</li>
            <li> Either I have extremely small, narrow fingers, or something was screwy there, because none of them fit any of my nails well at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If it worked, sticking on complex nail polish designs and then slicing around the edge of your nail to remove the excess (like Snow White slicing off her pie crust) would be pretty darn</li>
            <li> They last for days and they save me trips to the nail salon where I have to endure long waits.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed that if I put a coat of clear polish over them they can last a little longer even.</li>
            <li> so it wasn&#x27;t a complete waste.</li>
            <li> I too only used half the strips, so one package definitely gives two manicures.</li>
            <li> The seller gave me an immediate refund due to the problem and did not want the damaged goods back.  </li>
            <li> So, the second time I tried them I went very slowly and paid particular attention to roughing up the sides of my nails, as well as the tops.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t last very long when you work on a keyboard everyday</li>
            <li> When I received it the design was hard to peel off the clear seal and when it did peal off it ripped before I could apply it to my toe.</li>
            <li> I have been waiting on getting the pink camo</li>
            <li> but then again, of course, you never really know until you do try.</li>
            <li> but then again, of course, you never really know until you do try.</li>
            <li> Big waste of money.</li>
            <li> so sad that they wouldn&#x27;t work right.</li>
            <li> Works just like all of the other sally hansen nail strips.  </li>
            <li> (how misleading that would be!), and that I&#x27;d even seen a friend wear them--or something extremely similar--successfully.</li>
            <li> I ordered these a week ago an they came the other day.</li>
            <li> They take minutes to put on and last for days, Plus my nails r small</li>
            <li> value with the twin pack.&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing other styles.</li>
            <li> When applying, I was very careful to place them well inside my cuticles.</li>
            <li> The coliide o scope ones were ripping in half when pulling them off the strips.  </li>
            <li> I think the batch must have been stored poorly or just plain old.</li>
            <li> The strips did nothing but stick to themselves and crumple up, looking quite a mess.</li>
            <li> It just takes a little time &amp; patience to use.</li>
            <li> I ended up putting multiple strips of broken pieces close together</li>
            <li> I tried a few and had to discard them.</li>
            <li> but they were all ruined and was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I was shocked that almost all of the reviews seemed to be positive</li>
            <li> They arrived in a small envelope with no padding and the packages were smashed and in pieces.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was hit from shipping</li>
            <li> I have bought these in the past and have had no problems.  </li>
            <li> and they were really hard to get on.</li>
            <li> at least you get what you pay for.</li>

            <li> I got these for my Mom who has breast cancer and is undergoing a year&#x27;s worth of chemo. If you&#x27;ve ever been around anyone who is having chemo then you probably know that it discolors finger and toenails. It also makes you much more sensitive to smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Mom really likes these alot. They are fairly easy to use and though they do have a bit of polish smell, it&#x27;s lots less than regular nail polish so it doesn&#x27;t set off nausea the way regular polish can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are so cute and a nice change from just plain polish. Once you use them a few times and get used to how they have to be applied, they go on fairly quickly with the added bonus of no drying time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both my Mom and I found that they last longer and adhere better if, after you apply them, you avoid immersing your hands in warm/hot water, even with rubber gloves on, for a few hours after applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These were a great price too.</li>
            <li> Omg I love love love these! They are soo easy to use and can last more than two weeks! I will never go back to the acrylic tips.</li>
            <li> I read lots of reviews before buying these and *thought* I understood how to follow the directions, but my first try at using Sally Hansen Salon Effects Real Nail Polish Strips did not go as well as I had hoped. I understood some of the complaints, actually. But as I watched the wear pattern (chipping and lifting) I realized that the reason I wasn&#x27;t having a good experience was probably because I hadn&#x27;t prepped properly. So, the second time I tried them I went very slowly and paid particular attention to roughing up the sides of my nails, as well as the tops. I was much more generous with the nail polish remover for the final pass. When applying, I was very careful to place them well inside my cuticles. I too only used half the strips, so one package definitely gives two manicures. They have good staying power and do not chip easily. I am really satisfied with them, and highly recommend them: especially for women who can&#x27;t apply liquid polish for any reason.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very good at painting my own nails so these are perfect! I will order more of these for sure. One because I love them and Two because the delivery was so fast :)</li>
            <li> I use these Salon effects a lot but never bought from online. I ordered it online because I really wanted the colorful rainbow print. When I received it the design was hard to peel off the clear seal and when it did peal off it ripped before I could apply it to my toe. I ended up putting multiple strips of broken pieces close together so it wasn&#x27;t a complete waste. I think the batch must have been stored poorly or just plain old. In the end I received a lot of compliments after working a miracle. Everyone thought I went to a nail salon.</li>
            <li> Great design.  Works just like all of the other sally hansen nail strips.  Easy to apply, no wait time needed to dry.  Comes with extras in case of mistakes.</li>
            <li> Got it quick and love the designs!  I have been waiting on getting the pink camo and it was worth it!</li>
            <li> Purchased these as a gift for my daughter.  They arrived in a small envelope with no padding and the packages were smashed and in pieces.  The seller gave me an immediate refund due to the problem and did not want the damaged goods back.  I can&#x27;t comment on whether this batch of Salon Effects sticks or not, but my daughter uses Salon Effects frequently.  She finds the glitter ones hard to use, but the non-glitter ones are easy to put on (she is 11 and does it herself) and they stay on longer than polish. Plus... how fun?!?!</li>
            <li> These were priced so low how could you not buy them? I love these things! They go on so easy and you can do dishes right afterward. They last almost a full two weeks and I have noticed that if I put a coat of clear polish over them they can last a little longer even.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I picked up a bad box?! Doubt it, though! I was shocked that almost all of the reviews seemed to be positive (how misleading that would be!), and that I&#x27;d even seen a friend wear them--or something extremely similar--successfully. It seems like a great idea, so I tried a Collide-O-Scope pack from a local drugstore. Oh, man. I followed the simple instructions to a T. Firstly, the pieces were very oddly shaped and distributed. Either I have extremely small, narrow fingers, or something was screwy there, because none of them fit any of my nails well at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First attempt: The strips did nothing but stick to themselves and crumple up, looking quite a mess. I tried a few and had to discard them. No way were they going to fit or \\&quot;shape\\&quot; nicely. And I kept them stored nicely and neatly inside their original package in a bathroom drawer, so it&#x27;s not as if I mistreated the things by storing them in some harsh, unfriendly environment or anything of that nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second attempt: Forget it! All the adhesiveness was gone! The strips merely snapped in two. Not a bit of stick. I&#x27;ve kept the remaining ones just because I&#x27;m stubborn, but I know they&#x27;re never going to work, either. What a disappointment. If it worked, sticking on complex nail polish designs and then slicing around the edge of your nail to remove the excess (like Snow White slicing off her pie crust) would be pretty darn cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, I will probably avoid Sally Hansen products from now on. A few months of using their Vitasurge strength gel, and my nails still peel, splinter, crack, break, and tear off as easily as ever. Not that I would really want long nails (they bug me with their dirt-accumulating nature and are horrendously impractical), but still. That stuff is relatively easy to apply and quick to dry, but not worth it; luckily I&#x27;m almost most, so I&#x27;ll finish off the bottle just because I like the blue gel. &#x3D;P There&#x27;s no sense in these useless products that you may as well not have tried...but then again, of course, you never really know until you do try. Oh, well. One more silly nail product I mistakenly picked up, thinking it would be cool, but which is totally unusable and probably may as well get tossed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t be too keen to try anything else from this brand. It all looks like the cheap drugstore items that rarely, if ever, do what they purport to do.ll not have tried...but then again, of course, you never really know until you do try. Oh, well.

            <li> The twin value pack of Sally Hansen Salon Effects is a great value on Amazon. Though my nails are somewhat long, I was able to do both hands with one set, leaving me enough for a future application. These are surprisingly easy to apply. Just follow the directions and make sure you buff lightly and clean your nails thoroughly with nail polish remover before attaching the strips. My nail beds are small so the strips were a bit large, but I was able to remove excess from the sides with the pointed tip of the orange stick that&#x27;s included. Make sure you use the blunt end to smooth the strip to avoid wrinkles and bubbles. I finish with two coats of top coat to add shine and protection. My last set lasted about 10 days and I got tired of them before they were badly chipped. The adhesive is a bit difficult to remove. Best to use remover with acetone. Nails are left in great condition!</li>
            <li> When I went to use the nail strips neither color would stick except 2 or 3 and then when I went to feel the back of them there was no stickyness. I would not recommend this product to anyone, I honestly believe I wasted my money, if you want your nails designed go to the nail salon at least you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I ordered these a week ago an they came the other day. I was really excited so I decided to try on the Booty Camp style first. The give you 6 different sizes and they didn&#x27;t fit me very well and they were really hard to get on. After I was done the look okay but the pattern is hot!</li>
            <li> The Sally Hansen polish strips are great. They take a bit of time to apply (about an hour) but once they are on, I top them with a clear coat and they last for two weeks. I wore them on the beach, in and out of the ocean, for 10 days and they looked freshly applied.</li>
            <li> I REALLY HAVENT USED YET, IM GOING THRU ALL MY LAYLA NAIL POLISH COLORS RIGHT NOW, BUT CANT WAIT TO TRY IT OUT</li>
            <li> This product is great for easy application &amp; long wear without having to mess with nail polish. It just takes a little time &amp; patience to use. The company is a great company to deal with. I would recommend them highly.</li>
            <li> Nail art without the salon price or having to have art skills. Colorful, vibrant &amp;#34;polish&amp;#34; without the bottle. Good for one time use lasts about 4-5 days on active hands, possibly longer if non-active diva. Once you figure out best method for you, you can apply in 5 to 10 minutes if perfectionist.</li>
            <li> this product does not work. does not stay on. I did not like it because of that fact, I hate it.</li>
            <li> Love these!&lt;br /&gt;They are so easy to use. They last for days and they save me trips to the nail salon where I have to endure long waits.</li>
            <li> I love these nail strips! They take minutes to put on and last for days, Plus my nails r small so i get two uses out of each box instead of just one.</li>
            <li> The polish is very convenient to apply and is long lasting. Have received compliments on the design. The one thing to note is that color combinations with a large amount of white in them take a great deal more effort to remove.  Does not remove easily with remover on cotton balls or pre-soaked sheets, MUST use a dip and twist style remover.  Also, non-acetone takes longer, but will eventually remove the polish.</li>
            <li> When my daughter tried to apply these they didn&#x27;t adhere.  They were not sticky and couldn&#x27;t be used.  Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> These are ok, I just have trouble with any polish.  I thought these might work better, but they don&#x27;t.  Nothing against the product, it&#x27;s just my nails.  Arrived on time too...thanks!</li>
            <li> I spent $13 on one box of these Salon Effects at a local drug store, so being able to get a twin pack at such a great price was great.  And they came in the mail so quickly.  They really last.  You have to put them on per instructions.  They are a whole lot cheaper than a manicure and they look like nail art at the not nail art price.</li>
            <li> LOVE THESE!&lt;br /&gt;They were very easy to apply and look great.&lt;br /&gt;Great value with the twin pack.&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing other styles.</li>
            <li> Comes off too quickly and smells terrible difficult to apply. Did not last more than 2 days.  Big waste of money.</li>
            <li> A wonderful product!  My girls&#x27; nails still looked great after a full week and more!  Would definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to use. Did not come off with nail polish remover as stated. Great for someone who has lots of time to do nails</li>
            <li> When I received these I was super excited. I had bought some previously from a local store and really liked them. So finding them on amazon for this price I was excited. Thought he product was defective when I went to use them the nail strip was stuck to the clear plastic top piece. I tried to get a corner up to try to peel off but they would just rip. so sad that they wouldn&#x27;t work right. I&#x27;m not sure if it was hit from shipping but they were all ruined and was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> These salon effects are perfect for a quick manicure and pedicure, very simple and easy to do and they work great for anyone who wants to do their nails for any event.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay, don&#x27;t last very long when you work on a keyboard everyday but it is very easy to apply</li>
            <li> I have bought these in the past and have had no problems.  The coliide o scope ones were ripping in half when pulling them off the strips.  Maybe the product that was sold to me was old?</li>
