            <li>great choice for beginners.</li>

            <li>This mascara is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years and have always loved it.</li>
            <li>Nice even color.</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely, builds well, doesn&#x27;t clump or make my lashes feel crispy.  </li>

            <li>Excellent everyday mascara - the best I&#x27;ve found yet.</li>
            <li>This mascara I have liked and been buying for years.  </li>
            <li>I have really liked this mascara for years.</li>
            <li>One month in using this tube, the product is still nice and fluid.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>The good part is it washes off easily.</li>
            <li>It very rarely clumps, makes my lashes look great and feel healthy.</li>
            <li>This mascara washes off very easily with soap and water or with make up remover.&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br</li>
            <li>Removal is very easy, and because of this, it doesn&#x27;t cause you to lose eyelashes in the process.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>so was thrilled to be able to order online.</li>
            <li>cheap and good.</li>
            <li>MY LASHES ARE RATHER FINE &amp; THIS PRODUCT GRABS HOLD ONTO THEM GIVING THEM VOLUME!  </li>
            <li>easy to apply, nice definition &amp; doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li>You have to be patient and good at mascara to get this to work well; you cant just quickly dab it on the lashes.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS MASCARA</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
            <li>Otherwise I stick with tube type (love love Blinc) or combo tube/waterproof type</li>
            <li>favorite find.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara</li>
            <li>Love this mascara.</li>
            <li>It does just an okay job at seperating your lashes.  </li>
            <li>However, for more drama, I find I have to add 4 coats(fortunately</li>
            <li>, I really love this product.</li>
            <li>I have been buying this mascara for many years</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>

            <li>My favorite mascara ever.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>I get incredible results, ranging from natural looking to night out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many mascaras and this one can not be beat.</li>
            <li>The company has fast shipping and great packaging.</li>
            <li>another try to be sure the irritation was not from another cause.</li>
            <li>please post what mascara you love here.</li>

            <li>This is my favorite mascara.  </li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>like so many are nowadays.  </li>
            <li>This mascara is just okay.  </li>

            <li>This is more for every day</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this mascara!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to find mascara that doesn&#x27;t clump and make your lashes look like spider legs.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this mascara for soooo many years.</li>
            <li>This is an okay mascara.</li>
            <li>I really love it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite, stand-by mascara.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, but it does tend to clump and smudge under my eyes.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara at the moment</li>
            <li>My favorite mascara from now on.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my lashes look.</li>
            <li>I love that it washes off with water.</li>
            <li>Now I can again use this product that doesn&#x27;t turn my lashes into caked-up clumps just makes them darker and more visible.  </li>
            <li>This is an okay mascara.</li>
            <li>That I love.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read many reviews that say it doesn&#x27;t build drama.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I just wish Amazon carried more of the brownish shades of this mascara...</li>
            <li>This is just as described and I will be buying more when I need it</li>
            <li>I usually love this mascara and have for years.</li>
            <li>but I love the way it thickens my lashes.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara and have been using it for years.</li>
            <li>Glad you had it.</li>
            <li>LOVE THE BRUSH &amp; THE PRODUCT</li>
            <li>my favorite mascara.  </li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love this product.</li>
            <li>also love that it doesn&#x27;t run.</li>
            <li>It never flakes and is okay with eye-drops</li>
            <li>I loved this formula when it first came out years ago and like most women, I&#x27;ve used so many others in the intervening years.  </li>
            <li>Because the formula is thinner, it seems to transfer to my eyelids more easily when I&#x27;m applying the mascara.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>This is nice and soft (as the name suggests) and good for running out to the store or times</li>
            <li>This mascara is great for giving you that natural look!</li>
            <li>I have used several of these, on recommendation that it is very good for the price.</li>
            <li>This feels natural on your eyelashes and looks great.</li>
            <li>This is just a great standby mascara for an every-day natural look.</li>
            <li>Great natural looking mascara for someone like me ( almost 60 ).</li>
            <li>Looks great and natural, no clumping.</li>
            <li>other awesome thing about this is that it removes extremely easily (with soap or makeup remover; it doesn&#x27;t flake off).</li>
            <li>Easy on and even easier off.</li>
            <li>I like how easy fool proof the application is</li>
            <li>No irritation (unless accidently slept in) no flaking, easy to remove at night.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t crumble and it&#x27;s easy to wash off.</li>
            <li>It easily smudges because it&#x27;s not waterproof.</li>
            <li>but when I do I like it to be easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It does the job, washes off easily and doesn&#x27;t clump (in my experience).</li>
            <li>It is also easy to remove.</li>
            <li>Does not clump and goes on easily.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clump, or smudge on me, and it&#x27;s always easy to remove.  </li>
            <li>Does not wash off easily either.</li>
            <li>Comes off easily when I use mascara remover.</li>
            <li>Also, easy to remove at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>far as the application is concerned the product does give good coverage although it tends to clump, which seems to be a problem with many mascaras.</li>
            <li>Nothing special over most of the others available.</li>
            <li>If it truly made eyelashes full and soft, I&#x27;d be happy, but I don&#x27;t notice either of these things.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easily and comfortably, though I would prefer the wand to be curved and longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have fine lashes and this helps.  </li>
            <li>Just fine.</li>
            <li>when again I want to be able to take it off quickly.</li>
            <li>Good mascara, very soft brush.</li>
            <li>For me, this is huge.</li>
            <li>Applies smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li>I get compliments on a regular basis of how great my eyelashes look and have even had people as me if I have eyelash extensions.</li>
            <li>The formula is thinner and goes on smooth without clumping.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>No clumping, goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>makes my lashes look fantastic</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and does not clump.  </li>
            <li>If you have weepy eyes or cry easily, you&#x27;ll absolutely want the waterproof kind, since this version washes off super easy.  </li>
            <li>If I put a coat this one and then use a different brush, my lashes look great, but I didn&#x27;t want to have to use two brushes.</li>
            <li>The product seems to be good and natural.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t prefer waterproof because I like that this comes off easy with soap and water without need for a special makeup remover.</li>
            <li>It will make your lashes look very full, dark, and beautiful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I think this is a great everyday mascara that&#x27;s easy on the budget!</li>
            <li>and this does the job to accentuate them with rich color without clumping or irritation.</li>
            <li>It is a nice product but burned my eyes when I used mu normal make up remover.  </li>
            <li>Its not my favorite, but I really like the brush!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light but provides full coverage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read many reviews of the Great Lash, and this happens with quite a few people.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s alright on clean eyelashes, not as clumpy.</li>
            <li>Good everyday mascara that I use when I want to be able to take it off easily</li>
            <li>I prefer this over another Maybelline old classic Great Lash.</li>
            <li>It has been a refreshing transition because I will say that this product makes my lashes look much longer, does not clump, and feels weightless.</li>
            <li>Another aspect is that my lashes have a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; look to them, which lends itself well to its \\&quot;Full and Soft\\&quot; name.  </li>
            <li>Cannot say enough good things.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this mascara leaves my lashes looking full and the color makes the see thick..it dosnt separate my lashes to the point where they look like a rake..</li>
            <li>Love the brush but too much mascara comes out with the brush and must be wiped off a bit</li>
            <li>Full coverage, while not being clumpy.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s 100% true.</li>
            <li>I signed up for the subscribe and save on this Maybelline Full</li>
            <li>Love it natural looking and easy to remove with soap and water</li>
            <li>This mascara can go on a little clumpy at times but for the most part it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>Its wand head is full, but not as full as the wand on Maybelline Colossal and is longer than the one on Maybelline Collossal.  </li>
            <li>I have tried MANY drug store and high end mascaras</li>
            <li>This is after trying many high end department store mascaras.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says and gives your eyelashes a nice full and soft look.</li>
            <li>Honestly, you can do the same thing with any lipstick at all, and this color (plum) was a bright red color.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty and natural-looking.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for everyday wear, and I would recommend highly to anyone.</li>
            <li>It tends to run out quickly and sometimes has an odd consistency, but it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>Love this Full &amp; Soft.</li>
            <li>I love Maybelline Full n Soft but in the waterproof formula.</li>
            <li>I love how soft and full (no pun intended)</li>
            <li>I used to love Revlon&#x27;s full n&#x27; soft mascara, so I decided to try this one.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;re all looking for that perfect mascara that makes our lashes fluffy but full, natural looking but glamorous -</li>
            <li>This mascara gives me longer, more natural looking lashes, without all of the clumps!  </li>
            <li>This product is reasonably priced and is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>How grand is it to have soft lashes without the clumping and flaking?  </li>
            <li>for me it&#x27;s totally worth the price.</li>
            <li>I would say this is the best value mascara for thin eyelashes that doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li>I have gone swimming with it on and it rarely comes off.</li>
            <li>It gives your lashes a natural look, but more amped-up and defined.</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely, and really makes your lashes appear fuller, while keeping them feeling soft, not bristly.  </li>
            <li>The never fail good old soft and full still thickens and darkens</li>
            <li>This is far and away my favorite mascara.  </li>
            <li>Nice that it&#x27;s not very clump-y, but this is also goes on really light, which may or may not be for you.</li>
            <li>This mascara is a nice basic way to darken my lashes and fill them out just a bit.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;It delivers on it&#x27;s promises to not flake or clump and to feel more natural.</li>
            <li>Very soft and clean application!</li>
            <li>It is a wet product, but not nearly as thin as Great Lash--it builds up quickly--maybe too quickly at first.</li>
            <li>The mascara worked okay, but I didn&#x27;t get the results I normally get from the straight wand.</li>
            <li>This mascara is good in that looks more natural and less clumpy than some.  </li>
            <li>There are absolutely no clumps when I use this mascara; I prefer the latter, as it stays on great yet washes off easily.</li>
            <li>I personally think this is the best drugstore brand mascara that does not clump/weigh down your eyelashes.</li>
            <li>This mascara goes on really well-- no clumping even if you slide the wand through your lashes a few times (for complete, awesome coverage).  </li>
            <li>I really love the Maybelline New York Full &#x27;N Soft Mascara.  </li>
            <li>you prefer your makeup more natural looking and less obvious, this mascara is a very good inexpensive choice.  </li>
            <li>I think Gellar is gorgeous, even though she&#x27;s got an odd nose, and while she was Maybelline&#x27;s spokesmodel, I tried just about anything she modeled.  </li>
            <li>only downside is that you kind of have to apply a lot if you like a really lashy look like I do.</li>
            <li>But lashes are soft and easily applied, no flaking or smudge.</li>
            <li>Honestly, this is just as good as really expensive mascaras I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>and I like it very much.</li>
            <li>I have been an avid Covergirl LashBlast user for over 6 years.</li>
            <li>My first impression of this was that I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many others and this is the one I always go back to.</li>
            <li>I have been using it ever since Sarah-Michelle Gellar first hocked in 2000(?).  </li>
            <li>I have tried many higher end mascaras (via Sephora&#x27;s trial-sized mascara kit) and always come back to this.  </li>
            <li>Amazon - thanks for making this an Add On!</li>
            <li>Not expensive</li>
            <li>No idea what ingredient(s) are doing this, but consistent every time, and</li>
            <li>I have reached for it consistently over some of my higher end products.</li>
            <li>Like others here, I have tried many drug store brands, but always go back to this one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the same tube for 10 months now by doing this! :)</li>
            <li>I received mine in the time it said, but it wasn&#x27;t exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>I always seem to come back to this mascara after trying many others.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 58 and luckily still have decent eyelashes</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite mascara for several years now.  </li>
            <li>So glad I found it on amazon.... Will totally buy it again!</li>
            <li>A good everyday mascara.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s easy to wash off (even if you are a heavy mascara wearer like me :) and its affordable.</li>
            <li>This mascara was ok for the first week or so, but has dried out super quickly and now is too clumpy/flaky for use.</li>
            <li>Easily layered and I love that it doesn&#x27;t get stiff</li>
            <li>It makes lashes full and soft!</li>
            <li>but I have yet to find a mascara that will both lengthen and increase volume without some other kind of drawback like clumps, etc.  </li>
            <li>LOOKING FULL&amp; SOFT!</li>
            <li>I would not go so far as to say this is a true volumizing mascara, but it does give my lashes a bit of fullness, just perfect for casual days.</li>
            <li>In an effort to save money, I saw the great reviews on this mascara and even a better price, so I decided to try it out and alternate with my other mascara to make it last longer.</li>
            <li>Have used this product for years and really like it better than others I can find locally.</li>
            <li>It is a very reasonably priced mascara that really performs.  </li>
            <li>far as the rest of its performance, I find this to be nothing special.  </li>
            <li>I wanted it to look natural and was happy the first few times I used it because it was easy to apply and was soft and natural looking</li>
            <li>My go-to mascara is a higher end brand that costs four times as much as this mascara.</li>
            <li>It really makes my lashes look naturally full and soft!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about the same price as other mascaras that I greatly prefer, I will not buy again.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t use anything but Full &#x27;N Soft.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I use Maybelline Stilleto to seperate and lengthen my lashes and then throw a couple of coats of Full &amp; Soft over that to thicken a bit (no clumping results).      </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using full and soft for years.</li>
            <li>This one is just as good if not better than Lancomes mascaras.  </li>
            <li>It gives full and soft eyelashes just like the name.  </li>
            <li>Lashes are soft but bold.</li>
            <li>I value an easy to apply mascara and this simply was not it.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t feel brittle or dry up lashes and flake off like most mascaras.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m older, I want a mascara that gives me a more natural, soft look, and this does the trick.  </li>
            <li>I would have been better off to buy it brand new at a local store.</li>
            <li>After a few uses, I realized that the best way to use this mascara is to curl your lashes BEFORE using it to avoid any of it rubbing off or making a mess when you blink.</li>
            <li>This is a very low clump mascara formula, which is great for everyday wear.  </li>
            <li>This is my great basic everyday mascara.</li>
            <li>I was having trouble finding this great mascara in local stores.  </li>
            <li>I added this to my subscribe &amp; save order plus there was an additional coupon, so it was very cheap!&lt;br</li>
            <li>They really are &amp;#34;full &amp; soft&amp;#34;.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get as much volume with this mascara than with others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the brush.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very versatile.</li>
            <li>Would absolutely recommend to anybody, though.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really go on very well</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I also really like Revlon 3D photoready mascara.</li>
            <li>This mascara makes your lashes look thicker but natural without clumps when opened fresh, but it does tend to get clumpy after a while with repeat air exposures.</li>
            <li>when i apply it, tons of mascara gets up on my eyelid and its very chunky.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s get real.</li>
            <li>I also can re-apply in the evening if I&#x27;m going out and it radically enhances the look, turning it into an evening ready mascara that is still not spiky.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like it</li>
            <li>I have smaller, relatively deep-set eyes, and those plastic brushes are more useful, but again, with practice, this is great.&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>I came back to my old favorite</li>
            <li>Looks great wether wear it on my real lashes and or false lashes</li>
            <li>It goes on easy, minimal clumping, and gives your lashes a natural, full, lengthened look without burning, stinging.  </li>
            <li>I recommend the Maybelline New York Full &#x27;N Soft Mascara.</li>
            <li>Very soft and fluttery, my lashes but x10 better and not fake and clumpy looking like other mascaras.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ns my lashes better than any other mascara I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>When it rubs a little under the eyelid (humid hot weather for instance), you can just wipe it off with the top of your finger.</li>
            <li>it washes off fairly easily and isnt super stiff</li>
            <li>Very smudgey - I&#x27;ve got a fairly steady hand and still managed to get Mr. Hankey spots all around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>and I find that if I&#x27;m not very careful  after applying that I end up with mascara on my upper and lower eyelids from my lashes touching them.</li>
            <li>I used to go through these tubes so quickly because they would dry out pretty fast... until a trick I learned:</li>
            <li>Black gives a more intense lash for evening.</li>
            <li>Great basic mascara, I keep ordering every few months to replace my old tube.  </li>
            <li>Nice small brush and goes on well.</li>
            <li>Since the 80s, I&#x27;ve been such a sucker for marketing gimmicks and tried any product that sounded like the latest newer and better.</li>
            <li>In situations where I want more drama, I turn to other mascara, as using 4 coats is a waste of product in my opinion, so I use a mascara that is made for more drama.</li>
            <li>I am really into makeup and like trying new things.</li>
            <li>This has been my main one for years.</li>
            <li>sure enough its here in short order</li>
            <li>Like the bestseller and highly-rated Maybelline Great Lash (in the pink and green bottle), this also burns my eyes.  </li>
            <li>A decent mascara option.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about 15 years now and have never found a decent alternative.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried others, some much more expensive , but this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>and I know I won&#x27;t be in a high heat situation.</li>
            <li>I adore this mascara and have since I was in high school.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this mascara to anyone.  </li>
            <li>The spooly could be a little better</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t come off as easily as I would like, but other than that</li>
            <li>Thanks to all, hope this review encourages others to try Soft Lash.</li>
            <li>won&#x27;t add too much volume or length, but creates a natural look instead.</li>
            <li>Really like this stuff for a natural day look.</li>
            <li>first pic is this product at work on a natural day, the second is after swimming (underwater) on a hot day.</li>
            <li>My lashes look long ad full and they really do feel soft to the touch - almost as if I&#x27;m not wearing mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This Full and Soft Mascara definitely lives up to its name!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried mascaras that cost up to 10 times the Full &#x27;N Soft, but I always ended up coming back.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally wear mascara</li>
            <li>It makes my lashes look full and long.</li>
            <li>It definitely lives up to the name of being Full and SOFT.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It goes on nice and thick, but comes off super-easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>do like that the brush is fiber, and not hard plastic</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve made more money, I&#x27;ve tried other more expensive mascaras, but I keep coming back to this one because I love it so much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it felt more like putting black shoe polish on than mascara!  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t need to apply innumerable layers to make my light brown lashes intense black.</li>
            <li>(i&#x27;ve even been caught using a hair dryer on cool to dry my eyelashes), but after a month or two, it&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It goes on as smoothly on day one as it does after 6 months when it&#x27;s due for replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t get it in New Zealand anymore,</li>
            <li>I like this brand of new mascara.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for naturally longer but thin lashes, it&#x27;s quite black</li>
            <li>It also washes off easily without black residue lingering around.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes feel soft, long and full after using it.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>I like this because it looks very natural.  </li>
            <li>For a non-waterproof mascara, it holds curls relatively well for my very straight stubborn lashes.</li>
            <li>so they&#x27;re more noticeable, without any clumps and very little flaking.</li>
            <li>I like the very black, but sometimes I want a more natural look and like the brown/black.</li>
            <li>The first couple applications from a brand new tube are pretty thin and light, but it will thicken and give you the desired results thereafter.</li>
            <li>It looked and felt sooo natural!...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok but no more than that.</li>
            <li>I wish I could fine the brownish black in stores, but I can&#x27;t find anywhere that carries it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll probably still try other mascaras to see how they are, but I&#x27;ll undoubtedly come back to this one!</li>
            <li>I would have already requested a full refund for my recently purchased Maybelline New York Full &#x27;N Soft Mascara in Very Black.  </li>
            <li>Although I do have naturally dark and full lashes already (and am young) , so not sure how it would work on older people with shorter, more sparse lashes.</li>
            <li>The product was brand new, but the mascara itself was just too old.</li>
            <li>But this goes on easily, doesn&#x27;t coat your lashes in black goo, looks relatively un-made-up but still makes your eyelashes thick, bold, and full.</li>
            <li>Lashes are not stiff and brittle.</li>
            <li>The color is also a fantastic black that is both intense and soft at the same time!</li>
            <li>It is a tad hard to get off at night, as it takes more than just water.</li>
            <li>mascara doesn&#x27;t clump up as quickly in the tube as other brands and types.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara, but it can be hard to find in the store.</li>
            <li>and this one looks natural, but amped up.</li>
            <li>Lashes feel soft.</li>
            <li>and after the mascara dries my lashes feel soft</li>
            <li>It feels natural on your eyes.</li>
            <li>mascara that was sent to me was so old that the &amp;#34;old mascara smell&amp;#34; had kick in.</li>
            <li>It does leave your lashes feeling soft so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li>That makes different mascara options that have a lot of &amp;#34;thickening&amp;#34; in them look very clumpy and unnatural.  </li>
            <li>I think it may have been rather old and needed some use before working.</li>
            <li>basically, we want to look like we rolled out of bed with eyelashes ready for a makeup commercial.</li>
            <li>Works really well with cat eye makeup and makes your eyes look bigger.</li>
            <li>It does it&#x27;s job, and it leaves your lashes soft.  </li>
            <li>This one is extremely soft, yet noticeable and natural.  </li>
            <li>natural looking mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have short lashes, this one won&#x27;t give you much</li>
            <li>I wonder if the formula has changed or if I am getting ones that are old.</li>
            <li>It also wears soft all day.  </li>
            <li>I use this product because it is soft and doesn&#x27;t clump or stiffin my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>My lashes still feel soft after applying 3 coats.</li>
            <li>As good as any expensive mascara I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>The Full &#x27;N Soft is a more expensive drugstore mascara at my local Rite Aid it retailed at $7.69 Ouch!  </li>
            <li>It makes my light, short lashes look thick and lush but not fake or cakey.</li>
            <li>I also wear contacts and other mascaras have either caused irritation or lash loss, which isn&#x27;t fun when you have contacts.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that I live in a hot climate and it does sometimes leave some traces under my lower lashes (which are long and maybe that&#x27;s the readon)</li>
            <li>If you are someone like me who has fallen in love with the mascaras by Lancome, Clinique, Dior, and you&#x27;ve found a less expensive mascara you love that lengthens, volumizes and doesn&#x27;t flake....</li>
            <li>It is very dry and clumps way too much!</li>
            <li>Like other basic mascara&#x27;s I would never use this on my lower lashes as you&#x27;ll get smudges under your eyes (I live in Florida too hot and humid!).</li>
            <li>My lashes are long, but straight</li>
            <li>I have never experienced eye irritation because the staying power is so amazing, The only time it&#x27;s ever shed is when I used a 6 month old one in a pinch.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why this one isn&#x27;t as popular as Maybelline&#x27;s other mascaras.</li>
            <li>And it works way better than some of the more expensive brans, for way less the cost!</li>
            <li>You can put on as little or as much as you want and it still doesn&#x27;t clump and looks very natural.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>I particularly like the large fluffy brush.</li>
            <li>This simply adds a nice, dark veil of color that makes my pale lashes look like they exist.</li>
            <li>I recently had been following the advice of some beauty bloggers and tried a couple other brands only to be disappointed by their clumping, or inability to give me long, beautiful looking lashes (mostly clumping - yuck).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The mascara tube is made from an incredibly soft plastic, reminiscent to a child&#x27;s toy.</li>
            <li>lush lashes with volume definitely!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a mascara to be used maybe in daily basis, since it gives a natural look, that&#x27;s all</li>
            <li>look, this is just enough to look like I&#x27;ve fixed myself up but am not spending all morning on myself.</li>
            <li>This last all day for me and washes off completely with soap and water.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are soft, but only because I used one coat.  </li>
            <li>It gives a natural look, doesn&#x27;t irritate the eyes, and washes off with a tiny bit of soap and water, but manages to stay put during my 10K runs.</li>
            <li>When I first open this mascara I always feel like it&#x27;s too wet</li>
            <li>I apply a few swipes, comb through with an old wand and then wait a few seconds before adding more.</li>
            <li>i have small eye lashes and not too full.</li>
            <li>I recently switched to Maybelline Full n Soft after using Dior mascara for the past 5 years.  </li>
            <li>Just not Black enough</li>
            <li>Very thin coats--two swipes per eye, then go back and add more!</li>
            <li>If you want a more standout, dramatic look, this may not be the mascara for you.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>As mentioned before, this is a great everyday mascara (for the office, running errands, casual days, etc).  </li>
            <li>The mascara can be a little thick and clumpy, sometimes it will apply too much but using a clean brush or a little bit of tissue paper will smooth away the excess and leave your lashes looking dark and natural.</li>
            <li>It looks ok when you initially put it on, then within an hr or so the lashes start to look dull (not much length or volume).</li>
            <li>Very soft and comfortable, it does not make your eye lashes feel like rocks or leave little black flakes around your eyes as long as you do not rub them.</li>
            <li>This is really just average in my book</li>
            <li>To get a desired full effect, I have to apply the mascara at least three times.  </li>
            <li>The lashes also aren&#x27;t stiff, theyre pretty flexible with it on.</li>
            <li>I usually spend about 5 minutes getting it just right.</li>
            <li>This stuff doesn&#x27;t flake, is inky and black, but can be removed w gentle soap and water.  </li>
            <li>: Won&#x27;t lengthen your lashes enough to look like falsies, and doesn&#x27;t build up super thick.  </li>
            <li>The color was very dark and was soft as promised; however, it took multiple coats to build up to a wearable look which frequently became spidery.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great product!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not the very best but its a great backup for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy that she&#x27;s happy!</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara! :D</li>
            <li> Very grand, indeed!  </li>
            <li> and this mascara does a great job darkening them and providing a bit of fullness and length.  </li>
            <li> great choice for beginners.</li>
            <li> Tried EyesByDesign and it gave great lengthening and volumizing but not a fan of the comb</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s happy.</li>
            <li> It makes my eyes look great, doesn&#x27;t smudge for me.  </li>
            <li> Brush is great, par duct is great.</li>
            <li> This mascara is so great.</li>
            <li> Great product</li>
            <li> This mascara does a great job with lengthening lashes with no clumps.</li>
            <li> As a contact lens wearer, this is also a great mascara for that issue as well.</li>
            <li> Great price, great product</li>
            <li> It washes off great with out leaving our lashes feeling like you have to pill it off.  </li>
            <li> My eyes look great with this mascara.</li>
            <li> This is a great mascara once you get the hang of applying it.</li>
            <li> I think the brush is the real magic.</li>
            <li> The stick is overly flexible and not in a good way..</li>
            <li> brush is fabulous and lashes look great !</li>
            <li> The wand does a good job of separating lashes.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li> It is the most incredible mascara I have ever used.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t poke you in the eye, and I get really good results with it.</li>
            <li> Good shipping, no problems.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just as good as ever.  </li>
            <li> It is a good around mascara.</li>
            <li> I loved this product.  </li>
            <li> Loved it.</li>
            <li> I am happy to buy an excellent product in the speed of delivery thanks to the seller</li>
            <li> It is good that I am not the kind of woman who would ever return make up to the retailer otherwise</li>
            <li> Love this brush, it gets every lash very nicely.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara ever!</li>

            <li> FAVORITE for a DECADE!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li> I just love it!  </li>
            <li> Price was great and product easy to apply and lasts.</li>
            <li> This mascara is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years and have always loved it.</li>
            <li> Nice even color.</li>
            <li> It goes on nicely, builds well, doesn&#x27;t clump or make my lashes feel crispy.  </li>
            <li> For me, nicely done eyelashes are a must.</li>
            <li> It has the absolute best brush.</li>
            <li> Excellent everyday mascara - the best I&#x27;ve found yet.</li>
            <li> This mascara I have liked and been buying for years.  </li>
            <li> I have really liked this mascara for years.</li>
            <li> One month in using this tube, the product is still nice and fluid.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> The good part is it washes off easily.</li>
            <li> It very rarely clumps, makes my lashes look great and feel healthy.</li>
            <li> This mascara washes off very easily with soap and water or with make up remover.&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br</li>
            <li> Removal is very easy, and because of this, it doesn&#x27;t cause you to lose eyelashes in the process.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> so was thrilled to be able to order online.</li>
            <li> cheap and good.</li>
            <li> MY LASHES ARE RATHER FINE &amp; THIS PRODUCT GRABS HOLD ONTO THEM GIVING THEM VOLUME!  </li>
            <li> easy to apply, nice definition &amp; doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li> You have to be patient and good at mascara to get this to work well; you cant just quickly dab it on the lashes.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS MASCARA</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
            <li> Otherwise I stick with tube type (love love Blinc) or combo tube/waterproof type</li>
            <li> favorite find.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara</li>
            <li> Love this mascara.</li>
            <li> It does just an okay job at seperating your lashes.  </li>
            <li> However, for more drama, I find I have to add 4 coats(fortunately</li>
            <li> , I really love this product.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this mascara for many years</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara of all time.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara ever.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li> I get incredible results, ranging from natural looking to night out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many mascaras and this one can not be beat.</li>
            <li> The company has fast shipping and great packaging.</li>
            <li> another try to be sure the irritation was not from another cause.</li>
            <li> please post what mascara you love here.</li>
            <li> Love the product and will order again.</li>
            <li> I love the look it gives.</li>
            <li> Love both.</li>
            <li> Love this budget mascara.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara.  </li>
            <li> I love this mascara.</li>
            <li> like so many are nowadays.  </li>
            <li> This mascara is just okay.  </li>
            <li> There is so much to love about this mascara.</li>
            <li> This is more for every day</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this mascara!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to find mascara that doesn&#x27;t clump and make your lashes look like spider legs.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this mascara for soooo many years.</li>
            <li> This is an okay mascara.</li>
            <li> I really love it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite, stand-by mascara.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but it does tend to clump and smudge under my eyes.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara at the moment</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara from now on.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my lashes look.</li>
            <li> I love that it washes off with water.</li>
            <li> Now I can again use this product that doesn&#x27;t turn my lashes into caked-up clumps just makes them darker and more visible.  </li>
            <li> This is an okay mascara.</li>
            <li> That I love.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read many reviews that say it doesn&#x27;t build drama.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I just wish Amazon carried more of the brownish shades of this mascara...</li>
            <li> This is just as described and I will be buying more when I need it</li>
            <li> I usually love this mascara and have for years.</li>
            <li> but I love the way it thickens my lashes.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara and have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Glad you had it.</li>
            <li> LOVE THE BRUSH &amp; THE PRODUCT</li>
            <li> my favorite mascara.  </li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this product.</li>
            <li> also love that it doesn&#x27;t run.</li>
            <li> It never flakes and is okay with eye-drops</li>
            <li> I loved this formula when it first came out years ago and like most women, I&#x27;ve used so many others in the intervening years.  </li>
            <li> Because the formula is thinner, it seems to transfer to my eyelids more easily when I&#x27;m applying the mascara.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> This is nice and soft (as the name suggests) and good for running out to the store or times</li>
            <li> This mascara is great for giving you that natural look!</li>
            <li> I have used several of these, on recommendation that it is very good for the price.</li>
            <li> This feels natural on your eyelashes and looks great.</li>
            <li> This is just a great standby mascara for an every-day natural look.</li>
            <li> Great natural looking mascara for someone like me ( almost 60 ).</li>
            <li> Looks great and natural, no clumping.</li>
            <li> other awesome thing about this is that it removes extremely easily (with soap or makeup remover; it doesn&#x27;t flake off).</li>
            <li> Easy on and even easier off.</li>
            <li> I like how easy fool proof the application is</li>
            <li> No irritation (unless accidently slept in) no flaking, easy to remove at night.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t crumble and it&#x27;s easy to wash off.</li>
            <li> It easily smudges because it&#x27;s not waterproof.</li>
            <li> but when I do I like it to be easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It does the job, washes off easily and doesn&#x27;t clump (in my experience).</li>
            <li> It is also easy to remove.</li>
            <li> Does not clump and goes on easily.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clump, or smudge on me, and it&#x27;s always easy to remove.  </li>
            <li> Does not wash off easily either.</li>
            <li> Comes off easily when I use mascara remover.</li>
            <li> Also, easy to remove at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> far as the application is concerned the product does give good coverage although it tends to clump, which seems to be a problem with many mascaras.</li>
            <li> Nothing special over most of the others available.</li>
            <li> If it truly made eyelashes full and soft, I&#x27;d be happy, but I don&#x27;t notice either of these things.  </li>
            <li> It goes on easily and comfortably, though I would prefer the wand to be curved and longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have fine lashes and this helps.  </li>
            <li> Just fine.</li>
            <li> when again I want to be able to take it off quickly.</li>
            <li> Good mascara, very soft brush.</li>
            <li> For me, this is huge.</li>
            <li> Applies smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li> I get compliments on a regular basis of how great my eyelashes look and have even had people as me if I have eyelash extensions.</li>
            <li> The formula is thinner and goes on smooth without clumping.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> No clumping, goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> makes my lashes look fantastic</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and does not clump.  </li>
            <li> If you have weepy eyes or cry easily, you&#x27;ll absolutely want the waterproof kind, since this version washes off super easy.  </li>
            <li> If I put a coat this one and then use a different brush, my lashes look great, but I didn&#x27;t want to have to use two brushes.</li>
            <li> The product seems to be good and natural.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t prefer waterproof because I like that this comes off easy with soap and water without need for a special makeup remover.</li>
            <li> It will make your lashes look very full, dark, and beautiful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I think this is a great everyday mascara that&#x27;s easy on the budget!</li>
            <li> and this does the job to accentuate them with rich color without clumping or irritation.</li>
            <li> It is a nice product but burned my eyes when I used mu normal make up remover.  </li>
            <li> Its not my favorite, but I really like the brush!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light but provides full coverage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read many reviews of the Great Lash, and this happens with quite a few people.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright on clean eyelashes, not as clumpy.</li>
            <li> Good everyday mascara that I use when I want to be able to take it off easily</li>
            <li> I prefer this over another Maybelline old classic Great Lash.</li>
            <li> It has been a refreshing transition because I will say that this product makes my lashes look much longer, does not clump, and feels weightless.</li>
            <li> Another aspect is that my lashes have a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; look to them, which lends itself well to its \\&quot;Full and Soft\\&quot; name.  </li>
            <li> Cannot say enough good things.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this mascara leaves my lashes looking full and the color makes the see thick..it dosnt separate my lashes to the point where they look like a rake..</li>
            <li> Love the brush but too much mascara comes out with the brush and must be wiped off a bit</li>
            <li> Full coverage, while not being clumpy.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s 100% true.</li>
            <li> I signed up for the subscribe and save on this Maybelline Full</li>
            <li> Love it natural looking and easy to remove with soap and water</li>
            <li> This mascara can go on a little clumpy at times but for the most part it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Its wand head is full, but not as full as the wand on Maybelline Colossal and is longer than the one on Maybelline Collossal.  </li>
            <li> I have tried MANY drug store and high end mascaras</li>
            <li> This is after trying many high end department store mascaras.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says and gives your eyelashes a nice full and soft look.</li>
            <li> Honestly, you can do the same thing with any lipstick at all, and this color (plum) was a bright red color.  </li>
            <li> Very pretty and natural-looking.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for everyday wear, and I would recommend highly to anyone.</li>
            <li> It tends to run out quickly and sometimes has an odd consistency, but it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> Love this Full &amp; Soft.</li>
            <li> I love Maybelline Full n Soft but in the waterproof formula.</li>
            <li> I love how soft and full (no pun intended)</li>
            <li> I used to love Revlon&#x27;s full n&#x27; soft mascara, so I decided to try this one.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;re all looking for that perfect mascara that makes our lashes fluffy but full, natural looking but glamorous -</li>
            <li> This mascara gives me longer, more natural looking lashes, without all of the clumps!  </li>
            <li> This product is reasonably priced and is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> How grand is it to have soft lashes without the clumping and flaking?  </li>
            <li> for me it&#x27;s totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> I would say this is the best value mascara for thin eyelashes that doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li> I have gone swimming with it on and it rarely comes off.</li>
            <li> It gives your lashes a natural look, but more amped-up and defined.</li>
            <li> It goes on nicely, and really makes your lashes appear fuller, while keeping them feeling soft, not bristly.  </li>
            <li> The never fail good old soft and full still thickens and darkens</li>
            <li> This is far and away my favorite mascara.  </li>
            <li> Nice that it&#x27;s not very clump-y, but this is also goes on really light, which may or may not be for you.</li>
            <li> This mascara is a nice basic way to darken my lashes and fill them out just a bit.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It delivers on it&#x27;s promises to not flake or clump and to feel more natural.</li>
            <li> Very soft and clean application!</li>
            <li> It is a wet product, but not nearly as thin as Great Lash--it builds up quickly--maybe too quickly at first.</li>
            <li> The mascara worked okay, but I didn&#x27;t get the results I normally get from the straight wand.</li>
            <li> This mascara is good in that looks more natural and less clumpy than some.  </li>
            <li> There are absolutely no clumps when I use this mascara; I prefer the latter, as it stays on great yet washes off easily.</li>
            <li> I personally think this is the best drugstore brand mascara that does not clump/weigh down your eyelashes.</li>
            <li> This mascara goes on really well-- no clumping even if you slide the wand through your lashes a few times (for complete, awesome coverage).  </li>
            <li> I really love the Maybelline New York Full &#x27;N Soft Mascara.  </li>
            <li> you prefer your makeup more natural looking and less obvious, this mascara is a very good inexpensive choice.  </li>
            <li> I think Gellar is gorgeous, even though she&#x27;s got an odd nose, and while she was Maybelline&#x27;s spokesmodel, I tried just about anything she modeled.  </li>
            <li> only downside is that you kind of have to apply a lot if you like a really lashy look like I do.</li>
            <li> But lashes are soft and easily applied, no flaking or smudge.</li>
            <li> Honestly, this is just as good as really expensive mascaras I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> and I like it very much.</li>
            <li> I have been an avid Covergirl LashBlast user for over 6 years.</li>
            <li> My first impression of this was that I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many others and this is the one I always go back to.</li>
            <li> I have been using it ever since Sarah-Michelle Gellar first hocked in 2000(?).  </li>
            <li> I have tried many higher end mascaras (via Sephora&#x27;s trial-sized mascara kit) and always come back to this.  </li>
            <li> Amazon - thanks for making this an Add On!</li>
            <li> Not expensive</li>
            <li> No idea what ingredient(s) are doing this, but consistent every time, and</li>
            <li> I have reached for it consistently over some of my higher end products.</li>
            <li> Like others here, I have tried many drug store brands, but always go back to this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the same tube for 10 months now by doing this! :)</li>
            <li> I received mine in the time it said, but it wasn&#x27;t exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> I always seem to come back to this mascara after trying many others.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 58 and luckily still have decent eyelashes</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite mascara for several years now.  </li>
            <li> So glad I found it on amazon.... Will totally buy it again!</li>
            <li> A good everyday mascara.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s easy to wash off (even if you are a heavy mascara wearer like me :) and its affordable.</li>
            <li> This mascara was ok for the first week or so, but has dried out super quickly and now is too clumpy/flaky for use.</li>
            <li> Easily layered and I love that it doesn&#x27;t get stiff</li>
            <li> It makes lashes full and soft!</li>
            <li> but I have yet to find a mascara that will both lengthen and increase volume without some other kind of drawback like clumps, etc.  </li>
            <li> LOOKING FULL&amp; SOFT!</li>
            <li> I would not go so far as to say this is a true volumizing mascara, but it does give my lashes a bit of fullness, just perfect for casual days.</li>
            <li> In an effort to save money, I saw the great reviews on this mascara and even a better price, so I decided to try it out and alternate with my other mascara to make it last longer.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years and really like it better than others I can find locally.</li>
            <li> It is a very reasonably priced mascara that really performs.  </li>
            <li> far as the rest of its performance, I find this to be nothing special.  </li>
            <li> I wanted it to look natural and was happy the first few times I used it because it was easy to apply and was soft and natural looking</li>
            <li> My go-to mascara is a higher end brand that costs four times as much as this mascara.</li>
            <li> It really makes my lashes look naturally full and soft!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about the same price as other mascaras that I greatly prefer, I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use anything but Full &#x27;N Soft.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I use Maybelline Stilleto to seperate and lengthen my lashes and then throw a couple of coats of Full &amp; Soft over that to thicken a bit (no clumping results).      </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using full and soft for years.</li>
            <li> This one is just as good if not better than Lancomes mascaras.  </li>
            <li> It gives full and soft eyelashes just like the name.  </li>
            <li> Lashes are soft but bold.</li>
            <li> I value an easy to apply mascara and this simply was not it.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t feel brittle or dry up lashes and flake off like most mascaras.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m older, I want a mascara that gives me a more natural, soft look, and this does the trick.  </li>
            <li> I would have been better off to buy it brand new at a local store.</li>
            <li> After a few uses, I realized that the best way to use this mascara is to curl your lashes BEFORE using it to avoid any of it rubbing off or making a mess when you blink.</li>
            <li> This is a very low clump mascara formula, which is great for everyday wear.  </li>
            <li> This is my great basic everyday mascara.</li>
            <li> I was having trouble finding this great mascara in local stores.  </li>
            <li> I added this to my subscribe &amp; save order plus there was an additional coupon, so it was very cheap!&lt;br</li>
            <li> They really are &amp;#34;full &amp; soft&amp;#34;.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get as much volume with this mascara than with others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the brush.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very versatile.</li>
            <li> Would absolutely recommend to anybody, though.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really go on very well</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I also really like Revlon 3D photoready mascara.</li>
            <li> This mascara makes your lashes look thicker but natural without clumps when opened fresh, but it does tend to get clumpy after a while with repeat air exposures.</li>
            <li> when i apply it, tons of mascara gets up on my eyelid and its very chunky.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s get real.</li>
            <li> I also can re-apply in the evening if I&#x27;m going out and it radically enhances the look, turning it into an evening ready mascara that is still not spiky.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like it</li>
            <li> I have smaller, relatively deep-set eyes, and those plastic brushes are more useful, but again, with practice, this is great.&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> I came back to my old favorite</li>
            <li> Looks great wether wear it on my real lashes and or false lashes</li>
            <li> It goes on easy, minimal clumping, and gives your lashes a natural, full, lengthened look without burning, stinging.  </li>
            <li> I recommend the Maybelline New York Full &#x27;N Soft Mascara.</li>
            <li> Very soft and fluttery, my lashes but x10 better and not fake and clumpy looking like other mascaras.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ns my lashes better than any other mascara I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> When it rubs a little under the eyelid (humid hot weather for instance), you can just wipe it off with the top of your finger.</li>
            <li> it washes off fairly easily and isnt super stiff</li>
            <li> Very smudgey - I&#x27;ve got a fairly steady hand and still managed to get Mr. Hankey spots all around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> and I find that if I&#x27;m not very careful  after applying that I end up with mascara on my upper and lower eyelids from my lashes touching them.</li>
            <li> I used to go through these tubes so quickly because they would dry out pretty fast... until a trick I learned:</li>
            <li> Black gives a more intense lash for evening.</li>
            <li> Great basic mascara, I keep ordering every few months to replace my old tube.  </li>
            <li> Nice small brush and goes on well.</li>
            <li> Since the 80s, I&#x27;ve been such a sucker for marketing gimmicks and tried any product that sounded like the latest newer and better.</li>
            <li> In situations where I want more drama, I turn to other mascara, as using 4 coats is a waste of product in my opinion, so I use a mascara that is made for more drama.</li>
            <li> I am really into makeup and like trying new things.</li>
            <li> This has been my main one for years.</li>
            <li> sure enough its here in short order</li>
            <li> Like the bestseller and highly-rated Maybelline Great Lash (in the pink and green bottle), this also burns my eyes.  </li>
            <li> A decent mascara option.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 15 years now and have never found a decent alternative.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried others, some much more expensive , but this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> and I know I won&#x27;t be in a high heat situation.</li>
            <li> I adore this mascara and have since I was in high school.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this mascara to anyone.  </li>
            <li> The spooly could be a little better</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t come off as easily as I would like, but other than that</li>
            <li> Thanks to all, hope this review encourages others to try Soft Lash.</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t add too much volume or length, but creates a natural look instead.</li>
            <li> Really like this stuff for a natural day look.</li>
            <li> first pic is this product at work on a natural day, the second is after swimming (underwater) on a hot day.</li>
            <li> My lashes look long ad full and they really do feel soft to the touch - almost as if I&#x27;m not wearing mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Full and Soft Mascara definitely lives up to its name!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried mascaras that cost up to 10 times the Full &#x27;N Soft, but I always ended up coming back.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally wear mascara</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes look full and long.</li>
            <li> It definitely lives up to the name of being Full and SOFT.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It goes on nice and thick, but comes off super-easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> do like that the brush is fiber, and not hard plastic</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve made more money, I&#x27;ve tried other more expensive mascaras, but I keep coming back to this one because I love it so much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it felt more like putting black shoe polish on than mascara!  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t need to apply innumerable layers to make my light brown lashes intense black.</li>
            <li> (i&#x27;ve even been caught using a hair dryer on cool to dry my eyelashes), but after a month or two, it&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It goes on as smoothly on day one as it does after 6 months when it&#x27;s due for replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get it in New Zealand anymore,</li>
            <li> I like this brand of new mascara.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for naturally longer but thin lashes, it&#x27;s quite black</li>
            <li> It also washes off easily without black residue lingering around.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes feel soft, long and full after using it.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> I like this because it looks very natural.  </li>
            <li> For a non-waterproof mascara, it holds curls relatively well for my very straight stubborn lashes.</li>
            <li> so they&#x27;re more noticeable, without any clumps and very little flaking.</li>
            <li> I like the very black, but sometimes I want a more natural look and like the brown/black.</li>
            <li> The first couple applications from a brand new tube are pretty thin and light, but it will thicken and give you the desired results thereafter.</li>
            <li> It looked and felt sooo natural!...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but no more than that.</li>
            <li> I wish I could fine the brownish black in stores, but I can&#x27;t find anywhere that carries it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll probably still try other mascaras to see how they are, but I&#x27;ll undoubtedly come back to this one!</li>
            <li> I would have already requested a full refund for my recently purchased Maybelline New York Full &#x27;N Soft Mascara in Very Black.  </li>
            <li> Although I do have naturally dark and full lashes already (and am young) , so not sure how it would work on older people with shorter, more sparse lashes.</li>
            <li> The product was brand new, but the mascara itself was just too old.</li>
            <li> But this goes on easily, doesn&#x27;t coat your lashes in black goo, looks relatively un-made-up but still makes your eyelashes thick, bold, and full.</li>
            <li> Lashes are not stiff and brittle.</li>
            <li> The color is also a fantastic black that is both intense and soft at the same time!</li>
            <li> It is a tad hard to get off at night, as it takes more than just water.</li>
            <li> mascara doesn&#x27;t clump up as quickly in the tube as other brands and types.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, but it can be hard to find in the store.</li>
            <li> and this one looks natural, but amped up.</li>
            <li> Lashes feel soft.</li>
            <li> and after the mascara dries my lashes feel soft</li>
            <li> It feels natural on your eyes.</li>
            <li> mascara that was sent to me was so old that the &amp;#34;old mascara smell&amp;#34; had kick in.</li>
            <li> It does leave your lashes feeling soft so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> That makes different mascara options that have a lot of &amp;#34;thickening&amp;#34; in them look very clumpy and unnatural.  </li>
            <li> I think it may have been rather old and needed some use before working.</li>
            <li> basically, we want to look like we rolled out of bed with eyelashes ready for a makeup commercial.</li>
            <li> Works really well with cat eye makeup and makes your eyes look bigger.</li>
            <li> It does it&#x27;s job, and it leaves your lashes soft.  </li>
            <li> This one is extremely soft, yet noticeable and natural.  </li>
            <li> natural looking mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have short lashes, this one won&#x27;t give you much</li>
            <li> I wonder if the formula has changed or if I am getting ones that are old.</li>
            <li> It also wears soft all day.  </li>
            <li> I use this product because it is soft and doesn&#x27;t clump or stiffin my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> My lashes still feel soft after applying 3 coats.</li>
            <li> As good as any expensive mascara I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> The Full &#x27;N Soft is a more expensive drugstore mascara at my local Rite Aid it retailed at $7.69 Ouch!  </li>
            <li> It makes my light, short lashes look thick and lush but not fake or cakey.</li>
            <li> I also wear contacts and other mascaras have either caused irritation or lash loss, which isn&#x27;t fun when you have contacts.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that I live in a hot climate and it does sometimes leave some traces under my lower lashes (which are long and maybe that&#x27;s the readon)</li>
            <li> If you are someone like me who has fallen in love with the mascaras by Lancome, Clinique, Dior, and you&#x27;ve found a less expensive mascara you love that lengthens, volumizes and doesn&#x27;t flake....</li>
            <li> It is very dry and clumps way too much!</li>
            <li> Like other basic mascara&#x27;s I would never use this on my lower lashes as you&#x27;ll get smudges under your eyes (I live in Florida too hot and humid!).</li>
            <li> My lashes are long, but straight</li>
            <li> I have never experienced eye irritation because the staying power is so amazing, The only time it&#x27;s ever shed is when I used a 6 month old one in a pinch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this one isn&#x27;t as popular as Maybelline&#x27;s other mascaras.</li>
            <li> And it works way better than some of the more expensive brans, for way less the cost!</li>
            <li> You can put on as little or as much as you want and it still doesn&#x27;t clump and looks very natural.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> I particularly like the large fluffy brush.</li>
            <li> This simply adds a nice, dark veil of color that makes my pale lashes look like they exist.</li>
            <li> I recently had been following the advice of some beauty bloggers and tried a couple other brands only to be disappointed by their clumping, or inability to give me long, beautiful looking lashes (mostly clumping - yuck).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The mascara tube is made from an incredibly soft plastic, reminiscent to a child&#x27;s toy.</li>
            <li> lush lashes with volume definitely!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mascara to be used maybe in daily basis, since it gives a natural look, that&#x27;s all</li>
            <li> look, this is just enough to look like I&#x27;ve fixed myself up but am not spending all morning on myself.</li>
            <li> This last all day for me and washes off completely with soap and water.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are soft, but only because I used one coat.  </li>
            <li> It gives a natural look, doesn&#x27;t irritate the eyes, and washes off with a tiny bit of soap and water, but manages to stay put during my 10K runs.</li>
            <li> When I first open this mascara I always feel like it&#x27;s too wet</li>
            <li> I apply a few swipes, comb through with an old wand and then wait a few seconds before adding more.</li>
            <li> i have small eye lashes and not too full.</li>
            <li> I recently switched to Maybelline Full n Soft after using Dior mascara for the past 5 years.  </li>
            <li> Just not Black enough</li>
            <li> Very thin coats--two swipes per eye, then go back and add more!</li>
            <li> If you want a more standout, dramatic look, this may not be the mascara for you.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> As mentioned before, this is a great everyday mascara (for the office, running errands, casual days, etc).  </li>
            <li> The mascara can be a little thick and clumpy, sometimes it will apply too much but using a clean brush or a little bit of tissue paper will smooth away the excess and leave your lashes looking dark and natural.</li>
            <li> It looks ok when you initially put it on, then within an hr or so the lashes start to look dull (not much length or volume).</li>
            <li> Very soft and comfortable, it does not make your eye lashes feel like rocks or leave little black flakes around your eyes as long as you do not rub them.</li>
            <li> This is really just average in my book</li>
            <li> To get a desired full effect, I have to apply the mascara at least three times.  </li>
            <li> The lashes also aren&#x27;t stiff, theyre pretty flexible with it on.</li>
            <li> I usually spend about 5 minutes getting it just right.</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t flake, is inky and black, but can be removed w gentle soap and water.  </li>
            <li> : Won&#x27;t lengthen your lashes enough to look like falsies, and doesn&#x27;t build up super thick.  </li>
            <li> The color was very dark and was soft as promised; however, it took multiple coats to build up to a wearable look which frequently became spidery.  </li>
            <li> On average, I use about two full coats per eye for everyday wear and that gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> Very soft, but not very full.</li>
            <li> There is less mascara in this bottle than there is in the old bottle I was trying to replace!!</li>
            <li> I have thin short lashes but this mascara really does make them full without being goopy and stiff.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m not extreme careful my eyelashes become clumped.  </li>
            <li> It is incredibly long lasting and provides me with ample length and volume.</li>
            <li> If you have naturally longer lashes that simply fade away because they&#x27;re too pale, this won&#x27;t be a big deal.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> While the mascara is soft, it is not full.  </li>
            <li> &#x27;N Soft, Very Black masacara last month.</li>
            <li> Expect a pretty subtle effect.</li>
            <li> Occasionally I try some other brand that I see advertised and am disappointed and come back to my old reliable Full N Soft.</li>
            <li> I have drank out of crazy straws that had better construction</li>
            <li> and I hope they never discontinue it because they have a life long customer in me.</li>
            <li> I order it every few months to replace my old one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a pity that Amazon doesn&#x27;t ship it anymore internationally.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for this product for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m too old for the clumpy, messy look in mascara.</li>
            <li> It does go on a little thicker than some other brands, but it usually goes on smoothly with minimal clumping.  </li>
            <li> I tried using a different brand for a time but ultimately swithced back to the Very Black.</li>
            <li> However it takes a long time to dry</li>
            <li> The mascara also takes a long time to set and dry.  </li>
            <li> I have strayed from time to time to try other mascaras but always seem to keep coming back to this one.</li>
            <li> Definitely leaves your lashes softer to the touch than other mascaras but nothing &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; about it.</li>
            <li> Unlike other mascaras that claim they don&#x27;t clump this one actually doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> The only other one that comes close is lancomes mascaras</li>
            <li> I try other brands and types and always go back to this</li>
            <li> I have VERY long lashes</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out your lashes or make them break off either.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually wear makeup, as it&#x27;s not really a good fit for my occupation.</li>
            <li> Since using this, I never pull an eyelash out and seriously, who wants their mascara to cause them eyelash loss?</li>
            <li> , It takes forever to dry</li>
            <li> Really bummed, cuz I keep hoping to find a less expensive mascara that I like as much as the Lancome, Clinique and Dior mascaras.</li>
            <li> This product does not live up to its name.  </li>
            <li> Several years ago I had some eyelashes actually break off because of a mascara that was too stiff.  </li>
            <li> I would go out for 2 hours and come back with dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> No matter how big the savings, it&#x27;s just not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> if one is cheaper, don&#x27;t worry that it won&#x27;t be dark enough.</li>
            <li> I had to use my eyelash comb after the first coat until I got the hang of a thin coat.</li>
            <li> What I like is that the head tapers down a bit, which helps to grab lashes nearer to the inner corners of my eyes and for lower lashes.</li>
            <li> I no longer bother purchasing or experimenting with other mascaras that tend to prove mostly hypes or too expensive to throw away after a few months.</li>
            <li> Lately I have had problems with it clumping even when new.</li>
            <li> all in all, there is nothing here to recommend, and all the other minor points become moot, because burning is not acceptable.  </li>
            <li> Very black and long lasting</li>
            <li> I wanted to love it so badly.</li>
            <li> My lashes actually feel conditioned after using this for a few days.  </li>
            <li> The brush is really fluffy but short</li>
            <li> Dried out in ghe tube after three weeks I only used this item once and threw the tube away.</li>
            <li> It is getting harder to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I have tried a wide variety of mascaras.  </li>
            <li> Nothing flashy or WOW, but soft and touchable.</li>
            <li> However this arrived thicker than normal and was difficult to apply...as if it were old or partially dried out.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, long lashes naturally.  </li>
            <li> If I cry, or swim, I don&#x27; have to worry about black streaks running down my face (as long as you don&#x27;t rub your eyes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every other department store name brand</li>
            <li> (CK one my other staple).</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t need to hassle with other tricks.</li>
            <li> I did a test with L&#x27;Oreal on one side and Maybelline on the other, and both felt crispy once dried.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I like the shape of the brush, and it seems to coat my lashes with fewer strokes than some other brands.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and it doesn&#x27;t leave clumps like other mascaras.  </li>
            <li> It does not clump and divides each eyelash from the other.  </li>
            <li> have used this mascara for years because my lashes break with other brands</li>
            <li> It has never irritated my eyes like other types I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I have wasted enough money on trying other mascaras and I won&#x27;t waste anymore.</li>
            <li> Product has changed in the last year, I now fine it too thick and very difficult to apply to lashes</li>
            <li> Makes lashes look very thick and they are not stiff at all.  </li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff, but she was having a hard time finding it locally.</li>
            <li> get complements on my lashes often, and when I tell people I use a cheap ole drugstore mascara that&#x27;s been around for years and years, people are shocked.</li>
            <li> At least when I buy it at the drug store I can take it back</li>
            <li> You absolutely cannot go wrong with this mascara.</li>
            <li> I prefer dramatic but natural results and this delivers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Brownish Black works well with lighter eyes for a daytime</li>
            <li> But, I&#x27;ve never had raccoon eyes from a little rain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I never end up with thickly caked lashes and the mascara is thick enough to coat each lash and not coat groups of lashes in to one bulky mess.  </li>
            <li> Recently, I&#x27;ve been annoyed with the flaking of that product and decided to venture out.</li>
            <li> and this is one of the few that does not irritate them.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it everyday for a year.</li>
            <li> but after that it became clumpy and messy.</li>
            <li> and I have been using this for a few years.  </li>
            <li> plus it doesn&#x27;t make them spidery or messy looking.</li>
            <li> but I bought this for the few times I do.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like a heavy make up</li>
            <li> waste.</li>
            <li> It makes your lashes really look &amp;#34;full and soft&amp;#34; and definitely not clumpy which is what I hate.</li>
            <li> It is extremely buildable and is the least clumpy mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> It does not make your lashes stiff or crunchy, there are never any clumps, and it doesn&#x27;t flake off during the day.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s definitely not going to give you dramatic lashes.</li>
            <li> Why haven&#x27;t I been singing the praises of this little beauty of a mascara?!  </li>
            <li> But I realized that after a certain amount of time, like 3-4 weeks, it starts flaking badly and irritates my eyes.</li>
            <li> so I will have to toss it out, which as you know winds up being expensive if you have to do it several times.  </li>
            <li> I usually use waterproof but it doesn&#x27;t wash off as well as this does.</li>
            <li> This mascara does not give my lashes a curl (very few do), so I use my Shu Uemura lash curler when I want that look.  </li>
            <li> It does not clump, flake, or smear, and it does not give me hard crusty lashes.  </li>
            <li> I just take it as a queue to replace the inexpensive mascara since you&#x27;re supposed to rotate out mascaras at least every 3 months or so for the health of your eyes.</li>
            <li> It might not work for you, but at least it won&#x27;t cost you a fortune to find out.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the shipping process caused it to be thick, if the product formula has changed, or if the mascara came from expired inventory.  </li>
            <li> I just know I&#x27;m not very happy with it.</li>
            <li> No more!  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it seems mascara is always either \\&quot;natural\\&quot; - as in, basically invisible - or \\&quot;glam\\&quot; - thick, black, emphatic but gloppy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush is not evenly fluffy and has some weird indentations.</li>
            <li> Definitely give this a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> When I want impact I do three coats, and if I want outrageous drama, I use a mascara primer first.</li>
            <li> : Darkens the lashes and thickens the thin tips</li>
            <li> but I am getting tired of having to scrape the brush off before applying.</li>
            <li> They look a lot like false eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;black-brown\\&quot; is so close to black that it&#x27;s impossible to tell them apart on the lashes, so</li>
            <li> but they are way too expensive.  </li>
            <li> Not Great - I find this to be clumpy :(</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> and I know when a mascara has gone bad.</li>
            <li> mascara clumps terribly, even worse then</li>
            <li> but those flakes... :(</li>
            <li> It beats all the expensive mascaras out there!!</li>
            <li> I used this brand for over 15 years, I have used others and hate the clumps and firmness of the mascara.  </li>
            <li> but I do hate that it starts to flake on occasion.</li>
            <li> and it hurts BAD if I cry!  </li>
            <li> Perhaps others may like this, but I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This was truly an awful purchase.</li>
            <li> This is the worst mascara I have ever had.</li>
            <li> Awful mascara.</li>
            <li> This is the worst mascara I have used.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My favorite mascara! :D</li>
            <li> I like the lash appearance but it flakes off after several hours.  Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I have been an avid Covergirl LashBlast user for over 6 years. Recently, I&#x27;ve been annoyed with the flaking of that product and decided to venture out. My first impression of this was that I didn&#x27;t like it. After a few uses, I realized that the best way to use this mascara is to curl your lashes BEFORE using it to avoid any of it rubbing off or making a mess when you blink. It has been a refreshing transition because I will say that this product makes my lashes look much longer, does not clump, and feels weightless. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Good mascara, very soft brush. Applies smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use anything but Full &#x27;N Soft. I&#x27;ve tried every other department store name brand and this one is THE BEST. It doesn&#x27;t dry out your lashes or make them break off either. I have VERY long lashes and this does the job to accentuate them with rich color without clumping or irritation. LOVE THIS MASCARA and I hope they never discontinue it because they have a life long customer in me.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my sister in a different city, because I want her to try it. It&#x27;s my favorite mascara. It&#x27;s lengthening and natural-looking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for years and it&#x27;s my favorite. It very rarely clumps, makes my lashes look great and feel healthy. I&#x27;ve tried many others and this is the one I always go back to.</li>
            <li> It looks ok when you initially put it on, then within an hr or so the lashes start to look dull (not much length or volume).</li>
            <li> Not Great - I find this to be clumpy :(</li>
            <li> This has been my go to mascara for years! Easily layered and I love that it doesn&#x27;t get stiff</li>
            <li> It is good that I am not the kind of woman who would ever return make up to the retailer otherwise I would have already requested a full refund for my recently purchased Maybelline New York Full &#x27;N Soft Mascara in Very Black.  The biggest offense would be the  wand. The stick is overly flexible and not in a good way.. The mascara tube is made from an incredibly soft plastic, reminiscent to a child&#x27;s toy. I have drank out of crazy straws that had better construction then this mascara tube and wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mascara clumps terribly, even worse then some dollar brands. I would never consider using a second coat on my lashes. This was truly an awful purchase. I am going to stick with the Maybelline Define-a Lash mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S The Full &#x27;N Soft is a more expensive drugstore mascara at my local Rite Aid it retailed at $7.69 Ouch!  I am only thankful that I purchased it while it was 40% off.</li>
            <li> Love it natural looking and easy to remove with soap and water</li>
            <li> Nice small brush and goes on well.</li>
            <li> Good everyday mascara that I use when I want to be able to take it off easily and I know I won&#x27;t be in a high heat situation. Otherwise I stick with tube type (love love Blinc) or combo tube/waterproof type (CK one my other staple). This is nice and soft (as the name suggests) and good for running out to the store or times when again I want to be able to take it off quickly. Like other basic mascara&#x27;s I would never use this on my lower lashes as you&#x27;ll get smudges under your eyes (I live in Florida too hot and humid!).</li>
            <li> I like this mascara, it&#x27;s not the very best but its a great backup for the price.</li>
            <li> I loved this formula when it first came out years ago and like most women, I&#x27;ve used so many others in the intervening years.  This is my &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; favorite find.  How grand is it to have soft lashes without the clumping and flaking?  Very grand, indeed!  My makeup order arrived 4 days after placing the order, delivered by the Post Office to my Jersey City mail box.  Thanks to all, hope this review encourages others to try Soft Lash.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara and I have tried a lot. I am really into makeup and like trying new things. I actually bought this when I was trying different things for my wedding makeup and this is what I used. It makes your lashes really look &amp;#34;full and soft&amp;#34; and definitely not clumpy which is what I hate. I have wasted enough money on trying other mascaras and I won&#x27;t waste anymore. This one is the best!</li>
            <li> best mascara out there!</li>
            <li> Love this mascara. Can&#x27;t get it in New Zealand anymore, so was thrilled to be able to order online. brush is fabulous and lashes look great !</li>
            <li> This is a very low clump mascara formula, which is great for everyday wear.  My lashes are long, but straight and this mascara does a great job darkening them and providing a bit of fullness and length.  Its wand head is full, but not as full as the wand on Maybelline Colossal and is longer than the one on Maybelline Collossal.  What I like is that the head tapers down a bit, which helps to grab lashes nearer to the inner corners of my eyes and for lower lashes. It does just an okay job at seperating your lashes.  Sometimes I use Maybelline Stilleto to seperate and lengthen my lashes and then throw a couple of coats of Full &amp; Soft over that to thicken a bit (no clumping results).      As mentioned before, this is a great everyday mascara (for the office, running errands, casual days, etc).  On average, I use about two full coats per eye for everyday wear and that gets the job done.  However, for more drama, I find I have to add 4 coats(fortunately, it does not clump).  In situations where I want more drama, I turn to other mascara, as using 4 coats is a waste of product in my opinion, so I use a mascara that is made for more drama. This mascara does not give my lashes a curl (very few do), so I use my Shu Uemura lash curler when I want that look.  Another aspect is that my lashes have a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; look to them, which lends itself well to its \\&quot;Full and Soft\\&quot; name.  I would not go so far as to say this is a true volumizing mascara, but it does give my lashes a bit of fullness, just perfect for casual days.</li>
            <li> This makes my eyelashes look great!  Doesn&#x27;t come off as easily as I would like, but other than that, I really love this product.</li>
            <li> easy to apply, nice definition &amp; doesn&#x27;t clump. won&#x27;t add too much volume or length, but creates a natural look instead. for me it&#x27;s totally worth the price. great choice for beginners.</li>
            <li> best mascara and a bang for your buck!</li>
            <li> it flaked on me. I would go out for 2 hours and come back with dark circles under my eyes. I looked like a raccoon! It could have been because it wasn&#x27;t the waterproof formula. I wanted to love it so badly. It looked and felt sooo natural!... but those flakes... :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years and have always loved it. I personally think this is the best drugstore brand mascara that does not clump/weigh down your eyelashes. Definitely give this a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed. (Side note: I do not like the waterproof version, it does not apply the same/clumps a lot easier).</li>
            <li> I used this brand for over 15 years, I have used others and hate the clumps and firmness of the mascara.  This feels natural on your eyelashes and looks great.</li>
            <li> I have been using this mascara for years.  I have very sensitive eyes and this is one of the few that does not irritate them.  I get compliments on a regular basis of how great my eyelashes look and have even had people as me if I have eyelash extensions.</li>
            <li> My go-to mascara is a higher end brand that costs four times as much as this mascara. In an effort to save money, I saw the great reviews on this mascara and even a better price, so I decided to try it out and alternate with my other mascara to make it last longer. I was actually really impressed. Here is my opinion:&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1. Obviously the price can&#x27;t be beat. I added this to my subscribe &amp; save order plus there was an additional coupon, so it was very cheap!&lt;br /&gt;2. It doesn&#x27;t clump. The formula is thinner and goes on smooth without clumping.&lt;br /&gt;3. Buildable coverage. You can put on as little or as much as you want and it still doesn&#x27;t clump and looks very natural.&lt;br /&gt;4. The wand does a good job of separating lashes.&lt;br /&gt;5. Lashes are not stiff and brittle. They really are &amp;#34;full &amp; soft&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;6. Mascara doesn&#x27;t flake off or run by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;7. This mascara washes off very easily with soap and water or with make up remover.&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1. I can&#x27;t get as much volume with this mascara than with others I&#x27;ve tried. If you want a more standout, dramatic look, this may not be the mascara for you.&lt;br /&gt;2. Because the formula is thinner, it seems to transfer to my eyelids more easily when I&#x27;m applying the mascara.&lt;br /&gt;3. Not everyone cares about this, but if you&#x27;re trying to stay away from parabens in your cosmetics, then you want to stay away from this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this is a great everyday mascara that&#x27;s easy on the budget!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! Once I found it, I never used another. It does not make your lashes stiff or crunchy, there are never any clumps, and it doesn&#x27;t flake off during the day. Removal is very easy, and because of this, it doesn&#x27;t cause you to lose eyelashes in the process. It will make your lashes look very full, dark, and beautiful.</li>
            <li> my fave mascara from maybelline! cheap and good. lush lashes with volume definitely! prefers washable version for ease of removal.</li>
            <li> I adore this mascara and have since I was in high school. As a make up (especially mascara and eyeliner) junkie this stuff is unbeatable. It makes lashes full and soft! Hmmm... coincidence with the name? I have tried MANY drug store and high end mascaras and this one looks natural, but amped up. Lashes are soft enough to give butterfly kisses and durable enough to last all day with minimal flaking. I end up going back to this every time.</li>
            <li> I would say this is the best value mascara for thin eyelashes that doesn&#x27;t clump. I have been buying it for years and can&#x27;t say I have any desire to switch. Fingers crossed they don&#x27;t stop making it!</li>
            <li> I have been buying this mascara for many years and I love it. Easy on and even easier off. If it is waterproof you are looking for this is NOT for you. It comes off with just water and a washcloth.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara of all time. Looks great wether wear it on my real lashes and or false lashes</li>
            <li> Greatest mascara ever! I&#x27;ve tried others but this has remained my go to mascara for years. It makes my light, short lashes look thick and lush but not fake or cakey. I like how easy fool proof the application is and I don&#x27;t need to hassle with other tricks. I prefer dramatic but natural results and this delivers. I think the brush is the real magic. I also wear contacts and other mascaras have either caused irritation or lash loss, which isn&#x27;t fun when you have contacts. I&#x27;m terrified they will discontinue this line because it&#x27;s the best mascara I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Great basic mascara, I keep ordering every few months to replace my old tube.  What a bargain, and it never runs.</li>
            <li> Makes lashes look very thick and they are not stiff at all.  Lashes feel soft.</li>
            <li> This has been my main one for years. Nice even color.</li>
            <li> This is just a great standby mascara for an every-day natural look. Nothing flashy or WOW, but soft and touchable.</li>
            <li> This mascara is good in that looks more natural and less clumpy than some.  However it takes a long time to dry and I find that if I&#x27;m not very careful  after applying that I end up with mascara on my upper and lower eyelids from my lashes touching them.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the brush.  It gets all over my eyelids.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara ever.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  I have been using it ever since Sarah-Michelle Gellar first hocked in 2000(?).  A friend of mine was in to Buffy the Vampire Slayer and soon, so was I.  I think Gellar is gorgeous, even though she&#x27;s got an odd nose, and while she was Maybelline&#x27;s spokesmodel, I tried just about anything she modeled.  This was the one product that has been faithful.  It goes on nicely, builds well, doesn&#x27;t clump or make my lashes feel crispy.  I have tried many higher end mascaras (via Sephora&#x27;s trial-sized mascara kit) and always come back to this.  I hope they never discontinue it or &amp;#34;improve&amp;#34; the formula.</li>
            <li> Only mascara I consistantly wear. Doesnt give lashes a &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; look. Lashes are soft but bold. No irritation (unless accidently slept in) no flaking, easy to remove at night.</li>
            <li> HOLY GRAIL MASCARA!!&lt;br /&gt; I have been using this for two years. It is the most incredible mascara I have ever used. For me, nicely done eyelashes are a must. This formula takes some getting used to. I apply a few swipes, comb through with an old wand and then wait a few seconds before adding more. I get incredible results, ranging from natural looking to night out. It&#x27;s very versatile. You have to be patient and good at mascara to get this to work well; you cant just quickly dab it on the lashes. I usually spend about 5 minutes getting it just right. And it STAYS ON. I have gone swimming with it on and it rarely comes off. After swimming underwater it doesn&#x27;t clump my lashes either- this isn&#x27;t even the waterproof version. It is a tad hard to get off at night, as it takes more than just water. I use lotion on a cottonball and it works like a charm to remove any residue. I have never experienced eye irritation because the staying power is so amazing, The only time it&#x27;s ever shed is when I used a 6 month old one in a pinch. The lashes also aren&#x27;t stiff, theyre pretty flexible with it on. I&#x27;ve tried so many mascaras and this one can not be beat. Although I do have naturally dark and full lashes already (and am young) , so not sure how it would work on older people with shorter, more sparse lashes. Would absolutely recommend to anybody, though. Cannot say enough good things.&lt;br /&gt;The first pic is this product at work on a natural day, the second is after swimming (underwater) on a hot day.</li>
            <li> i have small eye lashes and not too full. this mascara leaves my lashes looking full and the color makes the see thick..it dosnt separate my lashes to the point where they look like a rake.. and after the mascara dries my lashes feel soft</li>
            <li> I have been using it everyday for a year. Very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually wear makeup, as it&#x27;s not really a good fit for my occupation. I decided to try this out, and I like the way it works. It doesn&#x27;t leave my lashes think or clumpy. The company has fast shipping and great packaging.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara ever! It never leaves clumps. It lives up to it&#x27;s name! It really makes my lashes look naturally full and soft! Love! I hope they make this forever!</li>
            <li> Love this Full &amp; Soft. I have thin short lashes but this mascara really does make them full without being goopy and stiff. Does improve the length as well. Although the product stays put, it removes without pulling out lashes. Please, Maybelline, do not discontinue! Amazon - thanks for making this an Add On!</li>
            <li> I was hopeful when I bought this mascara that it would not bother my eyes . . . it did.  I experimented with it by wearing it for several days and then when my eyes began to feel like there was grit in them and stinging, I switched to another mascara which did not bother my eyes and gave the Maybelline another try to be sure the irritation was not from another cause. However it was the mascara so I will have to toss it out, which as you know winds up being expensive if you have to do it several times.  At least when I buy it at the drug store I can take it back so I am not likely to buy mascara online again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the application is concerned the product does give good coverage although it tends to clump, which seems to be a problem with many mascaras.</li>
            <li> Why haven&#x27;t I been singing the praises of this little beauty of a mascara?!  I get courted away by $30+ mascaras that flake or never wash off!  Even the drugstore brands lured me away with their fancy brushes and promises of butterfly lashes.  No more!  This stuff doesn&#x27;t flake, is inky and black, but can be removed w gentle soap and water.  My lashes actually feel conditioned after using this for a few days.  Do yourself a favor and buy this!</li>
            <li> I tend to use Lancome and Dior mascaras, but thought I&#x27;d try a cheaper mascara now that my husband&#x27;s been laid off. I decided to try this one since it&#x27;s received a lot of hype. Perhaps others may like this, but I was very disappointed. Couldn&#x27;t even tell it was on. It didn&#x27;t lengthen nor volumize. So I&#x27;ll be returning it. Really bummed, cuz I keep hoping to find a less expensive mascara that I like as much as the Lancome, Clinique and Dior mascaras. Tried EyesByDesign and it gave great lengthening and volumizing but not a fan of the comb plus it flakes and it hurts BAD if I cry!  If you are someone like me who has fallen in love with the mascaras by Lancome, Clinique, Dior, and you&#x27;ve found a less expensive mascara you love that lengthens, volumizes and doesn&#x27;t flake....please post what mascara you love here. I&#x27;d love others&#x27; inputs!</li>
            <li> The brush is really fluffy but short so it doesn&#x27;t poke you in the eye, and I get really good results with it. My lashes look long ad full and they really do feel soft to the touch - almost as if I&#x27;m not wearing mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that you kind of have to apply a lot if you like a really lashy look like I do.</li>
            <li> This Full and Soft Mascara definitely lives up to its name! It gives your lashes a natural look, but more amped-up and defined. When I&#x27;m not in search of an almost-false-lashes look, this is what I&#x27;ll go for! Very, very good product!</li>
            <li> Love the product and will order again. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Wish they still made this product. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is my great basic everyday mascara. I order it every few months to replace my old one.Priced perfect, never smudges or runs off. It feels natural on your eyes.</li>
            <li> This mascara is great for giving you that natural look! Someone told me it didn&#x27;t even look like I was wearing mascara! It does exactly what it says and gives your eyelashes a nice full and soft look. I am very happy with my purchase and will continue buying this mascara after I run out!</li>
            <li> It is a nice product but burned my eyes when I used mu normal make up remover.  Gave it to a friend who loves it.</li>
            <li> This product does not live up to its name.  While the mascara is soft, it is not full.  To get a desired full effect, I have to apply the mascara at least three times.  The mascara also takes a long time to set and dry.  I will not be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> I always go back to this mascara. I love the look it gives. Very soft and fluttery, my lashes but x10 better and not fake and clumpy looking like other mascaras. No gross smell either and I have no problems with flaking or smudging, lasts all day. I also have the waterproof version and it works but smells. Love both. Will always repurchase.</li>
            <li> Love this budget mascara. Good shipping, no problems.</li>
            <li> I have blonde eyelashes and this covers the best. Hope they never quit making it. My lashes are coarse also  works Wonderful.</li>
            <li> I love Maybelline Full n Soft but in the waterproof formula. The non waterproof mascara flakes off.</li>
            <li> This is the worst mascara I have ever had. Doesn&#x27;t really go on very well&lt;br /&gt;Does Clump a lot too.  I won&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
            <li> The spooly could be a little better but that&#x27;s what the spoolies are for in brush sets so no biggie.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff, but she was having a hard time finding it locally. They either were always out of it or they didn&#x27;t carry it, so I told her I knew were I could get it and sure enough its here in short order and she&#x27;s happy. I&#x27;m happy that she&#x27;s happy!</li>
            <li> You absolutely cannot go wrong with this mascara. Not expensive and it doesn&#x27;t need to be. It beats all the expensive mascaras out there!!</li>
            <li> BEST mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.  I recently had been following the advice of some beauty bloggers and tried a couple other brands only to be disappointed by their clumping, or inability to give me long, beautiful looking lashes (mostly clumping - yuck).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I came back to my old favorite and it&#x27;s just as good as ever.  This mascara goes on really well-- no clumping even if you slide the wand through your lashes a few times (for complete, awesome coverage).  It makes my eyes look great, doesn&#x27;t smudge for me.  I have a friend who says she gets raccoon eyes from this-- so she uses their waterproof version and loves it.  So if you touch your eyes a lot or have allergies/watery eyes, maybe go waterproof.  I don&#x27;t prefer waterproof because I like that this comes off easy with soap and water without need for a special makeup remover.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara.  It goes on nicely, and really makes your lashes appear fuller, while keeping them feeling soft, not bristly.  I have been a fan of this mascara for years and will continue to use it.  Love it!  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. I know this because I&#x27;ve purchased it from drugstores and used it before.&lt;br /&gt;I will never ever buy mascara from Amazon. No matter how big the savings, it&#x27;s just not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;The mascara that was sent to me was so old that the &amp;#34;old mascara smell&amp;#34; had kick in. I&#x27;m a mascara junkie and I know when a mascara has gone bad.The product was brand new, but the mascara itself was just too old. And of course, it&#x27;s not eligible for returns.</li>
            <li> Nope.  Purchased it a couple weeks ago and every time I&#x27;ve used it, about 5 times, it has made my eyes burn and water.  Like the bestseller and highly-rated Maybelline Great Lash (in the pink and green bottle), this also burns my eyes.  I&#x27;ve read many reviews of the Great Lash, and this happens with quite a few people.  No idea what ingredient(s) are doing this, but consistent every time, and it doesn&#x27;t happen with my L&#x27;Oreal mascaras.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the rest of its performance, I find this to be nothing special.  If it truly made eyelashes full and soft, I&#x27;d be happy, but I don&#x27;t notice either of these things.  It seems quite sparse in what it deposits on the eyelashes.  I did a test with L&#x27;Oreal on one side and Maybelline on the other, and both felt crispy once dried.&lt;br /&gt;I do like that the brush is fiber, and not hard plastic like so many are nowadays.  It goes on easily and comfortably, though I would prefer the wand to be curved and longer.&lt;br /&gt;So all in all, there is nothing here to recommend, and all the other minor points become moot, because burning is not acceptable.  It claims to be hypoallergenic but it is not.</li>
            <li> I have only recently discovered this mascara and I like it very much. It&#x27;s perfect for naturally longer but thin lashes, it&#x27;s quite black and I don&#x27;t need to apply innumerable layers to make my light brown lashes intense black. It doesn&#x27;t crumble and it&#x27;s easy to wash off. What else to ask?) The only downside is that I live in a hot climate and it does sometimes leave some traces under my lower lashes (which are long and maybe that&#x27;s the readon) but it&#x27;s not that critical. It&#x27;s really a pity that Amazon doesn&#x27;t ship it anymore internationally.</li>
            <li> The mascara I have been searching for!! Brush is great, par duct is great. No clumping, goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> Love the brush but too much mascara comes out with the brush and must be wiped off a bit or you will have mascara in places you didn&#x27;t intend.</li>
            <li> This mascara is just okay.  No length or volume that I can see.  It does leave your lashes feeling soft so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> I like this because it looks very natural.  I have fine lashes and this helps.  I also really like Revlon 3D photoready mascara.</li>
            <li> Since the 80s, I&#x27;ve been such a sucker for marketing gimmicks and tried any product that sounded like the latest newer and better. I&#x27;ve tried mascaras that cost up to 10 times the Full &#x27;N Soft, but I always ended up coming back. This mascara makes your lashes look thicker but natural without clumps when opened fresh, but it does tend to get clumpy after a while with repeat air exposures. I just take it as a queue to replace the inexpensive mascara since you&#x27;re supposed to rotate out mascaras at least every 3 months or so for the health of your eyes. For a non-waterproof mascara, it holds curls relatively well for my very straight stubborn lashes. I prefer this over another Maybelline old classic Great Lash. I no longer bother purchasing or experimenting with other mascaras that tend to prove mostly hypes or too expensive to throw away after a few months.</li>
            <li> There is so much to love about this mascara. It is extremely buildable and is the least clumpy mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. Even after 4 coats it doesn&#x27;t get spidery. It does lengthen and volumize and noticeable amount but it&#x27;s definitely not going to give you dramatic lashes. This is more for every day</li>
            <li> I wanted it to look natural and was happy the first few times I used it because it was easy to apply and was soft and natural looking but after that it became clumpy and messy. It easily smudges because it&#x27;s not waterproof. It is opposite of it&#x27;s name so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like this mascara. I don&#x27;t use mascara every day but when I do I like it to be easy to apply. This Maybelline product compares favorably to much more expensive mascaras I have used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mascara to be used maybe in daily basis, since it gives a natural look, that&#x27;s all</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this mascara! It does the job, washes off easily and doesn&#x27;t clump (in my experience).</li>
            <li> I have health &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; going on and this mascara is the only one I have found that doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes or flake into them.</li>
            <li> will always use and always buy. makes my lashes look fantastic</li>
            <li> This is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; mascara.  It does go on a little thicker than some other brands, but it usually goes on smoothly with minimal clumping.  I like the shape of the brush, and it seems to coat my lashes with fewer strokes than some other brands.  I have tried several others, but always end up coming back to this one.</li>
            <li> Product has changed in the last year, I now fine it too thick and very difficult to apply to lashes</li>
            <li> Really like this stuff for a natural day look. Noclumps at all!  Only downfall is that it will smudge/run on lower lashes so I just use a different mascara on them.</li>
            <li> They took these off the shelf in Canada and I was heartbroken. I&#x27;ve never been able to find mascara that doesn&#x27;t clump and make your lashes look like spider legs.  This mascara is so great. It&#x27;s light and does not clump.  Love!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this mascara for soooo many years. As I&#x27;ve made more money, I&#x27;ve tried other more expensive mascaras, but I keep coming back to this one because I love it so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on nice and thick, but comes off super-easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to use it till I die.</li>
            <li> Very soft and comfortable, it does not make your eye lashes feel like rocks or leave little black flakes around your eyes as long as you do not rub them. The mascara can be a little thick and clumpy, sometimes it will apply too much but using a clean brush or a little bit of tissue paper will smooth away the excess and leave your lashes looking dark and natural.</li>
            <li> This is an okay mascara. No clumps. Nothing special over most of the others available. Very soft and clean application!</li>
            <li> My go-to drugstore mascara!!  I usually use waterproof but it doesn&#x27;t wash off as well as this does. LOVE my lashes!</li>
            <li> The never fail good old soft and full still thickens and darkens&lt;br /&gt;Ns my lashes better than any other mascara I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I really love it. Great product</li>
            <li> Clumpy! when i apply it, tons of mascara gets up on my eyelid and its very chunky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this mascara for 14 years. It has the absolute best brush.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite, stand-by mascara.  I&#x27;ve tried numerous brands and price ranges over the years and I still come back to this one.  The combination of formula and applicator just work for me somehow.  I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but it does tend to clump and smudge under my eyes. It&#x27;s alright on clean eyelashes, not as clumpy.</li>
            <li> Price was great and product easy to apply and lasts. No smudging.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> I really love the Maybelline New York Full &#x27;N Soft Mascara.  It is a very reasonably priced mascara that really performs.  It does not make my lashes feel like I coated them with cement.  I will say that I do not get the length that I would like but I have yet to find a mascara that will both lengthen and increase volume without some other kind of drawback like clumps, etc.  This mascara increases the volume of my lashes without looking spidery.  They look a lot like false eyelashes.  This is my favorite mascara at the moment and I have been using this for a few years.  I have strayed from time to time to try other mascaras but always seem to keep coming back to this one.</li>
            <li> Very soft, but not very full.</li>
            <li> I am happy to buy an excellent product in the speed of delivery thanks to the seller</li>
            <li> Definitely leaves your lashes softer to the touch than other mascaras but nothing &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; about it.</li>
            <li> This is a regular lipstick, in the shape of a pencil.  The directions suggest using it on the inner area of your lips and then spreading it toward the outside with the rubber tip.  Honestly, you can do the same thing with any lipstick at all, and this color (plum) was a bright red color.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara from now on.</li>
            <li> For the $5 and under price tag, this is one heck of a mascara. I have reached for it consistently over some of my higher end products. This is my daily go-to for work or a day of shopping. It is incredibly long lasting and provides me with ample length and volume. The color is also a fantastic black that is both intense and soft at the same time!</li>
            <li> As good as any expensive mascara I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Awful mascara. It clumped on my lashes. Maybe it was expired. I don&#x27;t know. I threw it in the trash.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite mascaras! It makes my eyelashes look darker, thicker, and fuller! plus it doesn&#x27;t make them spidery or messy looking.</li>
            <li> FAVORITE for a DECADE!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally wear mascara but I bought this for the few times I do. The product seems to be good and natural. I like this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent everyday mascara - the best I&#x27;ve found yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used this mascara because I like that it washes off fairly easily and isnt super stiff but I do hate that it starts to flake on occasion.</li>
            <li> This is far and away my favorite mascara.  Unlike other mascaras that claim they don&#x27;t clump this one actually doesn&#x27;t.  I have been using it for years.  Occasionally I try some other brand that I see advertised and am disappointed and come back to my old reliable Full N Soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but no more than that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. I had switched colors to the brownish-black but have been unsuccesful finding that in my local store or online here. I tried using a different brand for a time but ultimately swithced back to the Very Black. I love the way it makes my lashes look. Plus, I&#x27;ve had allergies to product before and this seems to work well.</li>
            <li> My mascara of choice!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and it doesn&#x27;t leave clumps like other mascaras.  It makes my lashes look full and long.</li>
            <li> A decent mascara option.  I have very thick, long lashes naturally.  That makes different mascara options that have a lot of &amp;#34;thickening&amp;#34; in them look very clumpy and unnatural.  I did not have this issue with this mascara.</li>
            <li> Awesome mascara...I love it!</li>
            <li> This product arrived clumpy and almost seemed like it was used. I think it may have been rather old and needed some use before working. The brush is not evenly fluffy and has some weird indentations. It didn&#x27;t last very long. I would have been better off to buy it brand new at a local store. Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> There is less mascara in this bottle than there is in the old bottle I was trying to replace!!</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years and really like it better than others I can find locally.</li>
            <li> Its not my favorite, but I really like the brush!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 10 years. It&#x27;s not clumpy, it lasts forever, it doesn&#x27;t flake, it&#x27;s easy to wash off (even if you are a heavy mascara wearer like me :) and its affordable. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do if they ever disconntinue it! LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using full and soft for years. I like that it doesn&#x27;t smudge unless I cry or have on lotion. I love that it washes off with water.</li>
            <li> I have used several of these, on recommendation that it is very good for the price. But I realized that after a certain amount of time, like 3-4 weeks, it starts flaking badly and irritates my eyes.</li>
            <li> I was having trouble finding this great mascara in local stores.  So happy to find I could get it from Amazon! So convenient! Now I can again use this product that doesn&#x27;t turn my lashes into caked-up clumps just makes them darker and more visible.  It is also easy to remove.</li>
            <li> This mascara I have liked and been buying for years.  However this arrived thicker than normal and was difficult to apply...as if it were old or partially dried out.  I don&#x27;t know if the shipping process caused it to be thick, if the product formula has changed, or if the mascara came from expired inventory.  I just know I&#x27;m not very happy with it.</li>
            <li> LADIES. Let&#x27;s get real. We&#x27;re all looking for that perfect mascara that makes our lashes fluffy but full, natural looking but glamorous - basically, we want to look like we rolled out of bed with eyelashes ready for a makeup commercial. Unfortunately, it seems mascara is always either \\&quot;natural\\&quot; - as in, basically invisible - or \\&quot;glam\\&quot; - thick, black, emphatic but gloppy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter this mascara. I don&#x27;t want to say that this is a panacea, because everyone and their lashes are different. But this goes on easily, doesn&#x27;t coat your lashes in black goo, looks relatively un-made-up but still makes your eyelashes thick, bold, and full. I also can re-apply in the evening if I&#x27;m going out and it radically enhances the look, turning it into an evening ready mascara that is still not spiky. For me, this is huge. I can&#x27;t stand it when my lashes stick together and clump, or when mascara keeps flaking off and piling under my eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other awesome thing about this is that it removes extremely easily (with soap or makeup remover; it doesn&#x27;t flake off). Since using this, I never pull an eyelash out and seriously, who wants their mascara to cause them eyelash loss? Talk about contradictory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically . . . I think this is the best thing ever. It might not work for you, but at least it won&#x27;t cost you a fortune to find out.</li>
            <li> Just fine. Nice that it&#x27;s not very clump-y, but this is also goes on really light, which may or may not be for you. Expect a pretty subtle effect.</li>
            <li> This is an okay mascara. It tends to run out quickly and sometimes has an odd consistency, but it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> This mascara is a nice basic way to darken my lashes and fill them out just a bit. I don&#x27;t like a heavy make up look, this is just enough to look like I&#x27;ve fixed myself up but am not spending all morning on myself.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like it but it felt more like putting black shoe polish on than mascara!  Very smudgey - I&#x27;ve got a fairly steady hand and still managed to get Mr. Hankey spots all around my eyes.  The color was very dark and was soft as promised; however, it took multiple coats to build up to a wearable look which frequently became spidery.  I value an easy to apply mascara and this simply was not it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t lengthen lashed or thicken them. basically just makes them darker. waste.</li>
            <li> This is the worst mascara I have used.  It is very dry and clumps way too much!</li>
            <li> This mascara can go on a little clumpy at times but for the most part it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Like others here, I have tried many drug store brands, but always go back to this one. It makes your lashes longer and it separates them, so that they fan out a bit. No clumps here! Very pretty and natural-looking. Works really well with cat eye makeup and makes your eyes look bigger. I hope they never stop making it.</li>
            <li> I particularly like the large fluffy brush. Full coverage, while not being clumpy.</li>
            <li> This is the only mascara I will use.  The only other one that comes close is lancomes mascaras but they are way too expensive.  This one is just as good if not better than Lancomes mascaras.  It does not clump and divides each eyelash from the other.  It gives full and soft eyelashes just like the name.  I have used this soley for about 5 or 6 years now.  This is after trying many high end department store mascaras. I hope Maybelline never discontinues this product its truly a winner!</li>
            <li> I love how soft and full (no pun intended) this makes my lashes. It&#x27;s light but provides full coverage. I am a big fan of this mascara.</li>
            <li> This mascara does a great job with lengthening lashes with no clumps. As a contact lens wearer, this is also a great mascara for that issue as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for a decade and have no intention of switching. Ever. I still remember the commercial with Sarah Michelle Gellar even :P&lt;br /&gt;It delivers on it&#x27;s promises to not flake or clump and to feel more natural. That I love. I&#x27;ve read many reviews that say it doesn&#x27;t build drama. When I want impact I do three coats, and if I want outrageous drama, I use a mascara primer first. I have zero problems making this mascara go from every day to big night out and everywhere in between. It also washes off easily without black residue lingering around. I do not use the waterproof version though, so I have no idea how well (or not) it washes off.&lt;br /&gt;I get complements on my lashes often, and when I tell people I use a cheap ole drugstore mascara that&#x27;s been around for years and years, people are shocked. But it&#x27;s 100% true. I love this stuff. I wish I could fine the brownish black in stores, but I can&#x27;t find anywhere that carries it but here. I like the very black, but sometimes I want a more natural look and like the brown/black.</li>
            <li> Best mascara! And this is two bucks cheaper then you&#x27;ll find anywhere!!</li>
            <li> I have tried tons of mascara, yet I always come back to this one.  This mascara is amazing.  I almost NEVER get clumps, the brush is PERFECT so I never end up with thickly caked lashes and the mascara is thick enough to coat each lash and not coat groups of lashes in to one bulky mess.  I just love it!  I just wish Amazon carried more of the brownish shades of this mascara... I would highly recommend this mascara to anyone.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 15 years now and have never found a decent alternative.</li>
            <li> Great natural looking mascara for someone like me ( almost 60 ). Does not clump and goes on easily.  Does not irritate my eyes at all.  My only wish is that they would go back to making a back/ brown shade again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this mascara for years and it never disappoints. Adds lots of length and volume to my lashes. The first couple applications from a brand new tube are pretty thin and light, but it will thicken and give you the desired results thereafter. I used to go through these tubes so quickly because they would dry out pretty fast... until a trick I learned: if your tube starts drying out, extend its life by adding 2 drops of contact solution/eye drops to the tube. It will instantly rehydrate it for continued use. I&#x27;ve been using the same tube for 10 months now by doing this! :)</li>
            <li> Honestly, this is just as good as really expensive mascaras I&#x27;ve tried.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This is really just average in my book</li>
            <li> I have tried like every mascara out there, and this is the one I always go back to. Looks great and natural, no clumping.</li>
            <li> This is just as described and I will be buying more when I need it</li>
            <li> A good everyday mascara.  It does it&#x27;s job, and it leaves your lashes soft.  It is a good around mascara.</li>
            <li> This has to be one of the best mascaras I have ever tried. There are absolutely no clumps when I use this mascara; I prefer the latter, as it stays on great yet washes off easily. It is perfect for everyday wear, and I would recommend highly to anyone.</li>
            <li> I usually love this mascara and have for years. I signed up for the subscribe and save on this Maybelline Full &#x27;N Soft, Very Black masacara last month. I received mine in the time it said, but it wasn&#x27;t exactly as pictured. Mine had a curved wand, which is not what is shown. I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it had I known that... The mascara worked okay, but I didn&#x27;t get the results I normally get from the straight wand.</li>
            <li> This mascara is always perfect.  Don&#x27;t use the waterproof...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brownish Black works well with lighter eyes for a daytime look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very Black gives a more intense lash for evening.</li>
            <li> I always seem to come back to this mascara after trying many others.  Now that I&#x27;m older, I want a mascara that gives me a more natural, soft look, and this does the trick.  It doesn&#x27;t clump, or smudge on me, and it&#x27;s always easy to remove.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll probably still try other mascaras to see how they are, but I&#x27;ll undoubtedly come back to this one!</li>
            <li> I received this mascara for christmas and I have been very happy with the results. This mascara gives me longer, more natural looking lashes, without all of the clumps!  And it works way better than some of the more expensive brans, for way less the cost!</li>
            <li> I do wish it stayed wetter in the tube but I love the way it thickens my lashes. The brush applicator is terrific. I don&#x27;t like waterproof because my lashes fall out. This last all day for me and washes off completely with soap and water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never flakes, never smudges.</li>
            <li> Several years ago I had some eyelashes actually break off because of a mascara that was too stiff.  This one is extremely soft, yet noticeable and natural.  I&#x27;ve used it for years - since that break-off incident.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I have ever tried and I tried tons. This doesn&#x27;t feel brittle or dry up lashes and flake off like most mascaras. Love this brush, it gets every lash very nicely. &amp;#34;Full N&#x27; Soft&amp;#34; indeed!! You won&#x27;t regret this one.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara and have been using it for years. I try other brands and types and always go back to this natural looking mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Won&#x27;t lengthen your lashes enough to look like falsies, and doesn&#x27;t build up super thick.  If you have naturally longer lashes that simply fade away because they&#x27;re too pale, this won&#x27;t be a big deal.  If you have short lashes, this one won&#x27;t give you much help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Darkens the lashes and thickens the thin tips so they&#x27;re more noticeable, without any clumps and very little flaking. If you have weepy eyes or cry easily, you&#x27;ll absolutely want the waterproof kind, since this version washes off super easy.  But, I&#x27;ve never had raccoon eyes from a little rain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara doesn&#x27;t clump up as quickly in the tube as other brands and types. It goes on as smoothly on day one as it does after 6 months when it&#x27;s due for replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you prefer your makeup more natural looking and less obvious, this mascara is a very good inexpensive choice.  The \\&quot;black-brown\\&quot; is so close to black that it&#x27;s impossible to tell them apart on the lashes, so if one is cheaper, don&#x27;t worry that it won&#x27;t be dark enough.</li>
            <li> Favorite mascara of all time!!!!</li>
            <li> I used to love Revlon&#x27;s full n&#x27; soft mascara, so I decided to try this one.  Its just not the same.  If I&#x27;m not extreme careful my eyelashes become clumped.  My eyelashes are soft, but only because I used one coat.  If I put a coat this one and then use a different brush, my lashes look great, but I didn&#x27;t want to have to use two brushes. Just not for me.  The good part is it washes off easily.</li>
            <li> This is the only mascara I will ever buy. I have used others but nothing compares to this. Great price, great product, I constantly get asked what I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
            <li> I loved this product.  It was affordable and came within the specified time.  I had been looking for this product for a long time.  Glad you had it.</li>
            <li> This mascara was ok for the first week or so, but has dried out super quickly and now is too clumpy/flaky for use. It&#x27;s about the same price as other mascaras that I greatly prefer, I will not buy again. Does not wash off easily either.</li>
            <li> For a full-time working mother who likes to work-out over lunchtime and has about 15 minutes a day to herself - This mascara is a staple. It gives a natural look, doesn&#x27;t irritate the eyes, and washes off with a tiny bit of soap and water, but manages to stay put during my 10K runs. When it rubs a little under the eyelid (humid hot weather for instance), you can just wipe it off with the top of your finger. The perfect daytime all-rounder for the perfect price. It&#x27;s a shame I can&#x27;t find it in stores here, so I buy it in &#x27;bulk&#x27; once or twice a year.</li>
            <li> I have really liked this mascara for years. My eyelashes feel soft, long and full after using it. If you need a mascara that will help you to achieve showing off your eyelashes this is it. I&#x27;m 58 and luckily still have decent eyelashes but this will help anyone with next to nothing eyelashes. I recommend the Maybelline New York Full &#x27;N Soft Mascara.</li>
            <li> I like this brand of new mascara.</li>
            <li> MY LASHES ARE RATHER FINE &amp; THIS PRODUCT GRABS HOLD ONTO THEM GIVING THEM VOLUME!  LOVE THE BRUSH &amp; THE PRODUCT AND IT DOESN&#x27;T FLAKE OFF.  IT HAS THE PERFECT NAME~ LEAVES YOUR LASHES LOOKING FULL&amp; SOFT!</li>
            <li> Dried out in ghe tube after three weeks I only used this item once and threw the tube away.</li>
            <li> Lately I have had problems with it clumping even when new. I wonder if the formula has changed or if I am getting ones that are old. It is getting harder to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this mascara for years because my lashes break with other brands but I am getting tired of having to scrape the brush off before applying.</li>
            <li> I have used this off and on for years and I always come back to it.  It washes off great with out leaving our lashes feeling like you have to pill it off.  It also wears soft all day.  It has never irritated my eyes like other types I have tried.  I will continue to buy this product!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Not &amp;#34;Very Black&amp;#34;. But lashes are soft and easily applied, no flaking or smudge. Comes off easily when I use mascara remover. Just not Black enough</li>
            <li> Like this product a lot.</li>
            <li> my favorite mascara.  It definitely lives up to the name of being Full and SOFT.  I use this product because it is soft and doesn&#x27;t clump or stiffin my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, but it can be hard to find in the store. I&#x27;m not sure why this one isn&#x27;t as popular as Maybelline&#x27;s other mascaras.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t enlarged or fatten my lashes...blah!</li>
            <li> I recently switched to Maybelline Full n Soft after using Dior mascara for the past 5 years.  This product is reasonably priced and is fantastic.  My lashes still feel soft after applying 3 coats. Love, Love, Love this product.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite mascara for several years now.  I&#x27;ve tried others, some much more expensive , but this is my favorite.  It goes on easy, minimal clumping, and gives your lashes a natural, full, lengthened look without burning, stinging.  Also, easy to remove at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> It is an excellent product! My eyes look great with this mascara. I used it and don&#x27;t cause any irritation.</li>
            <li> When I first open this mascara I always feel like it&#x27;s too wet, It takes forever to dry (i&#x27;ve even been caught using a hair dryer on cool to dry my eyelashes), but after a month or two, it&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that it doesn&#x27;t run. If I cry, or swim, I don&#x27; have to worry about black streaks running down my face (as long as you don&#x27;t rub your eyes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t get clumpy when applying a 2nd coat. I&#x27;ve used it for years, and although occasionally I&#x27;ll try something else for a while.. I always come back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m too old for the clumpy, messy look in mascara. This simply adds a nice, dark veil of color that makes my pale lashes look like they exist.</li>
            <li> Great product! My daughter loves it!</li>
            <li> This is a great mascara once you get the hang of applying it. Very thin coats--two swipes per eye, then go back and add more! It is a wet product, but not nearly as thin as Great Lash--it builds up quickly--maybe too quickly at first. I had to use my eyelash comb after the first coat until I got the hang of a thin coat. I can build my skimpy lashes to the sort of extremes you see in ads (not counting the lash inserts they use)  It never flakes and is okay with eye-drops--it has not run, although I only put the lightest coat on my lower lashes. One month in using this tube, the product is still nice and fluid.&lt;br /&gt;My one quibble is the standard brush, which makes it trickier than some to apply without stray bits on skin. I have smaller, relatively deep-set eyes, and those plastic brushes are more useful, but again, with practice, this is great.&lt;br /&gt;and the price makes it painless to replace every three months as you are supposed to!</li>
            <li> Loved it. Very black and long lasting</li>
            <li> I purchased this mascara years ago, and when it ran out I couldn&#x27;t find it again so I have tried a wide variety of mascaras.  None of them compared to this one.  It does not clump, flake, or smear, and it does not give me hard crusty lashes.  It stays put all day.  So glad I found it on amazon.... Will totally buy it again!</li>
