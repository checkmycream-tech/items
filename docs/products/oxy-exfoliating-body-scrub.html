    <ol>
            <li>but I found it to be just a very good shower wash.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves the product and it comes at a good price...</li>
            <li>Works great:)</li>
            <li>Scent isn&#x27;t very appealing but seems to work.</li>
            <li>Love this body wash!</li>
            <li>Smells kind of &amp;#34;mediciney&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Regardless, it is a great product for full body use in the shower.</li>
            <li>It seems to me that it has a more pleasant mild scent too.</li>
            <li>This product made my skin break out even more.</li>
            <li>It is a bit more watery though, so I feel like I go through this quite a bit faster than the Neutrogena one.</li>
            <li>I normally use the Neutrogena or the Biore brands, but the price on this was so good that I tried it.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t get it in stores anymore, and I always wonder why because it is such a great product.</li>
            <li>I love that it is an economical acne body wash.</li>
            <li>I Haven&#x27;t seen significant results yet but will keep using and hoping for improvements.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a good body scrub.</li>
            <li>Overall, though, this is a good product that we will continue to buy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although it&#x27;s not as good as the more expensive brands, I&#x27;ll probably get it again given that the price is so much better.</li>
            <li>The smell does not last outside the shower which is good, but I find a quick 2nd wash after this is good.</li>
            <li>It is more of a body wash than a medicated scrub; much more of a liquid consistency than your normal scrubs (such as</li>
            <li>I buy this for my son, and it works very well.</li>
            <li>Its exactly what it says it is, nothing more, nothing less.</li>
            <li>The scent is not horrible, it&#x27;s just odd.</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference in my skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scrubbing granules are smaller and more sparse than other brands as well, so it doesn&#x27;t provide as \\&quot;rough\\&quot; of a scrub (which is a plus for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find this scrub to be less abrasive with its scrubbing particles and it also contains aloe which makes in more moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t dry out skin as much as the Neutrogena one.</li>
            <li>Great value and same ingredients as expensive brands.</li>
            <li>So far, neither product has really helped that much with my back acne, which is the reason I can only give it 3 stars.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not terrible, but it&#x27;s not good, either.</li>
            <li>Finally found something to help prevent those few pesky pimples BUT the only down side to this product is it is very drying to the skin &amp;&amp; if you can get past the smell of&amp;#34;Lime Away&amp;#34;you are good to go.just use like every other day.</li>

            <li> It does work and work well, however the smell, while not bad, is not good.</li>
            <li> Helps clear up your acne and keep you clean without a nasty smell, what more could you want?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thinner in consistency than the other brands I&#x27;ve tried, so it can&#x27;t be stretched as far.</li>
            <li> It is a pleasure to us as my skin in the summer gets dry</li>
            <li> and this helps to remove the dry feeling.</li>
            <li> My main complaint is the scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a 1% salicylic acid concentration which is less than Neutrogena (2%) but the same as Biore (1%).</li>
            <li> Oxy does dry my skin a bit more than the other brands, but it&#x27;s not too bad.  </li>
            <li> but it has only been a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Not really soapy, but not really a floral or \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; scent either.</li>
            <li> Just like every other woman, my problem area is on my chest from working out and after a couple weeks I was all cleared up.</li>
            <li> Salicylic acid works well for me, and the lower concentration helps keep the irritation down to a minimum.</li>
            <li> It does dissipate quickly, so it&#x27;s not a deal</li>
            <li> but it is a little harsher on the skin than Phisoderm.</li>
            <li> I think the ingredients were really harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s not effective for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sort of a stale, medicinal type scent.</li>
            <li> It smells weird!  </li>

            <li> I Haven&#x27;t seen significant results yet but will keep using and hoping for improvements. Great value and same ingredients as expensive brands.</li>

            <li> I purchased this body wash to combat body acne. So far I haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference in my skin but it has only been a few weeks. I wish the product were scented.</li>
            <li> Love this body wash! I order it from amazon since the local stores never have it in stock! Helps clear up your acne and keep you clean without a nasty smell, what more could you want?</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a good body scrub. I normally use the Neutrogena or the Biore brands, but the price on this was so good that I tried it. It&#x27;s thinner in consistency than the other brands I&#x27;ve tried, so it can&#x27;t be stretched as far. But, on the plus side, the thinner consistency allows me to use it in a pump dispenser, which helps stretch out the product and minimize waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scrubbing granules are smaller and more sparse than other brands as well, so it doesn&#x27;t provide as \\&quot;rough\\&quot; of a scrub (which is a plus for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a 1% salicylic acid concentration which is less than Neutrogena (2%) but the same as Biore (1%).

It smells weird!  The scent is not horrible, it&#x27;s just odd. Not really soapy, but not really a floral or \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; scent either. Sort of a stale, medicinal type scent. It does dissipate quickly, so it&#x27;s not a deal killer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it&#x27;s not as good as the more expensive brands, I&#x27;ll probably get it again given that the price is so much better.</li>
            <li> This product states that it is for acne  but I found it to be just a very good shower wash. It is a pleasure to us as my skin in the summer gets dry and this helps to remove the dry feeling.</li>
            <li> It does work and work well, however the smell, while not bad, is not good. The smell does not last outside the shower which is good, but I find a quick 2nd wash after this is good.</li>
            <li> Scent isn&#x27;t very appealing but seems to work. Smells kind of &amp;#34;mediciney&amp;#34;. I would probably buy again but it is a little harsher on the skin than Phisoderm.</li>
            <li> It is more of a body wash than a medicated scrub; much more of a liquid consistency than your normal scrubs (such as St. Ive&#x27;s apricot scrub). The salicylic acid (acne fighting ingredient) is only 1% as opposed to the 2 or 3% that I am used to seeing. Regardless, it is a great product for full body use in the shower.</li>
            <li> OXY Daily Defense Exfoliating Body Scrub, 10-Ounce- its soap! Its exactly what it says it is, nothing more, nothing less.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this body wash.</li>
            <li> I got this along with a body brush to help my son with is back and chest acne. I do think it helped him and am buying it again.</li>
            <li> This product made my skin break out even more. I think the ingredients were really harsh on my skin. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I get this every month and I have noticed a difference and so has my husband. Just like every other woman, my problem area is on my chest from working out and after a couple weeks I was all cleared up. I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 months and now its on my subscribe and save list.</li>
            <li> Allergic reaction to this- it is not neutrogena!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get it in stores anymore, and I always wonder why because it is such a great product. A+</li>
            <li> I buy this for my son, and it works very well. I love that it is an economical acne body wash. The only downside to this product is the scent. It&#x27;s not terrible, but it&#x27;s not good, either. Overall, though, this is a good product that we will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves the product and it comes at a good price... I will defiantly be ordering again.... I don&#x27;t personally use it but she does seem to think it works with out drying out her skin.... She must like it as I keep getting asked to reorder which I do....</li>
            <li> I recently swtiched to this from the Neutrogena body scrub. I find this scrub to be less abrasive with its scrubbing particles and it also contains aloe which makes in more moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t dry out skin as much as the Neutrogena one. It seems to me that it has a more pleasant mild scent too. It is a bit more watery though, so I feel like I go through this quite a bit faster than the Neutrogena one. So far, neither product has really helped that much with my back acne, which is the reason I can only give it 3 stars.</li>
