    <ol>
            <li>So all in all I am extremely impressed with Kleancolor.</li>
            <li>and with my experiences with those and these metallics, I was so impressed</li>

            <li>That&#x27;s the best kind of recommendation a dancer can give or hear!</li>
            <li>Great variety of colors and beautiful tones, if they could just improve its quality, it would be great.</li>
            <li>The price is also a great bonus.</li>
            <li>, it also stained my nails, I prefer using these polishes for stamping as they are great for that.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t even been able to use them yet--my daughter grabbed them immediately!!</li>
            <li>Very nice colors</li>

            <li>Colors are great and package arrived right on time :)</li>
            <li>all the others are highly pigmented and work beautifully as stamping polish.</li>
            <li>I have used all but two colors so far, with very good results.</li>
            <li>One coat of Seche Vite to top it off, and my mani lasts 5 days.</li>

            <li>And they look even better on your nails.</li>
            <li>So far this nail polish seems to hold up incredibly well.</li>
            <li>would recomend to all that love color  </li>
            <li>Chip fast, but great for me, as I paint my nails like I forget to turn my car lights off.  </li>
            <li>Colors were lovely.</li>
            <li>Smells a bit strong but overall this brand is reliable and has awesome and inexpensive color choices.</li>
            <li>May not be best packaging for long distance travel...</li>
            <li>Beautiful colors for a young person.</li>
            <li>Colors are vibrant and dazzling .</li>
            <li>I guarantee you will love these colors, and as long as you use a good top coat they will come out just like the pictures!</li>
            <li>I love this set, highly pigmented colossal and works great for nail stamping</li>
            <li>These nail polishes are super vibrant, and great for stamping art.  </li>
            <li>Just a few drops thins it out beautifully for nice, smooth coverage.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and even.</li>
            <li>Arrived securely packaged.</li>
            <li>The polish goes on smoothly and has fantastic coverage.</li>
            <li>They are so pretty, the colors are bright and really sparkle.</li>
            <li>Love them so much!</li>
            <li>The Mango here is a light peachy color but the one I already have is a Bold rich burnt orange.</li>
            <li>I am amazed at how opaque the solid colors are - each time I paint my nails, I use just one coat and get gorgeous results, and tons of compliments.</li>
            <li>I ordered a full set of all the Kleancolor collection.</li>
            <li>I love all of them so much.</li>
            <li>I like the price for 12 full size nail polish.</li>
            <li>I love the consistency of the polish, the ease of application, highly pigmented colors,  and the smell is not offensive, as I have been told.  </li>
            <li>To be honest, I so rarely wear bare nails</li>
            <li>They are very shimmery and catch the light well.</li>
            <li>I think for the price this product is worth it..</li>
            <li>Liked all the colors but the white.</li>
            <li>and they got here pretty fast too!!</li>
            <li>They are certainly quite a deal!</li>
            <li>I am listing this as a pro, as this thick formula makes for great stamping.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Would recommend to anyone who are interested.</li>
            <li>They work pretty well.  </li>
            <li>The other dancers she goes to feiseanna (dance competitions) with have even asked her about the kind of polish she uses so</li>
            <li>This set really has beautiful colors, but the quality of the nail polish is not really good.</li>
            <li>Fast dry, cover with 3 coats of top coqt and doesnt chip</li>
            <li>So vibrant!  </li>
            <li>Very dissappointed.</li>
            <li>It also dries fairly fast</li>
            <li>The price was so reasonable on these metallics that I could not refuse.</li>
            <li>Was very gunky and translucent.</li>
            <li>It can take a little longer to dry than some polishes, depending upon how many coats you use and what you do about a top coat.</li>
            <li>The Aqua I received here is a light creamy blue but the one I already have is a bold rich deep oceany blue.</li>
            <li>, I am a firm believer in the powers of Seche Vite which greatly speeds my dry time...</li>
            <li>I bought this particular brand of metallic polish on the recommendation</li>
            <li>BUT these nail polishes chip within the first 24 hours even after putting a good base and top coat on.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally paint my fingernails so this was bought for mainly my pedicures.</li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE the colors and lasts for a long time, especially with a decent topcoat.</li>
            <li>It normally chips off after one day....</li>
            <li>One coat covers, except for the white and black, which are kind of like &amp;#34;washes&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Well I decided to try it but didn&#x27;t have high expectations because my natural fingernails don&#x27;t hold polish well at all.</li>
            <li>When I decided to change my nails, the color came off easily without making a mess.</li>
            <li>I love the metallic finish and the colors are vibrant, it did last a few days before it started chipping</li>
            <li>I always seal it with a clear coat, so it brings out the beauty and shine of the colors, as well as protection.</li>
            <li>Either these are old or way off.</li>
            <li>I have been pleasantly surprised and will order again.</li>

            <li> I have been pleasantly surprised and will order again.</li>
            <li> Putting down a good base coat will help this somewhat, but I am getting staining on my nails.</li>
            <li> My nails chipped in just a few short hours after being completely dry.</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t into stamping, simply add a few drops of Sally Beauty Supply Beauty Secrets Polish Thinner, or some Seche Restore (sold here on Amazon).</li>
            <li> I had a few solid colors and some of the glitter mixes before I ordered the metallic set.....</li>
            <li> EXCEPT for the green and white nd</li>
            <li> but I will say that in in past experience even that has never helped keep my nails from chipping, I will definitely buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> : The formulas on the solid and metallic colors that I have tried or swatched are extremely thick.</li>
            <li> I do have a base and top coat on also</li>
            <li> and that was with using a base and top coat</li>
            <li> Brush is a standard size, not too wide and not too thin.</li>
            <li> The only area where this polish fails is that you only get a day or two of wear before it starts chipping on fingernails.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that they dry a little slowly.</li>
            <li> Just wish they had come in a little bag.</li>
            <li> One coworker said that my manicure looked like I spent $100 on it!!!.</li>
            <li> but she&#x27;s a dancer and usually after one practice the nails on her toes are are wrecked.</li>
            <li> Also, quality of the nail polish is not very good, chips away in 24 hours.</li>
            <li> Not the least sad that I will now have duplicates of the metallics....</li>
            <li> The smell isnt as bad as some people lead you to believe....</li>
            <li> Kinda disappointed.</li>
            <li> Not gonna lie, I&#x27;m slightly disappointed about lack of earrings.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> excellent product fast delivery</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even been able to use them yet--my daughter grabbed them immediately!! Beautiful colors--unbelievably fast delivery!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE the colors and lasts for a long time, especially with a decent topcoat. When I decided to change my nails, the color came off easily without making a mess. The price is also a great bonus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried wearing two of the metallic polishes so far - the pink and the red (I&#x27;ve swatched them all though), and these are my findings:&lt;br /&gt;Cons: They do stain. Putting down a good base coat will help this somewhat, but I am getting staining on my nails. To be honest, I so rarely wear bare nails I do not care that there is some staining.&lt;br /&gt; It can take a little longer to dry than some polishes, depending upon how many coats you use and what you do about a top coat. I don&#x27;t care about this either, I am a firm believer in the powers of Seche Vite which greatly speeds my dry time...so no issue there.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: The formulas on the solid and metallic colors that I have tried or swatched are extremely thick. I am listing this as a pro, as this thick formula makes for great stamping. If you aren&#x27;t into stamping, simply add a few drops of Sally Beauty Supply Beauty Secrets Polish Thinner, or some Seche Restore (sold here on Amazon). Just a few drops thins it out beautifully for nice, smooth coverage.&lt;br /&gt;  Goes on smooth and even. Brush is a standard size, not too wide and not too thin. I am amazed at how opaque the solid colors are - each time I paint my nails, I use just one coat and get gorgeous results, and tons of compliments. One coworker said that my manicure looked like I spent $100 on it!!!. One coat of Seche Vite to top it off, and my mani lasts 5 days. I can&#x27;t get opaque-in-one-coat coverage from the higher-end polishes I have.&lt;br /&gt;  So all in all I am extremely impressed with Kleancolor. I had a few solid colors and some of the glitter mixes before I ordered the metallic set.....and with my experiences with those and these metallics, I was so impressed I ordered a full set of all the Kleancolor collection. Not the least sad that I will now have duplicates of the metallics....I now have plenty of stamping polish!!</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t claim something you don&#x27;t deliver. Earrings were not shipped. Also, quality of the nail polish is not very good, chips away in 24 hours.</li>
            <li> Wife loved them going too buy more colors very pleased thank you</li>
            <li> so these came yesterday and they are to die for like omg i was so happy when i saw they had came and how fast they had arrived</li>
            <li> Very nice colors BUT these nail polishes chip within the first 24 hours even after putting a good base and top coat on. Very dissappointed.</li>
            <li> I ordered this set specifically for the metallic Aqua &amp; Mango but these don&#x27;t look like the ones I already have. I purchased mine from a local store that has stopped selling them. The Mango here is a light peachy color but the one I already have is a Bold rich burnt orange. The Aqua I received here is a light creamy blue but the one I already have is a bold rich deep oceany blue. Either these are old or way off. Not quite was I was hoping for at all. Kinda disappointed.</li>
            <li> These nail polishes are super vibrant, and great for stamping art.  My only complaint is that they dry a little slowly.</li>
            <li> Smells a bit strong but overall this brand is reliable and has awesome and inexpensive color choices. As described. Arrived securely packaged. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love this polish! It is a great buy and every color looks wonderful. They are very shimmery and catch the light well. The polish goes on smoothly and has fantastic coverage. I only needed on coat. It also dries fairly fast I recommend that if you are thinking of buying this product that you do because it is great!</li>
            <li> Colors are vibrant and dazzling .</li>
            <li> The colors are amazing. So vibrant!  The pictures don&#x27;t even begin to do them justice. And they look even better on your nails. My daughter paints her nails and a few days later she&#x27;s trying another color because she wants to try them all so I can&#x27;t tell you how well the colors hold out on your hands but she&#x27;s a dancer and usually after one practice the nails on her toes are are wrecked. So far this nail polish seems to hold up incredibly well. For my daughter that&#x27;s even more impressive than the colors. The other dancers she goes to feiseanna (dance competitions) with have even asked her about the kind of polish she uses so she tells them about klean color . That&#x27;s the best kind of recommendation a dancer can give or hear!</li>
            <li> I orderedd these specifically for nail stamping.EXCEPT for the green and white nd maybe one yellow all the others are highly pigmented and work beautifully as stamping polish.I think for the price this product is worth it..</li>
            <li> The price was so reasonable on these metallics that I could not refuse. I love the consistency of the polish, the ease of application, highly pigmented colors,  and the smell is not offensive, as I have been told.  One coat covers, except for the white and black, which are kind of like &amp;#34;washes&amp;#34;. I have been pleasantly surprised and will order again.</li>
            <li> I bought this particular brand of metallic polish on the recommendation it was good for stamping. I have used all but two colors so far, with very good results. (Only one that did not work was the white.) Considering the cost of stamping polishes, this set was a steal! Nice color variety too.</li>
            <li> Liked all the colors but the white. Was very gunky and translucent. Also, didn&#x27;t receive earrings. Not gonna lie, I&#x27;m slightly disappointed about lack of earrings.&lt;br /&gt;Also came in envelope. May not be best packaging for long distance travel...bottles ARE glass....</li>
            <li> This set really has beautiful colors, but the quality of the nail polish is not really good. It only last for a couple of days. Great variety of colors and beautiful tones, if they could just improve its quality, it would be great.</li>
            <li> The only area where this polish fails is that you only get a day or two of wear before it starts chipping on fingernails. It stays on toenails for a week or two before chipping. I always seal it with a clear coat, so it brings out the beauty and shine of the colors, as well as protection.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally paint my fingernails so this was bought for mainly my pedicures. Well I decided to try it but didn&#x27;t have high expectations because my natural fingernails don&#x27;t hold polish well at all. It normally chips off after one day.... Well I&#x27;m on day three with nooooo chipping. Love this polish!!! The colors are brilliant and look exactly like the picture. I do have a base and top coat on also but I will say that in in past experience even that has never helped keep my nails from chipping, I will definitely buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> Fast dry, cover with 3 coats of top coqt and doesnt chip</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors for a young person. Just wish they had come in a little bag.</li>
            <li> I love the metallic finish and the colors are vibrant, it did last a few days before it started chipping and that was with using a base and top coat, it also stained my nails, I prefer using these polishes for stamping as they are great for that.</li>
            <li> would recomend to all that love color  these just one coat does it</li>
            <li> I love this set, highly pigmented colossal and works great for nail stamping</li>
            <li> I dont think it has the metallic look like I thought it would have.</li>
            <li> The smell isnt as bad as some people lead you to believe.... the colors are beautiful and though I received one of the bottles chipped they replaced it right away!!! Amazing customer service and they got here pretty fast too!! I guarantee you will love these colors, and as long as you use a good top coat they will come out just like the pictures!</li>
            <li> Chip fast, but great for me, as I paint my nails like I forget to turn my car lights off.  (almost everyday haha)</li>
            <li> The shipping was very fast and the polishes were perfect when they came, I loved them! They are so pretty, the colors are bright and really sparkle. Love them so much! Would recommend to anyone who are interested.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a bargain.  I have only used these polishes for stamping.  They work pretty well.  They are certainly quite a deal!</li>
            <li> Colors were lovely. My nails chipped in just a few short hours after being completely dry.</li>
            <li> I love all these colors it looks really nice on my nails</li>
            <li> These are the best! I love all of them so much. I use them a lot when I do gradient nail art and they are phenomenal and completely gorgeous!</li>
            <li> Colors are great and package arrived right on time :)</li>
            <li> Got this set for my daughter for her stocking for Christmas she LOVES it! I like the price for 12 full size nail polish. Good color choices too. Great buy! Would buy again!</li>
