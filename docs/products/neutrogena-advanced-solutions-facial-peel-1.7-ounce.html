    <ol>
            <li>and no I don&#x27;t work for Aveeno, they just have really great products that don&#x27;t cost a fortune!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best renewal scrub, cream or anything I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product!</li>
            <li>great products are..</li>
            <li>She purchases this periodically and is quite happy with the results.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a good moisturizer for your body, try Aveeno Creamy Moisturizing Oil or the Moisturizing Shower &amp; Bath Oil.  </li>
            <li>what \\&quot;CelluZyme technology\\&quot; consists of formulation wise but it isn&#x27;t making me do cartwheels in excitement for this product or its claims</li>
            <li>It does not smell good like it in the bottle at all</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>I LOVED this product.</li>
            <li>I still do get breakouts, especially right before my period</li>
            <li>I have used this for two weeks now and am totally impressed with the change in my &#x27;forty year old face&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>might think I use too many products but in reality I rotate them.  </li>
            <li>Neutrogena Facial Peel is the best treatment I have ever used on my face.  </li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so much better after using this.  </li>
            <li>I basically paid top dollar for an unusable product.  </li>
            <li>it also made my pores look huge.</li>
            <li>I use once a week or so, because of the cost I was stretching it by using the advanced solutions.  </li>
            <li>You can also use the sponge from the advanced solutions in circular motions.  </li>
            <li>I use Neutrogena Advanced Solutions Fadial Peel twice per week and have been using it for three years.  </li>
            <li>No burning, but my skin was amazingly smooth and glossy like a baby&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>In hot weather I use it more often when I feel like a cool rinse.</li>
            <li>I also have a fair complexion which reddens within five minutes of being outside.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t afford facials and facial peels so these are a good alternative.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena facial peel MUST be followed up with a good moisturizing lotion.  </li>
            <li>Use with caution before doing a full treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but as soon as it happens I use Biore facial strips to clean out my pores and dab on some Aveeno facial mask, which is also marvelous, and I can control the breakouts.</li>
            <li>It removes all makeup residue and super cleans my skin.  </li>
            <li>Complexion Foaming Cleanser - Absolutely great for daily use or even more then once daily.  </li>
            <li>try Neutrogena Advanced Solutions - this is more textured then the facial scrub.  </li>
            <li>as far as resurfacing and exfoliation goes, there are much better options out there.</li>
            <li>After each treatment, my skin feels smooth and new!  </li>
            <li>Deep Cleaning Pore Cleansing Cloths - these are sometimes better then using toner on a cotton ball since it&#x27;s a full cloth.  </li>
            <li>I see many great reviews for this product, which leaves me scratching my head and feeling a tad guilty for what I am about to write here but . . .</li>
            <li>Buying this facial peel was a HUGE MISTAKE!</li>
            <li>it looks on the commercial, it&#x27;s more of an exfoliating scrub then a cleanser.   </li>
            <li>I love to go to the spa for a facial.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t do it often enough, but I swear that this product works better than those visits.  </li>
            <li>My pores look smaller, so I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Especially if it&#x27;s going to cost me more than the $25 it costs in those stores.</li>
            <li>those containing beneficial and safe amounts of acids within this same price range.</li>
            <li>I use Neutrogena Ageless Restoratives 5-Minute Facial and LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it often enough, but i love this peel.</li>
            <li>ok, but it came in the tube ,different than the photos on the side.</li>
            <li>The face soap doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and the scrubbing side is perfect for sloughing off the dried skin.</li>
            <li>I found Neutrogena Advanced Solutions Facial Peel to work exactly like</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how much (dead skin cells, clogged pores and the effects of modern life)</li>
            <li>The gentle mask of soy is cleansing and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.  </li>
            <li>Complexion Daily Cleansing Pads (this is the one with the scrubbing side and smooth side)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena Advanced Solutions Facial Peel for about 3 months</li>
            <li>I have been using this for about 3 months now, but I don&#x27;t really see any differences.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is some notable flushing of the skin, somewhat like the increased skin bloodflow that comes with taking the wrong kind of Niacin tablet.</li>
            <li>after reading other reviews of this product and Neutrogena Advanced Solutions I decided to try both of them and what a result!</li>
            <li>I personally use Aveeno clear complexion face lotion, this is light and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores like some of the others.  </li>
            <li>For me personally though, I need a facial peel that is much more stronger exfoliant than this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years and have noticed a huge difference in my skin; in my humble opinion, it&#x27;s a better expenditure of money than a professional chemical peel.</li>
            <li>It is really nice to have smoother and younger looking skin without the high cost of other brands.</li>
            <li>Other reviews of this product point out that you have to continue to use these products and its true!  </li>
            <li>Also its a good idea to scrub away the flaking skin (usually by the next day)</li>
            <li>Your face will tingle, which is normal, massage off with fingertips</li>
            <li>This is normal because it increases circulation to your skin which brings the blood to your cheeks.  </li>
            <li>Like when I get a zit I dab on some Aveenofacial mask (not on my entire face, just the breakout area) right before the shower and rinse it off at the end.  </li>
            <li>One of those free gifts with an order of something or other.  </li>
            <li>and wow what a difference!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Neutrogena in the past but wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the cleansers and stuff..</li>
            <li>Also the breakouts I was having have nearly stopped!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 36 now and have developed VERY sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Using it twice a week has left my skin more pliant, with less wrinkles, and healthier.  </li>
            <li>Treatment, Clear Complexion  &lt;</li>
            <li>The next day I wet in and lightly massaged it, then rinsed it off with lukewarm water.  </li>
            <li>He also likes the Pore unclogging scrub for when he takes a shower and the Triple Action Astringent.</li>
            <li>I will admit that it did leave my skin soft and has not caused any sensitivity or breakouts.</li>
            <li>My skin is radiant after and I am 69 years old.  </li>
            <li>After using it now for 3 months, my face really feels and looks younger.</li>
            <li>But having suffered from acne all my life and been frustrated with the lack of good over the counter products the price is worth purchasing these and using them.  </li>
            <li>It has the exact same ingredients as this product, but sells for A LOT less.[[ASIN:B002BWOY1Q Neutrogena Ageless Restoratives 5-Minute Facial, 1.7 Ounce]]</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone who wants to gently resurface the dead cells from your skin.  </li>
            <li>a whole lot of nothing, and my skin still looks the same: constant breakouts.</li>
            <li>Even at-home glycolic peels should be tested on a small, easily covered part of the skin before using it on your entire face.</li>
            <li>I have light acne scarring that usually takes quite some time to fade, especially on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>It barely stings when I put it on.  </li>
            <li>this product removes in just ten minutes, and without any adverse reactions - even though I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been plagued with dry, sensitive skin and trust me over moisturizing</li>
    </ol>

            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been plagued with dry, sensitive skin and trust me over moisturizing</li>
            <li> I wear a hat while gardening due to the sensitive nature of my skin.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was that the dry skin I was having trouble with, which led to combination skin and dry patches on my face improved within a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> developed this odd condition of breaking out along my jaw line and had scars and even acne that just wouldn&#x27;t go away..</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin &amp; lots of stuff will break me out, but this isn&#x27;t too harsh at all.</li>
            <li> Really a BIG, BIG change compared to other at-home peels I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I suffered from teenage acne which never really went away</li>
            <li> This product does what it claims to do, it exfoliates dead skin and leaves it soft and dewy.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I forget and then my face feels all dry.</li>
            <li> It has a slight grainy texture so you get a little exfoliating action when you wash it off</li>
            <li> I use Aveeno facial two side scrubs (in round jar).  </li>
            <li> Its not really a scrubber as it doesn&#x27;t rotate</li>
            <li> Your face will pink up within thirty minutes after using this so don&#x27;t panic.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this facial peel.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve noticed that these scars are clearing up a little faster, due to the peel removing the topmost layer of dead cells, allowing the skin underneath to breathe and heal.</li>
            <li> - menthol is a BAD ingredient for facial cleansers anyway), as it will not let your skin cool after using that, and will burn.</li>
            <li> Anyway I use this every other day or so, again sparingly.  </li>
            <li> usually use these scrubs after I&#x27;ve taken a shower and my face is moist and pores open.  </li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t even come close to other peels, esp.</li>
            <li> Other reviews stated that it did not work on scaring...and that would be correct because this product makes no claims to do so.  </li>
            <li> But it was definitely not worth that $30-some-odd I spent on it.</li>
            <li> My skin was already used to other peel and AHA products.  </li>
            <li> This was a fantastic product and TOO BAD it&#x27;s discontinued.  </li>
            <li> HOLY COW!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely not a good idea to use this with any facial cleanser that contains menthol (check your labels</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t glop the stuff on my face just a few dots, forehead, cheeks, chin and jaw and anyplace where I might have blackheads and then follow up with the face cream.  </li>
            <li> The price is not justified at all considering what it does-or rather does not- accomplish.</li>
            <li> It helps get rid of the dead superficial stuff and leaves my face looking cleaner.</li>
            <li> : I left a thin layer on overnight, and used a towel on my pillow.  </li>
            <li> only disappointment is that due to the price, customers can&#x27;t get a small trial size and try it on a patch of skin before using it.</li>
            <li> Not sure</li>
            <li> I started out following the directions, and didn&#x27;t see any bad reaction, but not much skin-texture improvement either.  </li>
            <li> I noticed lately though that it is not being carried by Walmart or Walgreens</li>

            <li> I started using this product three months ago and wow what a difference!  I suffered from teenage acne which never really went away and when I hit my thirties it came back with a vengeance.  I&#x27;m 36 now and have developed VERY sensitive skin.  Never a makeup person since it makes me break out.  I even tried prescription acne medication, which never worked.  Finally took a six month treatment of pills and it cleared my skin up but it was never the same.  I don&#x27;t sun worship not since a case of sun poisoning when I was 24.  I also have a fair complexion which reddens within five minutes of being outside.  I wear a hat while gardening due to the sensitive nature of my skin.  Freckles everywhere, even my arms.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been plagued with dry, sensitive skin and trust me over moisturizing doesn&#x27;t work!  I began to use Aveeno and Biore products and got my skin under control but I was still having breakouts.  I&#x27;ve tried Neutrogena in the past but wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the cleansers and stuff.. after reading other reviews of this product and Neutrogena Advanced Solutions I decided to try both of them and what a result! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The facial peel I use once a week or so, because of the cost I was stretching it by using the advanced solutions.  The first thing I noticed was that the dry skin I was having trouble with, which led to combination skin and dry patches on my face improved within a couple of weeks. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I developed this odd condition of breaking out along my jaw line and had scars and even acne that just wouldn&#x27;t go away.. they&#x27;re finally gone!  Also the breakouts I was having have nearly stopped!  I still do get breakouts, especially right before my period but as soon as it happens I use Biore facial strips to clean out my pores and dab on some Aveeno facial mask, which is also marvelous, and I can control the breakouts. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Some might think I use too many products but in reality I rotate them.  Like when I get a zit I dab on some Aveenofacial mask (not on my entire face, just the breakout area) right before the shower and rinse it off at the end.  The gentle mask of soy is cleansing and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.  I can&#x27;t afford facials and facial peels so these are a good alternative. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Neutrogena facial peel MUST be followed up with a good moisturizing lotion.  I personally use Aveeno clear complexion face lotion, this is light and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores like some of the others.  Also its a good idea to scrub away the flaking skin (usually by the next day) I use Aveeno facial two side scrubs (in round jar).  The face soap doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and the scrubbing side is perfect for sloughing off the dried skin. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also try Neutrogena Advanced Solutions - this is more textured then the facial scrub.  White sandy thicker solution that you dab onto your face and use the hand held \\&quot;scrubber\\&quot; that comes with the kit.  Its not really a scrubber as it doesn&#x27;t rotate, it vibrates.  Anyway I use this every other day or so, again sparingly.  I don&#x27;t glop the stuff on my face just a few dots, forehead, cheeks, chin and jaw and anyplace where I might have blackheads and then follow up with the face cream.  Also this doesn&#x27;t &#x60;foam&#x27; up like it looks on the commercial, it&#x27;s more of an exfoliating scrub then a cleanser.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Facial Peel is thinner and sort of a tan gray color, looks sort of gross and when applying I apply it sparingly in a THIN layer.  You really don&#x27;t need to put it on heavily.  Your face will tingle, which is normal, massage off with fingertips or sometimes I use my handheld face sponge.  One of those free gifts with an order of something or other.  You can also use the sponge from the advanced solutions in circular motions.  Your face will pink up within thirty minutes after using this so don&#x27;t panic.  This is normal because it increases circulation to your skin which brings the blood to your cheeks.  Remember to use facial cream while your face is still moist.  Sometimes I forget and then my face feels all dry. &lt;br /&gt;I usually use these scrubs after I&#x27;ve taken a shower and my face is moist and pores open.  Also use a hairband or a hair towel to keep hair back, its really annoying trying to wash the face scrub out of your hair.  Follow up with a toner and lotion and you should notice a difference within a couple of weeks.  Other reviews of this product point out that you have to continue to use these products and its true!  But having suffered from acne all my life and been frustrated with the lack of good over the counter products the price is worth purchasing these and using them.  There are ways of stretching the products out like I said above. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also great products are.. and no I don&#x27;t work for Aveeno, they just have really great products that don&#x27;t cost a fortune! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Aveeno &lt;br /&gt;Clear Complexion Cleansing Mask  &lt;br /&gt;Clear Complexion Daily Cleansing Pads (this is the one with the scrubbing side and smooth side) &lt;br /&gt;Clear Complexion Daily Moisturizer  &lt;br /&gt;Clear Complexion Foaming Cleanser - Absolutely great for daily use or even more then once daily.  In hot weather I use it more often when I feel like a cool rinse. &lt;br /&gt;Correcting Treatment, Clear Complexion  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a good moisturizer for your body, try Aveeno Creamy Moisturizing Oil or the Moisturizing Shower &amp; Bath Oil.  I also use Jergen&#x27;s ultra healing which you can use on your face also. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Biore &lt;br /&gt;Blemish Ice Cleanser &lt;br /&gt;Daily Deep Cleaning Pore Cleansing Cloths - these are sometimes better then using toner on a cotton ball since it&#x27;s a full cloth.  My husbands actually likes to use these also.  He also likes the Pore unclogging scrub for when he takes a shower and the Triple Action Astringent. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Good luck with your skin! &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena Advanced Solutions Facial Peel for about 3 months and I haven&#x27;t noticed any dramatic results. I will admit that it did leave my skin soft and has not caused any sensitivity or breakouts. For me personally though, I need a facial peel that is much more stronger exfoliant than this.</li>
            <li> I have used this for two weeks now and am totally impressed with the change in my &#x27;forty year old face&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using it twice a week has left my skin more pliant, with less wrinkles, and healthier.  In fact, I&#x27;d say with seriousness that my skin looks ten years younger, no joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope it works as well for all of you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow the instructions!</li>
            <li> I love to go to the spa for a facial.  I don&#x27;t do it often enough, but I swear that this product works better than those visits.  I can see visible changes in my skin. It looks smoother.  My pores look smaller, so I love this stuff.  I have oily skin.</li>
            <li> When my skin gets the least bit tired or drab looking I use this.  It&#x27;s the best renewal scrub, cream or anything I&#x27;ve ever tried.  I noticed lately though that it is not being carried by Walmart or Walgreens so I think they may be discontinuing it!  That&#x27;s NOT good news!  Especially if it&#x27;s going to cost me more than the $25 it costs in those stores.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Facial Peel is the best treatment I have ever used on my face.  My skin is radiant after and I am 69 years old.  Neutrogena has stopped making this product.  How horrible.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 3 months now, but I don&#x27;t really see any differences.</li>
            <li> I found Neutrogena Advanced Solutions Facial Peel to work exactly like the instructions said it would. After using it now for 3 months, my face really feels and looks younger. It is really nice to have smoother and younger looking skin without the high cost of other brands.</li>
            <li> I see many great reviews for this product, which leaves me scratching my head and feeling a tad guilty for what I am about to write here but . . . as far as resurfacing and exfoliation goes, there are much better options out there. Matter of fact, the same results would be achieved by using an inexpensive exfoliating scrub. This product doesn&#x27;t even come close to other peels, esp. those containing beneficial and safe amounts of acids within this same price range. Not sure what \\&quot;CelluZyme technology\\&quot; consists of formulation wise but it isn&#x27;t making me do cartwheels in excitement for this product or its claims, that&#x27;s for sure. This is more like a really expensive facial toner I&#x27;d say.     The price is not justified at all considering what it does-or rather does not- accomplish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years and have noticed a huge difference in my skin; in my humble opinion, it&#x27;s a better expenditure of money than a professional chemical peel. The results are as dramatic!</li>
            <li> I use Neutrogena Ageless Restoratives 5-Minute Facial and LOVE it.  It has the exact same ingredients as this product, but sells for A LOT less.[[ASIN:B002BWOY1Q Neutrogena Ageless Restoratives 5-Minute Facial, 1.7 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> My skin feels so much better after using this.  It helps get rid of the dead superficial stuff and leaves my face looking cleaner.</li>
            <li> I have light acne scarring that usually takes quite some time to fade, especially on my cheeks. So far, I&#x27;ve noticed that these scars are clearing up a little faster, due to the peel removing the topmost layer of dead cells, allowing the skin underneath to breathe and heal. I&#x27;ve also noticed a smaller breakout area the week before menstruation, which is something of a blessing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only disappointment is that due to the price, customers can&#x27;t get a small trial size and try it on a patch of skin before using it. Even at-home glycolic peels should be tested on a small, easily covered part of the skin before using it on your entire face. Some people have a terrible reaction. Use with caution before doing a full treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is some notable flushing of the skin, somewhat like the increased skin bloodflow that comes with taking the wrong kind of Niacin tablet. You should have a tingling sensation, NOT a burning sensation. If it is in any way painful, remove it immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely not a good idea to use this with any facial cleanser that contains menthol (check your labels - menthol is a BAD ingredient for facial cleansers anyway), as it will not let your skin cool after using that, and will burn.</li>
            <li> This product does what it claims to do, it exfoliates dead skin and leaves it soft and dewy.  Other reviews stated that it did not work on scaring...and that would be correct because this product makes no claims to do so.  I recommend this to anyone who wants to gently resurface the dead cells from your skin.  I&#x27;m purchasing my third jar.</li>
            <li> I had some acne scarring and bought this product hoping it would help. Not only did it do nothing for my scars it also made my pores look huge. Buying this facial peel was a HUGE MISTAKE! Don&#x27;t waste your money on this facial peel.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it often enough, but i love this peel. I have very sensitive skin &amp; lots of stuff will break me out, but this isn&#x27;t too harsh at all.</li>
            <li> ok, but it came in the tube ,different than the photos on the side. It does not smell good like it in the bottle at all</li>
            <li> sadly, this product had a 2007 expiration date.  I basically paid top dollar for an unusable product.  I will never purchase from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> Been using this one to two times a week for over a month now and it hasn&#x27;t done a thing.  It barely stings when I put it on.  It has a slight grainy texture so you get a little exfoliating action when you wash it off so that&#x27;s good. It doesn&#x27;t smell terrible at all. But it was definitely not worth that $30-some-odd I spent on it. No peeling afterwards... a whole lot of nothing, and my skin still looks the same: constant breakouts.</li>
            <li> I use Neutrogena Advanced Solutions Fadial Peel twice per week and have been using it for three years.  It removes all makeup residue and super cleans my skin.  After each treatment, my skin feels smooth and new!  It&#x27;s amazing how much (dead skin cells, clogged pores and the effects of modern life) this product removes in just ten minutes, and without any adverse reactions - even though I have sensitive skin.  This is a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my wife and this works well with her skin. She purchases this periodically and is quite happy with the results.</li>
            <li> This was a fantastic product and TOO BAD it&#x27;s discontinued.  I started out following the directions, and didn&#x27;t see any bad reaction, but not much skin-texture improvement either.  My skin was already used to other peel and AHA products.  So I changed it up a bit: I left a thin layer on overnight, and used a towel on my pillow.  The next day I wet in and lightly massaged it, then rinsed it off with lukewarm water.  HOLY COW!  No burning, but my skin was amazingly smooth and glossy like a baby&#x27;s. PORELESS!!  Really a BIG, BIG change compared to other at-home peels I&#x27;ve tried.  I LOVED this product.</li>
