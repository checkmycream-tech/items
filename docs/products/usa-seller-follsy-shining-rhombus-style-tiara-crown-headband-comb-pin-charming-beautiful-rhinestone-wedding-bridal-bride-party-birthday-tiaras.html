            <li>I really love this.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and I was so pleased when I opened the box!  </li>
            <li>Looks super nice</li>
            <li>It looks lovely, not like a toy or cheap product.  </li>
            <li>I had looked locally at many tiaras and crowns for my granddaughter to wear with her Halloween costume and they were all cheap plastic that I did not think would even make it through one wearing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s full of sparkle and is perfect for a Western &amp; Diamonds party I&#x27;m going to as an Oil Baroness.  </li>
            <li>Good construction for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what was order, look even better in person!</li>
            <li>my friend loved it, and everyone commented how classy it was!</li>
            <li>I was so worried that I would be getting something that looked or felt cheap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to use with my business--</li>
            <li>Got it sooner than expected and are very happy with the high quality, sparkly beauty of it!</li>
            <li>I love it so much .</li>
            <li>and it can not be seen, luckily.</li>
            <li>It arrived so quickly.</li>
            <li>very pretty and well made.  </li>
            <li>It arrived promptly and was so pretty!</li>
            <li>It fits my head perfectly and doesn&#x27;t look cheap nor fake.</li>
            <li>Worth it</li>
            <li>It is large and glamorous!</li>
            <li>It is also the perfect size, almost a little large for my head (my head is on the smaller side), but I prefer that because I do not like it when the prongs stick into your head and cause a headache.  </li>
            <li>My 7 year old daughter looked fabulous.</li>
            <li>Great quality, fast shipping, heavy, metal, clear rhinestones.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very durable</li>

            <li>Can easily serve as an accent for prom, bride, party theme, dance recital, plays, Halloween, or just plain dress up  ;-)</li>
            <li>It is sure to last after Halloween is long gone.  </li>
            <li>and I was able to slightly bend the metal to fit her small head.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my 2year old&#x27;s dress-up collection.</li>
            <li>The picture doesn&#x27;t give it justice, it looks really pretty in person and way more expensive than I paid.</li>
            <li>It was actually of higher quality than I expected for the money.  </li>
            <li>Actually, given the price of it, I thought it&#x27;d look kind of cheesy</li>
            <li>Also the distributor sent a small gift with it, a cute little hair accessory for a ponytail!</li>

            <li> However, the packaging was not sufficient and the crown arrived bent to the point where one of the points is broken.  </li>

            <li> Fabulous quality! I purchased this for my 2year old&#x27;s dress-up collection. It&#x27;s very durable and I was able to slightly bend the metal to fit her small head. I have no fear of her breaking this or choking on small pieces, unlike the plastic tiaras that are marketed towards small children.</li>
            <li> Beautiful tiara! Got it sooner than expected and are very happy with the high quality, sparkly beauty of it! I was so worried that I would be getting something that looked or felt cheap. (Because it is so hard to tell by looking at the pictures.) But I needn&#x27;t have worried. This has a nice weight and a really nice price.</li>
            <li> Great Crown for the price! Very happy with it!</li>
            <li> My granddaughter bought this for her mom, my daughter, for Mother&#x27;s Day.  My daughter proudly wore this all day...even walking on the boardwalk in Rehoboth Beach Delaware.  Actually, given the price of it, I thought it&#x27;d look kind of cheesy but it was actually quite beautiful!  I can recommend this one for moms and brides and just those of us who need an everyday crown to wear around the house.</li>
            <li> Very nice tiara. My 7 year old daughter looked fabulous. Held it in place with a few bobby pins. Perfect.</li>
            <li> It is large and glamorous! Stunning and dazzling. I would buy it again! I can&#x27;t believe the price. It&#x27;s perfect for any occasion!</li>
            <li> Great Quality for a childrens BD party, my goddaughter was thrilled with it!</li>
            <li> The picture doesn&#x27;t give it justice, it looks really pretty in person and way more expensive than I paid. It was the Queen of my birthday ball with this crown....!</li>
            <li> BEAUTIFUL I LOVE IT AND FAST SHIPPING!!!!</li>
            <li> Great quality, fast shipping, heavy, metal, clear rhinestones. Looks super nice I&#x27;m excited to use with my business--bought another one just like it!</li>
            <li> I love my tiara!!! Very sturdy &amp; sparkly just how I like it. A great deal &amp; could not beat the price. Thank you amazon</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and I was so pleased when I opened the box!  It is BEAUTIFUL.  It looks lovely, not like a toy or cheap product.  It sparkles gorgeously.  What a wonderful product for the low price! It is also the perfect size, almost a little large for my head (my head is on the smaller side), but I prefer that because I do not like it when the prongs stick into your head and cause a headache.  I am wearing it with a wig for a Rapunzel Halloween costume!  I think it is a nice choice for a (Disney) Rapunzel-esque style.  Also the distributor sent a small gift with it, a cute little hair accessory for a ponytail! Really pleased, this is an excellent choice.</li>
            <li> great value for the price....</li>
