            <li>AND I FELL IN LOVE WITH THE DANCE TO LIFE PERFUME.</li>
            <li>SO I DECIDED TO LOOK FOR IT ON MY FAVORITE SITE</li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfume, so sweet and womanly yet beautiful in scent.</li>
            <li>My favorite scent right now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light fragrance that isn&#x27;t super overpowering.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually not a fan of fragrances with fruit and floral top notes, but Dance to Life is actually not bad.</li>
            <li>The fruit notes aren&#x27;t super intense, and the result is a warm, feminine fragrance that has pretty great staying power, especially for such a low-cost product.</li>
            <li>its funny</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m positive that she will be too.</li>
            <li>Now that&#x27;s reasonable.</li>
            <li>I wish it was cheaper, I want as much as I can get</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>BUT $50 WAS A BIT MUCH WHEN I ORDER PERFUME FROM AMAZON</li>
            <li>ALL THE TIME FOR SUCH REASONABLE PRICES.</li>
            <li>While I love the scent, I would not waste my money on another bottle of this stuff due to the fact that it simply does not last.</li>
            <li>It mixes very well with my chemistry, and stays all day long!</li>
            <li>I opened the box to be sure the bottle wasn&#x27;t cracked or broken.  </li>

            <li> I have used body sprays and EDTs from other retailers that last far longer than this EDP.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering, but unfortunately, it does not last long.</li>
            <li> It has little to no staying power and completely disappears after a few hours.</li>
            <li> but this was half the cost</li>
            <li> Mary Kay products seem to be a little pricey in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I was ordering it locally; but it was so expensive</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not a fruity smell or like a serious cologne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this perfume.</li>

            <li> My favorite perfume. It mixes very well with my chemistry, and stays all day long! Very warm smell</li>
            <li> Purchased for a friend.  I opened the box to be sure the bottle wasn&#x27;t cracked or broken.  This is a very nice fragrance. I am pleased with my purchase. I&#x27;m positive that she will be too.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product, I recieve many compliments when I wear this fragrance. I really Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Got here early, great product! :-)</li>
            <li> A guy at work was selling this for his sister. It smelled good to me, he said it was $50. I love my girl but wooo! I browsed amazon and found it for $32. Now that&#x27;s reasonable. So I bought it. Saved money Got laid. Awesome</li>
            <li> i order this product and it was selling on here for 3.00 and thought was getting a steal for a 1.7 fl oz bottle come to find out it was a sample. the listing didnt say anything about being a sample. its funny because not i see that the price has changed to 35.00. will never buy anything from big daddys again.</li>
            <li> I luv the product.  Will order again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually not a fan of fragrances with fruit and floral top notes, but Dance to Life is actually not bad. It&#x27;s a light fragrance that isn&#x27;t super overpowering. The fruit notes aren&#x27;t super intense, and the result is a warm, feminine fragrance that has pretty great staying power, especially for such a low-cost product. If you like fruit/floral scents, then I definitely recommend this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this for about a year now.  I was ordering it locally; but it was so expensive; I wish MaryKay offered it in the 3.4 oz bottle. Mary Kay products seem to be a little pricey in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.  Glad i can still get it from amazon.</li>
            <li> I loved this perfume. I get so many compliments. My favorite scent right now.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and awesome price. I love it. Mary Kay is one of my favorite companies but too expensive for me but this was half the cost so I will be coming back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this perfume.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume, so sweet and womanly yet beautiful in scent. I feel like it fits with my personality, it&#x27;s not a fruity smell or like a serious cologne. I wish it was cheaper, I want as much as I can get haha I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love the product and came quickly and in great condition! I also loved the price, anything is better than full price!</li>
            <li> MY COUSIN SALES MARY KAY AND I FELL IN LOVE WITH THE DANCE TO LIFE PERFUME. BUT $50 WAS A BIT MUCH WHEN I ORDER PERFUME FROM AMAZON ALL THE TIME FOR SUCH REASONABLE PRICES. SO I DECIDED TO LOOK FOR IT ON MY FAVORITE SITE AND OF COURSE U ALL HAD A MUCH BETTER DEAL! I RECEIVED IT TODAY...ITS A CHRISTMAS PRESENT TO MYSELF!</li>
