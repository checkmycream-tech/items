            <li> Minuscule .&lt;br /&gt;Might as well be samples .&lt;br /&gt;40$ for three tiny little quarter sized products . :(</li>

            <li> Love Bare Minerals, goes on very nice and lasts. This is the small travel size but for someone like me that doesn&#x27;t wear a lot it lasts!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed about the size of this kit. I bought a kit with larger containers about 5 yrs ago at Ulta, and it was $49.99. It included blush. This one did not That was a starter kit.The veil stuff made my face look ghostly. Also I was disappointed I couldn&#x27;t find any blush. If there was some it was not listed as blush. The picure looks bigger that the actual size of the products. To me I couldn&#x27;t believe how small the jars were. It looked like the size a little girl would wear. For that price I would have that the jars would have been bigger.</li>
            <li> Quality mineral makeup! Light weight, so elegant and beautiful!</li>
            <li> Extremely tiny package way over priced</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my sister in the UK.  It looks so natural, and feels completely lightweight. Stays on even under hot conditions. The shade was good for the winter, but I purchased a shade darker for the summer. the lipsticks are great and will look at blushers etc. later. I will definitely continue using these products</li>
            <li> The bottles were much smaller than the last time I had ordered it. Disappointed</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. It was like sample size definitely not how they described it. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> wasnt very much in there</li>
            <li> Not worth the price paid.</li>
            <li> Love it! It&#x27;s the first make-up that stays on me all day long!!</li>
            <li> Loved it!&lt;br /&gt;Will order again soon!!</li>
            <li> The color /shade a little too light.</li>
            <li> I ended up going with medium beige, but I am happy with the sizes and both of the brushes are very high quality.</li>
            <li> I did not read the product description well enough and realized that the containers are much smaller than i was expecting.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in the size. I understand it&#x27;s a&amp;#34;starter kit&amp;#34; but I could have went to Ulta and purchased the same &amp;#34;starter kit&amp;#34; for less.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be bigger but, its fine for a 30 day trial.</li>
            <li> Awesome, fast shipping</li>
            <li> am very glad I tried it...</li>
            <li> My wife loves these, just wished there was more product in this purchase.</li>
            <li> Great Product. I love Bare Minerals. Great price for the product.</li>
            <li> I knew it was a good price...so maybe to good to be true. I didn&#x27;t realize it would be mini travel like sizes. I was looking for fullsized products. Nonetheless I&#x27;ll use it.</li>
