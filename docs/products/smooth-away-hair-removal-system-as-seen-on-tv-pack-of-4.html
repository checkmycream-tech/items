            <li>Great item!!</li>
            <li>perfect for mustache hair and works on legs too after shaving with electric razor.</li>
            <li>The smoothaway; however, works perfectly for me.</li>
            <li>It is a very very very good value for you money.</li>
            <li>Moms happy we are all happy!!!</li>
            <li>It worked great.</li>
            <li>Great deal for four.</li>
            <li>Does the job and makes my skin feel great (exfoliates as well as removes hair).</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>These are just as great.</li>
            <li>she says the they are great.</li>
            <li>I was really happy with the purchase and with the seller.  </li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>Great deal and arrived before scheduled.</li>
            <li>And you get 4 sets for 10 bucks which is an awesome deal :)</li>
            <li>For myself this wasn&#x27;t a product I found to be very good, but for her much finer hair it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Honestly, it&#x27;s a good exfoliator.</li>
            <li>Follow the directions and use a good moisturizer afterwards and it takes care of that.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m spending a good 30 minutes with my disposable razor.</li>
            <li>I received my product in good order.</li>
            <li>I bought something like these before and loved them.</li>
            <li>I think by itself it is already a really good product</li>
            <li>works so good.</li>
            <li>This was a really good buy.  </li>
            <li>The quality of the product was really good.  </li>
            <li>it does not seem to be as good as I remember.  </li>
            <li>so for many, I suspect, the gentler pad is a welcome relief.  </li>
            <li>For that, they work great and it makes my makeup look more even.</li>
            <li>I use it on my chin area and i am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I was very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>Best to do this right before a shower</li>
            <li>i LOVE this!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>It works kind of life sandpaper that you rub in circles on your skin until the hair falls away.  </li>
            <li>Bought this product years ago for my own use.  </li>
            <li>I liked that it  removed the hair</li>
            <li>Smooth Away just wasn&#x27;t worth the time, although it did a wonderful job exfoliating my skin!</li>
            <li>Quick delivery and Great deal.</li>
            <li>Does not work very easily.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for tweens who are too young to shave.  </li>
            <li>As a fairly hairy guy, I have tried all sorts of hair removal methods available from trimming to wax strips (ouch).</li>
            <li>Perfect for hair on arms or legs because skin isn&#x27;t as sensitive in those areas.</li>
            <li>liked the idea of it since I found out there animal products in Nair, but I think I&#x27;ll just keep looking for hair removal products that work better for me.</li>
            <li>Smooth away works great to easily remove the hair.</li>
            <li>They still do provide a good laugh too!</li>
            <li>When I saw this on TV, it looked too good to be true.</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>Sort of works better as an exfoliator</li>
            <li>These work so much better.</li>
            <li>Love that this comes in a 4 pack.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>Okay, not well, but works</li>
            <li>By the time you&#x27;ve buffed off your hair, you&#x27;ve also removed the top layer of skin.  </li>
            <li>Best of all friction removal discourages future growth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I got these.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t know how it is better than shaving.</li>
            <li>This product is more of an exfoliator than a hair remover.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure anyone that uses these will continue to use them...</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Definitely better than shaving.</li>
            <li>I purchased these to see if it was a better way of removing leg hairs.</li>
            <li>but I think paired with something else it is an even better product.</li>
            <li>and so I am glad to get these</li>
            <li>As Seen on TV&#x27;s Smooth Away Hair Removal System works and works well!</li>
            <li>It took off the hair AND the top layer of skin which then scabbed over.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t like to have to pay shipping, though, which was more than the product.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed this product.</li>
            <li>and I thought that they would provide a good laugh.  </li>
            <li>It works fantastic for me!</li>
            <li>Only time will tell what&#x27;s best for someone else though.</li>
            <li>I used this product many years ago</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased at the the price and how quickly I received it.  </li>
            <li>Overall AMAZING PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li>I do have thicker hair, but I didn&#x27;t find it super effective</li>
            <li>Quick and tidy.</li>
            <li>For the best results, I recommend you to trim it short with a body hair trimmer before using smooth away.</li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s been great for all of us.</li>
            <li>Have been using the Smooth Away System for years, LOVE IT!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
            <li>Follow the directions and make sure your skin is clean before using.</li>
            <li>So easy.</li>
            <li>It helps if you have fine hair or peach fuzz.</li>
            <li>Yes these are basically a fine sandpaper that is what a buffer is</li>
            <li>Purchased these for my daughter&#x3D; she has blond, fine hair on her legs and this did NOT work at all-</li>
            <li>but I use it to get rid of fine hair after I use an epilator.</li>
            <li>I am a loyal fan now!</li>
            <li>It also exfoliated the skin leaving my arms and legs, silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While smooth away requires about twice the time you would spend shaving, the benefit is it&#x27;s painless and</li>
            <li>Smooth Away, I need not resign myself to always wearing pants.</li>
            <li>method still takes about 30 minutes to buff both legs, but ending with smooth, rash-free legs will keep me a devoted customer.</li>
            <li>I like how it exfoliates &amp; makes the skin feel so smooth.</li>
            <li>I do like the smooth away product.</li>
            <li>my legs were smooth</li>
            <li>It claims to be pain free...</li>
            <li>Also the product doesnt come in the smooth away boxes as pictured.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t seem to stay smooth any longer than shaving.</li>
            <li>Smooth Away is okay, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the right product for me.</li>
            <li>I still highly recommend Smooth Away!!  </li>
            <li>This product successfully removed fine blonde hair on my arms and legs.</li>
            <li>This was perfect for the very hairy legs of my first grader who was way too young for a razor</li>
            <li>I love the product it does exactly what is says.</li>
            <li>Gentle, circular motions on clean, dry skin works best.</li>
            <li>Not sure it&#x27;s best for me.</li>
            <li>Just glad i find it here in Amazon ;)</li>
            <li>The inital pain is worth it conpared to the extended irritation causef by this product!</li>
            <li>Great if you&#x27;ve got super dry skin that needed exfoliating, but</li>
            <li>Now they are too soft to be effective.</li>
            <li>After 30 min of constantly rubbing clock-wise and counter-clock wise, it took some of the hair off.</li>
            <li>They both love this product and it is easy for them to use on the sensitive areas are their faces.</li>
            <li>It does create a chalky residue on your skin and that smells mildly like rotten eggs.  </li>
            <li>So Quickly.</li>
            <li>I especially love them for camping at the lake when water use age in my rv is limited to getting your essential body parts clean.</li>
            <li>So easy and fast</li>
            <li>great little thing.</li>
            <li>I do not use this product for my legs, but it is absolutely amazing at removing the peace fuzz around my upper lip.</li>
            <li>Its the real deal smooth away in the rubber pouches.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product, and much cheaper online than it is in stores.</li>
            <li>My 12 year old daughter thinks these are magic.</li>
            <li>and quicker.&lt;br /&gt;I just got rid of mine because it wasn&#x27;t worth</li>
            <li>So if they can go back to the old formula that would be great.</li>
            <li>great, safe, gentle and fairly long lasting way to remove arm hair!</li>
            <li>they are not as rough as the silky smooth by body trends and they are good if know what you are doing and don&#x27;t over buff, but if you have sensitive skin this is probably not for you.</li>
            <li>Just charge more for actual product instead of making up for cheap prices w high shipping costs!</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t really do very much, it&#x27;s like others said, basically sandpaper designed to buff out hairs.</li>
            <li>Very high quality....Will use this vender again!</li>
            <li>Everything went great when ordering form this seller but I&#x27;m beginning to think the overall quality of Smooth Away pads has gone down a bit since I first began using this product 2 years ago.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not anywhere near instant and can cause skin irritation easily, but it is more useful for certain areas than a razor blade could ever be.</li>
            <li>I had to shave first before it would take off the fuzz.</li>
            <li>I used the lip pad first this time and my skin was a bit irritated for a day or so</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t exactly remove hair with a sponge unless you are using chemicals.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>exactly what I was looking for...</li>
            <li>She is a first time shaver.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it since it first came out</li>
            <li>These pads not only remove hair completely, but they leave your skin sooo soft and blackhead free!!!</li>
            <li>For people with low pain tolerance and fine hair, I suppose it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>My mom has had positive results though.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time, but not as good as some I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li>my skin tears very easy due to medication I take.  </li>
            <li>Be certain your skin, the pad,</li>
            <li>It definitely works on fine hair.</li>
            <li>it really gets rid of my hair without much trauma.</li>
            <li>This also took much longer to use than shaving takes.</li>
            <li>This item is a real joke.</li>
            <li>method takes too much time</li>
            <li>I really like these</li>
            <li>Using the no no then buffing with these after is so much faster then just using these or using the buffers that come with the no no.</li>
            <li>no stubble no over buffing redness and no hair patches or anything I just rinse off my legs put on my lotion and was ready to go.</li>
            <li>Love this product but wish the pads were pink like before with 3M on them.  </li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Shaving is so much easier</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The box indicates it&#x27;s for the Smooth Away, but the applicator on the inside has a different brand name, and the &#x27;flex crystal pads&#x27; are just 2000cw sandpaper with adhesive backing, which is much harsher on your skin than the actual Smooth Away pads.</li>
            <li>Seems to be same product and quality as original</li>
            <li>This product has changed my life, I really only use it for my arms &amp; face, but it is the best thing for thin blonde hair all over arms, not only does it get rid of it, but it exfoliates also &amp; makes them smooth!</li>
            <li>but  really embarrassed by her super italian hairy legs!</li>
            <li>the product works great, however the order says &amp;#34;pack of 4&amp;#34; but one of the boxes was empty - kind of disappointing...</li>
            <li>It does a fine job, but by the time you&#x27;re done, you&#x27;ve spent as much time as you would have shaving.</li>
            <li>back up, then I only had to do one more set and all the hair was gone and</li>
            <li>I just didnt like the high shipping cost.</li>
            <li>I am back to the razor and much happier!!</li>
            <li>The pieces of sandpaper that attach to the holders need to be just a little bit more rougher.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your time and money!!</li>
            <li>works great - just don&#x27;t push too hard or wait til hair is too long.  </li>
            <li>My daughter is too young to shave ( 11 ) but she is very hairy.....</li>
            <li>I a glad this worked since I was not comfortable with her using a razor or chemicals.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried on different parts of my body and it just isn&#x27;t worth the time.  </li>
            <li>the other users said, it feels like fine sandpaper on skin.</li>
            <li>Takes four times longer and hair comes right back.</li>
            <li>For those of us who have only a few wild facial hairs, this is a great solution.  </li>
            <li>Its not fair to not know that youre going to pay more for shipping than the product until after youve paid for your order!</li>
            <li>I think the important thing to remember is that everyone is different, so different things work for some people and not for others.</li>
            <li>felt lovely ... and exfoliates dead skin as well as removing lots of hair!</li>
            <li>So first, it definitely works!</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;refill pads only&amp;#34; don&#x27;t appear to be by same company, so I went with entire packages to be sure I got same quality.  </li>
            <li>When my 12 year old came to me, asking to shave, I shuddered!  </li>
            <li>My 12 year old loves it!  </li>
            <li>Maybe i&#x27;m just too fuzzy, but it only did the front of one of my legs and the two big pads it came with wore out quickly</li>
            <li>It was a huge waste of money.</li>
            <li>By following the instructions carefully, my legs go from old growth forest to glacial smooth without the pain and frustration of shaving.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Smooth Away for over a year, though I will still go a few weeks in between uses-</li>
            <li>My tween daughter has become conscious of the hair on her legs.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t get any irritation,  and I have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Apply some body lotion and your skin will feel baby soft.</li>
            <li>I use on my face only using gentle circular motions.  </li>
            <li>Man, I wish I could have had them when I was that young.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re so soft.</li>
            <li>This worked so well on my arm hair (I was very pleasantly surprised, didn&#x27;t expect it to do anything).  </li>
            <li>The only time they caused minor irritation was when she used them past their useful life; so I re-ordered her more off of Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I got my four packages, they were all complete with the product.  </li>
            <li>I have not used on my legs or underarms, but do use frequently for my face and arms.</li>
            <li>Was having trouble find this in my local drugstores, so glad Amazon has in bulk packs.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve heard many other customers complain that the pads were too rough and irritate skin,</li>
            <li>I have super course and dark hair.  </li>
            <li>The pads dull easy and it takes forever to do this.</li>
            <li>First of all this does not remove hair if it is coarse and long.</li>
            <li>I actually don&#x27;t order it to remove hair, but to exfoliate my body, it leaves the skin very soft, I will order this product again</li>
            <li>It works so well for quick hair removal, no, pain, mess, or red bumps.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not talking about the brand, just the product in general.</li>
            <li>but I just can&#x27;t bare the thought of having those hairs ripped out by waxing.  </li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend it and will not hesitate to re-order in due time.</li>
            <li>It is much more easier to shave because it takes less time and exfoliates by removing dead skin.</li>
            <li>those are what you should use if you have sensitive skin but don&#x27;t expect them to last long or do as well of a job.</li>
            <li>It is basically like using sand paper on your legs and left a little friction burn on certain areas on my legs.</li>

            <li> and it works beautifully!</li>
            <li> Great item!!</li>
            <li> perfect for mustache hair and works on legs too after shaving with electric razor.</li>
            <li> The smoothaway; however, works perfectly for me.</li>
            <li> It is a very very very good value for you money.</li>
            <li> Moms happy we are all happy!!!</li>
            <li> It worked great.</li>
            <li> Great deal for four.</li>
            <li> Does the job and makes my skin feel great (exfoliates as well as removes hair).</li>
            <li> lol.</li>
            <li> These are just as great.</li>
            <li> she says the they are great.</li>
            <li> I was really happy with the purchase and with the seller.  </li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> Great deal and arrived before scheduled.</li>
            <li> And you get 4 sets for 10 bucks which is an awesome deal :)</li>
            <li> For myself this wasn&#x27;t a product I found to be very good, but for her much finer hair it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Honestly, it&#x27;s a good exfoliator.</li>
            <li> Follow the directions and use a good moisturizer afterwards and it takes care of that.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m spending a good 30 minutes with my disposable razor.</li>
            <li> I received my product in good order.</li>
            <li> I bought something like these before and loved them.</li>
            <li> I think by itself it is already a really good product</li>
            <li> works so good.</li>
            <li> This was a really good buy.  </li>
            <li> The quality of the product was really good.  </li>
            <li> it does not seem to be as good as I remember.  </li>
            <li> so for many, I suspect, the gentler pad is a welcome relief.  </li>
            <li> For that, they work great and it makes my makeup look more even.</li>
            <li> I use it on my chin area and i am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Best to do this right before a shower</li>
            <li> i LOVE this!</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> It works kind of life sandpaper that you rub in circles on your skin until the hair falls away.  </li>
            <li> Bought this product years ago for my own use.  </li>
            <li> I liked that it  removed the hair</li>
            <li> Smooth Away just wasn&#x27;t worth the time, although it did a wonderful job exfoliating my skin!</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and Great deal.</li>
            <li> Does not work very easily.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for tweens who are too young to shave.  </li>
            <li> As a fairly hairy guy, I have tried all sorts of hair removal methods available from trimming to wax strips (ouch).</li>
            <li> Perfect for hair on arms or legs because skin isn&#x27;t as sensitive in those areas.</li>
            <li> liked the idea of it since I found out there animal products in Nair, but I think I&#x27;ll just keep looking for hair removal products that work better for me.</li>
            <li> Smooth away works great to easily remove the hair.</li>
            <li> They still do provide a good laugh too!</li>
            <li> When I saw this on TV, it looked too good to be true.</li>
            <li> Love these.</li>
            <li> Sort of works better as an exfoliator</li>
            <li> These work so much better.</li>
            <li> Love that this comes in a 4 pack.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> Okay, not well, but works</li>
            <li> By the time you&#x27;ve buffed off your hair, you&#x27;ve also removed the top layer of skin.  </li>
            <li> Best of all friction removal discourages future growth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I got these.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know how it is better than shaving.</li>
            <li> This product is more of an exfoliator than a hair remover.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure anyone that uses these will continue to use them...</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Definitely better than shaving.</li>
            <li> I purchased these to see if it was a better way of removing leg hairs.</li>
            <li> but I think paired with something else it is an even better product.</li>
            <li> and so I am glad to get these</li>
            <li> As Seen on TV&#x27;s Smooth Away Hair Removal System works and works well!</li>
            <li> It took off the hair AND the top layer of skin which then scabbed over.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like to have to pay shipping, though, which was more than the product.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this product.</li>
            <li> and I thought that they would provide a good laugh.  </li>
            <li> It works fantastic for me!</li>
            <li> Only time will tell what&#x27;s best for someone else though.</li>
            <li> I used this product many years ago</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased at the the price and how quickly I received it.  </li>
            <li> Overall AMAZING PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li> I do have thicker hair, but I didn&#x27;t find it super effective</li>
            <li> Quick and tidy.</li>
            <li> For the best results, I recommend you to trim it short with a body hair trimmer before using smooth away.</li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s been great for all of us.</li>
            <li> Have been using the Smooth Away System for years, LOVE IT!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
            <li> Follow the directions and make sure your skin is clean before using.</li>
            <li> So easy.</li>
            <li> It helps if you have fine hair or peach fuzz.</li>
            <li> Yes these are basically a fine sandpaper that is what a buffer is</li>
            <li> Purchased these for my daughter&#x3D; she has blond, fine hair on her legs and this did NOT work at all-</li>
            <li> but I use it to get rid of fine hair after I use an epilator.</li>
            <li> I am a loyal fan now!</li>
            <li> It also exfoliated the skin leaving my arms and legs, silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While smooth away requires about twice the time you would spend shaving, the benefit is it&#x27;s painless and</li>
            <li> Smooth Away, I need not resign myself to always wearing pants.</li>
            <li> method still takes about 30 minutes to buff both legs, but ending with smooth, rash-free legs will keep me a devoted customer.</li>
            <li> I like how it exfoliates &amp; makes the skin feel so smooth.</li>
            <li> I do like the smooth away product.</li>
            <li> my legs were smooth</li>
            <li> It claims to be pain free...</li>
            <li> Also the product doesnt come in the smooth away boxes as pictured.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t seem to stay smooth any longer than shaving.</li>
            <li> Smooth Away is okay, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the right product for me.</li>
            <li> I still highly recommend Smooth Away!!  </li>
            <li> This product successfully removed fine blonde hair on my arms and legs.</li>
            <li> This was perfect for the very hairy legs of my first grader who was way too young for a razor</li>
            <li> I love the product it does exactly what is says.</li>
            <li> Gentle, circular motions on clean, dry skin works best.</li>
            <li> Not sure it&#x27;s best for me.</li>
            <li> Just glad i find it here in Amazon ;)</li>
            <li> The inital pain is worth it conpared to the extended irritation causef by this product!</li>
            <li> Great if you&#x27;ve got super dry skin that needed exfoliating, but</li>
            <li> Now they are too soft to be effective.</li>
            <li> After 30 min of constantly rubbing clock-wise and counter-clock wise, it took some of the hair off.</li>
            <li> They both love this product and it is easy for them to use on the sensitive areas are their faces.</li>
            <li> It does create a chalky residue on your skin and that smells mildly like rotten eggs.  </li>
            <li> So Quickly.</li>
            <li> I especially love them for camping at the lake when water use age in my rv is limited to getting your essential body parts clean.</li>
            <li> So easy and fast</li>
            <li> great little thing.</li>
            <li> I do not use this product for my legs, but it is absolutely amazing at removing the peace fuzz around my upper lip.</li>
            <li> Its the real deal smooth away in the rubber pouches.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, and much cheaper online than it is in stores.</li>
            <li> My 12 year old daughter thinks these are magic.</li>
            <li> and quicker.&lt;br /&gt;I just got rid of mine because it wasn&#x27;t worth</li>
            <li> So if they can go back to the old formula that would be great.</li>
            <li> great, safe, gentle and fairly long lasting way to remove arm hair!</li>
            <li> they are not as rough as the silky smooth by body trends and they are good if know what you are doing and don&#x27;t over buff, but if you have sensitive skin this is probably not for you.</li>
            <li> Just charge more for actual product instead of making up for cheap prices w high shipping costs!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t really do very much, it&#x27;s like others said, basically sandpaper designed to buff out hairs.</li>
            <li> Very high quality....Will use this vender again!</li>
            <li> Everything went great when ordering form this seller but I&#x27;m beginning to think the overall quality of Smooth Away pads has gone down a bit since I first began using this product 2 years ago.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not anywhere near instant and can cause skin irritation easily, but it is more useful for certain areas than a razor blade could ever be.</li>
            <li> I had to shave first before it would take off the fuzz.</li>
            <li> I used the lip pad first this time and my skin was a bit irritated for a day or so</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t exactly remove hair with a sponge unless you are using chemicals.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for...</li>
            <li> She is a first time shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it since it first came out</li>
            <li> These pads not only remove hair completely, but they leave your skin sooo soft and blackhead free!!!</li>
            <li> For people with low pain tolerance and fine hair, I suppose it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> My mom has had positive results though.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, but not as good as some I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> my skin tears very easy due to medication I take.  </li>
            <li> Be certain your skin, the pad,</li>
            <li> It definitely works on fine hair.</li>
            <li> it really gets rid of my hair without much trauma.</li>
            <li> This also took much longer to use than shaving takes.</li>
            <li> This item is a real joke.</li>
            <li> method takes too much time</li>
            <li> I really like these</li>
            <li> Using the no no then buffing with these after is so much faster then just using these or using the buffers that come with the no no.</li>
            <li> no stubble no over buffing redness and no hair patches or anything I just rinse off my legs put on my lotion and was ready to go.</li>
            <li> Love this product but wish the pads were pink like before with 3M on them.  </li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Shaving is so much easier</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> The box indicates it&#x27;s for the Smooth Away, but the applicator on the inside has a different brand name, and the &#x27;flex crystal pads&#x27; are just 2000cw sandpaper with adhesive backing, which is much harsher on your skin than the actual Smooth Away pads.</li>
            <li> Seems to be same product and quality as original</li>
            <li> This product has changed my life, I really only use it for my arms &amp; face, but it is the best thing for thin blonde hair all over arms, not only does it get rid of it, but it exfoliates also &amp; makes them smooth!</li>
            <li> but  really embarrassed by her super italian hairy legs!</li>
            <li> the product works great, however the order says &amp;#34;pack of 4&amp;#34; but one of the boxes was empty - kind of disappointing...</li>
            <li> It does a fine job, but by the time you&#x27;re done, you&#x27;ve spent as much time as you would have shaving.</li>
            <li> back up, then I only had to do one more set and all the hair was gone and</li>
            <li> I just didnt like the high shipping cost.</li>
            <li> I am back to the razor and much happier!!</li>
            <li> The pieces of sandpaper that attach to the holders need to be just a little bit more rougher.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your time and money!!</li>
            <li> works great - just don&#x27;t push too hard or wait til hair is too long.  </li>
            <li> My daughter is too young to shave ( 11 ) but she is very hairy.....</li>
            <li> I a glad this worked since I was not comfortable with her using a razor or chemicals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried on different parts of my body and it just isn&#x27;t worth the time.  </li>
            <li> the other users said, it feels like fine sandpaper on skin.</li>
            <li> Takes four times longer and hair comes right back.</li>
            <li> For those of us who have only a few wild facial hairs, this is a great solution.  </li>
            <li> Its not fair to not know that youre going to pay more for shipping than the product until after youve paid for your order!</li>
            <li> I think the important thing to remember is that everyone is different, so different things work for some people and not for others.</li>
            <li> felt lovely ... and exfoliates dead skin as well as removing lots of hair!</li>
            <li> So first, it definitely works!</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;refill pads only&amp;#34; don&#x27;t appear to be by same company, so I went with entire packages to be sure I got same quality.  </li>
            <li> When my 12 year old came to me, asking to shave, I shuddered!  </li>
            <li> My 12 year old loves it!  </li>
            <li> Maybe i&#x27;m just too fuzzy, but it only did the front of one of my legs and the two big pads it came with wore out quickly</li>
            <li> It was a huge waste of money.</li>
            <li> By following the instructions carefully, my legs go from old growth forest to glacial smooth without the pain and frustration of shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Smooth Away for over a year, though I will still go a few weeks in between uses-</li>
            <li> My tween daughter has become conscious of the hair on her legs.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t get any irritation,  and I have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Apply some body lotion and your skin will feel baby soft.</li>
            <li> I use on my face only using gentle circular motions.  </li>
            <li> Man, I wish I could have had them when I was that young.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re so soft.</li>
            <li> This worked so well on my arm hair (I was very pleasantly surprised, didn&#x27;t expect it to do anything).  </li>
            <li> The only time they caused minor irritation was when she used them past their useful life; so I re-ordered her more off of Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I got my four packages, they were all complete with the product.  </li>
            <li> I have not used on my legs or underarms, but do use frequently for my face and arms.</li>
            <li> Was having trouble find this in my local drugstores, so glad Amazon has in bulk packs.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve heard many other customers complain that the pads were too rough and irritate skin,</li>
            <li> I have super course and dark hair.  </li>
            <li> The pads dull easy and it takes forever to do this.</li>
            <li> First of all this does not remove hair if it is coarse and long.</li>
            <li> I actually don&#x27;t order it to remove hair, but to exfoliate my body, it leaves the skin very soft, I will order this product again</li>
            <li> It works so well for quick hair removal, no, pain, mess, or red bumps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not talking about the brand, just the product in general.</li>
            <li> but I just can&#x27;t bare the thought of having those hairs ripped out by waxing.  </li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend it and will not hesitate to re-order in due time.</li>
            <li> It is much more easier to shave because it takes less time and exfoliates by removing dead skin.</li>
            <li> those are what you should use if you have sensitive skin but don&#x27;t expect them to last long or do as well of a job.</li>
            <li> It is basically like using sand paper on your legs and left a little friction burn on certain areas on my legs.</li>
            <li> You have to rub smooth away in small circular motions with slight pressure in order to get results.</li>
            <li> I have dark soft hair on my forearms.</li>
            <li> Of course it doesn&#x27;t last as long as waxing would</li>
            <li> Thought it was a &amp;#34;kinder, gentler&amp;#34; way to start my young daughter down this road.  </li>
            <li> My skin tried to scab over afterwards, leaving a thicker layer of skin that new hairs were trapped under.  </li>
            <li> I used it on my legs after a shower and it left them dry, scraped, and scaly.</li>
            <li> My skin is very pale, so it is really noticeable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strange, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li> I like to use it when I let it grow too long</li>
            <li> if any one tries to say this product works, theyre lying, I bought about 5 boxes of this garbage only to throw them away in the trash.</li>
            <li> The skin on my forearms is not sensitive...</li>
            <li> DONT try it on your face or armpits, the rubbing will definitely irritate your skin no matter how careful you are.</li>
            <li> I forgot that if you rub the pad too long on any one area that my skin gets irritated.  </li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t rub too hard or use them right after showering or sweating, this is when they they can cause redness or slight burning.</li>
            <li> even the air are dry, i.e. don&#x27;t try this in a steamy bathroom- abrasions will occur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is painful but yields better results overall and lasts longer.</li>
            <li> but if not then just take a soft wet cloth and wipe off any dead skin or hair.</li>
            <li> I can not use a standard straight razor because my skin is so thin.  </li>
            <li> I have a hairy chest and patches of dark hair growing on my back.</li>
            <li> and because you&#x27;re not plucking, the hair doesn&#x27;t come back dark.  </li>
            <li> I have very coarse, dark hair.</li>
            <li> And I think less hairs grow back.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I wouldn&#x27;t give these a 5 star rating, is because one pad only went for one leg up to my knee before it got dull.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful applying the pressure while rubbing or you might hurt your skin.</li>
            <li> if your skin is at all sensitive, it will leave behind a nice painful rash that feels a bit like rug burn.  </li>
            <li> This was a total waste of money and did not work as advertised.</li>
            <li> input to this product but will tell you my wife uses this regularly and we&#x27;ve bought these a few times.  </li>
            <li> 2 boxes came empty.</li>
            <li> It removed the unwanted hair as was expected.  </li>
            <li> so it rates as I expected.</li>
            <li> My HAIR is not coarse but not fine either.  </li>
            <li> Ingrowns, a painful rash, and hair that grew back as quickly as if I&#x27;d shaved - this was not worth the money I spent on it, and I bought mine at the Dollar Tree.  </li>
            <li> I usually wax my upper lip but instead decided to try these.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d rather do this ever other week then go through the pain of waxing.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried on other parts of my body.</li>
            <li> I prefer this product with all the other kinds i could get at the stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used it on my legs or underarms, but for removing small hairs on my face, it&#x27;s terrific!</li>
            <li> You have to do it every other day to keep it under control.  </li>
            <li> I will pay the $7 every other week for a wax at the salon because waxing does work &amp; no effort on my part.</li>
            <li> The reason I assume this product gets so many bad reviews is probably because people with very thick hair is using it, OR they are not using it properly, if someone says their skin is coming off, they are obviously rubbing too hard &amp; not in a circular motion like your supposed too.</li>
            <li> This is too difficult to use on the armpit area or face or on coarse hair in general.</li>
            <li> It did not remove any hair and it was not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the length of time involved in hair removal.</li>
            <li> This product is not worth the time or money.</li>
            <li> (at least until it grows back).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not a routine I want to commit to; it takes so long just to remove a small area of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Oh and beware of rubbing too hard around the lip because it will make it a little red for a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just noticed that these pads wear down after just one use whereas my previous orders contained pads I could exfoliate with for days.</li>
            <li> I did one set small circles moving in a line down my leg then rotating small circles in the opposite direction (clockwise down, counter clockwise up my leg)</li>
            <li> I used it on two spots on lower leg and felt a slight burn</li>
            <li> No they were still there looking closely at the product it looks like sand paper and slightly feels like it too</li>
            <li> I also tried it on my arm where there is less hair, it still didnt work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product previously at</li>
            <li> and although i have very sensitive skin,  i never had any scary side effects.</li>
            <li> No need to squint into a mirror to locate the offending bristle, just rub at little and its gone.  </li>
            <li> the little oval applicator is just rite for face.</li>
            <li> So not fun!  </li>
            <li> It also takes about 7 circles to remove the area of hair, so your hands will hurt afterwards and it won&#x27;t take a few moments.  </li>
            <li> Waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, waste of money</li>
            <li> Waste of Money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> I bought some of these as a &amp;#34;gag&amp;#34; gift for my wife a few years ago off of a department store&#x27;s clearance table.  </li>
            <li> Waste of your money</li>
            <li> The shipping was a few days to Tn.</li>
            <li> It just plain doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> wa s just plain dissapointed.</li>
            <li> not cool!</li>
            <li> It was painless with very little irritation afterward.</li>
            <li> waste of money!</li>
            <li> I tried this product on a small part of my leg, it worked well</li>
            <li> but you have to scrub yourself in a small circular motions for about 5 minutes in one spot and then the pad wears out.</li>
            <li> I was not pleased with how well it worked</li>
            <li> well i read how to use even found a small tip vidio online .</li>
            <li> these things aree not safe and will ruin ur skin, I have to use makeup to cover these spots if i wear anything that shows that part of legs..</li>
            <li> Other than the secret shipping, it wouldve been a 5.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Hey Kool-Aid&amp;#34; are the words I heard from my adoring husband&#x27;s mouth after using this God awful thing on my upper lip.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find item.</li>
            <li> They work well and they are hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> didnt want to give one star but cant post without rating at least a 1</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really hairy and HATE it.</li>
            <li> I paid thousands of dollars for laser hair removal, and even though I was a &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; candidate with light skin and dark hair, it failed miserable.</li>
            <li> Not good for hairy people</li>
            <li> much easier (and less painful) to just shave :(</li>
            <li> If you want to thin the hair growth, I suggest waxing.</li>
            <li> It took a while of going in circles to remove the hair that it ended up irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> The shipping on this was absolutely ridiculous!</li>
            <li> Have used it now for six months and really sorry I bought it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the pads still work well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always somewhat skeptical of &amp;#34;As seen on TV &amp;#34; products, a friend recommend this</li>
            <li> fake beacause</li>
            <li> This is a fake.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed and now know it was a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Has the retailer been replacing the pads with a cheaper, knock off brand or is the manufacturer cutting corners thinking no one will notice?  </li>
            <li> It is difficult for take of all the hair!</li>
            <li> I get really bad razor burn from shaving all the time.</li>
            <li> Its like a really bad exfoliating treatment.</li>
            <li> why do painful tweezing?  </li>
            <li> but nothing that was what I considered painful or anything, just irritated.  </li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> It stinks!</li>
            <li> For me this product is worthless, but won&#x27;t speak for everyone.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving my legs.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use these on my legs but for peach fuzz on my face that I&#x27;ve always hated.</li>
            <li> I hated this product didn&#x27;t remove hair and burnt skin</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> but I had a horrible reaction: redness, bumps, and even a rash looking outbreak.</li>
            <li> it are awful</li>
            <li> This was awful!!!!</li>
            <li> This is one of the worst things I have ever tried.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Honestly, it&#x27;s a good exfoliator. And I only use it as such.</li>
            <li> Love these. Hard to find item.</li>
            <li> I bought these because they were recommended by a friend. I usually wax my upper lip but instead decided to try these. It caused an abrasion like sandpaper.&lt;br /&gt;My friend can have the rest, these don&#x27;t even work and they hurt.</li>
            <li> I use this product in between uses with my epilator . It appears to extend the time I need between. Sort of works better as an exfoliator</li>
            <li> This system did not work at all for me. I had to shave first before it would take off the fuzz. I would not recommend this</li>
            <li> Does not work very easily.  Takes a lot of muscle and patience.</li>
            <li> This was perfect for the very hairy legs of my first grader who was way too young for a razor but  really embarrassed by her super italian hairy legs! Worked awesome. ... felt lovely ... and exfoliates dead skin as well as removing lots of hair!</li>
            <li> I used this on my &amp;#34;mustache&amp;#34; area.  It worked great. It was painless with very little irritation afterward. Follow the directions and use a good moisturizer afterwards and it takes care of that.  Of course it doesn&#x27;t last as long as waxing would but I just can&#x27;t bare the thought of having those hairs ripped out by waxing.  The hair is starting to grow back after a week but I&#x27;d rather do this ever other week then go through the pain of waxing.</li>
            <li> So first, it definitely works! It will remove hair. But only on your arms or legs.  It works kind of life sandpaper that you rub in circles on your skin until the hair falls away.  It&#x27;s strange, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt.  It does create a chalky residue on your skin and that smells mildly like rotten eggs.  This is too difficult to use on the armpit area or face or on coarse hair in general. It also takes about 7 circles to remove the area of hair, so your hands will hurt afterwards and it won&#x27;t take a few moments.  I like to use it when I let it grow too long and I don&#x27;t want to clog up my razor.</li>
            <li> Does not work for me or my daughter</li>
            <li> i LOVE this! it really gets rid of my hair without much trauma. Just be careful applying the pressure while rubbing or you might hurt your skin.</li>
            <li> I get really bad razor burn from shaving all the time. These work so much better. I especially love them for camping at the lake when water use age in my rv is limited to getting your essential body parts clean.</li>
            <li> Great deal for four. Cannot find locally. Very happy and it works great!</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t work on hair if they are longer then 1, maximum 2 mm. So you would need to do it every couple of days for legs, and it does irritates the skin, it starts to hurt cuz you do it so often. Doesn&#x27;t work on bikini area at all! For me this product is worthless, but won&#x27;t speak for everyone. Try yourself.</li>
            <li> Love that this comes in a 4 pack.&lt;br /&gt;A great, safe, gentle and fairly long lasting way to remove arm hair!</li>
            <li> Okay, not well, but works</li>
            <li> Love this! Makes my skin shine!</li>
            <li> By the time you&#x27;ve buffed off your hair, you&#x27;ve also removed the top layer of skin.  Great if you&#x27;ve got super dry skin that needed exfoliating, but if your skin is at all sensitive, it will leave behind a nice painful rash that feels a bit like rug burn.  My skin tried to scab over afterwards, leaving a thicker layer of skin that new hairs were trapped under.  Ingrowns, a painful rash, and hair that grew back as quickly as if I&#x27;d shaved - this was not worth the money I spent on it, and I bought mine at the Dollar Tree.  This also took much longer to use than shaving takes.</li>
            <li> I have used this product and wanted it as a gift.  i couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere in the stores.  I didn&#x27;t think to check Amazon until the last minute.  I was very pleased at the the price and how quickly I received it.  I love the product it does exactly what is says.</li>
            <li> This was a total waste of money and did not work as advertised.</li>
            <li> This product successfully removed fine blonde hair on my arms and legs. It also exfoliated the skin leaving my arms and legs, silky and smooth. You have to rub smooth away in small circular motions with slight pressure in order to get results. It helps if you have fine hair or peach fuzz. It does not work as well on thicker hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While smooth away requires about twice the time you would spend shaving, the benefit is it&#x27;s painless and you cannot nick yourself like you can with a razor. For people with low pain tolerance and fine hair, I suppose it&#x27;s worth it. I, personally, prefer waxing and the epilator. Smooth Away just wasn&#x27;t worth the time, although it did a wonderful job exfoliating my skin!</li>
            <li> Perfect for tweens who are too young to shave.  No bumps and no cuts!</li>
            <li> Waste of time and money. Its like a really bad exfoliating treatment. Don&#x27;t even consider getting one of these things.</li>
            <li> I like these and would buy this product again. It is a very very very good value for you money.</li>
            <li> why do painful tweezing?  For those of us who have only a few wild facial hairs, this is a great solution.  No need to squint into a mirror to locate the offending bristle, just rub at little and its gone.  Best of all friction removal discourages future growth.</li>
            <li> I actually don&#x27;t order it to remove hair, but to exfoliate my body, it leaves the skin very soft, I will order this product again</li>
            <li> waste of money! do not buy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not talking about the brand, just the product in general. The pads dull easy and it takes forever to do this. I&#x27;m really hairy and HATE it. :( I&#x27;m still on the look out to help reduce hair coming back or getting rid of it all together.</li>
            <li> This item is a real joke. What a waste of money and time. Takes four times longer and hair comes right back. Have used it now for six months and really sorry I bought it. I am back to the razor and much happier!!</li>
            <li> if any one tries to say this product works, theyre lying, I bought about 5 boxes of this garbage only to throw them away in the trash. DO NOT RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> The pieces of sandpaper that attach to the holders need to be just a little bit more rougher.  Now they are too soft to be effective.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my elderly mother and her sister.  They both love this product and it is easy for them to use on the sensitive areas are their faces. Moms happy we are all happy!!!</li>
            <li> I hate shaving my legs. The thought of razor burn, nicks, and itchy skin drives me to not shave for months. Then a time will come when I need to wear a shorter skirt and I&#x27;m spending a good 30 minutes with my disposable razor. *shudder*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Smooth Away, I need not resign myself to always wearing pants. By following the instructions carefully, my legs go from old growth forest to glacial smooth without the pain and frustration of shaving. I&#x27;ve been using Smooth Away for over a year, though I will still go a few weeks in between uses- I&#x27;m lazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note well, rub as softly as possible and always in the alternating circular motion described in the instructions. Be certain your skin, the pad, even the air are dry, i.e. don&#x27;t try this in a steamy bathroom- abrasions will occur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This method still takes about 30 minutes to buff both legs, but ending with smooth, rash-free legs will keep me a devoted customer.</li>
            <li> Was having trouble find this in my local drugstores, so glad Amazon has in bulk packs.  It works so well for quick hair removal, no, pain, mess, or red bumps.</li>
            <li> the product works great, however the order says &amp;#34;pack of 4&amp;#34; but one of the boxes was empty - kind of disappointing...</li>
            <li> My tween daughter has become conscious of the hair on her legs. For myself this wasn&#x27;t a product I found to be very good, but for her much finer hair it works wonderfully. I a glad this worked since I was not comfortable with her using a razor or chemicals.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time and money!! It does nothing!  after smoothing for 20 minutes, only several hair were removed !!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, waste of money</li>
            <li> This does not work at all! I used it on my legs after a shower and it left them dry, scraped, and scaly. It did not remove any hair and it was not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always struggled with shaving or waxing.  I have super course and dark hair.  At this point I would try anything once.  I&#x27;m so glad I got these.  The only reason I wouldn&#x27;t give these a 5 star rating, is because one pad only went for one leg up to my knee before it got dull.  But they do work,  and I didn&#x27;t get any irritation,  and I have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This Product Works If It Is Used Properly. Rub The Area Needed For About 10 Second In One Direction &amp; Again In Another Direction. The Only Problem I Seem To Have Is The Hairs Growing Back So Quickly.</li>
            <li> I like how it exfoliates &amp; makes the skin feel so smooth. Circular motions work best to remove the hair.</li>
            <li> As a fairly hairy guy, I have tried all sorts of hair removal methods available from trimming to wax strips (ouch). I have a hairy chest and patches of dark hair growing on my back. It is not like a sweater or anything but you can still see it if you look close. When I saw this on TV, it looked too good to be true. So I bought one for my sister and one for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the other users said, it feels like fine sandpaper on skin. First of all this does not remove hair if it is coarse and long. For the best results, I recommend you to trim it short with a body hair trimmer before using smooth away. After 30 min of constantly rubbing clock-wise and counter-clock wise, it took some of the hair off. But there are still patches where the hair hasn&#x27;t come off yet specifically the rounder areas of the body (shoulders, upper back, lower back etc.) So I had to get my razor and go over those areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This method takes too much time and I don&#x27;t know how it is better than shaving. This product is more of an exfoliator than a hair remover. It is much more easier to shave because it takes less time and exfoliates by removing dead skin. If you want to thin the hair growth, I suggest waxing. It is painful but yields better results overall and lasts longer.</li>
            <li> I have dark soft hair on my forearms. My skin is very pale, so it is really noticeable. Smooth away works great to easily remove the hair. The skin on my forearms is not sensitive...it&#x27;s been exposed to sun and who else knows what. I haven&#x27;t tried on other parts of my body. Hair on legs is very coarse, it would not work.</li>
            <li> I received my product in good order. I do like the smooth away product. it is one of the best products for hair removal.</li>
            <li> Everything went great when ordering form this seller but I&#x27;m beginning to think the overall quality of Smooth Away pads has gone down a bit since I first began using this product 2 years ago.  Has the retailer been replacing the pads with a cheaper, knock off brand or is the manufacturer cutting corners thinking no one will notice?  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the pads still work well and I&#x27;ve heard many other customers complain that the pads were too rough and irritate skin, so for many, I suspect, the gentler pad is a welcome relief.  I&#x27;ve just noticed that these pads wear down after just one use whereas my previous orders contained pads I could exfoliate with for days. Still a WONDERFUL product and I still highly recommend Smooth Away!!  These pads not only remove hair completely, but they leave your skin sooo soft and blackhead free!!! Just don&#x27;t rub too hard or use them right after showering or sweating, this is when they they can cause redness or slight burning. Gentle, circular motions on clean, dry skin works best. Overall AMAZING PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li> Bought this at the drug store one time and now I have boxes of these just in case they stop making them. Perfect for hair on arms or legs because skin isn&#x27;t as sensitive in those areas. DONT try it on your face or armpits, the rubbing will definitely irritate your skin no matter how careful you are. Follow the directions and make sure your skin is clean before using. Best to do this right before a shower but if not then just take a soft wet cloth and wipe off any dead skin or hair. Apply some body lotion and your skin will feel baby soft.</li>
            <li> I received 4 packages the day after I placed the order!  Seems to be same product and quality as original I bought a couple of years ago.  The &amp;#34;refill pads only&amp;#34; don&#x27;t appear to be by same company, so I went with entire packages to be sure I got same quality.  I use on my face only using gentle circular motions.  Exfoliates while removing hairs.  And I think less hairs grow back.  I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
            <li> Does the job and makes my skin feel great (exfoliates as well as removes hair). My only complaint is the length of time involved in hair removal.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use these on my legs but for peach fuzz on my face that I&#x27;ve always hated. For that, they work great and it makes my makeup look more even. And you get 4 sets for 10 bucks which is an awesome deal :)</li>
            <li> I bought this product in the hopes it would be a neat and simple way to get rid of hair without using a razor.  I followed the directions accordingly and the pads did not remove the hair on my legs it scrapped of my skin instead. It took over a week for my skin to heal and I had marks for another week.  This product is not worth the time or money.</li>
            <li> The reason I assume this product gets so many bad reviews is probably because people with very thick hair is using it, OR they are not using it properly, if someone says their skin is coming off, they are obviously rubbing too hard &amp; not in a circular motion like your supposed too. This product has changed my life, I really only use it for my arms &amp; face, but it is the best thing for thin blonde hair all over arms, not only does it get rid of it, but it exfoliates also &amp; makes them smooth!</li>
            <li> I ended up breaking out after using it. Not sure it&#x27;s best for me. My mom has had positive results though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not the expert (or user) but my wife loves these!  I won&#x27;t even try to give &amp;#34;experience&amp;#34; input to this product but will tell you my wife uses this regularly and we&#x27;ve bought these a few times.  I&#x27;m sure anyone that uses these will continue to use them...lol.</li>
            <li> I do not use this product for my legs, but it is absolutely amazing at removing the peace fuzz around my upper lip. I have never tried it on my legs though, so give it a try! Oh and beware of rubbing too hard around the lip because it will make it a little red for a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> Love this product. My daughter is too young to shave ( 11 ) but she is very hairy.....she uses this to remove her hair on her legs.....Perfect for her</li>
            <li> My 12 year old daughter thinks these are magic. Man, I wish I could have had them when I was that young. Definitely better than shaving.</li>
            <li> I tried this product on a small part of my leg, it worked well but I had a horrible reaction: redness, bumps, and even a rash looking outbreak. When I read further, I may have not used it correctly so I will try again with hopefully a different result!</li>
            <li> works great - just don&#x27;t push too hard or wait til hair is too long.  and because you&#x27;re not plucking, the hair doesn&#x27;t come back dark.  the little oval applicator is just rite for face.</li>
            <li> 2 boxes came empty. not cool!</li>
            <li> It definitely works on fine hair. I used it on my arms and they&#x27;re so soft. But on course hair I suggest you use another method. I tried my legs and underarms, it wouldn&#x27;t budge.</li>
            <li> It does somewhat work but you have to scrub yourself in a small circular motions for about 5 minutes in one spot and then the pad wears out. Maybe i&#x27;m just too fuzzy, but it only did the front of one of my legs and the two big pads it came with wore out quickly (only 1 session). I was not pleased with how well it worked and that&#x27;s why I only gave it 2 stars.</li>
            <li> This product beats the heck out of waxing!!  I&#x27;m always somewhat skeptical of &amp;#34;As seen on TV &amp;#34; products, a friend recommend this and it works beautifully!</li>
            <li> I purchased these to see if it was a better way of removing leg hairs. well i read how to use even found a small tip vidio online . I used it on two spots on lower leg and felt a slight burn so i waited 24 hrs... well to my surprise i have now 2 yrs later two spots on my leg that are red and wont go away .. these things aree not safe and will ruin ur skin, I have to use makeup to cover these spots if i wear anything that shows that part of legs.. didnt want to give one star but cant post without rating at least a 1</li>
            <li> I used this product years ago and remembered that it worked, so I decided to give it another go.  I forgot that if you rub the pad too long on any one area that my skin gets irritated.  I used the lip pad first this time and my skin was a bit irritated for a day or so but nothing that was what I considered painful or anything, just irritated.  But it went away and I didn&#x27;t have the hair to contend with anymore (at least until it grows back).  I would recommend giving this product a try, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Product was misrepresented. Only one box was sent, not four. Product  that was sent looked used. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It just plain doesn&#x27;t work.  I&#x27;ve tried on different parts of my body and it just isn&#x27;t worth the time.  I got it for my face and wa s just plain dissapointed.</li>
            <li> I bought something like these before and loved them. These are just as great. Great item!!</li>
            <li> I really like these they are not as rough as the silky smooth by body trends and they are good if know what you are doing and don&#x27;t over buff, but if you have sensitive skin this is probably not for you. I used to buy these at the store all the time before they stopped selling them in my area and I had to go back to a razor. I actually got a no no pro recently and their buffers that come with it are awful they are supposed to remove the rest of the burnt hair that is left and exfoliate your skin but it only works one time those are what you should use if you have sensitive skin but don&#x27;t expect them to last long or do as well of a job. Using the no no then buffing with these after is so much faster then just using these or using the buffers that come with the no no. I did one set small circles moving in a line down my leg then rotating small circles in the opposite direction (clockwise down, counter clockwise up my leg) back up, then I only had to do one more set and all the hair was gone and my legs were smooth no stubble no over buffing redness and no hair patches or anything I just rinse off my legs put on my lotion and was ready to go. Yes these are basically a fine sandpaper that is what a buffer is you can&#x27;t exactly remove hair with a sponge unless you are using chemicals. I think by itself it is already a really good product but I think paired with something else it is an even better product.</li>
            <li> Purchased these for my daughter&#x3D; she has blond, fine hair on her legs and this did NOT work at all- it did not remove ANY of her hair!</li>
            <li> Love this product but wish the pads were pink like before with 3M on them.  This items works for me in between shaves and only for a day.</li>
            <li> I prefer this product with all the other kinds i could get at the stores. I don&#x27;t like the shaver, spray and such and such. I&#x27;ve been a user with this product for 5yrs now and although i have very sensitive skin,  i never had any scary side effects. Just glad i find it here in Amazon ;)</li>
            <li> I gave some away and kept the rest. So far, it&#x27;s been great for all of us. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work. I beleive it &#x27;s fake beacause it didn&#x27;t even remove one hair.  I would never buy again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waist your money! It stinks! Does not work!</li>
            <li> This was awful!!!! It claims to be pain free...well, it is. When you initally use it. However! Just be patient! The pain and bumps will come! It feels like a sunburn, and parts of my arms look as though they WERE sunburned! If you&#x27;re as picky about body hair as I am, stick to waxing and shaving! The inital pain is worth it conpared to the extended irritation causef by this product!</li>
            <li> always use these for unwanted hair.  They work well and they are hard to find in stores and so I am glad to get these</li>
            <li> As Seen on TV&#x27;s Smooth Away Hair Removal System works and works well! I am a loyal fan now! I love this product!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Hey Kool-Aid&amp;#34; are the words I heard from my adoring husband&#x27;s mouth after using this God awful thing on my upper lip.  It took off the hair AND the top layer of skin which then scabbed over.  After a week of slathering myself in triple antibiotic, it finally healed.  Save your dignity. Do not buy this product!</li>
            <li> This worked so well on my arm hair (I was very pleasantly surprised, didn&#x27;t expect it to do anything).  Totally beats shaving.  I can do it at my office during lunch.</li>
            <li> great little thing. Didn&#x27;t like to have to pay shipping, though, which was more than the product.</li>
            <li> bought them for my mom. she says the they are great.</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for...thanks</li>
            <li> Not good for hairy people</li>
            <li> It took my skin off!&lt;br /&gt;So much easier (and less painful) to just shave :(</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. it doesn&#x27;t remove hair. Waste of Money.</li>
            <li> Shaving is so much easier and quicker.&lt;br /&gt;I just got rid of mine because it wasn&#x27;t worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> works so good. perfect for mustache hair and works on legs too after shaving with electric razor. I really enjoyed this product.</li>
            <li> I bought some of these as a &amp;#34;gag&amp;#34; gift for my wife a few years ago off of a department store&#x27;s clearance table.  They were only a dollar and I thought that they would provide a good laugh.  She tried them out and has been hooked ever since.  The only time they caused minor irritation was when she used them past their useful life; so I re-ordered her more off of Amazon.  They still do provide a good laugh too!</li>
            <li> It is difficult for take of all the hair!</li>
            <li> This is the same product as sold in stores that I have purchased before.  This was a really good buy.  I got my four packages, they were all complete with the product.  The quality of the product was really good.  It removed the unwanted hair as was expected.  I was really happy with the purchase and with the seller.  The package arrived promptly and served its purpose.  I would certainly recommend it and will not hesitate to re-order in due time.</li>
            <li> This was for my neice. She is a first time shaver. Thanks</li>
            <li> I have not used on my legs or underarms, but do use frequently for my face and arms. It works fantastic for me! I think the important thing to remember is that everyone is different, so different things work for some people and not for others. I paid thousands of dollars for laser hair removal, and even though I was a &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; candidate with light skin and dark hair, it failed miserable. It was a huge waste of money. The smoothaway; however, works perfectly for me. Only time will tell what&#x27;s best for someone else though.</li>
            <li> I do have thicker hair, but I didn&#x27;t find it super effective</li>
            <li> Works great. So easy and fast and you can do it anywhere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it since it first came out and all it did was make my skin white and flaky on the area I was rubbing and eventually turning it red ...hoping my hairs were gone ?! No they were still there looking closely at the product it looks like sand paper and slightly feels like it too</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, but not as good as some I&#x27;ve had in the past. Won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> Smooth Away is okay, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the right product for me. It took a while of going in circles to remove the hair that it ended up irritating my skin. It&#x27;s just not a routine I want to commit to; it takes so long just to remove a small area of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the idea of it since I found out there animal products in Nair, but I think I&#x27;ll just keep looking for hair removal products that work better for me.</li>
            <li> When my 12 year old came to me, asking to shave, I shuddered!  So not fun!  Bought this product years ago for my own use.  Admittedly, I don&#x27;t use it all of the time, but do like it when I do use it.  Thought it was a &amp;#34;kinder, gentler&amp;#34; way to start my young daughter down this road.  Went with the econo pack for the three of us (have an even younger daughter who will be using this soon, as well).  My 12 year old loves it!  We only use it on our legs - fyi.  Skin feels smoother after using, as well (exfoliating in nature).  Give it a try!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used it on my legs or underarms, but for removing small hairs on my face, it&#x27;s terrific! Quick and tidy.</li>
            <li> You have to do it every other day to keep it under control.  I can not use a standard straight razor because my skin is so thin.  my skin tears very easy due to medication I take.  I used this product many years ago it does not seem to be as good as I remember.  So if they can go back to the old formula that would be great.</li>
            <li> I liked that it  removed the hair and i had no side effects from it. I use it on my chin area and i am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I hated this product didn&#x27;t remove hair and burnt skin</li>
            <li> Love this product.  So easy.</li>
            <li> This is a fake. The box indicates it&#x27;s for the Smooth Away, but the applicator on the inside has a different brand name, and the &#x27;flex crystal pads&#x27; are just 2000cw sandpaper with adhesive backing, which is much harsher on your skin than the actual Smooth Away pads.</li>
            <li> This is one of the worst things I have ever tried. It removed maybe 2 hairs on my legs and that is it. It is basically like using sand paper on your legs and left a little friction burn on certain areas on my legs.</li>
            <li> I used this on my face, and it did not work. My HAIR is not coarse but not fine either.  I also tried it on my arm where there is less hair, it still didnt work. I will pay the $7 every other week for a wax at the salon because waxing does work &amp; no effort on my part.</li>
            <li> Not working at all. Waste of your money</li>
            <li> The shipping on this was absolutely ridiculous! I didnt know the shipping was over 8.00 until i got shipping info. The product itself was priced at 2.74. It ships in a 9oz envelope from las vegas. The shipping was a few days to Tn. Also the product doesnt come in the smooth away boxes as pictured. I have pics but my phone wont let me post em. Its the real deal smooth away in the rubber pouches. Set of 4. It does the trick for womens facial hair and short leg hair. I just didnt like the high shipping cost. Just charge more for actual product instead of making up for cheap prices w high shipping costs! Its not fair to not know that youre going to pay more for shipping than the product until after youve paid for your order! Thats why i gave 3 stars! Other than the secret shipping, it wouldve been a 5.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t really do very much, it&#x27;s like others said, basically sandpaper designed to buff out hairs. It&#x27;s not anywhere near instant and can cause skin irritation easily, but it is more useful for certain areas than a razor blade could ever be.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed and now know it was a waste of money.  My only regret I can not send back for a refund.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, and much cheaper online than it is in stores.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use the product!</li>
            <li> works well if hair is very short - must use daily</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and Great deal. Package arrived as described</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with this product. Great deal and arrived before scheduled.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product previously at the local Drug Store(who no longer carries the product) so it rates as I expected.</li>
            <li> Very high quality....Will use this vender again!</li>
            <li> After seeing this on TV I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot when I saw them being sold at RiteAid. Love it. Doesn&#x27;t work on coarse hair but I use it to get rid of fine hair after I use an epilator.</li>
            <li> I have very coarse, dark hair. I was using it on my forearms and, sometimes, on my lower legs. It does a fine job, but by the time you&#x27;re done, you&#x27;ve spent as much time as you would have shaving. It also doesn&#x27;t seem to stay smooth any longer than shaving. I got rid of mine. I didn&#x27;t see the benefit of it over shaving.</li>
            <li> Have been using the Smooth Away System for years, LOVE IT!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
