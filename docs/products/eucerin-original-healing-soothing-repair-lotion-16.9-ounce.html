            <li>Pricey but effective.</li>
            <li>best lotion around - odor-free and not messy - been using it forever!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t generally give 5 stars unless it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever tried before.</li>
            <li>Probably works for most people but it has met its match...</li>
            <li>like the Intensive cream by Eucerin better</li>
            <li>best results daily however a couple of days shows improvement in skin condition.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it works for others</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love the Eucerin lotion and creme products.</li>
            <li>and I really love the way my skin feels after this.</li>
            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>I have been using Eucerin Smoothing Repair for some time now and love it.  </li>
            <li>I like it even better than fancy stuff.</li>
            <li>Have tried many others and never found a better option.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many creams, in all price ranges (Chanel, Clarins), but always had adverse reactions.</li>
            <li>I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have suggested it to countless parents who have been very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seeing immediate results, ordered when all top brand moisturizers didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li>I love the way lotion feels on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Eucerin for years and love it.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product for babies too as it is a very gentle, high quality product at a steal of a price on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>especially good for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Best lotion for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent, non oily, unscented lotion that I use daily as an after shave to smooth my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Best lotion for dry skin!</li>
            <li>This product has been very successful in healing severe dry skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not oily, works in easily and leaves no residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>... I would pass on this version of Eucerin but strongly recommend their Smoothing Repair or Intensive Repair which I have found to be an acceptable alternative.</li>
            <li>I bought  this  for my  young  one, love the  good and easy  pump.</li>
            <li>Eucerin is a very good lotion for my dry skin in the Winter.</li>
            <li>Very good for winter dry skin.  </li>
            <li>The Original Formula is the best and costs nearly twice as much at brick &amp; mortar stores.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased other Eucerin lotions and I prefer the Original Healing Soothing Repair Lotion the best.</li>
            <li>and it will do it quickly!  </li>
            <li>The smell and hand feel are great, my hands and face totally appreciate this lotion</li>
            <li>Eucerin makes some great skin products, and this is no different.</li>
            <li>I even noticed less wrinkles on my neck after using this - great bonus :)</li>
            <li>, I have no idea how I managed to buy this original Eucerin by mistake.  </li>
            <li>One morning after a shower I used the original version on my legs without thinking, caught myself and used Smoothing Repair elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been hooked on original Eucerin lotion for 18 years, and have hooked others on it too.</li>
            <li>Eucerin is a great lotion for people with dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Also great for use on dry cracked hands in the winter.</li>
            <li>Great for dry skin, absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Love the Eucerin in the pump bottle, but the version in the jar is much thicker, greasier.</li>
            <li>for full body use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The rating on EWG Skin Deep are fairly good</li>
            <li>This is perfect for those times you need to moisturize but don&#x27;t feel like dealing with the thick creme.</li>
            <li>Eucerin got me through many years of full-time childcare duties and helped me maintain very youthful hands.</li>
            <li>Works great to help heal those patches way quicker than other moisturizers.</li>
            <li>It does have a bit of a greasy feel to it, but I like it--it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>This is simply one of the best lotions on the market today, and especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spoken to several people since returning and many experienced the same reaction.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is one of my top products that I wouldn&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li>and I consistently receive compliments on my complextion!  </li>
            <li>Great for sun dried skin here in Florida.</li>
            <li>Living in a very dry climate, moisturizers are important to me and I&#x27;ve tried most brands.  </li>
            <li>Very emulsive and quickly absorbs.  </li>
            <li>Helps the skin very much</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different lotions and creams and never used anything that works better than this, and never used anything that lasts as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Evidently a dingbat moment.  </li>
            <li>first learned its power when I worked as an infant/toddler caregiver.</li>
            <li>I broke out in a rash all over my body after the first application.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t make the connection at first but after applying again</li>
            <li>This original Eucerin is near the bottom of the list.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased with this lotion&#x27;s moisturizing properties and it leaves my dry skin smooth and soft</li>
            <li>liquid than most lotions I&#x27;ve used before so be careful the first time you pump some out or</li>
            <li>I always get too much lotion that I need to wipe off with a tissue.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not oily and keep your skin moisturized a whole day.</li>
            <li>My wife has been going to a dermatologist for a light skin rash and he had told her that she would have to come back forever and use the medicine he proscribed for her, or the rash would never go away.</li>
            <li>how much I dislike it compared to the Smoothing Repair</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Really keeps your skin hydrated without being greasy.</li>
            <li>Not only does it take off even the most water resistant eye makeup, it also leaves my lids soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>a good thick one, which does really moisturize.  </li>
            <li>I thought this would work about the same as the Eucerin Original Healing Cream, but it doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>Product was much more runny and drippy than other eucerine lotions I have used.</li>
            <li>And the next morning, skin on the original version leg felt dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t like how you can only dispense a FULL pump.</li>
            <li>Makes an immediate impact on dry skin and keeps skin smooth and supple</li>
            <li>It is much more soothing, and does a better job moisturizing than the expensive make-up</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>a few days later I experienced the same itchy rash.  </li>
            <li>Its initial greasy feel is quickly absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li>I personally haven&#x27;t used it, but I thought her review might be useful to someone.</li>
            <li>only complaint is with the pump bottle, a single pump puts out a considerable amount of lotion- more than what it takes to cover just my face, but even that just means I remember to do my elbows and hands more often with the excess!</li>
            <li>The bottle is travel friendly, and I have no problems getting it closed to pack into luggage.</li>
            <li>Live this.</li>
            <li>As expected the leg with the original version felt damp and sticky but the Smoothing Repair absorbed instantly, leaving a soft silky feel.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t break out my very sensitive face and also doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li>Eucerin Original is currently the only cream I use on both my face and body.</li>
            <li>My partner won&#x27;t use any other kind of lotion on his face unless we&#x27;re out of Eucerin (which I am careful about not allowing to happen).</li>
            <li>It works better than his cure and after several applications, the rash never returned, The old cash cow trick.</li>
            <li>Quacks will rip you off as quickly as any other con man.</li>
            <li>Eucerin is about the only lotion effective at keeping my fingers and hands from cracking due to dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Always soft.</li>
            <li>After years of using all natural creams, I decided to give this one a try.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s all I needed for this 50 plus year old woman to stick with Eucerin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;As a frequent litter-box scooper/cleaner with four cats, I use Eucerin every day now into my 40s.</li>
            <li>Be advised if you have sensitive skin, skip this lotion.  </li>
            <li>It feels a bit greasy but it works best for dry skin, especially during the cold New England winters.</li>
            <li>I love that its unscented &amp; a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>Provides lasting relief and benefit even for my highly calloused heels.  </li>
            <li>It is harder to put on, it is oily, but it works better for healing than the newer formulas with less oil.  </li>
            <li>(though it is very light so it wouldn&#x27;t stop me from purchasing this product if that was my only complaint).  </li>
            <li>The ONLY reasonably priced hand &amp; body lotion that actually improves the softness and appearance of skin.  </li>
            <li>The thickness is like no other lotion.</li>
            <li>This is one of the only products that works on my daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin and eczema.</li>
            <li>It not only moisturizes skin, but actually seems to clear my face up.  </li>
            <li>We always have a bottle near the toilet</li>
            <li>Mom loves this stuff, and the price was right, cheaper than CVS where she  usually buys it.</li>
            <li>The next morning, while the skin on my arms still felt soft and silky, my legs were very dry.  </li>
            <li>I tend to have dry skin, but this stuff seriously makes your skin silky smooth.</li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t make the connection at first but after applying again</li>
            <li> This original Eucerin is near the bottom of the list.  </li>
            <li> I was pleased with this lotion&#x27;s moisturizing properties and it leaves my dry skin smooth and soft</li>
            <li> liquid than most lotions I&#x27;ve used before so be careful the first time you pump some out or</li>
            <li> I always get too much lotion that I need to wipe off with a tissue.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not oily and keep your skin moisturized a whole day.</li>
            <li> My wife has been going to a dermatologist for a light skin rash and he had told her that she would have to come back forever and use the medicine he proscribed for her, or the rash would never go away.</li>
            <li> how much I dislike it compared to the Smoothing Repair</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Really keeps your skin hydrated without being greasy.</li>
            <li> Not only does it take off even the most water resistant eye makeup, it also leaves my lids soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> a good thick one, which does really moisturize.  </li>
            <li> I thought this would work about the same as the Eucerin Original Healing Cream, but it doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Product was much more runny and drippy than other eucerine lotions I have used.</li>
            <li> And the next morning, skin on the original version leg felt dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t like how you can only dispense a FULL pump.</li>
            <li> Makes an immediate impact on dry skin and keeps skin smooth and supple</li>
            <li> It is much more soothing, and does a better job moisturizing than the expensive make-up</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> a few days later I experienced the same itchy rash.  </li>
            <li> Its initial greasy feel is quickly absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> I personally haven&#x27;t used it, but I thought her review might be useful to someone.</li>
            <li> only complaint is with the pump bottle, a single pump puts out a considerable amount of lotion- more than what it takes to cover just my face, but even that just means I remember to do my elbows and hands more often with the excess!</li>
            <li> The bottle is travel friendly, and I have no problems getting it closed to pack into luggage.</li>
            <li> Live this.</li>
            <li> As expected the leg with the original version felt damp and sticky but the Smoothing Repair absorbed instantly, leaving a soft silky feel.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t break out my very sensitive face and also doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> Eucerin Original is currently the only cream I use on both my face and body.</li>
            <li> My partner won&#x27;t use any other kind of lotion on his face unless we&#x27;re out of Eucerin (which I am careful about not allowing to happen).</li>
            <li> It works better than his cure and after several applications, the rash never returned, The old cash cow trick.</li>
            <li> Quacks will rip you off as quickly as any other con man.</li>
            <li> Eucerin is about the only lotion effective at keeping my fingers and hands from cracking due to dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Always soft.</li>
            <li> After years of using all natural creams, I decided to give this one a try.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s all I needed for this 50 plus year old woman to stick with Eucerin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;As a frequent litter-box scooper/cleaner with four cats, I use Eucerin every day now into my 40s.</li>
            <li> Be advised if you have sensitive skin, skip this lotion.  </li>
            <li> It feels a bit greasy but it works best for dry skin, especially during the cold New England winters.</li>
            <li> I love that its unscented &amp; a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Provides lasting relief and benefit even for my highly calloused heels.  </li>
            <li> It is harder to put on, it is oily, but it works better for healing than the newer formulas with less oil.  </li>
            <li> (though it is very light so it wouldn&#x27;t stop me from purchasing this product if that was my only complaint).  </li>
            <li> The ONLY reasonably priced hand &amp; body lotion that actually improves the softness and appearance of skin.  </li>
            <li> The thickness is like no other lotion.</li>
            <li> This is one of the only products that works on my daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin and eczema.</li>
            <li> It not only moisturizes skin, but actually seems to clear my face up.  </li>
            <li> We always have a bottle near the toilet</li>
            <li> Mom loves this stuff, and the price was right, cheaper than CVS where she  usually buys it.</li>
            <li> The next morning, while the skin on my arms still felt soft and silky, my legs were very dry.  </li>
            <li> I tend to have dry skin, but this stuff seriously makes your skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li> For my skin (dry) they are a daily must.</li>
            <li> However I hate most lotions because they tend to make your hands really greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> I use this all winter long</li>
            <li> /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t long before all the adults were using it, too.</li>
            <li> I like scents but not near my eyes.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t make a difference for terribly dry hands.</li>
            <li> This does help my really dry skin, so I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
            <li> If you have dry, aging, or damaged skin</li>
            <li> My skin tends to being dry, and this lotion does help.</li>
            <li> Works as well as any dry skin cream 5 times</li>
            <li> As someone with dry skin, this product is a must!</li>
            <li> Had to send it back because half of the lotion was in the shipping bag, not in the bottle.</li>
            <li> Taking care of kids means a lot of hand washing, and potentially very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin due to eczema and this helps</li>
            <li> Not as moisturizing as other Eucerin products.  </li>
            <li> After realizing my mistake, I immediately went to a big box store and bought my usual Smoothing Repair.  </li>
            <li> This lotion just isn&#x27;t for me though I do like other lotions that Eucerin makes.</li>
            <li> I find eye make-up removers extremely drying.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s pediatrician recommended using this to get through the harsh, dry winter.</li>
            <li> His office was in a remote location and was hard to access.  </li>
            <li> This was recommended by a doctor to help fix my dried out cracked and bleeding hands from working in food industry.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion because of the harsh winter and it&#x27;s drying effects on my family&#x27;s skin.  </li>
            <li> , I stopped using it after just a few applications.  </li>
            <li> Within few days seeing the results.</li>
            <li> At mid age I suddenly came down with a bad case of Eczema &#x27;Go Figure&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I am a long time fan of Eucerin, I have used it for years to combat dry hands in the winter, and chapped hands after cold water SCUBA diving.</li>
            <li> Some babies drooled so much during teething that they had eczema around their mouths and painful chapping on their chins.</li>
            <li> Product soothes as well as stops itching from harsh water, after shower or bath!</li>
            <li> I tried using a small amount to see if that helped, but I just don&#x27;t like the way it feels on my skin and the smell is not good either</li>
            <li> This is thick, but dissolves well without been sticky, or greasy.</li>
            <li> The lotion is too thick for me and sometimes clogs my pores</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as thick as the cream, but leaves hands feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> Also a must have for those of you living in areas of prolonged cold or dry conditions.  </li>
            <li> All are pretty nasty allergens.  </li>
            <li> Does the job, addicted to this lotion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very difficult to settle for anything less.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have an annoying smell either.</li>
            <li> Wish I hadn&#x27;t because it is almost shocking</li>
            <li> The shipment was horrible though.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I gave this 4 stars because This is a Xmas gift. I cannot rate the product as it has not been used yet.</li>
            <li> Not as moisturizing as other Eucerin products.  I have to reapply often with this one.</li>
            <li> Very emulsive and quickly absorbs.  Great for sun dried skin here in Florida.</li>
            <li> Eucerin is a very good lotion for my dry skin in the Winter. I just don&#x27;t like how you can only dispense a FULL pump. I always get too much lotion that I need to wipe off with a tissue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Eucerin for 6-7 years. I have chronic hives so this is a daily must for me. It&#x27;s not oily and keep your skin moisturized a whole day.</li>
            <li> Ordered this expecting pump bottle as pictured, but received jar instead. Love the Eucerin in the pump bottle, but the version in the jar is much thicker, greasier. Yuck.</li>
            <li> This is one of the only products that works on my daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin and eczema. I wish it didn&#x27;t feel as greasy as it does though.</li>
            <li> I have always been a big fan of the Eucerin skin care line. As someone with dry skin, this product is a must! I apply it twice a day and keep portable sizes with me when I bike or travel.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by a doctor to help fix my dried out cracked and bleeding hands from working in food industry. The product seems to do the trick if applied regularly. However I hate most lotions because they tend to make your hands really greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> best lotion out there</li>
            <li> Live this. The smell and hand feel are great, my hands and face totally appreciate this lotion</li>
            <li> Probably works for most people but it has met its match... didn&#x27;t make a difference for terribly dry hands.</li>
            <li> Eucerin makes some great skin products, and this is no different. This is thick, but dissolves well without been sticky, or greasy.</li>
            <li> works great for my lymphedema arm massage</li>
            <li> like the Intensive cream by Eucerin better</li>
            <li> One of the best lotions EVER. Never greasy. Always soft. It disappears instantly. I try others from time to time, but always come back to Eucerin. The hardest thing about it is how to spell it when I&#x27;m searching on Amazon!</li>
            <li> great price,  great amount&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thnx</li>
            <li> Great for winter skin. :)</li>
            <li> especially good for dry skin. best results daily however a couple of days shows improvement in skin condition.  it is now the only lotion I use</li>
            <li> This Item came on time. I used this lotion on my son because he has eczema. I apply it two to three times a day and it seems to control his eczema break outs. The lotion is too thick for me and sometimes clogs my pores so I use a lighter version of Eucerin.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s pediatrician recommended using this to get through the harsh, dry winter. However, it makes my hands BURN when putting it on. My infant screamed when I tried it on him so I suspect the same. I&#x27;m sure it works for others but it didn&#x27;t work for us.</li>
            <li> Provides lasting relief and benefit even for my highly calloused heels.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different lotions and creams and never used anything that works better than this, and never used anything that lasts as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good for full body use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not oily, works in easily and leaves no residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More liquid than most lotions I&#x27;ve used before so be careful the first time you pump some out or it will run out of your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  I don&#x27;t generally give 5 stars unless it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever tried before.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. No scent</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Eucerin for a goods my years, and I will continue to do so. I like that this lotion isn&#x27;t greasy feeling, and take seconds to sink in to my skin. I can use it an elbows, knees, and red, chapped knuckles, and never have any problem. The bottle is travel friendly, and I have no problems getting it closed to pack into luggage. I will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Eucerin is the best lotion I&#x27;ve used.  Makes an immediate impact on dry skin and keeps skin smooth and supple 24/7.  And the &amp;#34;bit&amp;#34; of a shine makes my skin look GREAT!!!</li>
            <li> I love the Eucerin lotion and creme products. For my skin (dry) they are a daily must. And they work the best of any brand I have used before.</li>
            <li> GREAT STUFF...At mid age I suddenly came down with a bad case of Eczema &#x27;Go Figure&#x27;. Anyway, this stuff is great, kind of pricey but great!</li>
            <li> After years of using all natural creams, I decided to give this one a try. The rating on EWG Skin Deep are fairly good and I really love the way my skin feels after this. It&#x27;s been researched and tested and does what it says. I even noticed less wrinkles on my neck after using this - great bonus :)</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever!!!!  This is a healing wonder!  Fantastic to use after you shave your legs!!!!  .....feels like satin!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent, non oily, unscented lotion that I use daily as an after shave to smooth my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product.</li>
            <li> Eucerin is about the only lotion effective at keeping my fingers and hands from cracking due to dry skin.  Its initial greasy feel is quickly absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> As described. Excellent value as an add-on item.</li>
            <li> I thought this would work about the same as the Eucerin Original Healing Cream, but it doesn&#x27;t.  This is definitely a lotion- a good thick one, which does really moisturize.  It just doesn&#x27;t do what the Healing Cream does, which is heal damaged (or even injured) skin. This does help my really dry skin, so I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
            <li> My wife has been going to a dermatologist for a light skin rash and he had told her that she would have to come back forever and use the medicine he proscribed for her, or the rash would never go away. I ordered this creme on a hunch and guess what? It works better than his cure and after several applications, the rash never returned, The old cash cow trick. His office was in a remote location and was hard to access.  Quacks will rip you off as quickly as any other con man.</li>
            <li> Best lotion for my dry skin. Pricey but effective. Lotion arrived condition described by seller. I&#x27;m very pleased with this transaction.</li>
            <li> Product was much more runny and drippy than other eucerine lotions I have used.</li>
            <li> Living in a very dry climate, moisturizers are important to me and I&#x27;ve tried most brands.  This original Eucerin is near the bottom of the list.  I have been using Eucerin Smoothing Repair for some time now and love it.  Given Amazon&#x27;s \\&quot;buy it again\\&quot; feature, I have no idea how I managed to buy this original Eucerin by mistake.  Evidently a dingbat moment.  Wish I hadn&#x27;t because it is almost shocking how much I dislike it compared to the Smoothing Repair version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, it is a white, almost pasty lotion that seems to just sit on the skin and never fully absorb.  My skin felt damp and sticky for several minutes after application- like using hair conditioner on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worst of all it just doesn&#x27;t work that well.  After realizing my mistake, I immediately went to a big box store and bought my usual Smoothing Repair.  One morning after a shower I used the original version on my legs without thinking, caught myself and used Smoothing Repair elsewhere.  The next morning, while the skin on my arms still felt soft and silky, my legs were very dry.  So I deliberately ran a test using a different version on each leg.  As expected the leg with the original version felt damp and sticky but the Smoothing Repair absorbed instantly, leaving a soft silky feel.  And the next morning, skin on the original version leg felt dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So... I would pass on this version of Eucerin but strongly recommend their Smoothing Repair or Intensive Repair which I have found to be an acceptable alternative.</li>
            <li> The ONLY reasonably priced hand &amp; body lotion that actually improves the softness and appearance of skin.  The Original Formula is the best and costs nearly twice as much at brick &amp; mortar stores.  If you have dry, aging, or damaged skin this is all you need to turn that around and it will do it quickly!  Also a must have for those of you living in areas of prolonged cold or dry conditions.  Wonderful product for babies too as it is a very gentle, high quality product at a steal of a price on Amazon.  I subscribe &amp; save this one....</li>
            <li> I have been using Eucerin exclusively as a hand lotion for years.  I find that it is the only product that prevents chapping in the winter.  It does have a bit of a greasy feel to it, but I like it--it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I am a long time fan of Eucerin, I have used it for years to combat dry hands in the winter, and chapped hands after cold water SCUBA diving. I recently started using it as a replacement for my face cream. It is much more soothing, and does a better job moisturizing than the expensive make-up brands.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is with the pump bottle, a single pump puts out a considerable amount of lotion- more than what it takes to cover just my face, but even that just means I remember to do my elbows and hands more often with the excess!</li>
            <li> This is the lotion I have used for the last two years. I tend to have dry skin, but this stuff seriously makes your skin silky smooth. It is creamy but not oily. It doesn&#x27;t have an annoying smell either. Perfect for any time use!</li>
            <li> I had received the package with the cream out of the box</li>
            <li> I like it even better than fancy stuff. Great for dry skin, absorbs quickly. Fixes those itchies and alligator skin spots!</li>
            <li> This is perfect for those times you need to moisturize but don&#x27;t feel like dealing with the thick creme.</li>
            <li> Great price for a good product.</li>
            <li> this lotion is the only lotion that doesn&#x27;t make my hands sweat. I really like this product.</li>
            <li> My wife swears by this product.</li>
            <li> Product soothes as well as stops itching from harsh water, after shower or bath!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as thick as the cream, but leaves hands feeling greasy. It doesn&#x27;t seem to protect and heal my hands as well as the cream. I&#x27;m using it up, but will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I suffer from eczema and had this recommended to me by a dermatologist about 10 years ago.  I have always had a bottle of it on hand since then.  Have tried many others and never found a better option.</li>
            <li> This I like, give moisture to  the skin with out been greasy . I bought  this  for my  young  one, love the  good and easy  pump.</li>
            <li> Eucerin Original is currently the only cream I use on both my face and body. It&#x27;s been several years now and I consistently receive compliments on my complextion!  I&#x27;ve tried many creams, in all price ranges (Chanel, Clarins), but always had adverse reactions. That&#x27;s all I needed for this 50 plus year old woman to stick with Eucerin.</li>
            <li> I used this as suggested by nurses for my husband&#x27;s diabetic feet.  I don&#x27;t have diabetes, but I find the lotion is good for my skin as well.  My skin tends to being dry, and this lotion does help.</li>
            <li> I like this item for my legs  Helps the skin very much</li>
            <li> Good Product and delivered on time.</li>
            <li> This is simply one of the best lotions on the market today, and especially for the price.  It not only moisturizes skin, but actually seems to clear my face up.  I am not a lotion person, but apply this product every day because it works so well.</li>
            <li> Giant size! It will last you awhile</li>
            <li> Great lotion would but again</li>
            <li> Best lotion there is!</li>
            <li> Eucerin is a great lotion for people with dry skin.  I love that its unscented &amp; a little goes a long way.  The shipment was horrible though.  Had to send it back because half of the lotion was in the shipping bag, not in the bottle.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion because of the harsh winter and it&#x27;s drying effects on my family&#x27;s skin.  This lotion is incredibly greasy and I need to use a cloth or tissue to wipe the excess grease off my hands after applying it.  I tried using a small amount to see if that helped, but I just don&#x27;t like the way it feels on my skin and the smell is not good either (though it is very light so it wouldn&#x27;t stop me from purchasing this product if that was my only complaint).  I can&#x27;t comment on it&#x27;s effectiveness because I was so turned off by the greasiness, I stopped using it after just a few applications.  This lotion just isn&#x27;t for me though I do like other lotions that Eucerin makes.</li>
            <li> It is harder to put on, it is oily, but it works better for healing than the newer formulas with less oil.  I only use it before going to sleep so it will help heal my hands during the night. I could not use it in the day, because I work with photographic art materials and I can not get any oil on them. I can not put any lotion on my hands during the day, in fact, I have to wash my hands with isopropyl alcohol. So by the end of the day, I need this on my hands overnight.  It works.</li>
            <li> I use this all winter long and it works well. I would recommend that you try it using a Hydas Body Creamer (roller application).</li>
            <li> I use this when I don&#x27;t wish to use the cream.</li>
            <li> Best lotion for dry skin!</li>
            <li> cannot find this in stores at a good price and works great</li>
            <li> Tbh, I use this to remove eye make-up. I find eye make-up removers extremely drying. I use one pump of Eucerin to rub my water-proof eye makeup off. Not only does it take off even the most water resistant eye makeup, it also leaves my lids soft and moisturized. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will also use it when I get patches of eczema during winter. Works great to help heal those patches way quicker than other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been hooked on original Eucerin lotion for 18 years, and have hooked others on it too. That&#x27;s how great it is for chapped skin and hands that are washed frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first learned its power when I worked as an infant/toddler caregiver. Some babies drooled so much during teething that they had eczema around their mouths and painful chapping on their chins. Their pediatricians recommended Eucerin. So, parents would bring it and we&#x27;d apply it to their children&#x27;s faces at every diaper change, both as cure and prevention. It worked beautifully, without prescription and no complaints from the babies! I have suggested it to countless parents who have been very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t long before all the adults were using it, too. Taking care of kids means a lot of hand washing, and potentially very dry skin. Eucerin got me through many years of full-time childcare duties and helped me maintain very youthful hands. All it would take to turn anyone onto Eucerin is letting them try some. The thickness is like no other lotion. It&#x27;s very difficult to settle for anything less. We always have a bottle near the toilet so I can massage it into my hands whenever I sit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a frequent litter-box scooper/cleaner with four cats, I use Eucerin every day now into my 40s. My partner won&#x27;t use any other kind of lotion on his face unless we&#x27;re out of Eucerin (which I am careful about not allowing to happen). It also doubles as a makeup/sunscreen remover for me. It doesn&#x27;t break out my very sensitive face and also doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes. We love that it has no scent! I like scents but not near my eyes. It also works for hair frizz!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of my top products that I wouldn&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li> What I asked for... ._.</li>
            <li> I have always loved Eucerin products.  I was pleased with this lotion&#x27;s moisturizing properties and it leaves my dry skin smooth and soft</li>
            <li> This product has been very successful in healing severe dry skin. The doctors in the clinic and hospital recommend Eucerin.</li>
            <li> I have purchased other Eucerin lotions and I prefer the Original Healing Soothing Repair Lotion the best. It sometimes comes with an extra 25% which lasts longer. It feels a bit greasy but it works best for dry skin, especially during the cold New England winters.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for use after tattoos!  Really keeps your skin hydrated without being greasy. Also great for use on dry cracked hands in the winter. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin due to eczema and this helps</li>
            <li> Seeing immediate results, ordered when all top brand moisturizers didn&#x27;t help. Within few days seeing the results.</li>
            <li> I love the way lotion feels on my skin.  Very good for winter dry skin.  Use on a regular basis.  Good for hands too.</li>
            <li> Works as well as any dry skin cream 5 times it&#x27;s costs.</li>
            <li> best lotion around - odor-free and not messy - been using it forever!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Eucerin for years and love it. Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> Mom loves this stuff, and the price was right, cheaper than CVS where she  usually buys it. She claims it may not be the best, but its great value for the price and suits her needs. I personally haven&#x27;t used it, but I thought her review might be useful to someone.</li>
            <li> I broke out in a rash all over my body after the first application.  I didn&#x27;t make the connection at first but after applying again a few days later I experienced the same itchy rash.  A second look at the ingredients revealed several potential culprits; mineral oil, lanolin, MCI.  All are pretty nasty allergens.  the lotion was also a bit greasy for my liking.  Be advised if you have sensitive skin, skip this lotion.  I&#x27;ve spoken to several people since returning and many experienced the same reaction.</li>
            <li> Does the job, addicted to this lotion.</li>
    </ol>
