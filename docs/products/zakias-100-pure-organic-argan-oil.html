    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Wonderful oil.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve found it is absolutely wonderful for my skin as well.</li>
            <li>Great product, great price!</li>
            <li>Surprisingly,  I like Zakia&#x27;s deodorized Argan oil....a lot!  </li>
            <li>Very satisfied with this product!  </li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m exceptionally happy.  </li>
            <li>He is using it on his skin and he said it is great.</li>
            <li>Great buy compared to others.</li>
            <li>and I see a good result.</li>
            <li>great deal, most for the money.</li>
            <li>Just a drop of Argan oil and a drop of Tea tree oil makes a great under arm deodorant and antiperspirant not a 100% effective but better than the waxy build up and chemicals of the store bought products.</li>
            <li>Hope quality keeps top!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>Zakia&#x27;s 100% Pure Organic Argan Oil is a top-notch product.  </li>
            <li>Nice oil.</li>
            <li>Zakia&#x27;s deodorized Argan oil is the answer for effective skincare.</li>
            <li>My wife started using it now I have to order her own personnal bottle.</li>
            <li>The smell is strong but in a good way if you don&#x27;t mind the exotic Moroccan nutty scent.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>It is lighter in all ways but has not forsaken the healthy skin benefits.  </li>
            <li>You have to wait for it to fully return to the top before you can pump again.</li>
            <li>Skin feels really smooth and there&#x27;s no smell!  </li>
            <li>Will be getting more soon.</li>
            <li>It does not feel refreshing or cleansing.</li>
            <li>I will never use skin creams or lotion again as long as I have this AWESOME OIL...</li>
            <li>And, best of all, for me, no more explanations and justification of smelling like an exotic roasted nut!</li>
            <li>Fabulous customer service from Zakia&#x27;s Morocco.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it!!!  </li>
            <li>First time, I thought I had to add more because it was so light.</li>
            <li>I am familiar with.</li>
            <li>odor free and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Nothing that special.</li>
            <li>And I would recommend it to anyone who wants healthy skin and hair.</li>
            <li>Not a problem if you don&#x27;t mind some of the helpful qualities destroyed, but is if you need full strength.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product I use it daily after showering and it leaves my face moist and refreshed all day.  </li>
            <li>This argan oil is the real deal, absorbs very quickly and does not leave a greasy feeling whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>I bought this lovely product as a gift for my mother who has VERY SENSITIVE skin.  </li>
            <li>I have been using daily for about a month and have noticed my skin tone is much more even and texture is balanced!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right</li>
            <li>But this oil soaks right up</li>
            <li>Right?</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and I get migranes from strong fragrances.</li>
            <li>Maintain the overall value Zakia and you get to keep a customer that is loyal to her products :)</li>
            <li>Odor free and makes my skin very soft without feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>That feature was great for my thick hair, but not on my skin.</li>
            <li>Most definitely will purchase from Zakia&#x27;s again.</li>
            <li>This Argon oil from Zakia&#x27;s has helped the first day I used it on my feet, stopped the itching and cracking and keeps my feet moist with out a greasy or over oily feeling.</li>
            <li>so I can have soft skin in the hot Texas summer without sweating lotion off!  </li>
            <li>Seller ships fast.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband and he really loves it.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin that clogs and breaks out easily with most commonly found fragranced moisturizers.</li>
            <li>I particularly use it for my face.</li>
            <li>on the other hand, skin soaks up the argan oil very quickly, leaving skin dry, glowing and smooth, without getting yourself or your clothes greasy.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product for use on my face as its all natural pure argan oil with no additives.  </li>
            <li>Her skin has a new glow and elasticity.  </li>
            <li>It did not have the same positive experience.</li>
            <li>Been using the  Zakia&#x27;s 100% Pure, Organic Argan Oil for two months and it is so addictive from the way it makes you feel.</li>
            <li>My first introduction to Argan oil was the pure, viscous, dark, nutty oil.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin amazingly soft.</li>
            <li>(Sunlight is the natural way to deodorize oils.)  </li>
            <li>The results from the use of this product far exceed my expectations.</li>
            <li>And the oil is gentle enough for my skin.</li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;ve lived long enough to observe that everything has a positive role to contribute on this world.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad for the plastic bottle, as I use it in the shower and don&#x27;t want broken glass.</li>
            <li>Same with my feet I never had dry feet before till I realized I am older now</li>
            <li>It does exactly what I expect Argan oil to do for less money, no nutty scent, less waste, and fantastic skin results.  </li>
            <li>I do have another one but that one stinks, so I enjoy this oil very much.</li>
            <li>No second guessing if its too much or too little.  </li>
            <li>After all, if you&#x27;re serious about skin products, you are mostly taught through social media/community interactions that refined oil is a poor substitute for pure oil.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I use this to rub on after exfoliating with Zakia&#x27;s Moroccan Black Soap and my skin feels so soft without feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Zakia&#x27;s glove and black soap, and this argan oil is no different.</li>
            <li> The oil is good but the sprayer is really impossible to use!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s keeping my dry skin at bay.</li>
            <li> and my skin seems to dry faster.</li>
            <li> The subtle, earthy smell (I wouldn&#x27;t call it a fragrance because it is simply the natural scent of argan oil) does not bring on a migrane.</li>
            <li> My face gets particularly dry in the winter months and causes my skin to stretch and get rough.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I add a drop or two of essential oils in with it before I rub it on just to add a little scent as this oil has no odor to it all.  </li>
            <li> Due to</li>
            <li> I have to use organic products due to a severe immune deficiency and this product is a miracle in a bottle!</li>
            <li> took off one start because the pump is odd.</li>
            <li> I just use half refined and half unrefined.</li>
            <li> The product does not smell like pure argan oil, which was disappointing.</li>
            <li> But I disliked the feel of it under my clothes, which unavoidably soaked up some of the gel&#x27;s moisture.</li>
            <li> Experience, research, observation, and a little common sense does the job in choosing the correct application for you.  </li>
            <li> I slipped some rubber bands over the bottle no more problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s viscosity, absorption was slow.  </li>
            <li> I am bad about brushing up against sharp objects and cutting or scrapping my skin</li>
            <li> It has a terrible greasy feel unlike other brands I have used.</li>
            <li> Wrong!</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s very difficult for me to find moisturizers that work for me.</li>
            <li> too bad a problem in my book considering the alternative.</li>
            <li> I was just slightly disappointed that it came in a plastic bottle.  </li>
            <li> I used it all summer as I HATE to sweat when I&#x27;ve put lotion on my legs and arms, yuck!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Nothing that special. Nice oil. Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Wonderful oil. odor free and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> The oil is good but the sprayer is really impossible to use! I almost stopped using arrange oil because of that!&lt;br /&gt;Most of the time the sprayer will not work because it should have a wider spray and the oil gets stuck.&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product!  Hope quality keeps top!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that clogs and breaks out easily with most commonly found fragranced moisturizers. I ordered this product for use on my face as its all natural pure argan oil with no additives.  I am very pleased with this product I use it daily after showering and it leaves my face moist and refreshed all day.  My face gets particularly dry in the winter months and causes my skin to stretch and get rough. This oil helps!  I have been using daily for about a month and have noticed my skin tone is much more even and texture is balanced!</li>
            <li> I have to use organic products due to a severe immune deficiency and this product is a miracle in a bottle! I use it on my hair and my skin as well as my Husband. That&#x27;s right, he&#x27;s a roofing contractor and his hands, feet and butt take a beating on the roof. After using this argan oil for only a couple of weeks he actually feels like he too has human skin as opposed to reptile...would but it again? YES. And I would recommend it to anyone who wants healthy skin and hair.</li>
            <li> I like the oil.  It absorbs well.  I was just slightly disappointed that it came in a plastic bottle.  I don&#x27;t know why I thought it was a glass bottle.</li>
            <li> I use this to make a sugar scrub to use in the shower. It leaves my skin amazingly soft.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Odor free and makes my skin very soft without feeling greasy.  Sometimes I add a drop or two of essential oils in with it before I rub it on just to add a little scent as this oil has no odor to it all.  I use this to rub on after exfoliating with Zakia&#x27;s Moroccan Black Soap and my skin feels so soft without feeling greasy.  I used it all summer as I HATE to sweat when I&#x27;ve put lotion on my legs and arms, yuck!  But this oil soaks right up so I can have soft skin in the hot Texas summer without sweating lotion off!  Fabulous customer service from Zakia&#x27;s Morocco.</li>
            <li> The product does not smell like pure argan oil, which was disappointing. I have used a different brand but could not find it again, so decided to give this one a try. It did not have the same positive experience.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Seller ships fast.</li>
            <li> I bought this lovely product as a gift for my mother who has VERY SENSITIVE skin.  She absolutely loves it!!!  Her skin has a new glow and elasticity.  Zakia&#x27;s 100% Pure Organic Argan Oil is a top-notch product.  I&#x27;m exceptionally happy.  No doubt that explains the $20 price increase from the time I purchased this product to today.  Right?</li>
            <li> I got this oil as a present and I love it! I do have another one but that one stinks, so I enjoy this oil very much. I add it in shampoo and I apply it on my face and I see a good result. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I was a bit reluctant about purchasing this deodorized Argan oil.  After all, if you&#x27;re serious about skin products, you are mostly taught through social media/community interactions that refined oil is a poor substitute for pure oil.  Well, I&#x27;ve lived long enough to observe that everything has a positive role to contribute on this world.  Experience, research, observation, and a little common sense does the job in choosing the correct application for you.  My first introduction to Argan oil was the pure, viscous, dark, nutty oil.  The smell is strong but in a good way if you don&#x27;t mind the exotic Moroccan nutty scent. The scent dissipates over time, especially in the sunlight. (Sunlight is the natural way to deodorize oils.)  Due to it&#x27;s viscosity, absorption was slow.  That feature was great for my thick hair, but not on my skin. Zakia&#x27;s deodorized Argan oil is the answer for effective skincare. It is lighter in all ways but has not forsaken the healthy skin benefits.  And, best of all, for me, no more explanations and justification of smelling like an exotic roasted nut! The lighter weight equates to faster absorption, too.  No need to wipe away unabsorbed oil. No second guessing if its too much or too little.  It works the same in my hair, as well, but of course, without the scent. First time, I thought I had to add more because it was so light. Wrong! Surprisingly,  I like Zakia&#x27;s deodorized Argan oil....a lot!  It does exactly what I expect Argan oil to do for less money, no nutty scent, less waste, and fantastic skin results.  Maintain the overall value Zakia and you get to keep a customer that is loyal to her products :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s keeping my dry skin at bay. I&#x27;m glad for the plastic bottle, as I use it in the shower and don&#x27;t want broken glass. btw, it&#x27;s unavaidable that the bottle will be slippery - oil plus water plus a smooth-sided bottle. I slipped some rubber bands over the bottle no more problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off one start because the pump is odd. You have to wait for it to fully return to the top before you can pump again. It slows the whol process.</li>
            <li> great deal, most for the money.</li>
            <li> Odorless and refined. Not a problem if you don&#x27;t mind some of the helpful qualities destroyed, but is if you need full strength. Thing about unrefined Argan oil is that is smells like rotten fruit. So, deodorized ain&#x27;t too bad a problem in my book considering the alternative. I just use half refined and half unrefined.</li>
            <li> This argan oil is the real deal, absorbs very quickly and does not leave a greasy feeling whatsoever.  Skin feels really smooth and there&#x27;s no smell!  Will be getting more soon.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he really loves it. He is using it on his skin and he said it is great.</li>
            <li> This is like the eighth pressing of argan oil, if it even is argan oil. It does not have the smell or viscosity I am familiar with. I do not recommend using it on your face. It has a terrible greasy feel unlike other brands I have used. It does not feel refreshing or cleansing.</li>
            <li> Great buy compared to others.</li>
            <li> I purchased Zakia&#x27;s 100% Organic Argan oil specifically for my hair but I&#x27;ve found it is absolutely wonderful for my skin as well. The results from the use of this product far exceed my expectations. Great product, great price! Most definitely will purchase from Zakia&#x27;s again.</li>
            <li> Been using the  Zakia&#x27;s 100% Pure, Organic Argan Oil for two months and it is so addictive from the way it makes you feel. I use it from hair to toes.  I am bad about brushing up against sharp objects and cutting or scrapping my skin then I am bleeding all over the place since I started using the Argan oil from Zakia&#x27;s it has brought back the elasticity to my skin, out of all those fancy skin creams and lotion this works and keeps on working days after using. Same with my feet I never had dry feet before till I realized I am older now and my skin seems to dry faster. This Argon oil from Zakia&#x27;s has helped the first day I used it on my feet, stopped the itching and cracking and keeps my feet moist with out a greasy or over oily feeling. I bought the 8oz Argon Oil and use it on 100% of my body five days a week it soon last me three months. My wife started using it now I have to order her own personnal bottle. Just a drop of Argan oil and a drop of Tea tree oil makes a great under arm deodorant and antiperspirant not a 100% effective but better than the waxy build up and chemicals of the store bought products. I will never use skin creams or lotion again as long as I have this AWESOME OIL...</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Zakia&#x27;s glove and black soap, and this argan oil is no different. I have very sensitive skin, and I get migranes from strong fragrances. So it&#x27;s very difficult for me to find moisturizers that work for me. The subtle, earthy smell (I wouldn&#x27;t call it a fragrance because it is simply the natural scent of argan oil) does not bring on a migrane. And the oil is gentle enough for my skin. Before this argan oil, and sometimes if I know i am not leaving the house in a couple of hours, i would apply baby oil after stepping out of the shower. But I disliked the feel of it under my clothes, which unavoidably soaked up some of the gel&#x27;s moisture. on the other hand, skin soaks up the argan oil very quickly, leaving skin dry, glowing and smooth, without getting yourself or your clothes greasy. I still sometimes use my baby oil gel, it&#x27;s unavoidable because of the extremely harsh winter in NY, but I have added the argan oil to my beauty routine as it makes my skin really glow. I particularly use it for my face.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this oil. I swear by it for moisturizing face, hair, elbows and feet.</li>
