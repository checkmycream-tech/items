            <li>The product arrived really fast.</li>
            <li>They are precise enough to pick up and place the tiniest jewels and fimo slices.</li>
            <li>and I do mean it works good</li>
            <li>But after reading other reviews, I ordered this and am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I spent a little bit more and got these.</li>

            <li>I especially use them to put the little white sticker on so that you get a perfect french.  </li>
            <li>it is hard for me, being a person with smaller hands, as well as fibromyalgia, so my hands cramp easily when gripping implements.  </li>

            <li>what a waste... if any of you knows how to do it better please share</li>
            <li>They are comfortable to hold and really sharp.</li>
            <li>We ordered the MASH Nail Art Tweezers and were very surprised at the quality of this product.</li>
            <li>At first, I thought I could use regular tweezers.  </li>
            <li>I gave these nail canes and tweezers to my 10 yr old for Christmas and she LOVES them!  </li>
            <li>Just what I need for all those small creative card making moments</li>
            <li>I would recommend it for anyone doing nails, just be careful of the super pointy tip, but it comes with something to protect it</li>
            <li>This is a great little tool for those tiny little nail art pieces.  </li>
            <li>Product was purchased for my 11 year old granddaughter for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>so far im am not having that problem when using these tweezers.</li>
            <li>:) But Amazon requires me to write at least 20 words.  </li>
            <li>And they really do work well to wrangle those tiny rhinestones.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not so expensive and does a good job for nail art.</li>
            <li>The tiny pointed ends held tight which made for easy manipulation.  </li>
            <li>Not much to say on this, it is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Not much to say on this, it is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>These products were not only low priced but high quality.  </li>
            <li>I picked these up to add flocking to models, and general hobby work.</li>
            <li>Upon inspection:  has a vinyl protective slip over the tip to prevent unwanted ouchies,  sharp pointed tips match up very well...</li>
            <li>when using it if the tip touches your nails even slightly it leaves a poke whole  </li>
            <li>only used these a few times so far, but easy to use with small pieces.</li>
            <li>a little easier, that was too much.  </li>

            <li> Worth the prcie!</li>

            <li> The curvature of this tool makes the selection and application of each charm a much simpler task:)</li>
            <li> metal seems to be good quality, but the thing seems sharper than necessary, also the thing isn&#x27;t symmetrical so it might not work as well as you want it to if you&#x27;re unlucky with that.</li>

            <li> Thank you very much.</li>

            <li> The order looked exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> They are very pointy, but extremely useful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying more of them for similar projects!</li>
            <li> easy!you get exactly what they described..</li>
            <li> They are so cute and tiny.  </li>
            <li> I create in polymer clay and am able to work with tiny beads and crystals in my work.  </li>

            <li> It came really fast!  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Tweezers were just as described, and they work great for the very small stuff (fimo, confetti, rhinetones, etc.).</li>
            <li> Positive transaction.</li>
            <li> so I had to use it a certain way/angle in order to pick up rhinestones.</li>
            <li> These items arrived much sooner than expected, and were so easy to use!  </li>
            <li> They are nice and precise for picking up small nail things!!</li>

            <li> It makes jewel placement so much easier and faster.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> They pick up the items I need for my nails so efficiently, I really don&#x27;t know what I did before them.</li>
            <li> The product arrived really fast.</li>
            <li> They are precise enough to pick up and place the tiniest jewels and fimo slices.</li>
            <li> and I do mean it works good</li>
            <li> But after reading other reviews, I ordered this and am glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I spent a little bit more and got these.</li>
            <li> I use them for my new rhinestones, clay cane slices and also for my perler beads!</li>
            <li> They are very sturdy yet delicate enough to work with very fine and detailed jobs.</li>
            <li> I especially use them to put the little white sticker on so that you get a perfect french.  </li>
            <li> it is hard for me, being a person with smaller hands, as well as fibromyalgia, so my hands cramp easily when gripping implements.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Also, the product is high in quality.</li>
            <li> I love doing nail art and was looking for tweezers that could pick up all the little nail jewels and stay out of the way while I am setting them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was really pleasantly surprised by the quality of these -- VERY high quality for the price.  </li>
            <li> Thank you for the fast shipment and professional image.</li>
            <li> So far I really like it.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re useful for picking up tiny nail art stones and things.</li>
            <li> what a waste... if any of you knows how to do it better please share</li>
            <li> They are comfortable to hold and really sharp.</li>
            <li> We ordered the MASH Nail Art Tweezers and were very surprised at the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought I could use regular tweezers.  </li>
            <li> I gave these nail canes and tweezers to my 10 yr old for Christmas and she LOVES them!  </li>
            <li> Just what I need for all those small creative card making moments</li>
            <li> I would recommend it for anyone doing nails, just be careful of the super pointy tip, but it comes with something to protect it</li>
            <li> This is a great little tool for those tiny little nail art pieces.  </li>
            <li> Product was purchased for my 11 year old granddaughter for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> so far im am not having that problem when using these tweezers.</li>
            <li> :) But Amazon requires me to write at least 20 words.  </li>
            <li> And they really do work well to wrangle those tiny rhinestones.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not so expensive and does a good job for nail art.</li>
            <li> The tiny pointed ends held tight which made for easy manipulation.  </li>
            <li> Not much to say on this, it is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Not much to say on this, it is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> These products were not only low priced but high quality.  </li>
            <li> I picked these up to add flocking to models, and general hobby work.</li>
            <li> Upon inspection:  has a vinyl protective slip over the tip to prevent unwanted ouchies,  sharp pointed tips match up very well...</li>
            <li> when using it if the tip touches your nails even slightly it leaves a poke whole  </li>
            <li> only used these a few times so far, but easy to use with small pieces.</li>
            <li> a little easier, that was too much.  </li>
            <li> So other than the caution to be really careful of the sharp point, I really like them.</li>
            <li> Not only for placement of rhinestones and studs, but also for carefully picking up the occasional fuzz that will land on a wet nail and totally ruin your day.</li>
            <li> It was so sharp that it left a tiny puncture wound that started bleeding.  </li>
            <li> It took a little longer than usual to receive, but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> long if you don&#x27;t lose it.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> I have actually used them for other purposes.</li>
            <li> Tweezer points are sharp enough even to do some eye brows plugging.</li>
            <li> i have long acrylic nails and these allow me to pick up the smallest things with ease!</li>
            <li> this small would be hard, if not impossible, to use.  </li>
            <li> But, have found several other uses, such as for very tight knots.  </li>
            <li> I have a bit of difficulty picking up and holding onto the little rhinestones I ordered with these, but I think I just need to get used to working with such minutiae.</li>
            <li> The one thing you need to be careful of is the tips.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Just be careful if you do buy then...</li>
            <li> I purchased other nail art for her</li>
            <li> They definitely help me pick up the small stuff I use for work.</li>
            <li> They are really sharp.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what to say other than that.  </li>
            <li> Ordered these tweezers along with a bunch of other nail art supplies.</li>
            <li> I ordered these tweezers along with a bunch of other nail art supplies and tools.</li>
            <li> They are a bit sharp, but they are supposed to be small enough points to get a hold of the stone and place on the nail.</li>
            <li> This is a must-have product if you are going to be using the teeny tiny little beads or little doo-dads that are designed to be glued onto the nail bed.</li>
            <li> after couple tries I am going back to dotting tool for pickup and placement at least does not ruin manicure...</li>
            <li> You should use it -- those tips are SHARP, but that helps when I place a rhinestone: I can use the sharp tips to \\&quot;tap\\&quot; it down into the glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As the rhinestones are tiny it is hard to apply and when you are trying to position if it touches nails at all ruins the manicure...</li>
            <li> I tried to cancel this item but it was too late, it had already shipped, I figured I could just use regular tweezers.</li>
            <li> that ruins the manicure.</li>
            <li> THEY ARE REALLY SHARP!</li>
            <li> Told you it wasn&#x27;t the typical use.</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t make a mess.</li>
            <li> The tweezer was usable but had a little imperfection on it.</li>
            <li> I got them to pick up those really little rhinestones that are being used on fingernails.  </li>
            <li> If the were a little shorter I think this would help?</li>
            <li> It could pick up the smallest little beads for my nails.</li>
            <li> It seems that he will get at least 1 gnat doing a backstroke through the paint the minute he is finished and the paint is still wet.  </li>
            <li> I even use them to apply  my false eyelashes (with the pointy end turned away from my eyes obviously).</li>
            <li> Not to mention they were delivered in less than a week!</li>
            <li> These work for picking up the small rhinestones and placing them where I want them.</li>
            <li> U can use this tweezer to catch the small stuff</li>
            <li> I have small hands</li>
            <li> I have 1mm rhinestones and it&#x27;s very hard to pick them up using other tools.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have anything negative to say.</li>
            <li> No more fumbling with glitter and nail jewels!  </li>
            <li> No more looking around on the floor for a jewel that dropped (or flew) out of the tweezers!  </li>
            <li> ~They make placement of the small details a breeze!</li>
            <li> They are a little difficult to use.</li>
            <li> For the price can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Does the job , especially small crystals.</li>
            <li> It did take a bit of a learning curve to cut the decals very thin without losing part of the picture.  </li>

            <li> Great little tweezers so far, east to handle and they arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> only used these a few times so far, but easy to use with small pieces. A must have for rhinestones</li>
            <li> These tweezers are absolutely amazing and can be used for a variety of tasks. I personally like to use them to pick up rhinestones/pearls/studs and place striping tape on my nails.</li>
            <li> Product was purchased for my 11 year old granddaughter for Christmas.  I purchased other nail art for her and I&#x27;m sure she will use this item for the nail art she will place on her nails.  The order looked exactly as described.  Positive transaction.</li>
            <li> We ordered the MASH Nail Art Tweezers and were very surprised at the quality of this product. They came with a plastic sleeve to protect the tweezer ends. They are very sturdy yet delicate enough to work with very fine and detailed jobs. They were just what I needed to accomplish the intricate work I do as an artist. Truly the best tweezers I have ever had...</li>
            <li> The MASH Nail Art Tweezers are great!  I bought them for my daughters and they find it very easy to use. Not only is it a great product, but it seems like a great company.  They want to be sure that I am 100% satisfied with their product. Customer service seems to be deminishing fast, so if I can get great customer service along with a great product, I&#x27;m over the moon!!</li>
            <li> A very good tweezer. It&#x27;s perfect for picking up tiny decorative rhinestones, confetti or anything else that&#x27;s eensy weensy. I&#x27;ve been using it for placing glittery bits onto my nails.</li>
            <li> I picked these up to add flocking to models, and general hobby work. They are perfect for my needs. They are incredible sharp at the point, and make good contact at the tip, allowing one to grip the finest of objects.</li>
            <li> Must have item for nail art, easy picking up the rhinestones or take off the stickers, etc.&lt;br /&gt;It will last life long if you don&#x27;t lose it.&lt;br /&gt;One of my best friends in nail world.</li>
            <li> My helper!!! I love it</li>
            <li> I got this to manipulate tiny stuff for nail art and I love it!  You have a great grip and you don&#x27;t need the pulse of a surgeon to use it</li>
            <li> This tool I bought with a rhinestone wheel and I thought I should buy this for an easy application. I WAS RIGHT! :) I would definetly reccomend this to a friend!</li>
            <li> Ordered this for a friend of mine, it works as described, and have not heard any complaints about it. For the price can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Good quality and fast shipping . I recommend these tweezers one hundred percent to anyone hesitant on purchasing them .</li>
            <li> They are amazing, really comfortable to use!  Just in two words.  Love it. They are amazing it worth 5 star, no less.</li>
            <li> Tweezers were just as described, and they work great for the very small stuff (fimo, confetti, rhinetones, etc.). They are very pointy, but extremely useful. I highly recommend them for anyone looking for excellent tweezers. Thank you MASH!</li>
            <li> I purchased mash tweezers, and I am very happy with the purchase. The quality of the product is great. I can decorate my nails with ease, the tweezers help me apply the decorations with precision :). Great product!</li>
            <li> i love this item. it works perfectly. i use it almost every week and it makes it so much easier when i need to pick up rhinestones instead of using a toothpick. highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> These items arrived much sooner than expected, and were so easy to use!  No more fumbling with glitter and nail jewels!  No more looking around on the floor for a jewel that dropped (or flew) out of the tweezers!  They go on easily, and exactly where you want them.  :-)</li>
            <li> This was for a nail care basket i put together for an auction.  they are beautiful jewels . just as i ordered</li>
            <li> this is the best picker upper for nailart , it works well for me i might just buy another one</li>
            <li> I really like this MASH Nail Art Tweezer for Rhinestones. It looks just like the picture, very nice, and works well with the rhinestones.  I love it. No complaints.</li>
            <li> The tweezer was usable but had a little imperfection on it. The silver tip of the tweezer was asymmetrical so I had to use it a certain way/angle in order to pick up rhinestones. I like it but that&#x27;s the only problem I have with it.</li>
            <li> Words cannot express how much I love these. I use them for my new rhinestones, clay cane slices and also for my perler beads! They are all easy to pick up with these tweezers and I love these!</li>
            <li> it is hard for me, being a person with smaller hands, as well as fibromyalgia, so my hands cramp easily when gripping implements.  so far im am not having that problem when using these tweezers. so i love that about them.</li>
            <li> Great tweezers.  My hubby paints cars every once in awhile and when he does he wants the paint job to be perfect.  It seems that he will get at least 1 gnat doing a backstroke through the paint the minute he is finished and the paint is still wet.  He uses these tweezers to pluck that gnat out of his paint job.  Told you it wasn&#x27;t the typical use.</li>
            <li> I THINK THIS IS GREAT ITS ANGELED JUST RIGHT PERFECT SIZE TOO GOOD FOR DOING DETAILED NAIL ART,RHINESTONES,BEADS,SMALL STICKERS,FIMO CANES AND HOLDING THINGS WHILE GLUEING. JUST A GREAT TOOL TO HAVE FOR ALL KINDS OF THINGS AND VERY AFFORDABLE.</li>
            <li> I bought it to apply 3mm rhinestones on wedding invitations and it&#x27;s great! I&#x27;m buying more of them for similar projects!</li>
            <li> The brushes are all in good condition. One fell off the wood but a lil glue an perfect. The tweezers are awsome I tryed it out an it picks it up rhinestones an fimos perfectly. Will buy again for sure!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a crafter and this is a perfect pair of tweezers that is ideal for adding small finishing touches to projects such as resin charms, polymer clays, etc. It is very accurate and lines up perfectly to pull out a single hair without any &#x27;loosening&#x27; of the grip.</li>
            <li> My daughter is having a great time with these tweezers!  She received these to apply her collection of tiny nail art.  The curvature of this tool makes the selection and application of each charm a much simpler task:)</li>
            <li> The nail art tweezer was received in time stated and it works perfectly with the rhinestones I purchased.  My daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the product &amp; it arrived in a timely fashion. I will always continue to order from this company. They definitely help me pick up the small stuff I use for work.</li>
            <li> Awesome set of tweezers!! Easy to grip and very precise. I even use them to apply  my false eyelashes (with the pointy end turned away from my eyes obviously). If I ever lose them I would definitely repurchase!</li>
            <li> Have not used it for tiny rhinestones, yet.  But, have found several other uses, such as for very tight knots.  The tiny pointed ends held tight which made for easy manipulation.  A very handy tool to have.</li>
            <li> This was an excellent value.  Great product.  Very happy with the purchase.  Would recommend &amp; would purchase again.  Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> These are great tweezers to use for really tiny things.  I got them to pick up those really little rhinestones that are being used on fingernails.  I actually use those rhinestones for craft projects.  At first, I thought I could use regular tweezers.  But after reading other reviews, I ordered this and am glad I did.  Regular tweezers with things this small would be hard, if not impossible, to use.  The one thing you need to be careful of is the tips.  They are really sharp.  I dropped the tweezers and it fell on my arm with the point out.  It was so sharp that it left a tiny puncture wound that started bleeding.  So other than the caution to be really careful of the sharp point, I really like them.</li>
            <li> I ordered a set of itty bitty rhinestones, and decided to order these tweezers too, and they are great.  Don&#x27;t know what to say other than that.  Perfect for picking up things that you can&#x27;t with your fingers...</li>
            <li> Item does what it is stated to do. It&#x27;s not so expensive and does a good job for nail art.</li>
            <li> The gripping part of the tweezer is great! I don&#x27;t drop it. Nice ends to pick up almost anything tiny. Great product!</li>
            <li> they;re coated in that wonderfull rubbery grip stuff that some nicer pens have, and they are manufactured to a good tolerance.  perfect spring, what else can i say about a pair of tweezers?  also tehy came packaged with a littel rubber tubign to hold the points, so they care about their product, and tehy emailed me a coupel weeks after i received them askign to be sure to review it on amazon and if i didnt feel they were 5 star, theyd fix it, but honestly, they are the best quality i could hope for for however few dollars i spent.</li>
            <li> Received package quickly..very satisfied :)makes applying deco to  nails superdigging easy!you get exactly what they described..no surprises and great price for products thank you! Would recommend to others</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these tweezers.  It makes jewel placement so much easier and faster.  It took a little longer than usual to receive, but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Hi all,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never wirte reviews on products bought in Amazon.com, but this one deserve it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tweeser its the best I have ever seen or bought in mi life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its so precise that you don&#x27;t have to make any effort on getting the rhinestons or beads on the nail. Just took it with the tweezer and you will see how easy is to place it where you want it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This products its a MUST! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> These work great for picking up rhinestones and doing nail art work. Also work great for scrapbooking! Glad I got them!</li>
            <li> I gave these nail canes and tweezers to my 10 yr old for Christmas and she LOVES them!  They are so cute and tiny.  There are so many of them and are shipped in a baggie. Thanks</li>
            <li> Great transaction and would be happy to do business with them again.  Shipped quickly to ensure it arrived in time for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I got it to give to my daughter for her birthday.  She loves it.  Says it is perfect for her needs.</li>
            <li> Not much to say on this, it is exactly as described. Not much to say on this, it is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> These work for picking up the small rhinestones and placing them where I want them. I have actually used them for other purposes.</li>
            <li> These are the most precise tweezers I have ever used, and they are perfect for all my nail art needs.  I&#x27;ve used these tweezers for rhinestone/stud placement, stickers, and water decals and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I love these tweezers for doing nail art. Not only for placement of rhinestones and studs, but also for carefully picking up the occasional fuzz that will land on a wet nail and totally ruin your day.</li>
            <li> I like them. They&#x27;re useful for picking up tiny nail art stones and things. They are comfortable to hold and really sharp.</li>
            <li> Works just like it should. Better than your cheapo pair for placing jems.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect! I would recommend it for anyone doing nails, just be careful of the super pointy tip, but it comes with something to protect it so yeah it;s great.</li>
            <li> Does the job , especially small crystals.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice tool to use for putting on the dots and I do mean it works good, I enjoy putting on my nail polish and then my Rhinestones. Make my nail look beautiful.</li>
            <li> This is a great took for toenail art. I&#x27;ve said a lot of money doing my own manicures and pedicures.</li>
            <li> I tried to cancel this item but it was too late, it had already shipped, I figured I could just use regular tweezers. But these are actually really good, nice and pointy and they pick up things with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be careful if you do buy then... THEY ARE REALLY SHARP!</li>
            <li> I have one of these and ordered another as a gift.  I create in polymer clay and am able to work with tiny beads and crystals in my work.  Great price for this high quality tweezer.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Mash nail art design sticks and tweezer for my daughter&#x27;s 5th birthday party.  They were a big hit!  The girls loved picking their sticks for me to cut decals for them.  It did take a bit of a learning curve to cut the decals very thin without losing part of the picture.  But the girls had so much fun as did I!  The tweezers were great too.  The tips are pointy and very precise for placing the decals on.  Price was good too.</li>
            <li> These products were not only low priced but high quality.  Arrived right away.  Thanks for a nice product, my daughter loved them.</li>
            <li> These make it a breeze to do designs with nail art gems ,rhinestones,and pearls. They made it really easy for me to apply my pearls and I would definitely recommend them. :]</li>
            <li> Im very happy with the item I order. It was the right item.  It came really fast!  Cant wait to use it..</li>
            <li> Just placed an order for a second one.  Need I say more? :) But Amazon requires me to write at least 20 words.  So here goes...  The quality is great.  Tweezer points are sharp enough even to do some eye brows plugging.</li>
            <li> My daughter was thrilled to receive these as part of her birthday gift. She loves playing with her nail polishes and nail designs during the &amp;#34;off&#x27; season, and these grippers help her place her little jewels perfectly.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the fast shipment and professional image. This is exactly what I was looking for, and perfectly priced.</li>
            <li> It makes doing my nails 10x easier and faster.  I am so happy with my purchase, and wouldn&#x27;t return it for the world.</li>
            <li> U can use this tweezer to catch the small stuff it&#x27;s greattttttt&lt;br /&gt;I bought lots of tweezer but believe me this one the only one that work</li>
            <li> Im really not a big fan of these. If the were a little shorter I think this would help? They are a little difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I use them incessantly.  I especially use them to put the little white sticker on so that you get a perfect french.  --- Tip only use Orly French Tip Circles  --- They pick up the items I need for my nails so efficiently, I really don&#x27;t know what I did before them.</li>
            <li> metal seems to be good quality, but the thing seems sharper than necessary, also the thing isn&#x27;t symmetrical so it might not work as well as you want it to if you&#x27;re unlucky with that.</li>
            <li> Ordered these tweezers along with a bunch of other nail art supplies. They are affordable and arrived quickly and make applying nail decor very precise. I have a bit of difficulty picking up and holding onto the little rhinestones I ordered with these, but I think I just need to get used to working with such minutiae.</li>
            <li> Great item will use alot do my nails about every two weeks the tweezers will help me so much.thanks alot</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well made enough, but I have found it a bit cumbersome and prefer to use a toothpick. I don&#x27;t have anything negative to say. I just never use the thing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what to say.....they&#x27;re tweezers.  Slightly more expensive than I would have preferred to pay, but oh well, it gets the job done</li>
            <li> They work exactly the way they should, nice and pointy, the angle makes it easy to pick up beads etc.</li>
            <li> Have not used.  Gift for my daughter.  Upon inspection:  has a vinyl protective slip over the tip to prevent unwanted ouchies,  sharp pointed tips match up very well...I see these not just for nail glitz but as a jewelry tool as well to pick up the finest of seed beads...and if you happen to spot an unwanted brow hair or two.....  Great time on shipping from this seller, good price, free shipping, package arrived in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> I have small hands and I have small fingers, but these make decorating my nails incredibly easier.&lt;br /&gt;I thought that the tiny jewels I have would just slip through the ends of the tweezers, but they held them so well.&lt;br /&gt;And they were so easy to pick up too!</li>
            <li> I ordered these tweezers along with a bunch of other nail art supplies and tools. They were affordable and arrived quickly. The tips were protected with its own sleeve and the quality speaks for it&#x27;s self.</li>
            <li> Use these all the time !</li>
            <li> I have 1mm rhinestones and it&#x27;s very hard to pick them up using other tools. This tweezer is specifically made for that purpose and serves the same really good. I use this to pick up rhinestones and fimo cane pieces. The product arrived really fast. Very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> The curved shape of the tweezers is perfect for detailing things - like nail art. It works great at picking up rhinestones, loose glitter, and the tips are very precise</li>
            <li> Nice slim, pointed ends and a good angle make these a must for my nail art kit. They are precise enough to pick up and place the tiniest jewels and fimo slices. They seem sturdy, too.</li>
            <li> Is working, its good.</li>
            <li> When I was on here buying rhinestones I thought I better get a tool to pick them out so I wouldn&#x27;t make a mess. This does just that. They are a bit sharp, but they are supposed to be small enough points to get a hold of the stone and place on the nail. But they are amazing. Got here quickly and safely. I recommend this for sure.</li>
            <li> The price was unbeatable and these work so well for what I use them for!  Great for jewelry making and glueing/placing gemstones!</li>
            <li> Does what it supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I use it to put rhinestones on my manicured hands. It&#x27;s a great tool! It&#x27;s great to make your own designs or highlight designs.</li>
            <li> I am using these for an art project and have had great results. I am able to pick up the smallest gems without any problems and apply them to a glued surface. A must have for that crafty person!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a nail artist -- but I purchased these to use with the MASH rhinestones [[ASIN:B005BF1M10 MASH Rhinestones 2400 Piece 12 Color Nail Art Nailart Manicure Wheels]] that I purchased to use on my hand crafted greeting cards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really pleasantly surprised by the quality of these -- VERY high quality for the price.  And they really do work well to wrangle those tiny rhinestones.  The tweezers aren&#x27;t huge -- very nice manageable size -- and come with a little plastic cover for the tips.  You should use it -- those tips are SHARP, but that helps when I place a rhinestone: I can use the sharp tips to \\&quot;tap\\&quot; it down into the glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These now have a place in my crafts tool bag -- definitely a great purchase!</li>
            <li> Great!!! Buy it. It&#x27;s going to rock your design and make you like a great inventor. The Quality is good.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for. It work amazingly. It could pick up the smallest little beads for my nails.</li>
            <li> This is a great little tool for those tiny little nail art pieces.  Easy to hold and maneuver. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Love these tweezers! They are nice and precise for picking up small nail things!! Got here early and nicely packaged!!</li>
            <li> I stopped wrapping my nails because I of my job as a nurse and because I don&#x27;t I have much time,so I started doing my nails on my own.I bought some rhinestones and tried using a regular tweezer but that didn&#x27;t work too well kept smudging the nail polish I already had on so I decided to give these a try,believe me when I say I&#x27;m no nail artist lol,and they worked great!They place the stones,flowers or whatever it is you want to put on your nail exactly where you want the it,is easy to handle,and doesn&#x27;t smudge your polish.I recommend this product even for those who,like me,are artistically challenged!</li>
            <li> This truly is a 5 star product! The tweezers pick-up every piece of nailart that I&#x27;ve attempted...tiny rhinestones, fimo slices, tiny stickers, glitter confetti, shaved mylar pieces, etc. I also recieved this product very quickly after ordering. I would definitely recommend these tweezers to all nail artists...a must have in my tool set! :)</li>
            <li> These tweezers were great to grab a hair and also small items for crafts......</li>
            <li> Just received this MASH nail art tweezer in the mail today and I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product. It has a great pointy tip which picks up the rhinestone or other 3d design you might have with ease.</li>

            <li> This is a must-have product if you are going to be using the teeny tiny little beads or little doo-dads that are designed to be glued onto the nail bed. My daughter loves them. They are perfectly pointed at the end to pick up the tiniest of nail design. I&#x27;m glad I spent a little bit more and got these.</li>
            <li> I received this item pretty quickly and it seems real sturdy. I was expecting the metal to be light and cheap but its actually solid. So far I really like it. I use it primarily for peeling off designs of my nail stamper and the curved design lets me see where its going without accidentally smudging my polish.  Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Very handy! not just for nail designing. you could use it for many little things around the house .such as replacing a watch battery and etc.love it,very good quality.</li>
            <li> These are some really good Nail Art Tweezers! They pick up &amp; hold the Rhinestones well. They do not tire the hand. The item was delivered promptly &amp; was well packaged. I would buy again from this Seller.</li>
            <li> These are great for picking up tiny things.  I used them for nail art.  I actually now have two sets because I didnt realize a set came w/ some art kits I bought.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because the tweezers came on a timely fashon, curved and pointed as stated on website! Love thease it makes a graet product for eyelash application and more! I am very satisfied with the weight and feel of the tweezers.</li>
            <li> I love doing nail art and was looking for tweezers that could pick up all the little nail jewels and stay out of the way while I am setting them. These are so perfect, they pick up everything, and are so easy to work with!&lt;br /&gt;They are perfect for all my little &amp;#34;things&amp;#34; I am so glad I found them!  Now that I have them I have no idea how I ever used anything else :)</li>

They are perfect for picking up my nail rhinetstones that are so tiny. Great Product! I would definitley reccomend these to someone. Worth the prcie!</li>
            <li> Seriously, they are the best tweezers I have ever owned - and I&#x27;ve owned a lot.  The shape works incredibly well.  I have severe tremors and can prop my hand against myself or whatever, and use them just as well.  I&#x27;m really happy with this purchase!!</li>
            <li> Great little tweezers for using when deciding my girls nails</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to do and I&#x27;m happy I purchased it. Makes life easier whenever I go to use my rhinestones.</li>
            <li> These are awesome and a great value for the price. They were delivered really fast and work perfectly for those tiny little gems, stickers, etc. A must for anyone who likes to do decorative mani&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Just what I need for all those small creative card making moments~They make placement of the small details a breeze!</li>
            <li> I used to have a pair of these curved tweezers and I lost them.  I have been looking to replace them for some time.  I have occasionally found them, but they were always over $20 and since I just wanted them because they make some craft and sewing things a little easier, that was too much.  These are great.  I will probably get another one for back up.</li>
            <li> when using it if the tip touches your nails even slightly it leaves a poke whole  that ruins the manicure. As the rhinestones are tiny it is hard to apply and when you are trying to position if it touches nails at all ruins the manicure... after couple tries I am going back to dotting tool for pickup and placement at least does not ruin manicure... what a waste... if any of you knows how to do it better please share</li>
            <li> these are great for picking up tiny rhinestones for nail art... i have long acrylic nails and these allow me to pick up the smallest things with ease!</li>
