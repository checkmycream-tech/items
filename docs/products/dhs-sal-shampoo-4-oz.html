    <ol>
            <li> Good service from supplier. Product very good</li>
            <li> I buy this shampoo for my dad and he has no complaints. We&#x27;ve purchased this product many times and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> Left my hair very clean and lots of shine.  I did not need to use a conditioner and it didn&#x27;t fade my color.</li>
            <li> did not do a thing for me......</li>
            <li> Noticed a difference after using product faithfully for one week.&lt;br /&gt;Now only use as needed.&lt;br /&gt;Can make your hair feel a little porous and dry</li>
            <li> Works well for my mother&#x27;s scalp.  It takes off the cradle cap.</li>
            <li> Have had dermatitis of scalp for the last 40 years.  Up to this point I had used Tarsum by Summer labs and it is the only product that has worked to give me a clear scalp.  I bought the DHS SAL because of the reviews.  I have been disappointed with the product.  Itchiness has come back and the so have the scales.  I am currently trying their Tar shampoo product, but again, it is not as good as Tarsum, leaves my hairy oily and some itchiness.  The reason why I am trying alternatives is for cost reasons - Tarsum 8oz bottle costs $28.</li>
            <li> It worked pretty well.  I will continue to use product.</li>
            <li> Helping my scalp. Nice and cleansing.</li>
            <li> This shampoo was recommended from my doctor It has worked for me It lathers up nicely I would recommend&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li> Why this salicylic shampoo works for me while others (Neutrogena, and Dermarest) have not is a mystery to me. It&#x27;s been 4 weeks so far and I am hoping that the results are lasting, and not just a temporary solution. My best results for my shoulder-length hair has been this DHS SAL shampoo paired with the Cleure Deep Hair Conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is first time using this shampoo. Dermatologist recommended. It has worked great. I had early psorias and didn&#x27;t know it. would order again as many pharamys do not carry this as stock item.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo I have used which worked for my allergies.  I use it every day now.  At the start it took about 10 days of daily use to get rid of the itching and redness.  Since then it has eliminated my allergic reactions. It works well for me.</li>
            <li> The product was much better than expected and worked as advertised.  I Highly recommend this product for anyone considering buying it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a shampoo that would help with my itching and dandruff and DHS SAL was recommended by a relative, so I ordered some. Almost no smell and leaves my hair very clean, but best of all after a few days use my scalp was not itching nearly as much. Very happy with this shampoo and the quick shipment after ordering.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommend this to me. It does a great job on my dandruff here in the Southwest with the drying winds and low humidity.</li>
            <li> If you have problems with head acne, this stuff really works.  You need to use it for about 2-3 weeks before you see a improvement.  I use it every other day now and have no problems.</li>
            <li> Seems to be keeping my dermatitis under control.  Haven&#x27;t totally given up my prescription shampoo, but it&#x27;s up to 52.00 a bottle.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has greatly helped my scalp. I recommend it. I put it on and wait about 15 min before I shampoo. It helps with flaking and itching.</li>
            <li> It suds great but my scalp still seems to itch. Not sure I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> Does not live up to what it says it suppose to do.</li>
            <li> SAL shampoo is difficult to find, esp. in larger size.&lt;br /&gt;I am 100% satisfied with my purchase of 2 4 oz. bottles.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is &#x27;good to go&#x27; - just how I want it!</li>
            <li> Doctor recommended . Great stuff</li>
            <li> Works well for me.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit expensive if you have long hair as it&#x27;s a small bottle, but a great product that actually works. It takes away the itchy scalp and leaves your hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li> On the expensive side, but worth it. Too harsh to use daily, I focus the product on my patches, working it into a thick lather then letting it sit for a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I alternate days, only using it 2-3 times a week. On my off days I use Cynthia Sylvia Stout Shampoo from Lush (you can buy it online I think) and follow up both shampoo treatments with WEN (it&#x27;s the best cleansing conditioner/conditioner). My scalp has almost completely recovered after using the DHS, this is my second bottle. I&#x27;m looking at complete removal of scaley patches with the continued use.</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo on my dog who had some skin issues. He is doing great now. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> My husband has used this one for years and it is pretty good to control oil. He like it. I used it also but I didn&#x27;t see any change since my hair is normal.</li>
            <li> MY wife said this helped along with the prescription the Dr prescribed</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible. It is one of the only dandruff shampoos that totally cures my flakes and itching. But unlike some of the other options out there, it also leaves my hair scent-less, soft, and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of my roommates keep running their hands through my hair now that it&#x27;s clean, which is kind of a downside I suppose.</li>
            <li> Just as expected. I should have bought the 8oz one</li>
            <li> My scalp was doing weirdness. I suffer many allergies. This was on my approved list my allergist gave me. My head is now soft and gross free thanks to this shampoo. Worth the $$$. Wish they sold in larger sizes.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo that doesn&#x27;t make me break out. Using this with a conditioner and my hair is soft.</li>
            <li> It does an excellent job of cleaning your scalp and helps stop the itching. It isn&#x27;t too harsh on your hair either. It depends on what is causing your dandruff whether or not it would help you. I use it between shampoos with a prescription the doc gave me. It probably would help someone who only has a mild problem occasionally.</li>
            <li> I have a really dry scalp and have tried so many different shampoos over the counter and prescription.  This one seems to be working better than any of those and it doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as some of them that I used in the past.  Does it work 100% nope, but my scalp feels better.;  Doesn&#x27;t itch as much either.</li>
            <li> The best I have ever used. Better then what the Dermatogist gave me. I&#x27;ve been using this for over Two years now.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works well in my hair.  It removed the dandruff and my hair was left clean and manageable.</li>
            <li> Used it twice and got rid of several issues on my scalp. Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my scalp saw no improvement after using this product for more than a month. I was very disappointed because other reviewers claimed to have seen improvement.</li>
            <li> great shampoo for psoriasis</li>
            <li> It works for psoriasis</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo that helps manage the psoriasis on my scalp and the related itching.  Be sure to leave it on for a few minutes to let it work.  I only have to use it ever one to two weeks to keep my scalp clear.  Use it at the first sign and brings relief every time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great shampoo, it makes it so I can no longer &amp;#34;make it rain&amp;#34; dandruff on my desk. That aside, it&#x27;s no frills, it doesn&#x27;t smell pretty, but it will clean your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, definitely less dandruff with the recommended usage.</li>
            <li> Nice shampoo...sudsy...and my scalp does not itch after using it.</li>
            <li> Recommended by our dermatologist, this shampoo has worked wonders.  Clears and soothes quickly.  Very easy to use in a squeeze bottle.</li>
            <li> It worked very well on my problem and helps from my psoriasis from coming back. I will continue to use it</li>
