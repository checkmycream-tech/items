    <ol>
            <li>With that being said, still one of the best products out there.</li>
            <li>The best drugstore lotion (not counting Amlactin)!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great in the winter!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell the best, but gets the job done</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect the way it is!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week now and have had wonderful results with it.</li>
            <li>This Eucerin product, for me, is perfect with no skin reactions.</li>
            <li>Eucerin is the best, of course.</li>
            <li>both so it seems to work the best at clearing it up.  </li>
            <li>Cost is very good.  </li>
            <li>Has a pleasant scent, and works best after shower or bath.</li>

            <li>love this lotion!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t go on greasy, absorbs quickly, but best of all it has staying power, which makes it a great product -- and economical.</li>
            <li>/&gt;And in spite of the lightness of the product it works amazingly well.  </li>
            <li>and this works great to help smooth and soften them.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried most brands and found some good ones (Amlactin and Vaseline Intensive Repair come to mind)</li>
            <li>But I can tell you that it&#x27;s finally catching up with me.  </li>
            <li>Amazon has the best price, and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It was all in all a great product - absolutely worth the money.</li>
            <li>im loving these one more than udderly smooth!</li>
            <li>Very smooth to put on.</li>
            <li>Although the lotion is still a good choice because it&#x27;s not that greasy and it did absorb quickly, I hope the seller can change the picture to what they sell.</li>
            <li>I love Eucerin products.  </li>
            <li>They are simply the best.  </li>

            <li>I get the more</li>
            <li>In my 20&#x27;s I would not have been able to use this lotion</li>
            <li>it seems to be doing a wonderful job at exfoliating and moisturizing my skin at the same time.</li>
            <li>Most Eucerin products have proved to be of top quality.</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>Veery pleased with Eucerin lotion.  </li>
            <li>Skin feels smoother and more moisturized.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Pump dispenser dispenses perfect amount and has never clogged (even after dropping bottle multiple</li>
            <li>love this lotion.</li>
            <li>Smoothing Essentials was a great lotion - light, non-greasy, but still very, very effective at keeping dry skin at bay, even in the winter months.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion - Eucerin came recommended by  my doctor, &amp; the smoothing one glides on nice and quick</li>
            <li>I find Eucerin the best lotion for dry skin in the winter.</li>
            <li>It is the best for dry skin</li>
            <li>This is perfect for dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin that needs help exfoliating, and this lotion is just perfect.  </li>
            <li>I love how this lotion feels on my skin, feels smooth and moisturizing, part of my anti-aging regimen.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a permanant cure, but works great to clear it up.</li>
            <li>Goes on easy, soaks in and does not leave a greasy feel.  </li>
            <li>and it was easy to \\&quot;forget\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>it is easy to rub in and keeps skin moist.  </li>
            <li>are important to me.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just too many chemicals that I do not want to be absorbed into my already overloaded lymphatic</li>
            <li>I use this primarily on my face and it is not greasy or overly shiny, but I still prefer the Eucerin Plus Smoothing Essentials.</li>
            <li>* Opaque bottle keeps beneficial ingredients stable in the presence of light and air&lt;</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive and fair skin.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t sound very right, isn&#x27;t it?</li>
            <li>original version</li>
            <li>does not smell like the original and</li>
            <li>the bright white patch vanished within days (I kept checking with the uv light), the scaly texture resolved within a week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So many customers come for the old good ones but they ended up getting the new formula lotion.  </li>
            <li>I use the EUCERIN  Smoothing Dry Skin Lotion all over my body and find that it is very effective.</li>
            <li>A full pump is probably too much for most hands.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll save money and get it quick with Amazon.</li>
            <li>* Feels lightweight and absorbs quickly with a satin (non-greasy) finish&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried their new replacement products to see what might be comparable, but I&#x27;ve read the reviews and it seems that the reworked formula is more greasy.</li>
            <li>Everyone in the house has a bottle of their own and there is one kept in the open that is used all of the time.  </li>
            <li>Now when I take a shower water beads on my skin like a freshly waxed vehicle.</li>
            <li>Best kind for super dry skin, sometimes it is very hard to find</li>
            <li>Eucerin is also more affordable than many other brands.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a much heavier lotion, and doesn&#x27;t absorb cleanly.</li>
            <li>I only wish they weren&#x27;t so strong!</li>
            <li>Simply put, an effective, reasonably priced lotion that does some heavy-duty lifting when it comes to dry/scaly/KP plagued skin.</li>
            <li>I have used many Eurcerin products, so I was really surprised how much I don&#x27;t like this one.</li>
            <li>While this lotion was still good, the trial size seemed a little thinner (I can&#x27;t seem to find anything that is more lightweight then the middle one like this.  </li>
            <li>Eucerin quit making this lotion, which is unfortunate because it worked wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>My daughter tends to stop using the lotion when it&#x27;s better, then it comes back again.  </li>
            <li>I started doing this after I accidentally noticed the dry scaly skin patch on my leg glowed super bright white when I was playing with a pocket uv flashlight....</li>
            <li>It makes you mildly sun sensitive, so wear sleeves or sunscreen!</li>
            <li>Really a good lotion ,  for older people and it takes so little  Doc.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These 3 simple changes have resolved my dry scaly skin issues entirely and is far more pleasant overall!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine as a basic skin cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big Eucerin user (Calming cream, hand repair, facial cleanser) &amp; thought it would be perfect for my dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all this is a light, silky lotion that absorbs instantly.  </li>
            <li>my skin tone- very noticeable on my arms.  </li>
            <li>The only &amp;#34;drugstore&amp;#34; moisturizer that is paraben and mineral oil free.</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, item as described.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>As long as you comply with the less is more quote you will love this product.  </li>
            <li>This is the only lotion I have used that is great for dry skin especially in the Winter months.  </li>
            <li>Generally a little greasy but for winter, I&#x27;ll take it since it really does seem to make my skin better</li>
            <li>It is fantastic on dry skin.</li>
            <li>Much better than previous moisturizers I have used.</li>
            <li>This is an added benefit I wasn&#x27;t expecting from a main stream</li>
            <li>and it seems that the older</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see AHA in my ingredient list, but the third ingredient, urea, is used in creams to heal cracked skin, such as [[ASIN:B00N3W70L4 O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Working Hands &amp; Healthy Feet]].</li>
            <li>It may take a couple of tries to figure out the right amount to put on but it is well worth it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick to the Calming cream - highly recommend that for itchy skin or post-shave soothing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although most people don&#x27;t have to deal with a desert climate, during a harsh winter it can seem like it.  </li>
            <li>This heavy duty lotion is my favorite and I have used it for years.</li>
            <li>Looking back on it, it&#x27;s actually a very strange thing for me to skip because I AM one of those people that pay top dollar for high end</li>
            <li>I went to an actual store and brought the right product.</li>
            <li>Please note the product listing hasn&#x27;t been updated with the new product information, so if you order this you&#x27;ll receive the new Smoothing Repair formula.</li>
            <li>I  ordered  a  much smaller version butt wish I  ordered the large one like mom&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>Within 24 hours of applying this lotion, my skin feels silky and smooth again, especially skin that isn&#x27;t as prone to flaking, such as thighs, and torso.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised to find that it also seems to be evening out</li>
            <li>/&gt;skin has never been so soft!</li>
            <li>I normally have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Acts as a mild exfoliant, seems to promote healing, and eliminates rough skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rich and moisturizing, but not worth it if there&#x27;s no absorption.</li>
            <li>I find my skin feels rough and dry mostly because it doesn&#x27;t shed well.</li>
            <li>Not heavy.</li>
            <li>My skin still feels soft and moisturized 24 hours after use.  </li>
            <li>The lower pH really helps exfoliate and soften the skin, and unlike the traditional Eucerin Plus, the fast-absorbing formula means you don&#x27;t walk around for an hour after applying leaving grease stains on everything you bump into.</li>
            <li>and I wanted my skin silky soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li>It has a very funky odor which makes the experience gross.</li>
            <li>#34;it is the best&amp;#34; she has ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves her skin soft, and absorbs well leaving no greasy film.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended by her Dermatologist.</li>
            <li>After using this formula for about 3 weeks now, I&#x27;ve noticed a marked improvement in the texture and look of my skin.  </li>
            <li>It is unscented and makes my skin feel soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had no issues with this cream so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots of other lotions, but none of them exfoliate and moisturize enough for my skin to be smooth, soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>I apply it daily all over after my shower and it gives all day and all night protection for super dry skin.</li>
            <li>It clear up a lot of my dried skin and bottle is still full</li>
            <li>the bottle looks a bit different could be an older version</li>
            <li>it is super thick and very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>Having just left a negative review of original Eucerin, I felt obligated to provide a rave review for this Eucerin Smoothing Repair which I really</li>
            <li>I think those of you in colder climes will find this very beneficial in combating dry, winter skin.</li>
            <li>This product really helps my dry, itchy skin.  </li>
            <li>I have a dry skin and it works really well.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;ve neglected my skin for so long that it becomes chafed, the first application of Smoothing Skin Repair will sting a little but only the first time.</li>
            <li>My doctor prescribed an antifungal cream that barely halted the fungus, once I started spraying it with mag oil</li>
            <li>live in a dry climate and moisturizers</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive all the time and very dry if I&#x27;m not vigilant.</li>
            <li>Used consistently, this cream also keeps keratosis pilaris (little bumps that can appear on my forearms and upper thighs in winter) at bay.</li>
            <li>I only use a half pump for my hands or it&#x27;s way too much.  </li>
            <li>This is the only thing I have found that works for my dry sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>, the thick Smoothing Repair lotion sinks into my skin very quickly.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> While this lotion was still good, the trial size seemed a little thinner (I can&#x27;t seem to find anything that is more lightweight then the middle one like this.  </li>
            <li> Eucerin quit making this lotion, which is unfortunate because it worked wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> My daughter tends to stop using the lotion when it&#x27;s better, then it comes back again.  </li>
            <li> I started doing this after I accidentally noticed the dry scaly skin patch on my leg glowed super bright white when I was playing with a pocket uv flashlight....</li>
            <li> It makes you mildly sun sensitive, so wear sleeves or sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Really a good lotion ,  for older people and it takes so little  Doc.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These 3 simple changes have resolved my dry scaly skin issues entirely and is far more pleasant overall!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine as a basic skin cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big Eucerin user (Calming cream, hand repair, facial cleanser) &amp; thought it would be perfect for my dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all this is a light, silky lotion that absorbs instantly.  </li>
            <li> my skin tone- very noticeable on my arms.  </li>
            <li> The only &amp;#34;drugstore&amp;#34; moisturizer that is paraben and mineral oil free.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, item as described.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> As long as you comply with the less is more quote you will love this product.  </li>
            <li> This is the only lotion I have used that is great for dry skin especially in the Winter months.  </li>
            <li> Generally a little greasy but for winter, I&#x27;ll take it since it really does seem to make my skin better</li>
            <li> It is fantastic on dry skin.</li>
            <li> Much better than previous moisturizers I have used.</li>
            <li> This is an added benefit I wasn&#x27;t expecting from a main stream</li>
            <li> and it seems that the older</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see AHA in my ingredient list, but the third ingredient, urea, is used in creams to heal cracked skin, such as [[ASIN:B00N3W70L4 O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Working Hands &amp; Healthy Feet]].</li>
            <li> It may take a couple of tries to figure out the right amount to put on but it is well worth it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick to the Calming cream - highly recommend that for itchy skin or post-shave soothing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although most people don&#x27;t have to deal with a desert climate, during a harsh winter it can seem like it.  </li>
            <li> This heavy duty lotion is my favorite and I have used it for years.</li>
            <li> Looking back on it, it&#x27;s actually a very strange thing for me to skip because I AM one of those people that pay top dollar for high end</li>
            <li> I went to an actual store and brought the right product.</li>
            <li> Please note the product listing hasn&#x27;t been updated with the new product information, so if you order this you&#x27;ll receive the new Smoothing Repair formula.</li>
            <li> I  ordered  a  much smaller version butt wish I  ordered the large one like mom&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> Within 24 hours of applying this lotion, my skin feels silky and smooth again, especially skin that isn&#x27;t as prone to flaking, such as thighs, and torso.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised to find that it also seems to be evening out</li>
            <li> /&gt;skin has never been so soft!</li>
            <li> I normally have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Acts as a mild exfoliant, seems to promote healing, and eliminates rough skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rich and moisturizing, but not worth it if there&#x27;s no absorption.</li>
            <li> I find my skin feels rough and dry mostly because it doesn&#x27;t shed well.</li>
            <li> Not heavy.</li>
            <li> My skin still feels soft and moisturized 24 hours after use.  </li>
            <li> The lower pH really helps exfoliate and soften the skin, and unlike the traditional Eucerin Plus, the fast-absorbing formula means you don&#x27;t walk around for an hour after applying leaving grease stains on everything you bump into.</li>
            <li> and I wanted my skin silky soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li> It has a very funky odor which makes the experience gross.</li>
            <li> #34;it is the best&amp;#34; she has ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves her skin soft, and absorbs well leaving no greasy film.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended by her Dermatologist.</li>
            <li> After using this formula for about 3 weeks now, I&#x27;ve noticed a marked improvement in the texture and look of my skin.  </li>
            <li> It is unscented and makes my skin feel soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had no issues with this cream so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of other lotions, but none of them exfoliate and moisturize enough for my skin to be smooth, soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> I apply it daily all over after my shower and it gives all day and all night protection for super dry skin.</li>
            <li> It clear up a lot of my dried skin and bottle is still full</li>
            <li> the bottle looks a bit different could be an older version</li>
            <li> it is super thick and very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> Having just left a negative review of original Eucerin, I felt obligated to provide a rave review for this Eucerin Smoothing Repair which I really</li>
            <li> I think those of you in colder climes will find this very beneficial in combating dry, winter skin.</li>
            <li> This product really helps my dry, itchy skin.  </li>
            <li> I have a dry skin and it works really well.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;ve neglected my skin for so long that it becomes chafed, the first application of Smoothing Skin Repair will sting a little but only the first time.</li>
            <li> My doctor prescribed an antifungal cream that barely halted the fungus, once I started spraying it with mag oil</li>
            <li> live in a dry climate and moisturizers</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive all the time and very dry if I&#x27;m not vigilant.</li>
            <li> Used consistently, this cream also keeps keratosis pilaris (little bumps that can appear on my forearms and upper thighs in winter) at bay.</li>
            <li> I only use a half pump for my hands or it&#x27;s way too much.  </li>
            <li> This is the only thing I have found that works for my dry sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> , the thick Smoothing Repair lotion sinks into my skin very quickly.</li>
            <li> Its a little heavy but not bad.</li>
            <li> I use a little bit about 3-4 times a day, it lasts forever and really helps my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have dry asian skin, and I get extremely ashy during the winter time - this producted completely eliminated the issue with no greasy residue or fragrance.</li>
            <li> However, what I received when I placed this order is a new replacement product Eucerin has released called Smoothing Repair, and it&#x27;s not nearly as good as the old formula.</li>
            <li> I have naturally oily skin, so I occasionally become lazy with my body moisturizer routine.</li>
            <li> Skin isn&#x27;t left feeling damp and sticky as with some other lotions which shall remain nameless(*cough*</li>
            <li> This has been my go to every day lotion since my insurance quit covering any lotion that helped my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m prone I am to dry skin build-up.</li>
            <li> I use it on my daughter&#x27;s dry (eczema prone) skin and on mine.  </li>
            <li> My leg still has a degree of dry skin issues</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth money for anyone with difficult skin such as mine.  </li>
            <li> Several days a week I also spray on magnesium oil a few hours prior to my shower.</li>
            <li> Works on dry hands as expected.</li>
            <li> I had very dry skin</li>
            <li> I have VERY dry hands</li>
            <li> the skin on my entire body was noticeably healthier within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> so now I use coconut oil, it was vastly improved with a few days!</li>
            <li> face care and have a regimen that includes at least 7 different bottles and potions.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the cost to return.</li>
            <li> Why have I neglected everything from my neck down?  </li>
            <li> It leaves a slightly sticky film on the skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less than 8.00 on subscribe and save.  </li>
            <li> A little bit sticky</li>
            <li> In the past, I couldn&#x27;t wear Eucerin because it was too heavy for me and seemed to clog my pores but now having tried this cream</li>
            <li> Also this one almost has a sticky feeling for a little bit after use, while the trial my skin felt like silk!  </li>
            <li> I used just a small amount on my arms &amp; hands.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never liked how greasy it is</li>
            <li> My neglect becomes apparent after a series of dry, frigid days.</li>
            <li> Keeps our skin moisturized during the cold and dry winters in Chicago.</li>
            <li> Less expensive through Amazon</li>
            <li> Sucks!</li>
            <li> The pump was broken when it arrived.</li>
            <li> Seems shipping knew it was broken because they wrapped plastic around the pump to keep it from leaking all over the packaging.</li>
            <li> Plus the pharmacy suspends the milk acid in Lubriderm, which is too thin for my winter</li>
            <li> I may have bought the wrong Eucerin product, but I don&#x27;t think so.  </li>
            <li> Because it is a &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34; item, the non-fragrance part really stinks.</li>
            <li> * Contains beneficial humectants (glyceryl glucoside and shea butter, which doesn&#x27;t pill up in cold weather)&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant smell, but then again it doesn&#x27;t smell like flowers and sunshine either.</li>
            <li> With its unpleasant odor I&#x27;m not sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product moisturizes well but leaves a sticky film which feels very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed with how sticky this is.  </li>

            <li> The product moisturizes well but leaves a sticky film which feels very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> It clear up a lot of my dried skin and bottle is still full</li>
            <li> I love Eucerin products.  They are simply the best.  I bought this because I had a trial size that almost instantly improved my skin.  There is either another Eucerin product or it is changed a bit.  While this lotion was still good, the trial size seemed a little thinner (I can&#x27;t seem to find anything that is more lightweight then the middle one like this.  Also this one almost has a sticky feeling for a little bit after use, while the trial my skin felt like silk!  I may have bought the wrong Eucerin product, but I don&#x27;t think so.  With that being said, still one of the best products out there.</li>
            <li> Use with massage. Very smooth to put on. Not heavy.</li>
            <li> Really a good lotion ,  for older people and it takes so little  Doc. recommended it.</li>
            <li> Having just left a negative review of original Eucerin, I felt obligated to provide a rave review for this Eucerin Smoothing Repair which I really love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in a dry climate and moisturizers are important to me.  I&#x27;ve tried most brands and found some good ones (Amlactin and Vaseline Intensive Repair come to mind) but my favorite is Smoothing Repair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all this is a light, silky lotion that absorbs instantly.  Skin isn&#x27;t left feeling damp and sticky as with some other lotions which shall remain nameless(*cough* original version *cough*).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And in spite of the lightness of the product it works amazingly well.  My skin still feels soft and moisturized 24 hours after use.  I was very surprised to find that it also seems to be evening out my skin tone- very noticeable on my arms.  This is an added benefit I wasn&#x27;t expecting from a main stream moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although most people don&#x27;t have to deal with a desert climate, during a harsh winter it can seem like it.  I think those of you in colder climes will find this very beneficial in combating dry, winter skin.</li>
            <li> Lightweight and smoothing.</li>
            <li> The best drugstore lotion (not counting Amlactin)! The lower pH really helps exfoliate and soften the skin, and unlike the traditional Eucerin Plus, the fast-absorbing formula means you don&#x27;t walk around for an hour after applying leaving grease stains on everything you bump into. It doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant smell, but then again it doesn&#x27;t smell like flowers and sunshine either. Simply put, an effective, reasonably priced lotion that does some heavy-duty lifting when it comes to dry/scaly/KP plagued skin.</li>
            <li> I love how this lotion feels on my skin, feels smooth and moisturizing, part of my anti-aging regimen. Will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> I find Eucerin the best lotion for dry skin in the winter.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive and fair skin.  As long as you comply with the less is more quote you will love this product.  It may take a couple of tries to figure out the right amount to put on but it is well worth it.  I used Aveeno products before and found that Aveeno was waxy feeling.  I want moisturized skin and I wanted my skin silky soft to the touch.  This is a staple to my home!</li>
            <li> does not smell like the original and the bottle looks a bit different could be an older version</li>
            <li> Because it is a &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34; item, the non-fragrance part really stinks. It has a very funky odor which makes the experience gross. Now I understand why they put perfume in these products. I only wish they weren&#x27;t so strong!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion - Eucerin came recommended by  my doctor, &amp; the smoothing one glides on nice and quick, I use it every day and have for years.</li>
            <li> This has been my go to every day lotion since my insurance quit covering any lotion that helped my dry skin.  Goes on easy, soaks in and does not leave a greasy feel.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, it does wonders for my skin.</li>
            <li> I love Smoothing Repair. I didn&#x27;t get that though, I got a different Eucerine product that doesn&#x27;t work as well. I went to an actual store and brought the right product.Sucks!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great in the winter! Works on dry hands as expected.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this lotion, and has commented that &amp;#34;it is the best&amp;#34; she has ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves her skin soft, and absorbs well leaving no greasy film.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended by her Dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I have dry asian skin, and I get extremely ashy during the winter time - this producted completely eliminated the issue with no greasy residue or fragrance.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Keeps our skin moisturized during the cold and dry winters in Chicago.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin that needs help exfoliating, and this lotion is just perfect.  I&#x27;ve tried lots of other lotions, but none of them exfoliate and moisturize enough for my skin to be smooth, soft and hydrated.  It&#x27;s worth money for anyone with difficult skin such as mine.  You&#x27;ll save money and get it quick with Amazon.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell the best, but gets the job done</li>
            <li> The only &amp;#34;drugstore&amp;#34; moisturizer that is paraben and mineral oil free. And it has no fragrance either. A little bit sticky and I would recommend to use it at night.</li>
            <li> I find my skin feels rough and dry mostly because it doesn&#x27;t shed well. The acids in this product help remarkably, especially where I have bumps on the back of my arms. It makes you mildly sun sensitive, so wear sleeves or sunscreen! Eucerin is also more affordable than many other brands. Well rated by EWG for having safe ingredients.</li>
            <li> I love this product, so I am pleased with the purchase and the price.  It was shipped promptly and packaged well.</li>
            <li> This product really helps my dry, itchy skin.  I use the EUCERIN  Smoothing Dry Skin Lotion all over my body and find that it is very effective.</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion I have used that is great for dry skin especially in the Winter months.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion for years, I decided to order it instead of going to the store to buy it for a change.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed with how sticky this is.  I used just a small amount on my arms &amp; hands.  I like how lite it feels going on, however the initial stickiness did not go away.  I ended up washing it off after 30 min.  I have used many Eurcerin products, so I was really surprised how much I don&#x27;t like this one.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion. Doesn&#x27;t go on greasy, absorbs quickly, but best of all it has staying power, which makes it a great product -- and economical. Have been using it for several years now. Please don&#x27;t change the formula. It&#x27;s perfect the way it is!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit, I&#x27;ve actually never been the type of person that applies lotion religiously.  I&#x27;ve never liked how greasy it is and it was easy to \\&quot;forget\\&quot;.  Looking back on it, it&#x27;s actually a very strange thing for me to skip because I AM one of those people that pay top dollar for high end face care and have a regimen that includes at least 7 different bottles and potions.  Why have I neglected everything from my neck down?  Beats me.  But I can tell you that it&#x27;s finally catching up with me.  The skin on my shins looks like scales.  It&#x27;s gross.  After using this formula for about 3 weeks now, I&#x27;ve noticed a marked improvement in the texture and look of my skin.  I love that it&#x27;s fast-absorbing and non-greasy.  I apply it once in the morning after my shower and it lasts all day without feeling too heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend prefers to use this on his face over my \\&quot;fancy schmancy\\&quot; $70 face lotions that I buy for him.  Go figure.</li>
            <li> love this lotion! it is easy to rub in and keeps skin moist.  It is the best for dry skin</li>
            <li> This is the one I  ordered for mom. She loves it! I  ordered  a  much smaller version butt wish I  ordered the large one like mom&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> The pump was broken when it arrived. Seems shipping knew it was broken because they wrapped plastic around the pump to keep it from leaking all over the packaging. Not worth the cost to return. I had to transfer the lotion to another container?</li>
            <li> Eucerin quit making this lotion, which is unfortunate because it worked wonderfully.  I haven&#x27;t tried their new replacement products to see what might be comparable, but I&#x27;ve read the reviews and it seems that the reworked formula is more greasy.</li>
            <li> Smoothing Essentials was a great lotion - light, non-greasy, but still very, very effective at keeping dry skin at bay, even in the winter months. It was all in all a great product - absolutely worth the money. However, what I received when I placed this order is a new replacement product Eucerin has released called Smoothing Repair, and it&#x27;s not nearly as good as the old formula. It&#x27;s a much heavier lotion, and doesn&#x27;t absorb cleanly. It leaves a slightly sticky film on the skin. Please note the product listing hasn&#x27;t been updated with the new product information, so if you order this you&#x27;ll receive the new Smoothing Repair formula.</li>
            <li> Everyone in the house has a bottle of their own and there is one kept in the open that is used all of the time.  I only use a half pump for my hands or it&#x27;s way too much.  it is super thick and very moisturizing.  EVERYONE in our house loves this lotion.  It&#x27;s less than 8.00 on subscribe and save.  Can&#x27;t beat the price or the quality.  A full pump is probably too much for most hands.</li>
            <li> Generally a little greasy but for winter, I&#x27;ll take it since it really does seem to make my skin better</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Eucerin lotion of all the ones I&#x27;ve tried.  I can tell that it absorbs well because my hands do not feel slimy if I wash them after applying the lotion.  It is unscented and makes my skin feel soft and moisturized.  I can&#x27;t imagine ever being without a bottle of this lotion ever again!  I use it daily!</li>
            <li> My&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;skin has never been so soft!</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and decided to give it a try. Maybe I will get the same bottle as it showed on the listing. The lotion just came and I opened it. No luck, it was not what the picture showed. Although the lotion is still a good choice because it&#x27;s not that greasy and it did absorb quickly, I hope the seller can change the picture to what they sell. So many customers come for the old good ones but they ended up getting the new formula lotion.  It doesn&#x27;t sound very right, isn&#x27;t it?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week now and have had wonderful results with it. I&#x27;m in my later 40&#x27;s and it seems that the older I get the more I&#x27;m prone I am to dry skin build-up. In my 20&#x27;s I would not have been able to use this lotion but I would say that now it&#x27;s just what I need. Its a little heavy but not bad. You could use it at night and use something lighter during the day. I normally have sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve had no issues with this cream so far. In the past, I couldn&#x27;t wear Eucerin because it was too heavy for me and seemed to clog my pores but now having tried this cream it seems to be doing a wonderful job at exfoliating and moisturizing my skin at the same time. I think this is just what I need for my skin at my age. If you think this describes your skin then I would definitely try this product. Someone mentioned Amylactin on one of the reviews but I can&#x27;t use that product because I have sensitivities to it. This Eucerin product, for me, is perfect with no skin reactions.</li>
            <li> For some reason, this lotion just sits on my skin and gets sticky...doesn&#x27;t absorb. It&#x27;s rich and moisturizing, but not worth it if there&#x27;s no absorption. I&#x27;m a big Eucerin user (Calming cream, hand repair, facial cleanser) &amp; thought it would be perfect for my dry, sensitive skin. I&#x27;ll stick to the Calming cream - highly recommend that for itchy skin or post-shave soothing.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for dry skin. I am currently deployed and the sand and wind was ruining my skin. 2 days later this healed it!</li>
            <li> Most Eucerin products have proved to be of top quality. Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Great product as i spect</li>
            <li> Acts as a mild exfoliant, seems to promote healing, and eliminates rough skin. Has a pleasant scent, and works best after shower or bath.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, item as described.</li>
            <li> Eucerin is the best, of course. I use it on my daughter&#x27;s dry (eczema prone) skin and on mine.  Love</li>
            <li> This is the only thing I have found that works for my dry sensitive skin.  Less expensive through Amazon</li>
            <li> I bought it for my KP. I have use it just a couple of days havent see the difference about it but im amaze with it. I had very dry skin but it has moisturize my skin a lot, i also suffer of cracked heels and oh myyy it has make wonders in just 4 days. Highly recommend! Think im loving these one more than udderly smooth!</li>
            <li> family loves this stuff!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist turned me on to this. It is fantastic on dry skin.</li>
            <li> Veery pleased with Eucerin lotion.  Skin feels smoother and more moisturized.  I apply morning before  makeup and the evening before retiring.  Cost is very good.  Much better than previous moisturizers I have used.</li>
            <li> This heavy duty lotion is my favorite and I have used it for years. I apply it daily all over after my shower and it gives all day and all night protection for super dry skin. I&#x27;ve even used it on my face when I ran out of my Eucerin face cream.</li>
            <li> My German Shep cannot get enough of it. He throws it kicks it and chases it. Lol. I will be buying him one for outside also because I don&#x27;t let him bring toys back and forth from inside to outside.</li>
            <li> Love it. It does the job that it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I have a chronic life-threatening condition that causes both a lack of circulation and my leg to swell. My skin is very sensitive all the time and very dry if I&#x27;m not vigilant. Medical professionals always mention Eucerin so I tried this... why is it so sticky? With its unpleasant odor I&#x27;m not sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead I began using nutritional shakes like Vegansmart, the skin on my entire body was noticeably healthier within a few weeks. Now when I take a shower water beads on my skin like a freshly waxed vehicle. My leg still has a degree of dry skin issues so now I use coconut oil, it was vastly improved with a few days! Several days a week I also spray on magnesium oil a few hours prior to my shower. I started doing this after I accidentally noticed the dry scaly skin patch on my leg glowed super bright white when I was playing with a pocket uv flashlight.... the scale skin was a fungal infection that Eucerin allowed to grow unchecked! My doctor prescribed an antifungal cream that barely halted the fungus, once I started spraying it with mag oil the bright white patch vanished within days (I kept checking with the uv light), the scaly texture resolved within a week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These 3 simple changes have resolved my dry scaly skin issues entirely and is far more pleasant overall!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eucerin lists the ingredients as Ingredients : Water, glycerin, urea, cetearyl alcohol, glyceryl glucoside, cyclomethicone, sodium lactate, butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter, caprylic/capric triglyceride, methylpropanediol, octyldodecanol, dicaprylyl ether, tapioca starch, glyceryl stearate SE, hydrogenated coco-glycerides, arginine HCL, sodium PCA, dimethiconol, lactic acid, chondrus crispus (carrageenan), carnitine, ceramide 3, mannitol, serine, sucrose, citrulline, glycogen, histidine HCL, sodium chloride, sodium cetearyl sulfate... it&#x27;s just too many chemicals that I do not want to be absorbed into my already overloaded lymphatic system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, use coconut oil instead of Eucerin.</li>
            <li> My daughter and husband both suffer from peeling skin on their feet that according to the dermatologist is eczema.  She recommended looking for a lotion with alpha hydroxy or urea.  This one has both so it seems to work the best at clearing it up.  My daughter tends to stop using the lotion when it&#x27;s better, then it comes back again.  It&#x27;s not a permanant cure, but works great to clear it up.</li>
            <li> I have VERY dry hands and this works great to help smooth and soften them.  I use a little bit about 3-4 times a day, it lasts forever and really helps my dry skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine as a basic skin cream. I use this primarily on my face and it is not greasy or overly shiny, but I still prefer the Eucerin Plus Smoothing Essentials.</li>
            <li> I have naturally oily skin, so I occasionally become lazy with my body moisturizer routine. My neglect becomes apparent after a series of dry, frigid days. Within 24 hours of applying this lotion, my skin feels silky and smooth again, especially skin that isn&#x27;t as prone to flaking, such as thighs, and torso. Used consistently, this cream also keeps keratosis pilaris (little bumps that can appear on my forearms and upper thighs in winter) at bay. I don&#x27;t see AHA in my ingredient list, but the third ingredient, urea, is used in creams to heal cracked skin, such as [[ASIN:B00N3W70L4 O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Working Hands &amp; Healthy Feet]]. If I&#x27;ve neglected my skin for so long that it becomes chafed, the first application of Smoothing Skin Repair will sting a little but only the first time. My husband uses this lotion in the winter, when he spends the entire season bushwhacking up mountains in snowshoes. He says it keeps his skin from itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the super-greasy Eucerin in the tub that my mother used (which felt like lard), the thick Smoothing Repair lotion sinks into my skin very quickly. I&#x27;d have to wait several minutes before pulling on stockings or tights, but I can immediately pull on socks or pants or a skirt without feeling like the lotion will stain the fabric. I use this lotion year round.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;* Opaque bottle keeps beneficial ingredients stable in the presence of light and air&lt;br /&gt;* Pump dispenser dispenses perfect amount and has never clogged (even after dropping bottle multiple times)&lt;br /&gt;* No discernible fragrance&lt;br /&gt;* Smooths away keratosis pilaris&lt;br /&gt;* Contains ceramides and antioxidants&lt;br /&gt;* Feels lightweight and absorbs quickly with a satin (non-greasy) finish&lt;br /&gt;* Contains beneficial humectants (glyceryl glucoside and shea butter, which doesn&#x27;t pill up in cold weather)&lt;br /&gt;* Helps skin retain moisture, even after a shower&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Amlactin from the pharmacy, but I don&#x27;t like the way it feels or performs as muchas the Eucerin Smoothing Repair. Plus the pharmacy suspends the milk acid in Lubriderm, which is too thin for my winter skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this lotion. Amazon has the best price, and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have a dry skin and it works really well.</li>
            <li> Best kind for super dry skin, sometimes it is very hard to find</li>
    </ol>
