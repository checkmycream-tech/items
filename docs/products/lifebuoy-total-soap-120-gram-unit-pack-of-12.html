            <li>Picture of young boy washing hands in a bucket on the wrapper was priceless</li>
            <li>My  favorite soap.</li>
            <li>Anyhow, this is the famous soap that was used to punish the protagonist in the movie</li>
            <li>it has more of a fruity smell.  </li>
            <li>10/2014.Will order some more when this is gone unless Leaver Bros. start to make it again.</li>
            <li>Thank you for your fast delivery!!!!</li>
            <li>I enjoy this soap and have ordered some more.</li>
            <li>and I am always looking for unique items to send her at Christmas.  </li>
            <li>Does not smell like the original Lifebuoy from ago</li>
            <li>I was reading on the discription that the carbolic acid was no longer in the original product.  </li>
            <li>It is not quite the original Lifebuoy</li>
            <li>As I recall it was the first commercially available men&#x27;s deodorant soap available</li>
            <li>Wonder if this is true??</li>
            <li>The all time classic favorite while growing up in The South.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s pretty!</li>
            <li>- it cleaned okay, rinsed off my skin well, and my skin hasn&#x27;t developed a rash or itching, so I&#x27;ll continue using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>WHAT I REMEMBER FROM YEARS PAST,  THIS SOAP HAS A UNIQUE FRAGRANCE, OF ITS OWN</li>
            <li>I remember using Lifebuoy Soap when I was in the Military in the early 1960s, it worked pretty good for some of the smelly Sailors on board ship and the Squadron.</li>
            <li>very disapointed.</li>
            <li>$2 per each bar means with reasonable cost...</li>
            <li>If you want real carbolic soap just like Lifebouy, type in Island Pride Carbolic Germicidal Soap</li>
            <li>I just got 12 BIG bars for $20.00 and free shipping.</li>
            <li>The real life buoy soap is made in cyprus.</li>
            <li>I am glad I found it again, as a 69 yr old it helps with dry skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think any soap made will be exactly like the old Lifebouy unless Leaver Bros. start to produce it again</li>
            <li>The soap really delivers a lasting scent that is pleasing and fresh</li>
            <li>This product is not 100% of the old Lifebouy but it is close!!</li>
            <li>This is phony Lifebuoy, Odor poor, consistency mushy,Nothing good about it.</li>
            <li>I have used the new Lifebouy.  </li>
            <li>She was very surprised.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin that tends to flake--not with Lifebuoy.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know why I can&#x27;t find this in the US anymore, but this was like finding an old friend!</li>
            <li>The odor does not linger as the old Lifebouy.</li>
            <li>Its just old school soap.</li>
            <li>I am also looking forward to trying some of the Carbolic Soap, I remember my Dad using that after cleaning fish back in New Jersey!</li>
            <li>Nice smell, and seems to last a while, but is not the Lifebuoy of old, alas.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Does not have the same smell that I remember years ago.  very disapointed.</li>
            <li> I remember using Lifebuoy Soap when I was in the Military in the early 1960s, it worked pretty good for some of the smelly Sailors on board ship and the Squadron. I am glad I found it again, as a 69 yr old it helps with dry skin.

            <li> Great product. wish you offered larger sizes...price $2 per each bar means with reasonable cost...&lt;br /&gt;have a great choice ...</li>
            <li> This is &amp;#34;the&amp;#34; soap.  Watch &amp;#34;A Christmas Story&amp;#34;  This was the one soap that Ralphy hated most of all.  The red bar of Lifebuoy.&lt;br /&gt;Used by people everywhere in the 50&#x27;s.  Was very happy to find it.  I have a sister that loves the movie and I am always looking for unique items to send her at Christmas.  This was the ultimate.  She was very surprised.</li>
            <li> My  favorite soap. I have very sensitive skin that tends to flake--not with Lifebuoy. Don&#x27;t know why I can&#x27;t find this in the US anymore, but this was like finding an old friend!</li>
            <li> I recommend this for your bathing line up in a rotation with Irish Spring and Coast or whatever your current favorites are.  It was a blast from the past, if you are old enough to remember when it was sold in North America.  Now I guess we have to have it imported from India.  Anyhow, this is the famous soap that was used to punish the protagonist in the movie \\&quot;A Christmas Story\\&quot; when he said a dirty word.  ( In his fantasy blindness insued causing his parents eternal regret for what they had done to their son).</li>
            <li> Does not smell like the original Lifebuoy from ago</li>
            <li> LIKE THE SOAP, BUT THE FRAGRANCE IS NOT WHAT I REMEMBER FROM YEARS PAST,  THIS SOAP HAS A UNIQUE FRAGRANCE, OF ITS OWN</li>
            <li> To Everyone, This is not like lifebouy! Lifebouy contained Carbolic Acid read the ingredients No carbolic acid. If you want real carbolic soap just like Lifebouy, type in Island Pride Carbolic Germicidal Soap and you can buy it. I just got 12 BIG bars for $20.00 and free shipping. It is just like the Lifebouy from the 1960&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> The real life buoy soap is made in cyprus. This Indian version is not the real life bouy  and will be very disappointing if you are looking for the real thing</li>
            <li> Left red dye everywhere. Next time get white.</li>
            <li> I grew up with Lifebouy.  I was alittle disappointed that it didn&#x27;t smell quite the same. I was reading on the discription that the carbolic acid was no longer in the original product.  I have used the new Lifebouy.  It&#x27;s antibactial.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> The all time classic favorite while growing up in The South. The soap really delivers a lasting scent that is pleasing and fresh</li>
            <li> Nice smell, and seems to last a while, but is not the Lifebuoy of old, alas.</li>
            <li> smell was terrible.not what expected.  thought i was buying the nsame soap i used in my youth.Picture of young boy washing hands in a bucket on the wrapper was priceless</li>
            <li> This ships from India. It is not quite the original Lifebuoy but I may order it again.</li>
            <li> I searched for carbolic acid soap and was directed to this product. When I got it I checked the ingredients. NO CARBOLIC ACID!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thoroughly dissatisfied with Amazon on this one.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like the Lifebuoy I remember - it has more of a fruity smell.  It has a different shape, too.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t look for copious amounts of lather - it has less than other soaps I&#x27;ve used.  And no amount of rinsing could get all of the soap&#x27;s color out of my white washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;BUT - it cleaned okay, rinsed off my skin well, and my skin hasn&#x27;t developed a rash or itching, so I&#x27;ll continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;(I bought the 12-pack, and I have eleven bars to go.)  Would I buy it again?  Probably not - I&#x27;ll probably try the Carbolic soap next.</li>
            <li> This is phony Lifebuoy, Odor poor, consistency mushy,Nothing good about it. I am donating the rest to Good will. I hope they will take it.</li>
            <li> This product is not 100% of the old Lifebouy but it is close!! Leaver Bros. stopped making this soap years ago. Why? I don&#x27;t know, but this is close. The odor does not linger as the old Lifebouy. I don&#x27;t think any soap made will be exactly like the old Lifebouy unless Leaver Bros. start to produce it again but, this is close!! I enjoy this soap and have ordered some more. Thank you for your fast delivery!!!! ANOTHER ORDER THIS MONTH 10/2014.Will order some more when this is gone unless Leaver Bros. start to make it again. I understand that, in South Africa, you can buy Lifebouy every where!!! Wonder if this is true?? Wonder who makes it in South Africa??</li>
            <li> Its just old school soap. Lathers and cleans.</li>
            <li> Lifebuoy soap is a product from my youth. As I recall it was the first commercially available men&#x27;s deodorant soap available so I was trying to recreate a slice of my past with this product.  Soap smells very similar to the Lifebuoy I remember, but the shape of the bar seems somewhat different. Price at $2 per bar seems a little high, but I guess you have to pay for nostalgia. Shipping was prompt.</li>
            <li> They must have cut out the carbolic acid so it does not feel or smell at all the same. but it&#x27;s pretty!</li>
            <li> Skin fills good after a shower. Leave you smelling great and with a very clean sensation.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great product. wish you offered larger sizes.  Cannot find this product in stores. Is there a problem with that. Thankyou</li>
            <li> Good bath soap @ good price and a convenient purchase. I&#x27;ll definitely restock.</li>
    </ol>
