            <li> I have been using this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> Its affordable and lasts a LONG time!</li>
            <li> I put it on on dry hair</li>
            <li> I had the impression that it was used and not new by its appearance.  </li>
            <li> This is the only product to tame my hair.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I sit under a hooded dryer and other times</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I was having a problem with my hair due to medications.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t make look greasy like other products</li>
            <li> A hidden gym.</li>
            <li> umn, odd but . . .</li>
            <li> If you have extremely damaged, dry, dull, breaking, weak hair</li>
            <li> girl\\&quot; i DECIDED no more RELAXERS.</li>
            <li> There is nothing negative about this treatment.</li>
            <li> Plus my hair stays well hydrated for at least a week.</li>
            <li> It is thick and coats the hair.</li>
            <li> No more greasy hair days for me!</li>
            <li> After reading the previous reviews I was hoping for quite a bit, unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work as well on my hair as on others.  </li>
            <li> And I was very disappointed that mineral oil was one of the first ingredients</li>
            <li> It is my secret to stretching my relaxers.</li>
            <li> Makes it really soft and manageable, and doesn&#x27;t have a gosh awful smell.</li>
            <li> The shipping cost is expensive.</li>
            <li> The ingredients listed on amazon.com are wrong.  </li>
            <li> My hair isnt bad and all my life I was led to believe I had bad hair.</li>
            <li> If you are hesitant to purchase this conditioner because its made with snail slime, but trust me, you will not be disappointed.</li>

Anywho, everywhere I&#x27;ve gone everyone wants to pass a relaxer on my curly slash poofy soft amazingly soft not tangled hair. I was like forget that! At the age of 22 \\&quot;April 22nd,2013 whoo whoo bday girl\\&quot; i DECIDED no more RELAXERS. My hair isnt bad and all my life I was led to believe I had bad hair. There is no such thing. I came across this product at CVS and that was last month. Let me just say my hair never passed shoulder length mmh hmm never! Relaxers were killing it. I began using this and the collagen in it, vitamins and everything has made my hair thrive!!!! I can pass my fingers through it and I stopped shampooing I co-wash now. My hair would turn into a cute poofy curly afro but itd hit my shoulders not a ball afro. And after this!!! My hair is tamed, it falls gently on my shoulder and dry feels amazing my boyfriend loves my hair! This is the only product to tame my hair. Me encant esta baina!!! I love this s*** it gets the job done. For once I can tame my hair and I get compliments on the new growth being so soft and shiny, little by little I&#x27;ll reach my mid waist length using this product and taking my biotin pills daily with lots of water, 10,000mcg lol(2 years):) This is helping tremendously, I won&#x27;t let another product TOUCH my hair besides Baba de caracol. It is that goooood stuff ya tu sabes you already know lol.</li>
            <li> I just used this deep conditioner. It is thick and coats the hair. I went under the dryer for 20 minutes with a cap. Made my hair silky and moisturized. I used the baba de caracol rinse after, and that made my hair supple, and moist. I love the way my hair feels. Great price and quality results.</li>
            <li> I. LOVE. THIS. PRODUCT!!!!!!!!! I&#x27;m a huge fan of Dominican hair products and this has been the best dc I&#x27;ve used so far. My hair is as soft as it&#x27;s ever been. Has a strong but pleasant fragrance and is a thick consistency. I recommend this for people with course hair like mine.</li>
            <li> This product is great! I saw people mention this on an online hair forum so I decided to try it. I have african american relaxed and color treated hair. The smell is fantastic and it left my hair smooth and soft. This is great if your like me and want to stretch your relaxer. Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> This intensive treatment it is amazing, my hair is so soft, it is unbelievable, it even stopped my hair loss I am very gratefull to my friend that recommended this product to me. It is the best</li>
            <li> I have used this product only twice since buying it. BOTH times I have used it after my hair has been relaxed for some months (so thats, kinky roots, straight ends&#x3D; disaster!) But this time...with this product, conditioning my hair and then COMBING it afterwards was a breeze!  I like the smell a lot! Made it very smooth and manageable and that not easy for me! (I have waist length relaxed hair).  Sooo I recommend this product to all the brown girls with unruly hair...give it a try. (I left mine in for 45 mins though, with a plastic cap on) I do believe that going under the dryer with the product in would make it evern BETTER!</li>
            <li> My relaxed mid-back length hair needs all the moisture and strength that it can get---Which is EXACTLY would Baba de Caracol provides. I saturate my hair with Baba de Caracol once a week then cover with a plastic cap for 20-30 minutes. Sometimes I sit under a hooded dryer and other times I just let the heat from my scalp do the pentrating. Either way, when I rinse this conditioner out...MARVELOSO is all that I can say. Soft, silky, and a great scent. If you are hesitant to purchase this conditioner because its made with snail slime, but trust me, you will not be disappointed. Latinas y Morenas this is PERFECTO for your curls!</li>
            <li> My go to conditioner for my ethnic hair. A hidden gym. Don&#x27;t discount it. Makes my hair silky, manageable, smooth and moisturized. Love Love Love</li>
            <li> I was looking for snail cream and thought I buying cream for the face. What I bought was something I didnt need-conditioner for the hair. This is not specified in the title Description</li>
            <li> ok, good product, good price, I recommend</li>
            <li> I know the ingredients sound a bit . . . umn, odd but . . . This is a deep conditioner best for coarse or curly, thick, damaged or dry hair. And it works wonders trust me! I will only use Dominican products on my mane (I am Puerto Rican) and have tried many but this particular product is excellent, one of the best.  Because it&#x27;s a protein rich deep treatment, I use it at night once per week on my coarse curls, followed by the rinse, braid and sleep; when I take out my braids the next morning my hair is sooo shiny and soft! Just amazing, whether you use it with heat (under dryer) or without. I highly recommend this product for Latina&#x27;s, mixed and African American hair types.</li>
            <li> This Conditioner Smells Great! It Works awesome! Great to use for extreme conditioning!. I have also used it on dry hair as a leave in just because it smells so great!</li>
            <li> I have very think, very coarse &amp; wavy hair. Having been someone who has changed my hair color practically monthly for nearly 30 years, my curiosity got the best of me with this product. I am so glad it did! This product has been the single most helpful tool to help get my hair back in the best condition as well as completely change the texture of it. When people ask me what I use now, I am happy to direct them to the product and site. After reading several reviews, it definitely seems to work best for coarse, curly, and certain types of ethnic hair. While I am caucasian,I have difficulties often found with certain ethnic hair types. I am sincerely glad that I have stumbled on this product. I have never been happier with my hair!</li>
            <li> Halka Baba de Caracol Intensive Treatment is in my top 5 best Dominican treatments of all times. There is nothing negative about this treatment. If you have extremely damaged, dry, dull, breaking, weak hair this the best Dominican treatment for you. It&#x27;s affordable, but, its best to purchase the largest size. You get a better deal for the money. The shipping cost is expensive. I get mine from the local beauty supply store. If they don&#x27;t sell it in your neighborhood, order it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it once to 2x a week. It depends on how damaged your hair is. I place it on my hair, put a plastic cap on my hair, and sit under a heating cap for 15 min. My hair comes out sooo silky. I use it as a deep penetrating conditioner and treatment. Its also better if you use it with the shampoo and rinse and leave-in. the entire Halka Baba de Caracol line is great for all types of hair that is in need of help with dry, damaged, breaking, weak-fragile hair. I luv luv Dominican hair care products. Any type of hair can benefit from such rich fantastic products. This product gives you hair a high end results every time. I wish Dominican hair care products were sold everywhere like cvs, walgreens target walmart. It would out sell all the shampoos and conditioners on the market at a much cheaper price. This product works better than all the products they sell in all the drug stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you try this treatment it will become your staple product. I stock up on this item along with the shampoo, rinse, leave-in.</li>
            <li> I like the improvement to my hair thanks to this product and will buy more.my hair was damaged and i wear a natural, it&#x27;s very soft, smells good and is healthy again.</li>
            <li> This condition leaves my hair silky smooth after washing my hair. It has a nice smell to it as well.</li>
            <li> I have tried this product before by purchasing it at a local Dominican hair salon.  The product leaked and was not sealed properly.  I had the impression that it was used and not new by its appearance.  I won&#x27;t order this again but will stick with the salon.</li>
            <li> best product for my hair, looks young and healthy and feels great, I use once a week, and have even bought as gifts</li>
            <li> I am Puerto Rican/Panamenen mix {mother had the coarser hair} We use a lot of Dominican hair products in PR. This one is like others depending on needs. I am like a Lab Rat when it comes to hair products. Never post anything about them but this is a good one. I stopped relaxing my hair about 11/2 years ago. This is great for dry hair helps grow stay with it you will see everything takes time.</li>
            <li> This can&#x27;t telling the different between the Intensive treatment and conditioner for the my hair.  This product should be combine with the intensive treatment,</li>
            <li> I have medium length relaxed hair and I must say I walked past this product in the store one day and read that it was an intense treatment and knew right off the back that it would be good for my hair! I love the smell and the way it leaves my hair feeling after sitting under the dryer for 30-45 mins. Its affordable and lasts a LONG time! a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I am a black woman with fine 4a hair. My hair is generally really soft, so when people comment about how soft a product left their hair, I&#x27;m like &amp;#34;Yeah, whatever. I don&#x27;t care.&amp;#34; But can I tell you low lustrous and silky this leaves my hair!? I can feel it working immediately and it has great slip. Plus my hair stays well hydrated for at least a week. I don&#x27;t even have to moisturize and seal mid-week.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you how much I love this product. I&#x27;ve only used this once but I have to say that it left my hair feeling extremely soft and silky. Even after 6 days my hair still feels like I washed it yesterday. No more greasy hair days for me! This will be a staple in my hair regimen!  After shampooing, I put this in my hair, detangled, put a plastic cap on and sat under the dryer for 20 minutes, let my hair cool for another 10 minutes before washing it out. I am one satisfied customer! Can&#x27;t wait to use it again!!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE! Soft shiny hair that looks incredibly healthy! Works better if left on for 15-20 min with some heat but is still amazing used as a conditioner!</li>
            <li> This one pf my favorite conditioners.  It is my secret to stretching my relaxers.</li>
            <li> I was having a problem with my hair due to medications. My hair which is normally fine was falling out and became very frizzy. I used this product only, no shampoo, nothing else, once a week. I do not have oily hair so that was not an issue. My hair at age 56 is gorgeous and I always get compliments, and I always direct them to this product.</li>
            <li> I use this as a leave in conditioner. I really like how this product gives my hair pronounced curves when I leave my hair natural.</li>
            <li> This is a nice conditioner.  I use it 3-4 times per week.  My skin and hair seems to really love the snail extract products.</li>
            <li> works really good my hair is not as frizzy and really shiny.  I put it on on dry hair and it doesn&#x27;t make look greasy like other products</li>
            <li> After reading the previous reviews I was hoping for quite a bit, unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work as well on my hair as on others.  And I was very disappointed that mineral oil was one of the first ingredients but that&#x27;s my fault for not reading the description better.  I tossed this and tried pure avocado oil instead and that works great, brings out the curl in my hair and made frizzies almost non-existent even in damp weather.</li>
            <li> Best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  Amazing on my natural hair.  Makes it really soft and manageable, and doesn&#x27;t have a gosh awful smell.</li>
            <li> I think this product smell excellent. I don&#x27;t think its amazing. I had heard so many great reviews. I use it as a deep conditioner (no heat). It doesn&#x27;t do wonders for my hair. I have used other products with better results. I will finish my bottle out but I won&#x27;t purchase again. I have 4a/b hair just to let you know,</li>
            <li> I leaves your hair soft</li>
            <li> I love the quantity and price and the shipping was super fast! The quality is not the best but it matces the price.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a long time. Sometimes I just apply this product to my hair rinse it out and style my hair.  It makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> The ingredients listed on amazon.com are wrong.  Mineral oil is one of the top ingredients, and &#x27;snail slime&#x27; is not mentioned at all in the ingredient list.  I bought this because of the review on a natural hair website.  If I had known about the mineral oil, I would have purchased something else.  Two stars because it is an okay conditioner.</li>
