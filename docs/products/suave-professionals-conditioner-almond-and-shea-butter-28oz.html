            <li>I might even use a pea-size amount of the conditioner as a &amp;#34;leave in&amp;#34; on the parched areas of my hair (very effective) and use a bit of coconut oil, Moroccan oil, or serum of my choice just on the ends.</li>

            <li>This is a great product for a really cheap price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved Suave and now it&#x27;s even better.  </li>
            <li>It does leave my hair in great shape, though, and it rinses clean.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner is fine for most people and for the price, a great deal.</li>

            <li>Love this suave shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Great product, thanks.</li>
            <li>Emerging greys are now an enjoyable evolution...</li>
            <li>WAAYYY better than pantene co wash which i will never buy again.</li>
            <li>I bought this product at Walmart at the results are phenomenal.</li>
            <li>Even though the formula was changed for Nexus, I still believe it provides better shampoo and condition.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner makes my hair silky smooth for a fraction of the price of salon brands!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It leaves my hair very smooth and light.</li>
            <li>The scent is very nice and makes my shower smell like a professional salon.  </li>
            <li>Plus its super cheap!</li>
            <li>This is a HUGE bottle.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>What I enjoyed equally more is how much I savored the scent of this</li>
            <li>The scent is light and not at all overpowering and my hair feels clean and lightweight after washing.  </li>
            <li>This is a great value for the price; it has a great textured feel; make my hair manageable; my scalp doesn&#x27;t feel dry and it controls dandruff until my next washing session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Suave, it has been a long time, welcome</li>
            <li>Hair feels soft and silky using subscribe &amp; save makes the savings even  better!</li>
            <li>This almond and shea butter conditioner really gives my hair a healthy shine.</li>
            <li>An agreeable scent is another &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; for me: the scent of this is very clean/warm/nurturing/light ...totally enjoyable.</li>
            <li>E or Sweet Almond Oil (for scent)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>another wonderfully affordable conditioner that leaves natural african hair soft, smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li>So this is my new favorite cheapy conditioner..</li>
            <li>Great conditioner, beautiful scent but not too much, works just as much as those expensive</li>
            <li>My hair tends to be a bit softer than most and Suave products failed to even make my hair feel its absolute best.</li>
            <li>I honestly, was pleasantly surprised how soft this felt while massaging into the roots; it felt great-so good that I rinsed and re-applied a second time.</li>
            <li>Oil, mixture (With coconut water and fresh lemon juice)&lt;br</li>
            <li>the comb went right through it</li>
            <li>The shampoo is also sulfate free and I live by both of them.</li>
            <li>The smell is great and makes my hair soft (as long as I don&#x27;t rinse too much of the conditioner out).</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t use it very much.</li>
            <li>I like it so much that I have a subscription for this product so that I never have to run out!</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t even gotten through the first one yet.</li>
            <li>My whole family likes it!</li>
            <li>I first bought this conditioner and shampoo in BJ&#x27;s but they stopped carrying it.</li>
            <li>I compared results and ingredients with many higher priced products and have found this to be equal to any.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m liking it quite a lot, actually :-).</li>
            <li>So far my results with the grey and lightened hair are GOOD...</li>
            <li>, the trick obviously is not to attempt this while showering, but in replace of washing ones hair during normal shower time; the better and more practical solution would be to wash ones hair in the sink; this is something I live by and think how much everyone could contribute to the environment; as well as the planet</li>
            <li>Most products make my hair flat and greasy looking or dry/frizzy.</li>
            <li>Love the size too - lasts long.</li>
            <li>The scent was strong enough that I could smell</li>
            <li>/&gt;These two statements alone touched my heart today; to know there are companies in Corporate America that does seem to give-a-damn and because of that, I have a new outlook and appreciation of Suave and its subsidiaries; a very special thank you, from me</li>
            <li>I also got way too much of it.</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable .too.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This conditioner left my hair very shiny and smoother than other conditioners , my hair feels good and.</li>
            <li>Great price for this price, I go between Suave and Lush (expensive hair products), and my hair stays clean when I use Suave still.</li>
            <li>This product is ideal for anyone who suffers from dry, damaged hair and wants more vitality and luster to one’s hair.</li>
            <li>Not bad, especially for the price, but it is very watery.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is amazing, it makes my hair soft and shiny without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>yes, I do practice this very important cause; I did not know the exact numbers and how much I was saving in doing this one, simple remedy; a ten year old (Miss Elizabeth)taught me how to recycle and</li>
            <li>with using any new products, I always only use just that product alone; making certain not to combine any additional products, which actually can cause more damage due to mixing of too many ingredients; and with any new product, I highly recommend giving it one-two weeks, before truly accepting or rejecting it as insignificant.</li>
            <li>and when I went back to the hair dresser last week, she praised the healthy appearance of my hair.</li>
            <li>I particularly like to use this after I&#x27;ve done an overnight hot coconut oil treatment on the lower two-thirds of my hair...and the section of grey hair that is is slowly becoming a &amp;#34;Bonnie Raitt&amp;#34; style streak off my left temple</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>/looks better with a little TLC.</li>
            <li>Nice smell, but it is hard to get off of my hair when I try to rinse it out</li>
            <li>Yeah: as far as I&#x27;m concerned...the over-priced &amp;#34;high-end&amp;#34; products are getting a real &amp;#34;run for the money&amp;#34; with this stuff.</li>
            <li>This ocnditoner made my hair instantly soft and manageable which helped me so much with detangling it..</li>
            <li>I think the quality is just as good as other more expensive shampoos.</li>
            <li>I am of mixed race, with extremely curly hair, and was looking for a good conditioner to use until I could run across town to purchase my regular botanical conditioner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything from super cheap V05 to super expensive Paul Mitchell products and couldn&#x27;t find anything that worked.</li>
            <li>Have to wash my hair a little more than when I use Lush but for the price, cant beat it.</li>
            <li>you know that, depending on where you live, your family could save up to $100 and 3,200 gallons of water per year by turning off the water when you shampoo and condition.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has been a couple of years since I&#x27;ve tried another Suave product, but I was enticed with their claim on this particular product having, &amp;#34;100% natural Almond-Shea Butter.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells decent and leaves my hair somewhat soft.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner makes my hair makes my hair feel very soft and silky.</li>
            <li>The members of our household have been trying to get back to natural products that really work for us.</li>
            <li>well; store in a clear plastic container; refrigerate overnight; wear a plastic cap for (15-20 minutes); rinse well.</li>
            <li>NEVER HAS MY HAIR LOOKED THIS SOFT AND SCRUMPTIOUS</li>
            <li>Would recommend for anyone including those with sensitive skin, like myself.</li>
            <li>Personally I think it works better than much more expensive products!</li>
            <li>I think this and some of the other suave products are a breath of fresh air.</li>
            <li>the colored grey strands now look like very believable blonde highlights: but the texture of the grey hair is slightly coarser and dryer than the rest of my hair...and behaves</li>
            <li>/&gt;It had a strong scent of coconut; something, I honestly, do not get from a lot of products, which claim to have something that resemblance of the island tropics.</li>
            <li>they put it in such small print; I almost missed it myself; and the reality is, the majority of the people, will most likely disregard it also, but hey, that&#x27;s why you have me:&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This will leave your hair feeling soft and looking healthy without hidden dyes and harsh chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I hope Suave never stops making this particular shampoo and conditioner: I plan to be a life-long devotee as long as they continue to produce it.</li>
            <li>; I had to be certain this was actually a Suave professionals product; it baffled my mind that such a low cost conditioner could feel this</li>
            <li>but I have a few consistent &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; products that I like to always have on hand...and Suave almond/shea butter shampoo and conditioner are among my favorites.</li>
            <li>People of color only need to wash our hair only once; maybe two days a week;  using any one particular shampoo or conditioning treatment approximately 3-4 washing cycles in order to fully, achieve whatever, the final results we want for our hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suave Professions Moisturizing Conditioner with Almond and Shea Butter actually surpassed my expectations from the very first wash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent hundreds of dollars on expensive ones and my hair has never looked or felt better than with using this Suave!</li>

            <li> This ocnditoner made my hair instantly soft and manageable which helped me so much with detangling it..</li>
            <li> I think the quality is just as good as other more expensive shampoos.</li>
            <li> I am of mixed race, with extremely curly hair, and was looking for a good conditioner to use until I could run across town to purchase my regular botanical conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything from super cheap V05 to super expensive Paul Mitchell products and couldn&#x27;t find anything that worked.</li>
            <li> Have to wash my hair a little more than when I use Lush but for the price, cant beat it.</li>
            <li> you know that, depending on where you live, your family could save up to $100 and 3,200 gallons of water per year by turning off the water when you shampoo and condition.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has been a couple of years since I&#x27;ve tried another Suave product, but I was enticed with their claim on this particular product having, &amp;#34;100% natural Almond-Shea Butter.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells decent and leaves my hair somewhat soft.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner makes my hair makes my hair feel very soft and silky.</li>
            <li> The members of our household have been trying to get back to natural products that really work for us.</li>
            <li> well; store in a clear plastic container; refrigerate overnight; wear a plastic cap for (15-20 minutes); rinse well.</li>
            <li> NEVER HAS MY HAIR LOOKED THIS SOFT AND SCRUMPTIOUS</li>
            <li> Would recommend for anyone including those with sensitive skin, like myself.</li>
            <li> Personally I think it works better than much more expensive products!</li>
            <li> I think this and some of the other suave products are a breath of fresh air.</li>
            <li> the colored grey strands now look like very believable blonde highlights: but the texture of the grey hair is slightly coarser and dryer than the rest of my hair...and behaves</li>
            <li> /&gt;It had a strong scent of coconut; something, I honestly, do not get from a lot of products, which claim to have something that resemblance of the island tropics.</li>
            <li> they put it in such small print; I almost missed it myself; and the reality is, the majority of the people, will most likely disregard it also, but hey, that&#x27;s why you have me:&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This will leave your hair feeling soft and looking healthy without hidden dyes and harsh chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hope Suave never stops making this particular shampoo and conditioner: I plan to be a life-long devotee as long as they continue to produce it.</li>
            <li> ; I had to be certain this was actually a Suave professionals product; it baffled my mind that such a low cost conditioner could feel this</li>
            <li> but I have a few consistent &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; products that I like to always have on hand...and Suave almond/shea butter shampoo and conditioner are among my favorites.</li>
            <li> People of color only need to wash our hair only once; maybe two days a week;  using any one particular shampoo or conditioning treatment approximately 3-4 washing cycles in order to fully, achieve whatever, the final results we want for our hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suave Professions Moisturizing Conditioner with Almond and Shea Butter actually surpassed my expectations from the very first wash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent hundreds of dollars on expensive ones and my hair has never looked or felt better than with using this Suave!</li>
            <li> simply prefer to buy products that are all natural; brand names tend to make claims, their products contain better enhancing ingredients, such as this one with combining ‘Shea butter and almond’ but quite often they fail long-term consistency one expects; due in short, they continue to keep a lot of the junk that is associated with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m cheating the sparse new greys I&#x27;m getting now with slightly lighter hair coloring...</li>
            <li> but the bottle is large for small hands.</li>
            <li> I generally don&#x27;t care which brand of shampoo/conditioner that I purchase - I usually just buy whatever is cheapest/on sale but the Suave professional line has caught my attention.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair so soft and smooth, it&#x27;s crazy.</li>
            <li> I bought this in the store and I was skeptical because most conditioners didnt work well with my hair,which is partially course..</li>
            <li> its very light and not thick- hate those kinds of conditioners...</li>
            <li> It gave my hair a dry, flat feeling;</li>
            <li> I never have any split ends in my long layers.</li>
            <li> Wanting to give it one more chance in hopes that the bad results came from underuse on my part, I had the same experience.</li>
            <li> absolutely, no body and</li>
            <li> Btw I&#x27;m African American with thick hair.</li>
            <li> (I mean, it&#x27;s obviously not, at 3.00 $)...</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick, long hair</li>
            <li> Got this with the shampoo for a little over $5.</li>
            <li> I tend to have quite a few shampoo and conditioner products in my &amp;#34;rotation&amp;#34; at all times...</li>
            <li> this was one of her everyday rants and demands she made upon me, whenever, she would visit my home.&lt;br</li>
            <li> only purchase this shampoo because it is the less expensive shampoo out</li>
            <li> this was not your usual, ordinary, bottle of conditioner, but not too overpowering either that it irritated my senses.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve stopped using Suave shampoos and conditioners in the past as their product in essence; did not seem to meet my expectations for anyone with thick or course textured- type hair.</li>
            <li> Before trying this product, I was using Nexxus brand conditioner, which is at least 5 times the price.</li>
            <li> I actually prefer the mint and rosemary scent, but this one isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> if I didn’t make reference of this one marketing statement I read; it&#x27;s too bad</li>
            <li> instead of an awkward transition!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love the smell it leaves in my girls hair and they love the conditioner.  Great price but the bottle is large for small hands.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> The members of our household have been trying to get back to natural products that really work for us. I have been using this for about a month and when I went back to the hair dresser last week, she praised the healthy appearance of my hair. This almond and shea butter conditioner really gives my hair a healthy shine. The price is perfect too! I like it so much that I have a subscription for this product so that I never have to run out!</li>
            <li> Nice smell, but it is hard to get off of my hair when I try to rinse it out so I don&#x27;t use it very much. I also got way too much of it. I got three bottles and I haven&#x27;t even gotten through the first one yet.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It works wonders with my hair. I can&#x27;t even imagine using anything else. Great great product!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Great conditioner, great price. Makes my hair look, feel &amp; smell totally awesome. For the price, I will keep buying it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a student  and decided to give this brand a try. The smell is great and makes my hair soft (as long as I don&#x27;t rinse too much of the conditioner out). I&#x27;m definetly buying this again.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner, beautiful scent but not too much, works just as much as those expensive ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my hair very smooth and light. My whole family likes it! Will recommend anyone to buy it.</li>
            <li> I generally don&#x27;t care which brand of shampoo/conditioner that I purchase - I usually just buy whatever is cheapest/on sale but the Suave professional line has caught my attention. I am also a fan of their peppermint shampoo. I really enjoy the smell of this product and it leaves my hair very smooth and shiny!</li>
            <li> Save yourself a lot of money and buy this Suave conditioner. I assure you that it works just as well as Aveda.</li>
            <li> Got this with the shampoo for a little over $5. Amazing! I&#x27;ve spent hundreds of dollars on expensive ones and my hair has never looked or felt better than with using this Suave! It&#x27;s quality and it&#x27;s cheap. Who doesn&#x27;t like that?</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner!  Personally I think it works better than much more expensive products! The scent is very nice and makes my shower smell like a professional salon.  This conditioner makes my hair makes my hair feel very soft and silky. I have already re-purchased this product several times.</li>
            <li> Not the best out there (I mean, it&#x27;s obviously not, at 3.00 $)...I was expecting a lot I guess, from all the positive reviews, but I just wasn&#x27;t that impressed at all. its very light and not thick- hate those kinds of conditioners...anyway, at 3 bucks, give it a shot, maybe your hair will settle..</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. I think the quality is just as good as other more expensive shampoos. I&#x27;ve used it for years, and it does a great job moisturizing my hair.</li>
            <li> NEVER HAS MY HAIR LOOKED THIS SOFT AND SCRUMPTIOUS&lt;br /&gt;GOOD LORD&lt;br /&gt;I AM SAMSON BEFORE DELILAH&lt;br /&gt;I AM THOR&lt;br /&gt;I AM RAPUNZEL</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this conditioner, I have the matching shampoo as well, been using them for about a month now and still like them which is saying something. Would recommend for anyone including those with sensitive skin, like myself.</li>
            <li> I first bought this conditioner and shampoo in BJ&#x27;s but they stopped carrying it. So glad I found it on here. It leaves your hair so soft and smooth, it&#x27;s crazy. Best conditioner EVER!!! The shampoo is also sulfate free and I live by both of them. Even my hairdresser asked where I got it from. Btw I&#x27;m African American with thick hair. Trust me. It works.</li>
            <li> Not bad, especially for the price, but it is very watery. It does leave my hair in great shape, though, and it rinses clean.  I actually prefer the mint and rosemary scent, but this one isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> I swear this stuff turns your hair into butter.I think this and some of the other suave products are a breath of fresh air. Great doesn&#x27;t have to cost a lot!</li>
            <li> Super duper, works great!</li>
            <li> This is a HUGE bottle.  It will easily last me over a year, and I shower and wash my hair daily.  The scent is light and not at all overpowering and my hair feels clean and lightweight after washing.  Great with the conditioner also.</li>
            <li> Does great job on hair</li>
            <li> Love this suave shampoo and conditioner. It doesn&#x27;t build up on hair and smells great! Love the size too - lasts long.</li>
            <li> I am of mixed race, with extremely curly hair, and was looking for a good conditioner to use until I could run across town to purchase my regular botanical conditioner. After the first use, it left my usually curly/wavy roots frizzy, and my curly ends knotted. Wanting to give it one more chance in hopes that the bad results came from underuse on my part, I had the same experience. I recommend against buying this product and will not be using it again.</li>
            <li> Great product, thanks.</li>
            <li> This conditioner left my hair very shiny and smoother than other conditioners , my hair feels good and. The price was reasonable .too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;使用之後, 我的頭髮很有光澤和平滑, 我的頭髮感覺很好，價格是合理的了。</li>
            <li> only purchase this shampoo because it is the less expensive shampoo out but it does what it has to do.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for a really cheap price. I compared results and ingredients with many higher priced products and have found this to be equal to any.</li>
            <li> its a great product at a fantastic price now will not spend any more money than with suave products the best</li>
            <li> Emerging greys are now an enjoyable evolution...instead of an awkward transition!!! I&#x27;ve always had good hair...but I&#x27;m cheating the sparse new greys I&#x27;m getting now with slightly lighter hair coloring...the colored grey strands now look like very believable blonde highlights: but the texture of the grey hair is slightly coarser and dryer than the rest of my hair...and behaves/looks better with a little TLC. I tend to have quite a few shampoo and conditioner products in my &amp;#34;rotation&amp;#34; at all times...but I have a few consistent &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; products that I like to always have on hand...and Suave almond/shea butter shampoo and conditioner are among my favorites. For the money, you can not beat the quality of these products. I particularly like to use this after I&#x27;ve done an overnight hot coconut oil treatment on the lower two-thirds of my hair...and the section of grey hair that is is slowly becoming a &amp;#34;Bonnie Raitt&amp;#34; style streak off my left temple (I&#x27;m liking it quite a lot, actually :-). In the morning I shampoo and condition with these products...and the results are wonderful...I might even use a pea-size amount of the conditioner as a &amp;#34;leave in&amp;#34; on the parched areas of my hair (very effective) and use a bit of coconut oil, Moroccan oil, or serum of my choice just on the ends. So far my results with the grey and lightened hair are GOOD...I never have any split ends in my long layers. An agreeable scent is another &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; for me: the scent of this is very clean/warm/nurturing/light ...totally enjoyable. Yeah: as far as I&#x27;m concerned...the over-priced &amp;#34;high-end&amp;#34; products are getting a real &amp;#34;run for the money&amp;#34; with this stuff. I hope Suave never stops making this particular shampoo and conditioner: I plan to be a life-long devotee as long as they continue to produce it.</li>
            <li> This had great slip the comb went right through it and it smelled great,also cleansed my hair well and moisturized i would definitely recommend but buy this from Walmart where its only under 3.00 a bottle! WAAYYY better than pantene co wash which i will never buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Suave and now it&#x27;s even better.  Hair feels soft and silky using subscribe &amp; save makes the savings even  better!</li>
            <li> Great price for this price, I go between Suave and Lush (expensive hair products), and my hair stays clean when I use Suave still. Have to wash my hair a little more than when I use Lush but for the price, cant beat it.</li>
            <li> get this for my kids to use, works good for them. last a while too. can get it for a good price here</li>
            <li> I caught a sale on the Suave Professions Moisturizing Conditioner with Almond and Shea Butter and although a bit apprehensive, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I simply prefer to buy products that are all natural; brand names tend to make claims, their products contain better enhancing ingredients, such as this one with combining ‘Shea butter and almond’ but quite often they fail long-term consistency one expects; due in short, they continue to keep a lot of the junk that is associated with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve stopped using Suave shampoos and conditioners in the past as their product in essence; did not seem to meet my expectations for anyone with thick or course textured- type hair. My hair tends to be a bit softer than most and Suave products failed to even make my hair feel its absolute best. It gave my hair a dry, flat feeling; absolutely, no body and it made my hair feel brittle even after rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been a couple of years since I&#x27;ve tried another Suave product, but I was enticed with their claim on this particular product having, &amp;#34;100% natural Almond-Shea Butter.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with using any new products, I always only use just that product alone; making certain not to combine any additional products, which actually can cause more damage due to mixing of too many ingredients; and with any new product, I highly recommend giving it one-two weeks, before truly accepting or rejecting it as insignificant. People of color only need to wash our hair only once; maybe two days a week;  using any one particular shampoo or conditioning treatment approximately 3-4 washing cycles in order to fully, achieve whatever, the final results we want for our hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suave Professions Moisturizing Conditioner with Almond and Shea Butter actually surpassed my expectations from the very first wash. I honestly, was pleasantly surprised how soft this felt while massaging into the roots; it felt great-so good that I rinsed and re-applied a second time. What I enjoyed equally more is how much I savored the scent of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It had a strong scent of coconut; something, I honestly, do not get from a lot of products, which claim to have something that resemblance of the island tropics. It lightened up my entire showering experience; for just that moment I forgot where I was and allowed my thoughts to drift off to being back home in my homeland, Jamaica. The scent was strong enough that I could smell this was not your usual, ordinary, bottle of conditioner, but not too overpowering either that it irritated my senses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so taken back, that I actually grabbed the bottle and re-read the name and its contents again; I had to be certain this was actually a Suave professionals product; it baffled my mind that such a low cost conditioner could feel this good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t be Awakened1 if I didn’t make reference of this one marketing statement I read; it&#x27;s too bad they put it in such small print; I almost missed it myself; and the reality is, the majority of the people, will most likely disregard it also, but hey, that&#x27;s why you have me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marketing Statement:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Did you know that, depending on where you live, your family could save up to $100 and 3,200 gallons of water per year by turning off the water when you shampoo and condition.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why yes, I do practice this very important cause; I did not know the exact numbers and how much I was saving in doing this one, simple remedy; a ten year old (Miss Elizabeth)taught me how to recycle and this was one of her everyday rants and demands she made upon me, whenever, she would visit my home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the trick obviously is not to attempt this while showering, but in replace of washing ones hair during normal shower time; the better and more practical solution would be to wash ones hair in the sink; this is something I live by and think how much everyone could contribute to the environment; as well as the planet itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Each one-teach one&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also mentioned to, &amp;#34;Please recycle.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These two statements alone touched my heart today; to know there are companies in Corporate America that does seem to give-a-damn and because of that, I have a new outlook and appreciation of Suave and its subsidiaries; a very special thank you, from me Awakened1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awakened1&#x27;s Hair Conditioning Treatment:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*RoseMary Oil, mixture (With coconut water and fresh lemon juice)&lt;br /&gt;*Wheat Germ Oil&lt;br /&gt;*Peppermint Oil&lt;br /&gt;*Aloe Vera&lt;br /&gt;*Pascalite Powder&lt;br /&gt;*Vitamin E or Sweet Almond Oil (for scent)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mix well; store in a clear plastic container; refrigerate overnight; wear a plastic cap for (15-20 minutes); rinse well. Repeat 1-2 times a week until achieved desired textured affect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will leave your hair feeling soft and looking healthy without hidden dyes and harsh chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Do not use metal bowls or utensils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This led me to now want to venture into trying additional hair care products under the Suave professionals umbrella. This product is ideal for anyone who suffers from dry, damaged hair and wants more vitality and luster to one’s hair. This is a great value for the price; it has a great textured feel; make my hair manageable; my scalp doesn&#x27;t feel dry and it controls dandruff until my next washing session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suave, it has been a long time, welcome back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And on that note...I am done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Review has been brought to you by &#x27;Awakened1&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** See all my reviews:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34AZ5B6CCBLPN/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_pr_auth_rev?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;sort_by&#x3D;MostRecentReview</li>
            <li> I bought this product at Walmart at the results are phenomenal. I have extremely thick, long hair that&#x27;s a pain in the butt to take care of. I&#x27;ve tried everything from super cheap V05 to super expensive Paul Mitchell products and couldn&#x27;t find anything that worked. Most products make my hair flat and greasy looking or dry/frizzy. This conditioner is amazing, it makes my hair soft and shiny without weighing it down. Plus its super cheap! I&#x27;d highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this in the store and I was skeptical because most conditioners didnt work well with my hair,which is partially course..This ocnditoner made my hair instantly soft and manageable which helped me so much with detangling it..So this is my new favorite cheapy conditioner..Will use this for my cowashes from now on</li>
            <li> Smells decent and leaves my hair somewhat soft.  I was reading reviews of others saying this was as good as the Nexus Humid series, but I cannot agree with that.  Even though the formula was changed for Nexus, I still believe it provides better shampoo and condition.  Albeit, the price is completely in opposite regions.  This conditioner is fine for most people and for the price, a great deal.</li>
            <li> another wonderfully affordable conditioner that leaves natural african hair soft, smooth and moisturized. another must have for detangling. it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> This conditioner works wonders for my hair. Before trying this product, I was using Nexxus brand conditioner, which is at least 5 times the price. This conditioner makes my hair silky smooth for a fraction of the price of salon brands!</li>
