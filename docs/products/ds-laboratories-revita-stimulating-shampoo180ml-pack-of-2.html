            <li>If my hair got a bit more thicker I would give it 5 stars, but there probably isn&#x27;t a product that will do that.  </li>
            <li>but there&#x27;s better options out there, so I won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
            <li>I jave to use it for 4 more months to see if my hairloss is improving or not.</li>
            <li>I have been using this shampoo for more than a year now</li>
            <li>I paid significanty more for it through the salon.  </li>
            <li>I love the way my hair feels.</li>
            <li>Those of us with balding heads need a product that stimulates and makes healthy the remaining hair roots we have.  </li>
            <li>And Healthy the hair stop to fallng .</li>
            <li>It is great and really works.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>and it leaves the hair nice and clean.</li>
            <li>she notice a good  results in the first bottle , now Her hair Is more  shiny</li>
            <li>The top easily opens spilling out the shampoo.</li>
            <li>Still a great product, still plan to buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great shampoo, but I don&#x27;t know about it making your hair grow back.</li>
            <li>They make my hair feel great and actually have stimulated hair growth.</li>
            <li>This shampoo sounded great prior to being ordered but it made me have a ton of acne all over my head</li>
            <li>my hair is not falling as much and have become healthy and strong.</li>
            <li>I bought this product originally to stop hair loss.</li>
            <li>True nourishment for our hair.</li>
            <li>I started using it while I was pregnant and have continued.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m mainly using this shampoo for hairloss, and I love the way my hair feels after I use Revita.  </li>
            <li>I began using this product about a year ago after noticing more and more hair being left on my pillow in the morning.  </li>
            <li>Love it but price is a bit high</li>
            <li>I have very baby fine hair</li>
            <li>Oh but it might make your hair grow faster, for whatever that&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t recommend buying a couple of months worth .</li>
            <li>Not bad, shampoo was really runny</li>
            <li>Not losing anymore, maybe a little thicker, but it helps to keep your scalp scale free, nice added bonus.  </li>
            <li>In fact, it might be more economical to buy the larger size.</li>
            <li>Has really helped hair growth!</li>
            <li>I could feel the difference in the texture of my hair the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo!  </li>
            <li>The only thing I have a problem with is the top.  </li>
            <li>However, it worked pretty well for my mum who just tried it once and felt a difference.</li>
            <li>She has since been using this shampoo only and is satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>This shampoo gives my hair some extra body and certainly is refreshing......</li>
            <li>My process is to first wash my hair with another shampoo (head and shoulders) to remove accumulated dirt and oils, then to wash with the Revita shampoo - leaving it in my hair for about 5 minutes or so before rinsing.  </li>
            <li>and my hair has pretty much doubled in thickness.  </li>
            <li>I noticed that even after the first shampoo, I didn&#x27;t have as much hair fall out during and after my shower.  </li>
            <li>Dr. Said this product contains a strong fungicide that has caused numerous problems.</li>
            <li>.. Ended up going with Regene Pure.</li>
            <li>I googled it and found it on Amazon and have been paying a lot less for the same great product.</li>
            <li>and I have found it to be even better than expected.</li>
            <li>The results are very noticable.</li>
            <li>Be reasonable.</li>
            <li>and my hair is much softer.</li>
            <li>I dont see much difference in hair regrowth or hair loss prevention, but</li>
            <li>They really need to reengineer the container.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of different shampoos and conditioners and this stuff is far better than the others.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 months now and haven&#x27;t really notice any changes on my scalp or slowed down my hair loss, I was really hoping for a more effective performance since I&#x27;m actually on the early stages of hair loss, I still have plenty that&#x27;s why I wanted to try something to prevent it to fall off, unfortunally Revita for man has not help at all so far!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for the past 5 months as my sole shampoo and I have noticed a great difference.  </li>
            <li>particularly the enclosure leaves a lot to be desired.</li>
            <li>So far, I do not see much of a change in terms of hair growth.</li>
            <li>I use another shampoo first to clean and give my hair shine, it&#x27;s called FAT HAIR, then I shampoo with this and leave it on for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>New hair is coming.</li>
            <li>I also have all kinds of new growth that I didn&#x27;t expect.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do much for growth as much as for preventing future fall out.</li>
            <li>By washing in this manner, I was able to use a much smaller amount of Revita on the second wash and could make a bottle last 2 to 3 months.  </li>
            <li>Hair loss, however, has diminished considerably.</li>
            <li>The conditioner makes my hair feel soft.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Revita shampoo for over 6 months and have not seen any results so far.</li>
            <li>In fact, I would go as far as to suggest that it increased</li>
            <li>you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It has stopped most of the  loss and a few hairs grew back.</li>
            <li>Other than that, the actual product itself is fantastic.</li>
            <li>At the same time, a friend ordered the same shampoo from another site, but paid almost twice as much for the same exact quantity - the only difference was that the expiration date was November 2017.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed a big improvement with hair loss,and a lot of new hair growth since using this product along with taking fish oil.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always hard to due any nice hair styles do to my flaky hair &amp;#34;NOT ANYMORE&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>As far as helping it to grow back, no.</li>
            <li>but it apparently it did not work out for me.</li>
            <li>Young male in his twenties!</li>
            <li>I have a lot  of new hair all about 1 and 1/2 inch long.</li>
            <li>Me on the other hand, not so much.</li>
            <li>I have to say this won me over because it doesn&#x27;t&#x27; dry my hair live Regenepure.  </li>
            <li>For a shampoo that costs so much, I don&#x27;t want to waste any of it leaking out because of a poor top design.</li>

            <li> it has not turned me into Fabio, but my hair is less &amp;#34;patchy&amp;#34;  and I&#x27;ve seen evidence of new hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not losing as much hair, but I&#x27;m not sure if its the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Just try one  bottle in small quantity to try first, so u don&#x27;t loose out on your money and your hair.</li>
            <li> and I felt it was a hair loss solution I could maintain for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product,  Like any other product,  takes several months to work.</li>
            <li> I had the same problem with previous buys.</li>
            <li> I decided to go ahead with the product anyways as it required less modification to my daily routine</li>
            <li> so if the bottle tipped over it would leak through the closed cap.</li>
            <li> Several members of my family, including myself, had trouble with losing hair and scaly scalp.  </li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s not oozing out of its poorly designed nozzle, this shampoo is not going to do much to fight hairloss.</li>
            <li> However, I expected some results after 6 months of using the shampoo but the problem is increasing rather than decreasing.</li>
            <li> This particular bottle design is not great.</li>
            <li> My hair is thinning due to heredity and medicine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I started using the shampoo I have noticed new hair growth in my receding hairline indentations,  as well as thickening of hair behind the island.  </li>
            <li> Even after one use, my scalp hurts less and flaking is minimal.</li>
            <li> I would have given 4 stars but i loose a lot of shampoo in the cap and it gets messy.</li>
            <li> I have been having the problem of hair loss for less than a year due to the sandy and humid weather conditions.</li>
            <li> The only complaint  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great stuff for person&#x27;s losing their hair.  Helps keep it on your head and not in the drain.  My boyfriend swears by it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a year and I have found it to be even better than expected. The results are very noticable.</li>
            <li> Has really helped hair growth!</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of different shampoos and conditioners and this stuff is far better than the others. I could feel the difference in the texture of my hair the first time I used it. It has a very pleasant scent and my hair looks great. I use his along with the hair treatment and I am happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with this shampoo.   I use with the condition and the spray. I have a lot  of new hair all about 1 and 1/2 inch long. The rest of my  hair is Bout 8 inches and all most no falling  out when   I wash used about 4 months</li>
            <li> Been using it for six months...done nothing for regrow the or decreased shedding, but that&#x27;s just me. Ditto the others..poor bottle design, just leaks out and at this price I for want to waste a drop.  Won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> The bottle tend to leak out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not losing as much hair, but I&#x27;m not sure if its the shampoo. I&#x27;m still using it just in case.</li>
            <li> Not bad, shampoo was really runny so if the bottle tipped over it would leak through the closed cap. Not good for travel.. Ended up going with Regene Pure.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product. Made my hair thinner. Stuck with two bottles. No refunds at this point. Should be outlawed</li>
            <li> This a great shampoo. I&#x27;ve been using it for the past 5 months as my sole shampoo and I have noticed a great difference.  I&#x27;m in my late 30s and I was beginning to get an island in my hair as my receding hairline was starting to connect behind a patch of hair up front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I started using the shampoo I have noticed new hair growth in my receding hairline indentations,  as well as thickening of hair behind the island.  Granted it has not turned me into Fabio, but my hair is less &amp;#34;patchy&amp;#34;  and I&#x27;ve seen evidence of new hair so I will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a note to those giving bad ratings... This product,  Like any other product,  takes several months to work. Don&#x27;t expect to use it and within a month have thick locks of hair.  Be reasonable. Anyone starting this process should map and survey their head,  take pictures even,  and then compare a monthly intervals. I think you will notice the difference that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only knock on the shampoo is the design of the cap. It will either leak shampoo if upside down,  or wit will let water in (mine sat under the shower head) .</li>
            <li> If it sounds too good to be true, then it probably isn&#x27;t.  Once again, I believed</li>
            <li> This shampoo works wonders. I have much less hair falling out and my hair is much softer.</li>
            <li> The two bottles that came had an expiration date of April 2015.  If used correctly, there is no way to use two bottles of this product in that short amount of time.  At the same time, a friend ordered the same shampoo from another site, but paid almost twice as much for the same exact quantity - the only difference was that the expiration date was November 2017.  Something to consider.</li>
            <li> Hair loss stopped with this product. New hair is coming. Must be used like recommended by factory. Solved my problem.</li>
            <li> Dr. Said this product contains a strong fungicide that has caused numerous problems. Have thrown this product out because he was correct.</li>
            <li> Again wat too expensive of a product when you can get the same thing at your local drugstore for half the price</li>
            <li> Product came on time, but not sure it is helping with my hair loss.  I still see a ton of hair in my sink, unfortunately.  Will keep trying.  Have only been using it for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> Awesome product...just love it...works...</li>
            <li> The shampoo seems to be working. I do notice less hair lost. Unfortunately, the cap is defective, it leaks. I had the same problem with previous buys. I believe they are trying to get rid of this lot.</li>
            <li> Thank you for providing a great product that works and at a great price that is affordable to everyone.  Keep up the good work!!</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my hair stylist.&lt;br /&gt;I just received, so cannot comment on how it will work, but I love&lt;br /&gt;the lather of the shampoo and it leaves my hair \\&quot;feeling\\&quot; thicker and&lt;br /&gt;easy to style.</li>
            <li> Gave my hair body and it is growing slowly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great shampoo, but I don&#x27;t know about it making your hair grow back. Then again, different results for different people. I think this has helped slow down my hair loss. As far as helping it to grow back, no. Love the way it smells, though and it leaves the hair nice and clean. This particular bottle design is not great. The top of it collects shampoo and eventually leaks. For a shampoo that costs so much, I don&#x27;t want to waste any of it leaking out because of a poor top design. If you get this, you might consider putting it in a different bottle. I opted for the larger size that comes with the pump.</li>
            <li> You do not need to have thinning hair to use this product. I have psoriasis on my scalp.  Even after one use, my scalp hurts less and flaking is minimal.</li>
            <li> We have bought this multiple times. Still a great product, still plan to buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> So far, I do not see much of a change in terms of hair growth. Hair loss, however, has diminished considerably.</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo and the tingly feel. I would have given 4 stars but i loose a lot of shampoo in the cap and it gets messy.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Several members of my family, including myself, had trouble with losing hair and scaly scalp.  Not losing anymore, maybe a little thicker, but it helps to keep your scalp scale free, nice added bonus.  I think not having sulfates in it helps to avoid these problems.  If my hair got a bit more thicker I would give it 5 stars, but there probably isn&#x27;t a product that will do that.  Stopping the loss was great.</li>
            <li> I use this product to make my hair grow faster and boy, does it! I also have all kinds of new growth that I didn&#x27;t expect. I do use a good conditioner on the ends to keep them protected. Love it!</li>
            <li> this product is great for alopecia together with phito pills and aspectra spray, for be honest i love it.</li>
            <li> I use both the Revita shampoo and conditioner. They make my hair feel great and actually have stimulated hair growth.</li>
            <li> I like these shampoos.  I dont see much difference in hair regrowth or hair loss prevention, but oh well. I wasnt expecting a miracle.</li>
            <li> I started using Revita about 6 months ago, I was using another hair loss product but switched to Revita.  I have noticed a big improvement with hair loss,and a lot of new hair growth since using this product along with taking fish oil.  As a woman, thinning hair is terrible but this really works!</li>
            <li> Well I like the product itself, the container particularly the enclosure leaves a lot to be desired. The top easily opens spilling out the shampoo. I&#x27;ve taken to putting it in plastic so it doesn&#x27;t spill into my workout bag. They really need to reengineer the container.</li>
            <li> Love it but price is a bit high</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo!  My hair seems thicker and healthier.  I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 6 weeks in conjunction with the Spectral F7 Efficacy Booster.  Both were recommended to me by my hairdresser who noticed a bit of thinning around my temples.  I would recommend!</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo for thinning hair.  I started using it while I was pregnant and have continued.  I&#x27;ve been using it about 3 years now and my hair has pretty much doubled in thickness.  The only thing I have a problem with is the top.  It leaks like crazy!  The shampoo is orange, so my shower has gooey orange puddles and drips everywhere.  Other than that, the actual product itself is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I tried both this and the Regenepure product. I have to say this won me over because it doesn&#x27;t&#x27; dry my hair live Regenepure.  The conditioner makes my hair feel soft.  I noticed that even after the first shampoo, I didn&#x27;t have as much hair fall out during and after my shower.  My hair stylist made the same observation and asked me what I was using.  I don&#x27;t shampoo everyday and not sure if that will make a difference in the long run but this is what I am using exclusively now.  In fact, it might be more economical to buy the larger size.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 months now and haven&#x27;t really notice any changes on my scalp or slowed down my hair loss, I was really hoping for a more effective performance since I&#x27;m actually on the early stages of hair loss, I still have plenty that&#x27;s why I wanted to try something to prevent it to fall off, unfortunally Revita for man has not help at all so far!</li>
            <li> Not a fan. When it&#x27;s not oozing out of its poorly designed nozzle, this shampoo is not going to do much to fight hairloss. Oh but it might make your hair grow faster, for whatever that&#x27;s worth. Sorry, but there&#x27;s better options out there, so I won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Did everything it said it would....</li>
            <li> This product is garbage. I used this product as directed and it did nothing to help thicken up my thinning hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mainly using this shampoo for hairloss, and I love the way my hair feels after I use Revita.  I jave to use it for 4 more months to see if my hairloss is improving or not. I&#x27;m also using Lipogaine twice a day.</li>
            <li> I have been using Revita shampoo for over 6 months and have not seen any results so far. I am shedding hair like crazy and it is getting worse every day. I was pinning a lot of hopes on this shampoo but it apparently it did not work out for me. I have been having the problem of hair loss for less than a year due to the sandy and humid weather conditions. However, I expected some results after 6 months of using the shampoo but the problem is increasing rather than decreasing.</li>
            <li> This product came on time and works good, it takes time before you see the results, but after it starts working it looks good</li>
            <li> This stuff works great!  Hair is now fuller from the day I started using it.  It is ORANGE.  Lathers well, leave it on lathered for 3-5mins.&lt;br /&gt;Would say it works as they claim.  I have re-ordered.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for more than a year now and I am very happy with the results. my hair is not falling as much and have become healthy and strong.</li>
            <li> I have very baby fine hair and I am in my 50&#x27;s. My hair is thinning due to heredity and medicine. I started using this about 2 years ago when recommended by my hair salon. I paid significanty more for it through the salon.  I googled it and found it on Amazon and have been paying a lot less for the same great product. It has made a BIG difference in the texture and volumn of my hair. I use another shampoo first to clean and give my hair shine, it&#x27;s called FAT HAIR, then I shampoo with this and leave it on for a few minutes. I follow up with a creme rinse. I love the way my hair feels. I would not recommend using this as your only shampoo since it does not give you the body and sheen you may be looking for. I wash my hair everyday, and use the product at least every other day. My husband was so impressed that he is now using it.</li>
            <li> Young male in his twenties! This did not work on me, despite using it according to the instructions for over a month. However, it worked pretty well for my mum who just tried it once and felt a difference. She has since been using this shampoo only and is satisfied with it. Me on the other hand, not so much. In fact, I would go as far as to suggest that it increased my hair fall instead of decreasing it.</li>
            <li> This is a great value for a great product.  Those of us with balding heads need a product that stimulates and makes healthy the remaining hair roots we have.  True nourishment for our hair.</li>
            <li> This shampoo sounded great prior to being ordered but it made me have a ton of acne all over my head and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin I would be cautious.</li>
            <li> I Bought this product For My wife because she has problems with Her hair she notice a good  results in the first bottle , now Her hair Is more  shiny And Healthy the hair stop to fallng .</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much for growth as much as for preventing future fall out. Been using for a year.</li>
            <li> For the passed 30 years I&#x27;ve been having problem with my scalp. I tried everything, even expensing prescription shampoo and nothing ever works. It&#x27;s always hard to due any nice hair styles do to my flaky hair &amp;#34;NOT ANYMORE&amp;#34;. I am sooooooo HAPPY to say that this shampoo change my life. After only two weeks using Revita  Stimulating Shampoo, I am no longer have to wash my hair every two to three days anymore.</li>
            <li> This shampoo gives my hair some extra body and certainly is refreshing......</li>
            <li> I bought this product originally to stop hair loss. It has stopped most of the  loss and a few hairs grew back. I like the tingling feeling when using it and the way it leaves my hair. The only complaint  I have is the bottle itself leads to some waste. You would figure a bottle  of $30 shampoo  wouldn&#x27;t  leak. Since i travel alot it is an issue  for me, but i have started switching the bottle.</li>
            <li> Very happy with product</li>
            <li> I used this shampoo for about 6 months and didn&#x27;t see any improvement in my thinning hair.  Also, the bottle is not well-designed because it constantly leaks the orange-colored shampoo and it stains really badly.</li>
            <li> I got two for the price of one.  This is really good shampoo that makes your hair feel thicker and look thicker.</li>
            <li> It is great and really works.&lt;br /&gt;My beautician started me on it and I saw how it works great.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> not a miracle product.. actually after 3 months using it, i have not seen any change.&lt;br /&gt;this was a part of a treatment by my dr. before hair implant treatment &#x3D;/</li>
            <li> I am the same reviewer that had bad results with this product. Don&#x27;t recommend buying a couple of months worth . Just try one  bottle in small quantity to try first, so u don&#x27;t loose out on your money and your hair.</li>
            <li> I began using this product about a year ago after noticing more and more hair being left on my pillow in the morning.  I was recommended this product from my hair stylist at the time as an alternative to the Nioxin hair products.  She told me that the shampoo was the strongest part of the duo of shampoo and conditioner, so I began using just the shampoo (and still do).  She also told me that I would need to use it for a while before I started seeing results - that it could be up to 6 months before I noticed anything!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I decided to go ahead with the product anyways as it required less modification to my daily routine and I felt it was a hair loss solution I could maintain for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now this product was quite expensive in the salon, so I used it much more sparingly than the directions called for.  My process is to first wash my hair with another shampoo (head and shoulders) to remove accumulated dirt and oils, then to wash with the Revita shampoo - leaving it in my hair for about 5 minutes or so before rinsing.  By washing in this manner, I was able to use a much smaller amount of Revita on the second wash and could make a bottle last 2 to 3 months.  I perform this process every time I shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 1 month of use, I noticed less hair being left behind on my pillow.  After about a year of use now, I don&#x27;t notice ANY hair on my pillow and very little loss anywhere else!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never subscribed to the belief that this product would &amp;#34;re-grow&amp;#34; my hair.  The only goals I had placed on this product were to&lt;br /&gt;1) reduce my hair loss&lt;br /&gt;2) make the hair I have left stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel it has succeeded on both counts and I plan on continuing to use this product for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li> Did what it said it would.</li>
