            <li>Recommended by my optometrist, this is  a handy product for eyelid cleansing.</li>
            <li>eyes are truly loving the product.  </li>
            <li>New, sealed, unopened perfect!</li>
            <li>This is a nice alternative to the wipes and even may provide a better bang for the buck.  </li>
            <li>Although it has not cured my condition, ocusoft eyelid cleanser has given me more relief than anything else I have tried until now.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>My doctor recommended an eyelid scrub and gave me some pads, but the foam is better.</li>
            <li>recommended by my opthmalogist and works better than the one that is not plus</li>
            <li>There is a noticeable residue, but it is OK.  </li>
            <li>I used Johnson&#x27;s baby shampoo for a while but thought this might be better..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, but I prefer a soap that I wash off.  </li>
            <li>But love this product.</li>
            <li>It is for more severe problems.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that you wipe it on and leave it; no need to rinse off.  </li>
            <li>I have Sj√∂gren&#x27;s Syndrome and have to keep my eyelids very clean.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the best for chronic dry eye sufferers</li>
            <li>It is easy &amp; convenient to use</li>
            <li>And today, for the first time in many weeks, I will go to the office with clear, bright eyes!</li>
            <li>Every morning/night I first close my eyes and cup warm water to them to loosen any particles, then rinse, then put on this foam, then rinse.</li>
            <li>After voicing frustration to my doctor, she said that she just attended a seminar where a handful of doctors were having good luck with a new prescription medication.</li>
            <li>It has worked fine; no sting, and I leave it on while I&#x27;m showering.</li>
            <li>Please note that it isn&#x27;t available at pharmacies yet</li>
            <li>I have troublesome eye allergies, and this product helps keep my eyes clean and comfortable by cleaning off the film and exudate from the allergic response.</li>
            <li>I am giving Ocusoft more than one star because the seller appears to be very responsible.</li>
            <li>I like it better than the pre moistened pads, fast &amp; easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t remove makeup like the original lid wipes do.  </li>
            <li>There are two versions of OcuSoft Foam: Original and Plus.</li>
            <li>I have been using Plus to start but will try switching to Original because it is cheaper</li>
            <li>Many stores do not carry the foam or overprice it, but the CLE price is very competitive.    </li>
            <li>The plus is not as good as the regular.</li>
            <li>The ocusoft lid scrub foam regular is just as effective at a significant savings.  </li>
            <li>Really relieves the itch!!</li>
            <li>For people allergic there is a baby gentle eyelid cleaner that is fabulous and will not burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is amazing that I could not find it in any local pharmacy after trying seven of them.</li>
            <li>The enthusiastic reviews of this product that I read on Amazon are entirely justified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then, I rinse my eyelids with warm water to remove the excess product and debris that has been loosened by the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product not only removes the debris, it seems to act as a skin moisturizer and conditioner for the eyelids.</li>
            <li>If you clean your fingers carefully then you can use the foam on your finger for the scrub, which is much more comfortable for me than the pads.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent Lid Scrub and is different from the other version in that the foam does not need to be rinsed off.  </li>
            <li>it is gentle and safe for her to use I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>My eyes feel wonderful all day with only two to three applications of eye drops as  opposed to using drops every few hours.</li>
            <li>I would like to give this product a stellar review, but the truth is that I wouldn&#x27;t purchase any of these over-the-counter treatments for blepharitis.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference after the first day that I used this.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Using the product in this manner, my first bottle lasted nine weeks.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and utilized before.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Unfortunately most sellers don&#x27;t know there are two different kinds.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I finally did some Internet research, and learned more about my condition than three ophthalmologists ever told me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not sure if my lids are just especially sensitive, but this product left them stinging, more itchy, more swollen, and more flaky than they had been.</li>
            <li>My mother, aged 103, found this enhanced formula safe and effective for helping to relieve her dry itchy eyelids.</li>
            <li>The regular formula wasn&#x27;t quite enough but will be good for maintenance.</li>
            <li>: I quickly depress the plunger on top of the bottle to dispense some foam into the cupped palm of my hand.</li>
            <li>Does the job but will dry out eyelids if I use more than 3x&#x27;s week</li>
            <li>Much easier to buy on-line.  </li>
            <li>This method removes makeup very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for helping locate</li>
            <li>It helps so much during allergy season for me.</li>
            <li>Seems very off for a product designed to use on your lids.</li>
            <li>The product is gentle, yet does the job in cleaning off oils, makeup, etc.</li>
            <li>Is this really that concentrated?  </li>
            <li>and this was recommended by my eye doctor, but I much prefer the lid wipe originals to this foam.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe the Plus is available in the 215 ML (7-1/4 oz) size, only 50 ML.</li>
            <li>This really helps reduce blephritis redness.  </li>
            <li>So your eyes feel clean and fresh in a way that I had not experienced for MANY years.</li>
            <li>Much better than the other stuff as this stays on and moisturizers.</li>
            <li>I like this product better than other lid scrubs I have tried.</li>
            <li>More expensive than the original formula but definitely works better.</li>
            <li>So the cost no problem, especially considering how valuable the product is.in this way the cost is not bad.</li>
            <li>The product is a liquid that is converted to foam by quickly passing through a nozzle, so it is necessary to apply the product  to the eyelids without delay.</li>
            <li>On their web site OcuSoft recommends using it for two weeks and then switching to Original for long term.</li>
            <li>This is particularly useful for trips and the size is small for easy packing.</li>
            <li>But customer service at OcuSoft said even for dry skin the Original was recommended unless there is some severe problem that needs the Plus.</li>
            <li>As a result, the eyes are not chronically irritated by this residue, which normal washing with soap and water does not remove.</li>
            <li>This new prescription product is quite soothing.</li>
            <li>It explains that not only does this foam clean the lids, but that as you apply it, you should massage your lids in a certain way to help clear the tiny oil glands that line the lid rim.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>Baby shampoo works fine for me and costs less.</li>
            <li>Arrived a day early!  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use, but it does sting a little if you get it into your eye.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a while because of ocular rosacea and even though this condition has always getting its set backs, I still consider it useful to control the dry eyes with this product.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for it.</li>
            <li>I have also had less incidences of checking to make sure there wasn&#x27;t an eyelash or something in my eye only to find nothing.  </li>
            <li>It helped clear up my blepharitis.</li>
            <li>This helps clear out the remaining bits of eyeliner and mascara after washing my face, but I can&#x27;t say that&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my 6 yr old daughter</li>
            <li>Then, I gently rub back and forth  sideways on the eyelids as if massaging the product into the eyelids.</li>
            <li>and wow there it was.  </li>
            <li>Do not recommend, does not seem gentle enough for skin around eyes.</li>
            <li>It was sent to me very quickly and as usual the product is everything I need.</li>
            <li>My doctor recommended this cleanser for everyday use in keeping eyelids clean.  </li>
            <li>This will help return those glands to normal functioning, creating normal tears that prevent dry eye.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It works very well as long as you realize that it is not a cure -- it is a maintenance treatment.</li>
            <li>And it is not necessary to use eye drops as frequently.  </li>
            <li>I liked it but will not buy anymore because shipping makes it too expensive.</li>
            <li>The foam works so much better than the individual packets, and the foam plus does not dry my tissues out and make things worse.</li>
            <li>This product does a fantastic job removing residue of dried eyedrops, tears, and other secretions/debris from the eyelids.</li>

            <li> It works very well as long as you realize that it is not a cure -- it is a maintenance treatment.</li>
            <li> And it is not necessary to use eye drops as frequently.  </li>
            <li> I liked it but will not buy anymore because shipping makes it too expensive.</li>
            <li> The foam works so much better than the individual packets, and the foam plus does not dry my tissues out and make things worse.</li>
            <li> This product does a fantastic job removing residue of dried eyedrops, tears, and other secretions/debris from the eyelids.</li>
            <li> Then, I use my index finger to scoop up the rest of the foam and gently rub it across the eyelid of the other closed eye.</li>
            <li> Then, I use my index finger to scoop up half the foam  and gently rub it across the eyelid of one closed eye.</li>
            <li> Dry eye is quite annoying but this is a great help to alleviate the problem.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only thing that dealt with my dry morning eyes.</li>
            <li> I still don&#x27;t get the link between washing the outside of your lid and dry eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plus, my chronic blepharitis and dry eye are finally on the run!  </li>
            <li> Especially helps severe dry eyes!</li>
            <li> (There is no complete cure for blepharitis at this time.)</li>
            <li> I use it after my shower and the medication stays on my lids and works for a long time afterwards, even overnight.</li>
            <li> Endless rounds of antibiotic ointment and drops worked only as long as I kept applying them, which is not a practical long-term plan.  </li>
            <li> My dr recommended washing my lids as part of treating my dry eyes.</li>
            <li> It has help with my dry eyes..</li>
            <li> it helped my dry, scratchy eyes at all.  </li>
            <li> I buy inexpensive, soft gauze pads and cut into little squares for applying the foam with a little extra scrubbing.</li>
            <li> So the whites of the eyes are whiter and less red, and the eyes do not have that itchy feeling.</li>
            <li> To help control this, I need an extra strength cleanser with little to no oil-base ingredient, for the eye area.</li>
            <li> And it does sting if you get it in your eyes, so be careful.  </li>
            <li> The sting only lasts a few seconds though.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> There are other things, Restasis and liquid tears that are part of the regimen.</li>
            <li> I have been suffering from blepharitis for several years and have tried hard to overcome this problem.  </li>
            <li> This shipment not as foamy as previous despite vigorous shaking.</li>
            <li> Generates fewer waste items too (pads or cotton balls or tips).</li>
            <li> I have chronic dry eye due to Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome, and my eyes tend to be at their worst first thing in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I have an inside eyelid wart that itches, weeps, burns and generally drives me nearly crazy at times.</li>
            <li> It is hard to overstate the utility of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All sorts of surgery and medication have just made it worse.</li>
            <li> This is a lifetime affliction that has been made worse by surgery.</li>
            <li> , I just wish it wasn&#x27;t soooooooo expensive.</li>
            <li> Product was recommended by my eye doctor, but is sometimes difficult to find in drug stores.  </li>
            <li> It is not sticky or uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> In addition, the use of foam in the dispenser and cotton rounds makes this about 25% as expensive as buying Ocusoft packets.</li>
            <li> The commonly-available and rather expensive wipes aren&#x27;t quite up to the task.</li>
            <li> But this silly foam stuff keeps me from flipping out when the wart is especially annoying due to the acid-y by-products causing inflammation of the eyelid.</li>
            <li> I was desperate and at my wits end until I thought  of searching for the item on Amazon</li>
            <li> Expensive for what you get!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product before but the odor in this shipment is unpleasant.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use this because if my Doctor&#x27;s suggestion and it does help.  It is easy &amp; convenient to use, I just wish it wasn&#x27;t soooooooo expensive.</li>
            <li> Product was recommended by my eye doctor, but is sometimes difficult to find in drug stores.  Much easier to buy on-line.  A bit pricey, but seems to be effective.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best for chronic dry eye sufferers</li>
            <li> I have been suffering from blepharitis for several years and have tried hard to overcome this problem.  Although it has not cured my condition, ocusoft eyelid cleanser has given me more relief than anything else I have tried until now.[[ASIN:B000Q8ISXM Ocusoft Eyelid Scrub Foaming Plus Eyelid Cleanser - 50 Ml]]</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended an eyelid scrub and gave me some pads, but the foam is better. Many stores do not carry the foam or overprice it, but the CLE price is very competitive.    If you clean your fingers carefully then you can use the foam on your finger for the scrub, which is much more comfortable for me than the pads. Generates fewer waste items too (pads or cotton balls or tips).</li>
            <li> I would like to give this product a stellar review, but the truth is that I wouldn&#x27;t purchase any of these over-the-counter treatments for blepharitis. Over the years I have tried LOTS of them in hopes of relieving the itching and redness. In the end, none of them truly work. After voicing frustration to my doctor, she said that she just attended a seminar where a handful of doctors were having good luck with a new prescription medication. It is not on the Kaiser formulary, but my doctor said she would write a prescription for me anyway if I wanted to pay for it myself. So I did. It works very well as long as you realize that it is not a cure -- it is a maintenance treatment. (There is no complete cure for blepharitis at this time.) This new prescription product is quite soothing. Please note that it isn&#x27;t available at pharmacies yet -- you have to order it from their online website store. I am giving Ocusoft more than one star because the seller appears to be very responsible.</li>
            <li> My ophthalmologist suggested I use this daily in the shower to keep from getting reoccurring blepharitis (infection of the eyelids). It has worked fine; no sting, and I leave it on while I&#x27;m showering. It does not need to be rinsed.</li>
            <li> It was sent to me very quickly and as usual the product is everything I need.</li>
            <li> I like it better than the pre moistened pads, fast &amp; easy to use.  Works well</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this works so well but it does.  I have chronic dry eye due to Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome, and my eyes tend to be at their worst first thing in the morning.  I noticed a difference after the first day that I used this.  Although my eyes are still somewhat irritated in the mornings, they don&#x27;t have that gritty feeling to them.  I have also had less incidences of checking to make sure there wasn&#x27;t an eyelash or something in my eye only to find nothing.  I don&#x27;t know how this stuff works but it does.  I recommend it!</li>
            <li> Excellent for eye care. I purchased this for my 6 yr old daughter it is gentle and safe for her to use I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product does a fantastic job removing residue of dried eyedrops, tears, and other secretions/debris from the eyelids. As a result, the eyes are not chronically irritated by this residue, which normal washing with soap and water does not remove. So the whites of the eyes are whiter and less red, and the eyes do not have that itchy feeling. And it is not necessary to use eye drops as frequently.  The product does not sting the eyes if you get some of it in your eyes. It does not feel good, but it is not terribly unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I learned about this product by accident; I was completely unaware of this product or similar products. The enthusiastic reviews of this product that I read on Amazon are entirely justified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what I do: I quickly depress the plunger on top of the bottle to dispense some foam into the cupped palm of my hand. Then, I use my index finger to scoop up half the foam  and gently rub it across the eyelid of one closed eye. Then, I use my index finger to scoop up the rest of the foam and gently rub it across the eyelid of the other closed eye. The product is a liquid that is converted to foam by quickly passing through a nozzle, so it is necessary to apply the product  to the eyelids without delay. Then, I gently rub back and forth  sideways on the eyelids as if massaging the product into the eyelids. Then, I rinse my eyelids with warm water to remove the excess product and debris that has been loosened by the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product not only removes the debris, it seems to act as a skin moisturizer and conditioner for the eyelids. So your eyes feel clean and fresh in a way that I had not experienced for MANY years. I do this in the morning after I have showered and washed my face with soap and water, and I do it in the evening. It is hard to overstate the utility of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the product in this manner, my first bottle lasted nine weeks. So the cost no problem, especially considering how valuable the product is.in this way the cost is not bad.</li>
            <li> Required for use with prosthesis; have used this product for 5 years. This shipment not as foamy as previous despite vigorous shaking.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by our eye doctor to use for dandruff of the eye. My husband uses it when this occurs.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my eye doctor. It cleans the bacteria that builds up on my eyelashes that cause eye irritation.</li>
            <li> This product works great for my eye condition.</li>
            <li> Great service And a great product that really works. Much better than the other stuff as this stays on and moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Feels sticky on the eyelids?</li>
            <li> I have blepharitis, which is a condition where oil ducts inside the eyelids can clog and cause problems. To help control this, I need an extra strength cleanser with little to no oil-base ingredient, for the eye area. I buy inexpensive, soft gauze pads and cut into little squares for applying the foam with a little extra scrubbing. This method removes makeup very well.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my optometrist, this is  a handy product for eyelid cleansing. It does not sting or burn, and has emolient properties to condition the skin around the eye.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for this product all over after the regular drug stores stop selling the product.  I was desperate and at my wits end until I thought  of searching for the item on Amazon and wow there it was.  Thanks Amazon for helping locate the product.&lt;br /&gt;I will be back to shop!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;My eyes are truly loving the product.  It helps so much during allergy season for me.</li>
            <li> My opthomologist gave me a sample.  It&#x27;s the only thing that dealt with my dry morning eyes. There are other things, Restasis and liquid tears that are part of the regimen.</li>
            <li> recommended by my opthmalogist and works better than the one that is not plus</li>
            <li> My clinician recommended this.  It can be left on, no rinse required.  There is a noticeable residue, but it is OK.  It is not sticky or uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> My dr recommended washing my lids as part of treating my dry eyes. I used Johnson&#x27;s baby shampoo for a while but thought this might be better.. I still don&#x27;t get the link between washing the outside of your lid and dry eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This foam seems to work, but if it gets in my eyes it burns. Seems very off for a product designed to use on your lids. I&#x27;ll go back to the baby shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is a nice alternative to the wipes and even may provide a better bang for the buck.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, but I prefer a soap that I wash off.  Baby shampoo works fine for me and costs less.</li>
            <li> I have meibomian gland dysfunction. I switched from water-based eye drops to lubricant eye drops with a lot of improvement.  The later addition of Ocusoft  to my regimen did the trick.  My eyes feel wonderful all day with only two to three applications of eye drops as  opposed to using drops every few hours.</li>
            <li> Why would you need it and why would it cost so much?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to be luxurious and soothing.  I have an inside eyelid wart that itches, weeps, burns and generally drives me nearly crazy at times. All sorts of surgery and medication have just made it worse. This is a lifetime affliction that has been made worse by surgery. But this silly foam stuff keeps me from flipping out when the wart is especially annoying due to the acid-y by-products causing inflammation of the eyelid.</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended this cleanser for everyday use in keeping eyelids clean.  The product is gentle, yet does the job in cleaning off oils, makeup, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product before but the odor in this shipment is unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I have blepharitis.  Ocusoft plus helps me keep it under control.  I like this product better than other lid scrubs I have tried.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent Lid Scrub and is different from the other version in that the foam does not need to be rinsed off.  This is particularly useful for trips and the size is small for easy packing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using a couple of weeks, but I do feel that it has helped my blepharitis.  It is easy to use, but it does sting a little if you get it into your eye.  I like that you don&#x27;t have to rinse it off.</li>
            <li> Have used for years. Works great.</li>
            <li> Same price as the 7.5 ounce -- about 225 ml as opposed to 50.  Is this really that concentrated?  Concentrated at all?  If so why don&#x27;t they market both in ounces or both in ml?</li>
            <li> Recommended by eye doctor. Works well.</li>
            <li> Works as described and priced to sell.</li>
            <li> very happy with product and seller</li>
            <li> This stuff works so well for removing all makeup, eye makeup included.  It was a bonus for me as I have an eye infection my doctor wanted scrubbed each day with this scrub.</li>
            <li> The foam works so much better than the individual packets, and the foam plus does not dry my tissues out and make things worse. I have troublesome eye allergies, and this product helps keep my eyes clean and comfortable by cleaning off the film and exudate from the allergic response. I&#x27;d recommend it for anyone with itchy eye allergies.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t remove makeup like the original lid wipes do.  I have very sensitive eyes and this was recommended by my eye doctor, but I much prefer the lid wipe originals to this foam.</li>
            <li> Great for using in the shower for ocular rosacia!</li>
            <li> It has help with my dry eyes..</li>
            <li> It  got damaged  in the mail.</li>
            <li> The plus is not as good as the regular. But love this product. Did not purchase from Amazon but will this time. For people allergic there is a baby gentle eyelid cleaner that is fabulous and will not burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This removes all the eye drop buildup or night gunk!!  Especially helps severe dry eyes!</li>
            <li> There are two versions of OcuSoft Foam: Original and Plus. The product here is Plus. It is designed to be left on and not washed off. It is for more severe problems. On their web site OcuSoft recommends using it for two weeks and then switching to Original for long term. PLus also contains a moisturizer. But customer service at OcuSoft said even for dry skin the Original was recommended unless there is some severe problem that needs the Plus. See [...] I don&#x27;t believe the Plus is available in the 215 ML (7-1/4 oz) size, only 50 ML. I have been using Plus to start but will try switching to Original because it is cheaper and i don&#x27;t need to leave it on. This is a superb product.</li>
            <li> Good for cleaning my eyelid.</li>
            <li> Happy with.product and shipping time.</li>
            <li> This really helps reduce blephritis redness.  You also don&#x27;t need to rinse this off after application, so the scrub has longer to work on you lids.  I use the packets for travel, but this lives in my shower so I remember to use it all the time.</li>
            <li> Great for blepharitis treatment and prevention.  I like the Plus because you can leave it on after application and it continues to work. In addition, the use of foam in the dispenser and cotton rounds makes this about 25% as expensive as buying Ocusoft packets.</li>
            <li> I have blepharitis, an inflammation in the eyelid area, and use this product twice a day to keep it under control.  Really relieves the itch!!</li>
            <li> was allergic to it - sent it back!</li>
            <li> Nothing else has worked as well for treating my blepharitis as this. Every morning/night I first close my eyes and cup warm water to them to loosen any particles, then rinse, then put on this foam, then rinse. More expensive than the original formula but definitely works better.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful eye cleaner.  I use it after I take my makeup off.  After I wash my face, but before I put on my nighttime cream.  I love the fact that you wipe it on and leave it; no need to rinse off.  I have very sensitive eyes and it did not irritate me at all.  Dry eye is quite annoying but this is a great help to alleviate the problem.  Couple this with Systane eye drops and life is grand!</li>
            <li> AAAAA+  -- THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> After a lengthy eye infection finally cleared up my eyelids now get itchy and crusty. The commonly-available and rather expensive wipes aren&#x27;t quite up to the task. While price-checking the wipes I came upon this product, and hope Amazon carries it forever because it&#x27;s great. I use it after my shower and the medication stays on my lids and works for a long time afterwards, even overnight.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and utilized before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received within 7 days.</li>
            <li> I bought this on the recommendation of my ophthalmologist. It works great and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eye. It helped clear up my blepharitis.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  The \\&quot;Plus\\&quot; version can be kept on, while the \\&quot;Original\\&quot; version (with a darker blue label) must be washed off.  Unfortunately most sellers don&#x27;t know there are two different kinds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have incorrectly received the \\&quot;Original\\&quot; version instead of \\&quot;Plus\\&quot; from the following sellers: \\&quot;Shop CLE\\&quot;, \\&quot;Buy It Now\\&quot;, and \\&quot;Since 1901\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These sellers have sent the CORRECT version: \\&quot;Interspective LLC\\&quot;, \\&quot;AC Lens\\&quot;, \\&quot;1-888-248-LENS\\&quot;, and \\&quot;BigFlySports\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Does the job but will dry out eyelids if I use more than 3x&#x27;s week</li>
            <li> This leave-on foam brought a wonderful lessening of my blepharitis.  Applied every night and will continue indefinitely.  My eye doctor is soooo pleased!  It is amazing that I could not find it in any local pharmacy after trying seven of them.</li>
            <li> I liked it but will not buy anymore because shipping makes it too expensive.</li>
            <li> After only 4 days of using OcuSoft Lid Scrub Foam Plus, my chronic blepharitis and dry eye are finally on the run!  For months I&#x27;ve struggled with gritty pink/red eyes.  Endless rounds of antibiotic ointment and drops worked only as long as I kept applying them, which is not a practical long-term plan.  I finally did some Internet research, and learned more about my condition than three ophthalmologists ever told me.&lt;br /&gt;The makers of OcuSoft have a short video on their website that shows the proper way to use this product, and I recommend watching that.  It explains that not only does this foam clean the lids, but that as you apply it, you should massage your lids in a certain way to help clear the tiny oil glands that line the lid rim.  This will help return those glands to normal functioning, creating normal tears that prevent dry eye.&lt;br /&gt;I actually look forward to using this product twice a day, because it makes my eyes feel so refreshed.  And today, for the first time in many weeks, I will go to the office with clear, bright eyes!</li>
            <li> My mother, aged 103, found this enhanced formula safe and effective for helping to relieve her dry itchy eyelids. The regular formula wasn&#x27;t quite enough but will be good for maintenance.</li>
            <li> Expensive for what you get!</li>
            <li> Arrived a day early!  New, sealed, unopened perfect!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a while because of ocular rosacea and even though this condition has always getting its set backs, I still consider it useful to control the dry eyes with this product.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for it.</li>
            <li> Does what it claims to do.  My eye doctor recommended this foam and although it burns at times, it has helped my problem.</li>
            <li> The ocusoft lid scrub foam regular is just as effective at a significant savings.  Would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Wanted to try this for my blepharitis. Not sure if my lids are just especially sensitive, but this product left them stinging, more itchy, more swollen, and more flaky than they had been. Do not recommend, does not seem gentle enough for skin around eyes.</li>
            <li> No foam.....just liquid.</li>
            <li> This helps clear out the remaining bits of eyeliner and mascara after washing my face, but I can&#x27;t say that&#x27;s it helped my dry, scratchy eyes at all.  And it does sting if you get it in your eyes, so be careful.  The sting only lasts a few seconds though.</li>
            <li> The foam is thinner than the scrub  I purchased from another supplier.</li>
            <li> I have Sj√∂gren&#x27;s Syndrome and have to keep my eyelids very clean. I find the product non-irritating even when I use it two times a day.</li>
