            <li>I love these!</li>
            <li>I have never used one but according to her, they are pretty awesome.</li>
            <li>Have been using it for 2 weeks and loving it.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;i gave one to my hygienist she had not seen them before, and liked the look</li>
            <li>With the radius you get a nice mouthful of a massage that scrubs the teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these toothbrushes for over five years and they are much more than good looking.  </li>
            <li>and I am very glad to be able to get them through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>They massage your gums too, keeping them nice and healthy.</li>
            <li>By far the best toothbrush in the world.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best toothbrush I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a good clean, spring for an electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The handle is very comfortable and</li>
            <li>The arrangement of the bristles seems overly large but it is a joy in your mouth.  </li>
            <li>As a 30 yr plus user of this product I am more than qualified to rate &amp; comment on this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s &#x27;okay&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>Gums are healthy too.</li>
            <li>I love these</li>
            <li>You will not find a better tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to love this toothbrush, but it&#x27;s just a pain to use.</li>
            <li>I have used the Radius toothbrush for many years.</li>
            <li>I am glad I found them on Amazon.</li>
            <li>so welli am glad i invested in them.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps if the handle was a bit longer I would like it much better.</li>
            <li>most Americans, I have a big mouth and this toothbrush is perfect.</li>
            <li>It cleans more teeth all at once</li>
            <li>and I dont have to work to brush my teeth any more</li>
            <li>- I always buy more for my family members and Christmas day</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>Also I appreciate the way the toothbrush fits in my hand, putting me more in control.</li>
            <li>I was expecting more for the price.</li>
            <li>I love them and I will continue to use them, give them as gifts and hope that I can maintain a healthy mouth for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li>Fantastic toothbrush!</li>
            <li>and it keeps your gums really healthy because you HAVE to brush them.  </li>
            <li>The &#x27;feel&#x27; of the RADIUS makes it my favorite toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something to travel with, you&#x27;re better off looking elsewhere.</li>
            <li>She used to love these types of brushes years ago and was upset when GNC stopped carrying them.</li>
            <li>Great to have extras on hand or for the whole family.</li>
            <li>Love them.  </li>
            <li>but I am in love now.</li>
            <li>I love these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>They are a great design and they are very sturdy.  </li>
            <li>You use to be able to buy them at the drugstore</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>It is a good brush and the price is also very reasonable for the type and quality of the brush.</li>
            <li>but it is wonderful and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Best toothbrushes I&#x27;v ever used, huge surface area compared to regular toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>Is more comfortable in your hand, gentler on the gums and more thorough on the tongue.</li>
            <li>Amazon offers a great price on these tooth brushes, which are my favorite in the  hand held variety.</li>
            <li>These clean your teeth and gums!  </li>
            <li>They have an excellent design, colors are beautiful, bristles are soft, and because the bristle area is big, it really does a better job, and are paraben free!</li>
            <li>Wish they were available at more stores.</li>
            <li>Really love the product and really great price at that.... will be looking forward to plenty more purchases like this in the future.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had excellent check ups for the past five years, especially healthy gums because this brush is soft and flexible and really gives your gums a nice workout.  </li>
            <li>It was like the first love, never forget it!</li>
            <li>I purchased these for my mother who is 80, and she found them so easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>Love these toothbrushes they clean my teeth</li>
            <li>Easy to grip and use with an angle to the brush that makes cleaning your teeth easy.</li>
            <li>I love these toothbrushes and feel like they get my gums clean..</li>
            <li>They are so easy to brush with.</li>
            <li>Was happy to seem them sold in sets as it was a much better value than purchasing them individually in the store.</li>
            <li>Your gums and teeth both get a great scrubbing with the nice, wide brush.</li>
            <li>Let me just state that this radius toothbrush is hands down the best toothbrush I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how huge these were.  </li>
            <li>Great product but will not last the advertised 9 mo as stated.</li>
            <li>And BTW I have not received any free product in return for my review.</li>
            <li>I have never taken great care of my teeth and this has definitely inspired me to start.</li>
            <li>These brushes are fantastic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy I finally found them!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable to hold</li>
            <li>and have been cavity free.</li>
            <li>so I have been looking for a good soft toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Okay, so at first if you&#x27;ve never used one of these brushes you&#x27;ll look at it and go &amp;#34;yeah</li>
            <li>Gets my teeth really clean.</li>
            <li>They really clean your teeth and gums well.</li>
            <li>Will never use the tradtional brushes again, except to clean grout.</li>
            <li>It does a great job at cleaning teeth and gums with minimal effort.  </li>
            <li>They clean extraordinarily well massaging the gums as you go.</li>
            <li>They are just way cool</li>
            <li>Comfortable to use and a pleasure to brush with as they clean your whole mouth while brushing!</li>
            <li>Came quickly.</li>
            <li>Although I use an electric toothbrush, the Scuba is super for those mornings when you wake up feeling like a camel died in your mouth.  </li>
            <li>right, this is for brushing out a horses mane, not for brushing my dainty little teeth!&amp;#34</li>
            <li>It fits comfortably in your hand and is very gentle on your gums and teeth.</li>
            <li>Easy to hold and manage, and they really get in there and get it done.  </li>
            <li>They really are easy to grip.  </li>
            <li>Just the best I know, the amazing Radius toothbrushes are - for my knowledge - impossible to find in Europe</li>
            <li>Yes these toothbrushes are HUGE but my gums noticeably do not bleed as much when I floss.  </li>
            <li>also the bristles are kind to my sensitive teeth and gums, while still cleaning very well.</li>
            <li>Really love the soft bristles.  </li>
            <li>But once you get used to them, because they are really big, they clean more of the surface of your teeth.</li>
            <li>You will not be sorry if you try it its the best toothbrush ever, your teeth have never felt so clean.</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t feel right anymore.  </li>
            <li>They are very easy to grip and use versus her standard Sonicare electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>sure to choose a right VS left handed handle when buying.</li>
            <li>It is a little like brushing your teeth with a hair brush but that is the good thing.</li>
            <li>highly recommend to try this out!!</li>
            <li>My wife and kids love these tooth brushed.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I got passed my initial hesitations and kept trying it.</li>
            <li>Brushed your teeth faster, and more thoroughly than skinny toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>I got my first Radius Scuba in the 1997.</li>
            <li>I first purchase mine at Wholefoods having decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>The brush covers a larger area and does a better job getting between the teeth.</li>
            <li>Make sure you buy the correct grip--right hand or left hand.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using one since I first saw Whoopi use it in &amp;#34;Ghosts.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so much cleaner!</li>
            <li>they ain&#x27;t cheap compared to a one or two or three dollar supermarket toothbrush, but the size of the brushing surface, the ergonomic comfort of the handle, and the longevity of the bristles themselves (the 6 month lifespan is about right) make them well worth the extra money</li>
            <li>love the way these toothbrushes fit in the hand and flex a little when you use them......</li>
            <li>I was sort of weirded out by how large they are at first</li>
            <li>You need a new toothbrush case though, won&#x27;t fit in a normal one.</li>
            <li>and I still found the head waaay too large and the handle cumbersome to maneuver.</li>
            <li>I really dig this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say it&#x27;s a setback</li>
            <li>Love the wide head on this brush.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t really zero in on any teeth area because of the way it&#x27;s constructed.  </li>
            <li>the brushes have always been comfortable to handle, and the actual brush has never been abrasive.</li>
            <li>But this really cleans and feels well.</li>
            <li>It really gets your gums simultaneously with your teeth.</li>
            <li>It is gently working on my gums as well as teeth.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping from seller as well.</li>
            <li>This brush is gentle and yet very thorough in it&#x27;s cleaning of you</li>
            <li>I have been using these toothbrushes for a couple of years and my dental checkups are much improved.</li>
            <li>This is such amazingly simple product and so effective.  </li>
            <li>Also, if you are physically compromised in a way that effects your ability to grasp, or move these toothbrushes are very useful.  </li>
            <li>Yes, I would recommend if you are willing to try something new.</li>
            <li>and I believe are made with better materials than all of those other substandard brushes.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m quirky like that and enjoy trying new things.</li>
            <li>The taste of plastic is unmistakable to me, and the overly large brush head (which, to its credit, probably does make it more effective) is equally awkward to brush with.  </li>
            <li>Lasts much longer than normal brushes.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t live without radius tooth brush!</li>
            <li>but more like a jaw exercise as I have to open my mouth wider to reach the back row teeth.</li>
            <li>It kind of made it hard to brush my teeth.  </li>
            <li>By the time you are finished, your entire mouth feels fresh.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that they last much longer than conventional brushes, and just &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; better in your hands and on your gums.</li>
            <li>Based upon the company website, I bought this for my son who loves new design.</li>
            <li>RADIUS has seriously ruined it for me, they made this amazing brush</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s awkward at first, but it&#x27;s a much better clean when you brush with these.</li>
            <li>They may seem a little pricey but they last much longer than most</li>
            <li>First off--they are really big and that takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li>children also were excited when I purchased the smaller child-size Radius toothbrushes for them and even fought over who could use the third adult-sized brush (comes in a three pack).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the feel in my mouth, knowing that I am covering more territory than with my usual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Well to be honest I tried with a high quality brush I bought from Walgreens but that made the pain of not having my Radius even worse, and money</li>
            <li>I like them because while the bristles are soft because they are a larger toothbrush, you just feel like your teeth are getting extra clean.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had these brushes for less than a month, used one every day and, at this point, am satisfied.</li>
            <li>like how it cleans your teeth and gums at same time with large head</li>
            <li>the Radius toothbrush and continuing to use the sensitive toothpaste</li>
            <li>max.&lt;br /&gt;Bristles begin to flatten &amp; thus lose their effectiveness almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;Using the soft bristle version recommended by Dentists.</li>
            <li>at least twenty or more years ago, i received one of these brushes either in the mail, or maybe it was a gift.</li>
            <li>I don’t completely dislike these toothbrushes</li>
            <li>I would recommend just sticking with the old fashioned Colgate toothbrushes you can buy at Wal-Mart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Straight back to the Radius</li>
            <li>and I found that my gum line doesn&#x27;t bleed as much when I use this brush regularly.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d think that a larger brush head would be less conducive to fine scrubbing and cleaning.</li>
            <li>you have a small mouth, this might not be the brush for you--unless you literally want to brush top and bottom at the same time.</li>
            <li>RADIUS toothbrush has a very large coverage area with the bristles, opposite the way many other companies use a small, focused brush.  </li>
            <li>I must have a small mouth, because it is still rather arkward brushing my teeth with the huge head on this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I love the big surface area and soft bristles but its hard to use on the inner surface of your bottom teeth without spraying tooth paste all over the place.</li>
            <li>Try one and you will never go back to the old regular toothbrush!</li>
            <li>; I was a little hesitant at first</li>
            <li>Using a sensitive toothpaste with other toothbrushes still gave me sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>I bought these due to the rave reviews, and I&#x27;m always one to try something new.  </li>

            <li> The handle is very comfortable and</li>
            <li> The arrangement of the bristles seems overly large but it is a joy in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> As a 30 yr plus user of this product I am more than qualified to rate &amp; comment on this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s &#x27;okay&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> Gums are healthy too.</li>
            <li> I love these</li>
            <li> You will not find a better tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to love this toothbrush, but it&#x27;s just a pain to use.</li>
            <li> I have used the Radius toothbrush for many years.</li>
            <li> I am glad I found them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> so welli am glad i invested in them.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps if the handle was a bit longer I would like it much better.</li>
            <li> most Americans, I have a big mouth and this toothbrush is perfect.</li>
            <li> It cleans more teeth all at once</li>
            <li> and I dont have to work to brush my teeth any more</li>
            <li> - I always buy more for my family members and Christmas day</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> Also I appreciate the way the toothbrush fits in my hand, putting me more in control.</li>
            <li> I was expecting more for the price.</li>
            <li> I love them and I will continue to use them, give them as gifts and hope that I can maintain a healthy mouth for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> Fantastic toothbrush!</li>
            <li> and it keeps your gums really healthy because you HAVE to brush them.  </li>
            <li> The &#x27;feel&#x27; of the RADIUS makes it my favorite toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something to travel with, you&#x27;re better off looking elsewhere.</li>
            <li> She used to love these types of brushes years ago and was upset when GNC stopped carrying them.</li>
            <li> Great to have extras on hand or for the whole family.</li>
            <li> Love them.  </li>
            <li> but I am in love now.</li>
            <li> I love these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> They are a great design and they are very sturdy.  </li>
            <li> You use to be able to buy them at the drugstore</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> It is a good brush and the price is also very reasonable for the type and quality of the brush.</li>
            <li> but it is wonderful and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrushes I&#x27;v ever used, huge surface area compared to regular toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Is more comfortable in your hand, gentler on the gums and more thorough on the tongue.</li>
            <li> Amazon offers a great price on these tooth brushes, which are my favorite in the  hand held variety.</li>
            <li> These clean your teeth and gums!  </li>
            <li> They have an excellent design, colors are beautiful, bristles are soft, and because the bristle area is big, it really does a better job, and are paraben free!</li>
            <li> Wish they were available at more stores.</li>
            <li> Really love the product and really great price at that.... will be looking forward to plenty more purchases like this in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had excellent check ups for the past five years, especially healthy gums because this brush is soft and flexible and really gives your gums a nice workout.  </li>
            <li> It was like the first love, never forget it!</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my mother who is 80, and she found them so easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> Love these toothbrushes they clean my teeth</li>
            <li> Easy to grip and use with an angle to the brush that makes cleaning your teeth easy.</li>
            <li> I love these toothbrushes and feel like they get my gums clean..</li>
            <li> They are so easy to brush with.</li>
            <li> Was happy to seem them sold in sets as it was a much better value than purchasing them individually in the store.</li>
            <li> Your gums and teeth both get a great scrubbing with the nice, wide brush.</li>
            <li> Let me just state that this radius toothbrush is hands down the best toothbrush I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how huge these were.  </li>
            <li> Great product but will not last the advertised 9 mo as stated.</li>
            <li> And BTW I have not received any free product in return for my review.</li>
            <li> I have never taken great care of my teeth and this has definitely inspired me to start.</li>
            <li> These brushes are fantastic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy I finally found them!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable to hold</li>
            <li> and have been cavity free.</li>
            <li> so I have been looking for a good soft toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Okay, so at first if you&#x27;ve never used one of these brushes you&#x27;ll look at it and go &amp;#34;yeah</li>
            <li> Gets my teeth really clean.</li>
            <li> They really clean your teeth and gums well.</li>
            <li> Will never use the tradtional brushes again, except to clean grout.</li>
            <li> It does a great job at cleaning teeth and gums with minimal effort.  </li>
            <li> They clean extraordinarily well massaging the gums as you go.</li>
            <li> They are just way cool</li>
            <li> Comfortable to use and a pleasure to brush with as they clean your whole mouth while brushing!</li>
            <li> Came quickly.</li>
            <li> Although I use an electric toothbrush, the Scuba is super for those mornings when you wake up feeling like a camel died in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> right, this is for brushing out a horses mane, not for brushing my dainty little teeth!&amp;#34</li>
            <li> It fits comfortably in your hand and is very gentle on your gums and teeth.</li>
            <li> Easy to hold and manage, and they really get in there and get it done.  </li>
            <li> They really are easy to grip.  </li>
            <li> Just the best I know, the amazing Radius toothbrushes are - for my knowledge - impossible to find in Europe</li>
            <li> Yes these toothbrushes are HUGE but my gums noticeably do not bleed as much when I floss.  </li>
            <li> also the bristles are kind to my sensitive teeth and gums, while still cleaning very well.</li>
            <li> Really love the soft bristles.  </li>
            <li> But once you get used to them, because they are really big, they clean more of the surface of your teeth.</li>
            <li> You will not be sorry if you try it its the best toothbrush ever, your teeth have never felt so clean.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t feel right anymore.  </li>
            <li> They are very easy to grip and use versus her standard Sonicare electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> sure to choose a right VS left handed handle when buying.</li>
            <li> It is a little like brushing your teeth with a hair brush but that is the good thing.</li>
            <li> highly recommend to try this out!!</li>
            <li> My wife and kids love these tooth brushed.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I got passed my initial hesitations and kept trying it.</li>
            <li> Brushed your teeth faster, and more thoroughly than skinny toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> I got my first Radius Scuba in the 1997.</li>
            <li> I first purchase mine at Wholefoods having decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> The brush covers a larger area and does a better job getting between the teeth.</li>
            <li> Make sure you buy the correct grip--right hand or left hand.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using one since I first saw Whoopi use it in &amp;#34;Ghosts.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner!</li>
            <li> they ain&#x27;t cheap compared to a one or two or three dollar supermarket toothbrush, but the size of the brushing surface, the ergonomic comfort of the handle, and the longevity of the bristles themselves (the 6 month lifespan is about right) make them well worth the extra money</li>
            <li> love the way these toothbrushes fit in the hand and flex a little when you use them......</li>
            <li> I was sort of weirded out by how large they are at first</li>
            <li> You need a new toothbrush case though, won&#x27;t fit in a normal one.</li>
            <li> and I still found the head waaay too large and the handle cumbersome to maneuver.</li>
            <li> I really dig this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say it&#x27;s a setback</li>
            <li> Love the wide head on this brush.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really zero in on any teeth area because of the way it&#x27;s constructed.  </li>
            <li> the brushes have always been comfortable to handle, and the actual brush has never been abrasive.</li>
            <li> But this really cleans and feels well.</li>
            <li> It really gets your gums simultaneously with your teeth.</li>
            <li> It is gently working on my gums as well as teeth.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping from seller as well.</li>
            <li> This brush is gentle and yet very thorough in it&#x27;s cleaning of you</li>
            <li> I have been using these toothbrushes for a couple of years and my dental checkups are much improved.</li>
            <li> This is such amazingly simple product and so effective.  </li>
            <li> Also, if you are physically compromised in a way that effects your ability to grasp, or move these toothbrushes are very useful.  </li>
            <li> Yes, I would recommend if you are willing to try something new.</li>
            <li> and I believe are made with better materials than all of those other substandard brushes.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m quirky like that and enjoy trying new things.</li>
            <li> The taste of plastic is unmistakable to me, and the overly large brush head (which, to its credit, probably does make it more effective) is equally awkward to brush with.  </li>
            <li> Lasts much longer than normal brushes.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t live without radius tooth brush!</li>
            <li> but more like a jaw exercise as I have to open my mouth wider to reach the back row teeth.</li>
            <li> It kind of made it hard to brush my teeth.  </li>
            <li> By the time you are finished, your entire mouth feels fresh.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that they last much longer than conventional brushes, and just &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; better in your hands and on your gums.</li>
            <li> Based upon the company website, I bought this for my son who loves new design.</li>
            <li> RADIUS has seriously ruined it for me, they made this amazing brush</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awkward at first, but it&#x27;s a much better clean when you brush with these.</li>
            <li> They may seem a little pricey but they last much longer than most</li>
            <li> First off--they are really big and that takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li> children also were excited when I purchased the smaller child-size Radius toothbrushes for them and even fought over who could use the third adult-sized brush (comes in a three pack).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the feel in my mouth, knowing that I am covering more territory than with my usual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Well to be honest I tried with a high quality brush I bought from Walgreens but that made the pain of not having my Radius even worse, and money</li>
            <li> I like them because while the bristles are soft because they are a larger toothbrush, you just feel like your teeth are getting extra clean.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had these brushes for less than a month, used one every day and, at this point, am satisfied.</li>
            <li> like how it cleans your teeth and gums at same time with large head</li>
            <li> the Radius toothbrush and continuing to use the sensitive toothpaste</li>
            <li> max.&lt;br /&gt;Bristles begin to flatten &amp; thus lose their effectiveness almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;Using the soft bristle version recommended by Dentists.</li>
            <li> at least twenty or more years ago, i received one of these brushes either in the mail, or maybe it was a gift.</li>
            <li> I don’t completely dislike these toothbrushes</li>
            <li> I would recommend just sticking with the old fashioned Colgate toothbrushes you can buy at Wal-Mart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Straight back to the Radius</li>
            <li> and I found that my gum line doesn&#x27;t bleed as much when I use this brush regularly.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d think that a larger brush head would be less conducive to fine scrubbing and cleaning.</li>
            <li> you have a small mouth, this might not be the brush for you--unless you literally want to brush top and bottom at the same time.</li>
            <li> RADIUS toothbrush has a very large coverage area with the bristles, opposite the way many other companies use a small, focused brush.  </li>
            <li> I must have a small mouth, because it is still rather arkward brushing my teeth with the huge head on this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love the big surface area and soft bristles but its hard to use on the inner surface of your bottom teeth without spraying tooth paste all over the place.</li>
            <li> Try one and you will never go back to the old regular toothbrush!</li>
            <li> ; I was a little hesitant at first</li>
            <li> Using a sensitive toothpaste with other toothbrushes still gave me sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> I bought these due to the rave reviews, and I&#x27;m always one to try something new.  </li>
            <li> That way you will always have a replacement when the first one loses bristle firmness.</li>
            <li> needless to say, i have purchased many, when they were sold in my local cvs, for gifts to my brothers and other family members and friends.</li>
            <li> I refer to this toothbrush as my toilet brush for teeth!  </li>
            <li> Lasts a long time too.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying these for a few years, and I&#x27;ll never go back to a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I only use the Philips in combination, as the dentist says the sonic vibrations are needed to agitate just below the gum-line without hurting (e.g. apply no significant pressure with the Philips), while a manual toothbrush simply can&#x27;t get there without causing some damage to the gums due to pressure needed.</li>
            <li> I realized that my teeth are cleaner because I brush a little longer then usual, of course the 6500 soft bristles plays a big part.</li>
            <li> Smaller toothbrushes have a psychological effect of making you want to press hard.  </li>
            <li> My husband never cared for the size of them, but I&#x27;ll never go back to a small brush.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the glowing reviews but have found it difficult to use because of the large size.</li>
            <li> She was having such a hard time grasping a tradtional toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> On average about 3-6 mo.</li>
            <li> I have used these toothbrushes for at least ten years now.  </li>
            <li> even though it looks a little odd!</li>
            <li> all you have to do is put them in a cup of peroxide for a few once a week to keep them on point.  </li>
            <li> The only con of buying this was that it is expensive compared to other brushes.</li>
            <li> and I could not imagine brushing with one of those little ordinary brushes again after using these.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also difficult to brush as is often suggested - down and up from the gum - because it&#x27;s too big to maneuver in the mouth that way, at least in my mouth.</li>
            <li> With very little pressing it does the job.  </li>
            <li> I have been using radius products for past 8 years and they have always exceeded all my expectations.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go back to using small brushes as they now feel weird!</li>
            <li> My dentist is always telling me I brush too hard</li>
            <li> but it is hard to find them at a store anymore</li>
            <li> Use the Philips once a day, while I use the RADIUS at least two times per day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I did temporarily switch back to a regular style brush just to see and hated, HATED it!</li>
            <li> I was unable to find them in the retail store where I had always purchased them.</li>
            <li> but it has become increasingly difficult to find.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was grossly disappointed with them.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Using a sensitive toothpaste with other toothbrushes still gave me sensitive teeth.  No lemons - no ice, thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Radius toothbrush and continuing to use the sensitive toothpaste, I have welcomed lemons and ice back into my diet.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t live without radius tooth brush! best tooth brush ever. highly recommend to try this out!! if you haven&#x27;t yet!</li>
            <li> Great product but will not last the advertised 9 mo as stated. On average about 3-6 mo. max.&lt;br /&gt;Bristles begin to flatten &amp; thus lose their effectiveness almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;Using the soft bristle version recommended by Dentists. As a 30 yr plus user of this product I am more than qualified to rate &amp; comment on this product. Let me just state that this radius toothbrush is hands down the best toothbrush I have ever used. Just plan on buying several at a time. That way you will always have a replacement when the first one loses bristle firmness. And BTW I have not received any free product in return for my review.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s &#x27;okay&#x27;.  I&#x27;d like to start off by saying I do like this toothbrush, a lot.  It does a great job at cleaning teeth and gums with minimal effort.  However I have to give it a subpar rating because the neck is way too short, I find myself sticking my fist in my mouth or brushing with my mouth open.  Along with a &#x27;regular&#x27; brush, this is no doubt a 5 star.  I have never taken great care of my teeth and this has definitely inspired me to start.</li>
            <li> Its the Best toothbrush Ive Ever try!</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush! Feels like a thorough brushing. Somebody loves my teeth!</li>
            <li> Great for keeping the tarter off your teeth. Gums are healthy too. Wait until you see how good your mouth feels after you use it.</li>
            <li> I love these and so does my dentist.  You will not find a better tooth brush.  Only I wish I could pick my colors</li>
            <li> My wife and kids love these tooth brushed.  Good price.</li>
            <li> I have to say that this toothbrush was totally a different experience. My sister talked me into trying it. First off--they are really big and that takes some getting used to. But once you get used to them, because they are really big, they clean more of the surface of your teeth. I am glad I got passed my initial hesitations and kept trying it. I really dig this toothbrush. I talked my boyfriend into using one now and he likes it too! Spread the word!</li>
            <li> Just the best I know, the amazing Radius toothbrushes are - for my knowledge - impossible to find in Europe</li>
            <li> Have been using it for 2 weeks and loving it. It massages the gum as I brush in circular motions, surprisingly therapeutic. I can&#x27;t really say it&#x27;s a setback but more like a jaw exercise as I have to open my mouth wider to reach the back row teeth. :-D. I realized that my teeth are cleaner because I brush a little longer then usual, of course the 6500 soft bristles plays a big part. It is a good buy. Try it.</li>
            <li> It is a little like brushing your teeth with a hair brush but that is the good thing. This brush gets your gums and your mouth feels great after using it.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these toothbrushes for quite some time and I am very pleased with them. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this toothbrush, but it&#x27;s just a pain to use. I have a big mouth and horse teeth and I still found the head waaay too large and the handle cumbersome to maneuver.</li>
            <li> I have used the Radius toothbrush for many years. I was unable to find them in the retail store where I had always purchased them. It fits comfortably in your hand and is very gentle on your gums and teeth. I am glad I found them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> excellent for brushing teeth. as a rule I do this morning and night. works well in conjunction with tooth paste and copious amounts of water.</li>
            <li> Love the wide head on this brush. Gets my teeth really clean.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the glowing reviews but have found it difficult to use because of the large size.

I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> there is nothing like this experience. at least twenty or more years ago, i received one of these brushes either in the mail, or maybe it was a gift. don&#x27;t quite remember. ever since, it has been a must for me and my children. now they are grown and i provide my grandchildren with this product. the brushes have always been comfortable to handle, and the actual brush has never been abrasive. needless to say, i have purchased many, when they were sold in my local cvs, for gifts to my brothers and other family members and friends. the quality has been above expectations.</li>
            <li> love the way these toothbrushes fit in the hand and flex a little when you use them......also the bristles are kind to my sensitive teeth and gums, while still cleaning very well.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my mother who is 80, and she found them so easy to handle.  She was having such a hard time grasping a tradtional toothbrush.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> i have used these for years, and have had good dental checkups&lt;br /&gt;i gave one to my hygienist she had not seen them before, and liked the look</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d think that a larger brush head would be less conducive to fine scrubbing and cleaning. That assumption couldn&#x27;t be more wrong. These brushes are fantastic. They massage your gums too, keeping them nice and healthy.</li>
            <li> Love these toothbrushes they clean my teeth so welli am glad i invested in them.  There aren&#x27;t any toothbrushes that they compare to because of the way they massage my gums when i brush  Wish they were available at more stores.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect manual toothbrush!</li>
            <li> This is really an awesome toothbrush. The only con of buying this was that it is expensive compared to other brushes. But this really cleans and feels well.</li>
            <li> Brushed your teeth faster, and more thoroughly than skinny toothbrushes.  Also, if you are physically compromised in a way that effects your ability to grasp, or move these toothbrushes are very useful.  I&#x27;ve found that they last much longer than conventional brushes, and just &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; better in your hands and on your gums.</li>
            <li> The brush is well made and all but I cannot help but feel that it can only augment your regular tooth brush and not replace it. With the radius you get a nice mouthful of a massage that scrubs the teeth and gums. Somehow though I feel it does not get into the corners at the back like a regular head brush.</li>
            <li> These are very nice. I&#x27;ve been using them for YEARS. They massage your gums as you&#x27;re brushing. but not too big to injure you.&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to choose a right VS left handed handle when buying.</li>
            <li> Great product and excellent transaction.</li>
            <li> I love the big surface area and soft bristles but its hard to use on the inner surface of your bottom teeth without spraying tooth paste all over the place. Perhaps if the handle was a bit longer I would like it much better.</li>
            <li> Best tooth brush around.Takes care of gums message and teeth.Good price.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrushes I&#x27;v ever used, huge surface area compared to regular toothbrushes. I&#x27;ve been buying these for a few years, and I&#x27;ll never go back to a regular toothbrush. It&#x27;s awkward at first, but it&#x27;s a much better clean when you brush with these. It really gets your gums simultaneously with your teeth.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent toothbrush!  The oversized head massages my gums while it does an execllent job cleaning teeth. The handle is very comfortable and every morning/night I actually look forward to brushing my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like most Americans, I have a big mouth and this toothbrush is perfect. ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My children also were excited when I purchased the smaller child-size Radius toothbrushes for them and even fought over who could use the third adult-sized brush (comes in a three pack).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a small mouth, this might not be the brush for you--unless you literally want to brush top and bottom at the same time.</li>
            <li> My fiance loves these tooth brushes. Came quickly.</li>
            <li> By far the best toothbrush in the world. Can&#x27;t go back to using small brushes as they now feel weird! Comfortable to use and a pleasure to brush with as they clean your whole mouth while brushing!</li>
            <li> This is the best toothbrush and the healthiest for you teeth.  It cleans more teeth all at once and I dont have to work to brush my teeth any more - I always buy more for my family members and Christmas day my son said &amp;#34;I hope you got  me some of those toothbrushs&#x27;!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is such amazingly simple product and so effective.  I&#x27;ve used these toothbrushes for over five years and they are much more than good looking.  My husband never cared for the size of them, but I&#x27;ll never go back to a small brush.  It just doesn&#x27;t feel right anymore.  I&#x27;ve had excellent check ups for the past five years, especially healthy gums because this brush is soft and flexible and really gives your gums a nice workout.  Love them.</li>
            <li> RADIUS has seriously ruined it for me, they made this amazing brush and now I can&#x27;t use another brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not exaggerating, I literally will not brush my teeth unless I have one of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stayed in a hotel for 3 days and forgot mine, and yep, I didn&#x27;t brush. Well to be honest I tried with a high quality brush I bought from Walgreens but that made the pain of not having my Radius even worse, and money wasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and buy one of these, your teeth would thank you if they had a mouth (see what I did there?)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had these brushes for less than a month, used one every day and, at this point, am satisfied. I like the feel in my mouth, knowing that I am covering more territory than with my usual toothbrush. It is gently working on my gums as well as teeth. Also I appreciate the way the toothbrush fits in my hand, putting me more in control. Yes, I would recommend if you are willing to try something new.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my mom who has arthritis in her hands.  They are very easy to grip and use versus her standard Sonicare electric toothbrush.  She is very happy with the brush and has no pain when she is brushing her teeth.  A great prduct...even though it looks a little odd!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this toothbrush for the last 15 years! I&#x27;m happy I finally found them! I got my first Radius Scuba in the 1997. It was like the first love, never forget it! They have an excellent design, colors are beautiful, bristles are soft, and because the bristle area is big, it really does a better job, and are paraben free! Try one and you will never go back to the old regular toothbrush!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best toothbrush I have ever used.  You do have to get used to the &amp;#34;bigness&amp;#34; of the brush but it is wonderful and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Yes these toothbrushes are HUGE but my gums noticeably do not bleed as much when I floss.  My dentist is always telling me I brush too hard (didnt know that was possible) so I have been looking for a good soft toothbrush.  This is it.</li>
            <li> I was expecting more for the price. I don’t completely dislike these toothbrushes but I don’t think I’ll be buying them again. I would recommend just sticking with the old fashioned Colgate toothbrushes you can buy at Wal-Mart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this review was helpful please select the ‘yes’ button below.</li>
            <li> I love these toothbrushes!!!!! They really clean your teeth and gums well. I switched to these a  year ago and I&#x27;ll never go back to a regular toothbrush again.</li>
            <li> Yeah yeah, they ain&#x27;t cheap compared to a one or two or three dollar supermarket toothbrush, but the size of the brushing surface, the ergonomic comfort of the handle, and the longevity of the bristles themselves (the 6 month lifespan is about right) make them well worth the extra money upfront.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since moved on to a mechanical Oral-B toothbrush, but I use it only 2-3 times a week since I suspect that daily use might cause enamel loss.  The rest of the time, I go back to this product...will never buy supermarket toothbrushes again!</li>
            <li> I love these tooth brushes!  Fast shipping from seller as well.</li>
            <li> Lasts much longer than normal brushes. Is more comfortable in your hand, gentler on the gums and more thorough on the tongue.</li>
            <li> I have used these tooth brushes, Radius, for years and years. I love them and I will continue to use them, give them as gifts and hope that I can maintain a healthy mouth for the rest of my life. They just feel good. The handle fits in your palm perfectly and they even have lefty brushes for you special folks.</li>
            <li> As good a manual toothbrush as you can buy. Easy to grip and use with an angle to the brush that makes cleaning your teeth easy.</li>
            <li> I have been using radius products for past 8 years and they have always exceeded all my expectations. Very good deal and an amazing product.</li>
            <li> Based upon the company website, I bought this for my son who loves new design. He hasn&#x27;t taken to it.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Radius for years but it has become increasingly difficult to find.  Now that I have Amazon as a source I am relieved.  This toothbrush just seems to fill your mouth with the essence of whatever toothpaste you use.  The arrangement of the bristles seems overly large but it is a joy in your mouth.  With very little pressing it does the job.  Smaller toothbrushes have a psychological effect of making you want to press hard.  This brush is gentle and yet very thorough in it&#x27;s cleaning of you teeth, gums and tongue</li>
            <li> Fantastic toothbrush! Okay, so at first if you&#x27;ve never used one of these brushes you&#x27;ll look at it and go &amp;#34;yeah right, this is for brushing out a horses mane, not for brushing my dainty little teeth!&amp;#34; I was a little hesitant at first but I&#x27;m quirky like that and enjoy trying new things. I first purchase mine at Wholefoods having decided to give it a try. I have to say that I will never use another style of toothbrush again. I love these! They clean extraordinarily well massaging the gums as you go. I did temporarily switch back to a regular style brush just to see and hated, HATED it! Straight back to the Radius I went and I&#x27;m never going back! They may seem a little pricey but they last much longer than most and I believe are made with better materials than all of those other substandard brushes. Go Radius!</li>
            <li> Really love the product and really great price at that.... will be looking forward to plenty more purchases like this in the future.</li>
            <li> Been using this brand for over 12 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of these Radius toothbrushes.  I have been using them for years.  Be prepared, however, for a totally different brushing experience.  They! Are! BIG!  The width of the head might be intimidating but trust me, you get used to it and it keeps your gums really healthy because you HAVE to brush them.  It&#x27;s comfortable to hold and I found that my gum line doesn&#x27;t bleed as much when I use this brush regularly.</li>
            <li> I have been using these toothbrushes for a couple of years and my dental checkups are much improved. Prior to using them I was constantly on the verge of gum disease. Now I have no issues! I replace every 9 month. I&#x27;m very, very happy with these toothbrushes!</li>
            <li> Really love the soft bristles.  Using RADIUS toothbrushes for years now.  Take turns with RADIUS manually scrubbing, with a Philips sonic-scrubber.  Use the Philips once a day, while I use the RADIUS at least two times per day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The RADIUS toothbrush has a very large coverage area with the bristles, opposite the way many other companies use a small, focused brush.  The &#x27;feel&#x27; of the RADIUS makes it my favorite toothbrush.  I only use the Philips in combination, as the dentist says the sonic vibrations are needed to agitate just below the gum-line without hurting (e.g. apply no significant pressure with the Philips), while a manual toothbrush simply can&#x27;t get there without causing some damage to the gums due to pressure needed.</li>
            <li> I bought these due to the rave reviews, and I&#x27;m always one to try something new.  Unfortunately, I was grossly disappointed with them.  The taste of plastic is unmistakable to me, and the overly large brush head (which, to its credit, probably does make it more effective) is equally awkward to brush with.  The size / shape make it seem like it&#x27;s meant for toddlers to people with range of motion issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a good clean, spring for an electric toothbrush.  If you&#x27;re looking for something to travel with, you&#x27;re better off looking elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Got these as a stocking stuffer for my mother. She used to love these types of brushes years ago and was upset when GNC stopped carrying them. I have never used one but according to her, they are pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on the go because I have invisalign.  I didn&#x27;t realize how huge these were.  It kind of made it hard to brush my teeth.  Other than that, they get the job done.</li>
            <li> Been using for years, won&#x27;t switch to another style.  Lasts a long time too.  You need a new toothbrush case though, won&#x27;t fit in a normal one.</li>
            <li> like how it cleans your teeth and gums at same time with large head</li>
            <li> I love these toothbrushes and feel like they get my gums clean..They arrived in time for Christmas so made a perfect stocking stuffer.  They are just way cool</li>
            <li> Radius toothbrushes are the only brushes for me and my family. I&#x27;ve never used anything else since trying them. Your gums and teeth both get a great scrubbing with the nice, wide brush. The color combos also appeal to the fashion-slaves among us.</li>
            <li> Amazon offers a great price on these tooth brushes, which are my favorite in the  hand held variety. Great to have extras on hand or for the whole family.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush ever. You will not be sorry if you try it its the best toothbrush ever, your teeth have never felt so clean.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Radius toothbrush for about 10 yrs. and have been cavity free. The brush covers a larger area and does a better job getting between the teeth.</li>
            <li> It is a good brush and the price is also very reasonable for the type and quality of the brush. It does a good job of cleaning the teeth.</li>
            <li> These clean your teeth and gums!  Easy to hold and manage, and they really get in there and get it done.  My teeth are smoother, and my gums feel good too.  Get these.  They  come in a pack of 3.  all you have to do is put them in a cup of peroxide for a few once a week to keep them on point.  Love them.  Will never use the tradtional brushes again, except to clean grout.</li>
            <li> I refer to this toothbrush as my toilet brush for teeth!  Everyone should have one of these.  Although I use an electric toothbrush, the Scuba is super for those mornings when you wake up feeling like a camel died in your mouth.  Make sure you buy the correct grip--right hand or left hand.  They really are easy to grip.  And boy, can you ever SCRUB with one of these--teeth, tongue, roof, lips.....I&#x27;ve been using one since I first saw Whoopi use it in &amp;#34;Ghosts.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> YEY THESE TOOTHBRUSHES ARE THE BEST.  I was sort of weirded out by how large they are at first but I am in love now.</li>
            <li> I love these toothbrushes. They are so easy to brush with. Once you try them you won&#x27;t want to use skinny toothbrushes ever again. My teeth feel so much cleaner!</li>
            <li> We have been using these for years.  They are a great design and they are very sturdy.  Was happy to seem them sold in sets as it was a much better value than purchasing them individually in the store.</li>
            <li> I have used these toothbrushes for at least ten years now.  You use to be able to buy them at the drugstore but it is hard to find them at a store anymore and I am very glad to be able to get them through Amazon.  I like them because while the bristles are soft because they are a larger toothbrush, you just feel like your teeth are getting extra clean.  Love them.</li>
            <li> This brush does feel good and stimulates your gums.  By the time you are finished, your entire mouth feels fresh.  I must have a small mouth, because it is still rather arkward brushing my teeth with the huge head on this toothbrush.</li>
