            <li>So excited that it is affordable on Amazon for the normal working girl like me !</li>
            <li>I have dry skin, and LOVE this moisturizer!</li>
            <li>This is a very lightweight lotion that actually behaves more like a rich cream on the skin.</li>
            <li>It is pretty light, not a thick moisturizer.</li>

            <li>This was my first purchase of this product.</li>
            <li>Has a great texture (not to watery and not to thick)and doesn&#x27;t leave any kind of greasy residue behind once dry.</li>
            <li>my son on accutane took over my first tube, to ease dry skin without causing more breakouts</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin soft.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to pack and light weight, versus the heavy jars that some creams come in.</li>
            <li>This products keeps my face hydrated thanks a lot.</li>
            <li>I thought my skin was just getting drier and more lined as I aged but</li>
            <li>I apply it from the back of my hands onto my face and my hands have never been so smooth.</li>
            <li>Getting ready to get another.</li>
            <li>had to buy another...works really well, no irritation and no burning on skin...</li>
            <li>this is the real brand of skin medica.  </li>
            <li>well-priced and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>This product has really cleared my skin up well.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my face really moist.  </li>
            <li>The price is much cheaper than what a spa charges.</li>
            <li>and this works very well.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the texture of this cream as it is a gel-like consistency, so it does not feel heavy and soaks in quickly to the skin.</li>
            <li>I want something more moisturizing for less money.</li>
            <li>Forgot to mention I am older and not a kid</li>
            <li>Will highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Left my face feeling dry and had to apply my Clinique lotion on top of it</li>
            <li>and I live in the south with a 100% humidity.</li>
            <li>Live and learn</li>
            <li>My skin looks clear and soft very youthful looking.</li>
            <li>My skin feels fresh and hydrated when I wake up vs dry and needing moisture.</li>
            <li>Normally never buy anything with a smell but this is worth it.</li>
            <li>if you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>but I prefer my old moisturizer from Victoria Principal.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing  but being only 2 oz</li>
            <li>I find myself running out of it frequently.  </li>
            <li>This cream is my miracle treatment and has completely fixed my dryness issues.</li>
            <li>It does what I want and makes skin feel soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>First bought it when I forgot to pack my then current moisturizer when on a trip, and I have never looked back.</li>
            <li>docent feel oily, fast adsorb, and is working all day long!</li>
            <li>Received a free sample from my Dr. a few years back; so I have been looking for this.  </li>
            <li>I went back to my old moisturizer and my skin is supple once again.  </li>
            <li>I use this along with other Skin Medica products and I really like all of them.</li>
            <li>I had to use a lot of product to get my skin to feel smooth and nourished; I had a similar complaint with their toner.</li>
            <li>I like it but don&#x27;t think I will re-order - found it kind of expensive for a moisturizer when others do the same thing and are not so costly.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about two years and have very sensitive, dry skin.</li>

            <li> It is easy to pack and light weight, versus the heavy jars that some creams come in.</li>
            <li> This products keeps my face hydrated thanks a lot.</li>
            <li> I thought my skin was just getting drier and more lined as I aged but</li>
            <li> I apply it from the back of my hands onto my face and my hands have never been so smooth.</li>
            <li> Getting ready to get another.</li>
            <li> had to buy another...works really well, no irritation and no burning on skin...</li>
            <li> this is the real brand of skin medica.  </li>
            <li> well-priced and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> This product has really cleared my skin up well.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my face really moist.  </li>
            <li> The price is much cheaper than what a spa charges.</li>
            <li> and this works very well.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the texture of this cream as it is a gel-like consistency, so it does not feel heavy and soaks in quickly to the skin.</li>
            <li> I want something more moisturizing for less money.</li>
            <li> Forgot to mention I am older and not a kid</li>
            <li> Will highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Left my face feeling dry and had to apply my Clinique lotion on top of it</li>
            <li> and I live in the south with a 100% humidity.</li>
            <li> Live and learn</li>
            <li> My skin looks clear and soft very youthful looking.</li>
            <li> My skin feels fresh and hydrated when I wake up vs dry and needing moisture.</li>
            <li> Normally never buy anything with a smell but this is worth it.</li>
            <li> if you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> but I prefer my old moisturizer from Victoria Principal.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing  but being only 2 oz</li>
            <li> I find myself running out of it frequently.  </li>
            <li> This cream is my miracle treatment and has completely fixed my dryness issues.</li>
            <li> It does what I want and makes skin feel soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> First bought it when I forgot to pack my then current moisturizer when on a trip, and I have never looked back.</li>
            <li> docent feel oily, fast adsorb, and is working all day long!</li>
            <li> Received a free sample from my Dr. a few years back; so I have been looking for this.  </li>
            <li> I went back to my old moisturizer and my skin is supple once again.  </li>
            <li> I use this along with other Skin Medica products and I really like all of them.</li>
            <li> I had to use a lot of product to get my skin to feel smooth and nourished; I had a similar complaint with their toner.</li>
            <li> I like it but don&#x27;t think I will re-order - found it kind of expensive for a moisturizer when others do the same thing and are not so costly.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about two years and have very sensitive, dry skin.</li>
            <li> It provides just the right amount of moister, without being too thick.</li>
            <li> It readily comes out of the tube so if you choose to purchase it, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> In just a few weeks I noticed my skin felt softer and smoother than it had with my old product, which was more expensive.</li>
            <li> For the price it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> My face gets incredibly dry, especially during the winter.</li>
            <li> Since this product is water based, a little can go a long way by applying it directly out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is minimal (not enough to cause irritation).</li>
            <li> It is rather thick, has a mild scent but absorbs after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> This is due to a combination of factors including naturally dry skin and regularly applying retinol.  </li>
            <li> I had dry and patches blotches which are now gone.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> Plus when it is almost empty I can cut the end of the tube off with scissors to get the last little bit out.</li>
            <li> Overpriced product that delivers minimal results.  </li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t buy again due to that.</li>
            <li> The price was excessive for such a small amount of product because my tube only lasted me three weeks.</li>
            <li> have used other products that lasted longer.</li>
            <li> So I have no basis of comparison to previous purchases and am therefore being cautious in my review.  </li>
            <li> It does have a slight odor but works</li>
            <li> My skin was congested, I had been for a facial and bought all the products they recommended with no good</li>
            <li> It caused irritations on my forehead and chins and leaves my skin tight.</li>
            <li> A little pricey but everything is.</li>
            <li> It works and isn&#x27;t too heavy.  </li>
            <li> Medica had been my moisturizer of choice a few years ago, recommended to me by a plastic surgeon&#x27;s technician.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I like the consistency and not strong smelling.</li>
            <li> A little thin and not as moisturizing for really dry skin as the wife would like,</li>
            <li> Additionally, it&#x27;s lightweight so it absorbs quickly cutting down on my routine time.</li>
            <li> The kicker is that this product can be SO expensive.  </li>
            <li> This product is so disappointing.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is great daily moisturizer.  It makes my makeup glide on smoothly.  It stays with you all day and I live in the south with a 100% humidity.</li>
            <li> Great item.! Will highly recommend. Pricey for me but still buy it... Always been getting excellent result from this product. Is my rescue cream.&lt;br /&gt;For times my facials require a reliable moisturizer .. Buy it!</li>
            <li> I have been using Skin Medica for years, this is a great product, keeps my skin moist and dewey.&lt;br /&gt;Supplier delivered as expected.</li>
            <li> absorbs rather quickly when I try to spread it</li>
            <li> This products keeps my face hydrated thanks a lot.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this moisturizer based on the good reviews here and on Paula&#x27;s choice, but I couldn&#x27;t. It caused irritations on my forehead and chins and leaves my skin tight. I give it two stars because of the nice tube packaging, which is hygienic and convenient for traveling.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for a few years, it&#x27;s a shame that they discontinued it because it was one of the best products they make.  I&#x27;ll never understand why manufacturers discontinue popular products that sell well.  I&#x27;m glad I can find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> A little thin and not as moisturizing for really dry skin as the wife would like, but it&#x27;s a non-irritating moisturizer which is good.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer I have ever used. My complexion look so smooth and I have had so many complements!</li>
            <li> I am in my 60&#x27;s and have searched for many years for just the right skin cream and this is it!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, recommended by my dermatologist, been using for 7 yrs.  Fast ship, great service from seller!</li>
            <li> I am in the age range where my skin is changing.  I have gone from oily to combination.  This moisturizer is perfect..not greasy and gives great hydration.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!! Fast shipping too :)</li>
            <li> I do not like this product at all. It seems the cream does not dissolve into skin. I will not purchase again! I am 58 years old and need a good moisturizer, this product is not at all what it promises to be!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over a year.  It works and isn&#x27;t too heavy.  I can always get the best price at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. Feel like my pores are getting smaller. I would like to continue use it again. Thank you!</li>
            <li> First time to use this product and although pricey it does a good job.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin feeling soft not greasy</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t think this has done anything spectacular to my skin, it does do a good job moisturizing.  I enjoy the texture of this cream as it is a gel-like consistency, so it does not feel heavy and soaks in quickly to the skin.</li>
            <li> Just received the product so haven&#x27;t used it enough. I like the consistency and not strong smelling.</li>
            <li> Excellent value. Delivery as promised. Will do again.</li>
            <li> This product is so disappointing.  I used it for years at my dermatologists suggestion.  I thought my skin was just getting drier and more lined as I aged but no - it was just the way my skin reacted to this product!  I went back to my old moisturizer and my skin is supple once again.  The kicker is that this product can be SO expensive.  $70 at the dermatologists office.  Live and learn</li>
            <li> Great for all skin types. It is pretty light, not a thick moisturizer. So it won&#x27;t break out your skin.</li>
            <li> Great product, I noticed a big difference in my skin immediately.</li>
            <li> excellent all rounder - esp. if you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This is a very lightweight lotion that actually behaves more like a rich cream on the skin. I apply it from the back of my hands onto my face and my hands have never been so smooth. I believe it has silicon in it which is what dermatologists tell you to use for scar care. It is a barrier which keeps moisture in. I use this along with other Skin Medica products and I really like all of them.</li>
            <li> Love it! Love it! Love it! Works wonders. Getting ready to get another. Totally met expectations!</li>
            <li> I love it! I have combination skin and it work perfectly fine to me.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My skin loves this, very hydrating!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s o.k. but I prefer my old moisturizer from Victoria Principal.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is good - - not greasy at all!  I like it but don&#x27;t think I will re-order - found it kind of expensive for a moisturizer when others do the same thing and are not so costly.</li>
            <li> Not greasy, just right.  Received a free sample from my Dr. a few years back; so I have been looking for this.  Will continue to use as it makes my skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> had to buy another...works really well, no irritation and no burning on skin...my son on accutane took over my first tube, to ease dry skin without causing more breakouts</li>
            <li> A wonderful fast penetrating light weight skin moisturizer for all skin types at a reasonable price. I have been using it for about two years and have very sensitive, dry skin.</li>
            <li> Is the best , I use it  before makeup. docent feel oily, fast adsorb, and is working all day long!</li>
            <li> Not moisturizing, product not thicker or creamy like one would expect of a moisturizer.  Won&#x27;t buy again due to that.</li>
            <li> Great price and quinches the skin!</li>
            <li> Seems genuine.  Arrived timely.</li>
            <li> Overpriced product that delivers minimal results.  The price was excessive for such a small amount of product because my tube only lasted me three weeks. I want something more moisturizing for less money. I had to use a lot of product to get my skin to feel smooth and nourished; I had a similar complaint with their toner.</li>
            <li> The Skin Medica Rejuvenative Moisturizer is excellent for dry skin.  It feels light and cool  on my sometimes irritated skin, never greasy.  I have repurchased it.  It is a good product for summer or winter.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing  but being only 2 oz I find myself running out of it frequently.  For the price it doesn&#x27;t last very long. I use this on top of TNS Serum</li>
            <li> Light, non-perfumy moisturizer. Love!</li>
            <li> The best moisturizer I&#x27;ve used in my life.</li>
            <li> I use this moisturizer each morning after cleansing my face and applying the Skin Medica toner.  It leaves my skin feeling soft and helps my makeup go on smoothly.  I would have rated it 5 stars if it had sunscreen as so many better moisturers do.</li>
            <li> a LOT of companies sell this product.  this is the real brand of skin medica.  i trust it and reorder from this vendor only.  well-priced and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> This is the REAL Deal !! So excited that it is affordable on Amazon for the normal working girl like me ! Love skin medica !</li>
            <li> This product has really cleared my skin up well.  I had dry and patches blotches which are now gone.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, just wish the price was lower.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Hydrates skin all day.</li>
            <li> First time to use this &amp; very pleased</li>
            <li> Various websites, including of course Skin Medica, state that not all retailers are authorized resellers.  This was my first purchase of this product. The price was attractive compared to Skin Medica&#x27;s.  I do not know if I received the authentic product or even if genuine, that it had not expired, been diluted, etc.  So I have no basis of comparison to previous purchases and am therefore being cautious in my review.  It is rather thick, has a mild scent but absorbs after a few minutes. I used it twice daily.  My skin felt OK but there was no dramatic change in texture. It readily comes out of the tube so if you choose to purchase it, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Although I can&#x27;t say I love it more than the SkinMedica Dermal Repair, I DO love the price more! This is a great everyday lotion that dries nicely on the skin and does not leave you feeling sticky or oily. It works well under makeup or mixed with a bit of CC/BB cream. Since this product is water based, a little can go a long way by applying it directly out of the shower. (My esthetician recommended doing this to get more out of the product). Overall, very nice product and a great everyday moisturizer!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s excellent  moisturizer:)</li>
            <li> good product, my wife uses this and amazon is the best place to order it.</li>
            <li> Keeps my face really moist.  I also mix it with my liquid foundation which makes for a really smooth application.  The price is much cheaper than what a spa charges.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this line when I went in for age spot consult. I didn&#x27;t have a lot of hyperpigmentation, but certainly enough to warrant a change in skin care regimen. Within a year, the results have been quite noticeable. I switched to the restorative moisturizer recently and noticed increased firmness within 2-3 weeks. I&#x27;m very happy with it. Additionally, it&#x27;s lightweight so it absorbs quickly cutting down on my routine time.</li>
            <li> My skin was congested, I had been for a facial and bought all the products they recommended with no good results.&lt;br /&gt; [[ASIN:B0009DU99U Skin Medica Rejuvenative Moisturizer-2 oz]]&lt;br /&gt;Skin Medica had been my moisturizer of choice a few years ago, recommended to me by a plastic surgeon&#x27;s technician.&lt;br /&gt;For some reason, I saved the tube in the back of my drawer. Hooray, hooray, I found it on Amazon.com, (at the best price) and my skin has never looked better.  I will continue using this moisturizer from now on!</li>
            <li> This lotion is great for dry skin, I bought it at salon for three times the price. Of course, they never tell you to try it on amazon for a third of the cost. I have ordered twice now and I love it!</li>
            <li> Have been using SkinMedica products for about a year. Love all their products. This is a very good moisturizer for combination skin. I use it regularly and always have good results.</li>
            <li> Creamy and smooth but ~ The moisturizing effect seem to vanish quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I have used other products that lasted longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and I&#x27;m on my second tube. It moisturizes but goes on light and isn&#x27;t oily. It&#x27;s work great under my liquid makeup or on clean skin overnight. It is easy to pack and light weight, versus the heavy jars that some creams come in. Plus when it is almost empty I can cut the end of the tube off with scissors to get the last little bit out.</li>
            <li> Great seller! Awesome moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I use this moisturizer daily, as part of my morning routine. It provides just the right amount of moister, without being too thick. I love the texture of it, and the way it feels on my skin. I apply it after my antioxidant, and before I apply my sunscreen.  Then I apply my make up. This is the perfect combination. My skin feels fresh and looks good all day.</li>
            <li> This is not moisturizing at all. Left my face feeling dry and had to apply my Clinique lotion on top of it</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, and LOVE this moisturizer! After having a laser procedure on my face, my doctor started me on Skin Medica products. He had me using Dermal Repair Cream, but it didn&#x27;t moisturize my face quite enough. This product, however, does. My favorite out of all moisturizers ever used.</li>
            <li> Softens skin, great for softening lines. I have been using this for over year now. My skin looks clear and soft very youthful looking. My Dr. recommended it. Great price, better than department store products.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer and was shipped right away.</li>
            <li> This is a very effective moisturizer if you want the moisture without the grease.  It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin soft.  I have been using it for 6 months and I love it.  Great price online versus buying it at my doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite night time moisturizer.  It does leave my skin feeling hydrated not greasy. My skin feels fresh and hydrated when I wake up vs dry and needing moisture.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with transaction. I have used this product for years and love it. This is best pricing that can be found. Much better than purchasing from physician.</li>
            <li> I have ordered and reordered this amazing light moisturizer and will continue to order it.  First bought it when I forgot to pack my then current moisturizer when on a trip, and I have never looked back.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome light weight moisturizer and I have tried EVERYTHING out there.</li>
            <li> So glad I found this! My face gets incredibly dry, especially during the winter. This is due to a combination of factors including naturally dry skin and regularly applying retinol.  This cream is my miracle treatment and has completely fixed my dryness issues. Has a great texture (not to watery and not to thick)and doesn&#x27;t leave any kind of greasy residue behind once dry. Fragrance is minimal (not enough to cause irritation). This product does NOT contain sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and this works very well. It does have a slight odor but works so well you can ignore that. Normally never buy anything with a smell but this is worth it. A little pricey but everything is. It does what I want and makes skin feel soft and hydrated. Forgot to mention I am older and not a kid so I have special needs.</li>
            <li> In just a few weeks I noticed my skin felt softer and smoother than it had with my old product, which was more expensive.</li>
