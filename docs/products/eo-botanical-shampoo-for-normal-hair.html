            <li>A really good shampoo.</li>
            <li>It is a good product</li>
            <li>the EO shampoo and conditioner do not hav e a good smell and do not beneift my hair in any way.</li>

            <li>Doesn&#x27;t lather well at all but has made an amazing difference.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;In terms of the cleaning power of the shampoo and conditioner, I think that it does a really nice job.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK but not as good as the Acure shampoo I also use.</li>
            <li>Both the shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  the shampoo has a very strong smell of tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>One of the best natural products on the market.</li>
            <li>It gives a very clean feeling and smells amazing.  </li>
            <li>I bought Enjoy and it has a great lather and smell and my hair is smooth.</li>
            <li>As a result my hair did not get a good clean.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the way my hair looks after using this shampoo with the keratin conditioner.</li>
            <li>it deep cleans, without stripping color from your hair, and gives you hair wonderful shine and body!</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It made my look shiny and healthy.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure that contributed.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels softer and is much more manageable than it used to be.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the volumizing shampoo and conditioner for about 5 years which I love.</li>
            <li>This is one of two of my favorite shampoos by EO.  </li>
            <li>But the scent was lovely.</li>
            <li>I love the scent.</li>
            <li>Would recommend tis shampoo to daughter for my grandson who has a sensitivity to most shamoos she uses on his hair.</li>
            <li>This was more like washing my hair with unfiltered sea water.  </li>
            <li>I really love the way my hair feels.</li>
            <li>Now it is just finding my favorite scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now it is just finding my favorite scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice to know its free of harmful ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li>each day has changed my scalp and I&#x27;m never going back, very impressed!</li>
            <li>It has a unique smell, and I wasn&#x27;t quite sure that I liked it.</li>
            <li>Thanks EO Products!!!!</li>
            <li>This shampoo works pretty good and smells great, but it does not have much lather.  </li>
            <li>Regardless though, I like the way I feel after using high quality bath products with great scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using EO Sulfate Free shampoo for 6 months and it works perfectly for my curly red hair.  </li>
            <li>But this shampoo is great, makes hair very soft, shiny and</li>
            <li>and I love that it&#x27;s chemical free</li>
            <li>Maybe they think everyone likes strong smelling shampoo and are trying to reach that market.  </li>
            <li>I have never used this line of hair care products before, the shampoo seems fine, but I ordered the coconut hibiscus and it smells like rosemary or eucalyptus, not what I had envisioned.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great, especially for hair with coloring.</li>
            <li>I use EO&#x27;s restorative conditioner after and my hair looks fabulous and my curls are magazine-worthy!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is not silky smooth, but my hair never was to begin with.</li>
            <li>It is not silky smooth, but my hair never was to begin with.</li>
            <li>The conditioner smelled like cheap hotel lotion</li>
            <li>conditioner was about the consistency of a cheap hotel lotion (noticing a trend??</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking they just bottled cheap lotion and called it conditioner).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>hair not only smells great</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve always used sulfate free products, but since I&#x27;ve started using this conditioner my hair has become greasy and clumpy like it has tons of gel in it.  </li>
            <li>Switching to sulfate free hair care as well as not washing my scalp</li>
            <li>Leaves hair clean, light and manageable.</li>
            <li>I noticed EO had some sulfate-free shampoos with some really unique scents, so I decided to give them a shot.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t clean my hair at all.</li>
            <li>Hair and scalp feels clean.  </li>
            <li>, it feels so clean</li>
            <li>I was doing no-poo for a while to help when the excess secretion of hair oils, then decided I couldn&#x27;t just go without shampooing because it didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; clean.</li>
            <li>But I wanted more of a coconut smell, and I really didn&#x27;t notice anything special about my hair after using it.</li>
            <li>Good shampoo, especially for the summer</li>
            <li>I used to purchase the cheapest soaps and hair products that were on sale at the grocery store; but recently decided that I wanted to start using products that made me feel good.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not bad either.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is very gentle but gets hair really clean.  </li>
            <li>After the initial adjustment, I think most ppl will be fine.</li>
            <li>I terribly surprised because I&#x27;ve always liked EO as a pure product.  </li>
            <li>It smells fantastic and cleans very well.</li>
            <li>I really love what this shampoo does for my hair, but man alive is it STINKY.  </li>
            <li>better off with Dessert essence organics or aubrey organics brand for natural hair care products.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend it again, and would buy it, price so reasonable for such a good shampoo.</li>
            <li>have curly hair and rarely use shampoo and in the event that I do, my go to is the Garnier Sleek and Shine.</li>
            <li>I really liked the way it filled the bathroom, and made me feel like I was somewhere other than my home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using the L&#x27;Oreal sulfate free shampoo and it is much richer and has a great thick lather.  </li>
            <li>First shampoo I&#x27;ve had in a while</li>
            <li>When I first received the shampoo, I immediately opened it to smell it.</li>
            <li>and it overall I was satisfied.</li>
            <li>If your primary priority is the avoid the dangerous chemicals in your body care products this product is ideal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not super amazing</li>
            <li>I love every single</li>
            <li>Recently I have begun to believe that high-quality bathing products make a huge difference in my life.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>EO recently came out with the sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li>The scent of the hibiscus is very invigorating.</li>
            <li>Now that I know that I really like this product, I have no problem buying a three pack.</li>
            <li>Now that I know that I really like this product, I have no problem buying a three pack.</li>
            <li>it seems to really protect it from damage.</li>
            <li>(my hair and scalp are more on the dry than oily side), but with this particular brand my scalp is already oily the day after I shampoo it.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect suds, but keep in mind that SLS (sodium laurel sulfate, the ingredient in most shampoos, was originally developed to clean grease off the floors of manufacturing plants) produces lather but is incredibly harsh.</li>
            <li>The scent of the essential oils is lovely, and it makes my hair feel soft, encouraging its natural curl without any frizziness.</li>
            <li>Although I liked it, I do not love it.ove the way my hair feels.</li>
            <li>Although I liked it, I do not love it.</li>
            <li>Smell not so appealing, watered down lavender.</li>
            <li>As someone who colors her hair, I&#x27;m no stranger to sulfate-free shampoos, but I am not a fan of this particular one.</li>
            <li>I recently bought this as I love trying different things that are healthier.</li>
            <li>I really like that I was able to use this product and my hair didn&#x27;t feel straw-like from being overly stripped by harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>Recommend this highly.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product, but deducted the one star for the scent.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product, but deducted the one star for the scent.</li>
            <li>I usually have very easy to care for hair</li>
            <li>I recently read the book Curly Girl and have been trying out different organic/natural products for my hair that are free of sulfates (very drying), silicones, alcohols and parabens.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is so refreshing to find a company that offers AFFORDABLE chemical-free hair products that actually work extremely well.</li>
            <li>I prefer Alba shampoo for natural products.</li>
            <li>Being natural AND for color treated hair (I know, kinda contradicting</li>
            <li>This stuff leaves SO much buildup that I can scratch it off my scalp (gross, I know)!</li>
            <li>My skin is naturally oily, and thus, so is my scalp.  </li>
            <li>All I know, is I like washing my hair now, and I am a 29 year old man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>All I know, is I like washing my hair now, and I am a 29 year old man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now and the buildup in my hair is completely unmanageable.  </li>
            <li>This made my already coarse hair much coarser.  </li>
            <li>I tried other conditioners with it, but still had a light amount of the smell left over.  </li>
            <li>This was evident by the dry flakes I had after washing and drying my</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally acceptable, and it&#x27;s above average in that it&#x27;s a healthier alternative to most shampoos out there.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this brand for years and this particular scent for the last couple years (since they released it).</li>
            <li>I probably should have been tipped off by the incorrect product description posted by the manufacturer, but I highly recommend you avoid this product if at all possible.</li>
            <li>I previously mentioned, I am starting to believe that scents and aromatherapy could be really important for me.</li>
            <li>use Amazon Subscribe and Save for a lot of my basic necessities (toilet paper, shampoo, soap, plastic wrap, etc.), and noticed that they had a wide variety of EO products available for subscription.</li>
            <li>My hair feels dry ,flaky and very itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But unfortunately even though I really wanted to love this product it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>My hair is color-treated and this shampoo keeps it soft, without making it flat.  </li>
            <li>I have tried other non sulfate shampoos but they either have a smell or don&#x27;t really lather.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Consistency: the shampoo was thick and felt like normal shampoo texture but didn&#x27;t lather very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not real sudsy of course, no sulfate-free shampoo is, but I&#x27;m not sure my hair is actually getting clean using this shampoo.</li>

            <li> Would recommend it again, and would buy it, price so reasonable for such a good shampoo.</li>
            <li> have curly hair and rarely use shampoo and in the event that I do, my go to is the Garnier Sleek and Shine.</li>
            <li> I really liked the way it filled the bathroom, and made me feel like I was somewhere other than my home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using the L&#x27;Oreal sulfate free shampoo and it is much richer and has a great thick lather.  </li>
            <li> First shampoo I&#x27;ve had in a while</li>
            <li> When I first received the shampoo, I immediately opened it to smell it.</li>
            <li> and it overall I was satisfied.</li>
            <li> If your primary priority is the avoid the dangerous chemicals in your body care products this product is ideal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super amazing</li>
            <li> I love every single</li>
            <li> Recently I have begun to believe that high-quality bathing products make a huge difference in my life.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> EO recently came out with the sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li> The scent of the hibiscus is very invigorating.</li>
            <li> Now that I know that I really like this product, I have no problem buying a three pack.</li>
            <li> Now that I know that I really like this product, I have no problem buying a three pack.</li>
            <li> it seems to really protect it from damage.</li>
            <li> (my hair and scalp are more on the dry than oily side), but with this particular brand my scalp is already oily the day after I shampoo it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect suds, but keep in mind that SLS (sodium laurel sulfate, the ingredient in most shampoos, was originally developed to clean grease off the floors of manufacturing plants) produces lather but is incredibly harsh.</li>
            <li> The scent of the essential oils is lovely, and it makes my hair feel soft, encouraging its natural curl without any frizziness.</li>
            <li> Although I liked it, I do not love it.ove the way my hair feels.</li>
            <li> Although I liked it, I do not love it.</li>
            <li> Smell not so appealing, watered down lavender.</li>
            <li> As someone who colors her hair, I&#x27;m no stranger to sulfate-free shampoos, but I am not a fan of this particular one.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this as I love trying different things that are healthier.</li>
            <li> I really like that I was able to use this product and my hair didn&#x27;t feel straw-like from being overly stripped by harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> Recommend this highly.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product, but deducted the one star for the scent.</li>

            <li> I usually have very easy to care for hair</li>
            <li> I recently read the book Curly Girl and have been trying out different organic/natural products for my hair that are free of sulfates (very drying), silicones, alcohols and parabens.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is so refreshing to find a company that offers AFFORDABLE chemical-free hair products that actually work extremely well.</li>
            <li> I prefer Alba shampoo for natural products.</li>

            <li> This made my already coarse hair much coarser.  </li>

            <li> I previously mentioned, I am starting to believe that scents and aromatherapy could be really important for me.</li>
            <li> use Amazon Subscribe and Save for a lot of my basic necessities (toilet paper, shampoo, soap, plastic wrap, etc.), and noticed that they had a wide variety of EO products available for subscription.</li>
            <li> My hair feels dry ,flaky and very itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But unfortunately even though I really wanted to love this product it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> My hair is color-treated and this shampoo keeps it soft, without making it flat.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other non sulfate shampoos but they either have a smell or don&#x27;t really lather.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Consistency: the shampoo was thick and felt like normal shampoo texture but didn&#x27;t lather very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not real sudsy of course, no sulfate-free shampoo is, but I&#x27;m not sure my hair is actually getting clean using this shampoo.</li>

            <li> I only wash my hair with shampoo every few days and usually that&#x27;s fine</li>

            <li> will definitely repurchase this product, but I will also be purchasing it in its other scents.</li>
            <li> but once it&#x27;s empty I will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> No complaints about the delivery time, just not what i had expected.</li>
            <li> The scents are not strong but just enough Aroma-Escape therapy.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> It is not going to feel (nor foam) like conventional products.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t use half of the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Not rich.</li>
            <li> Tamed a lot of the trouble, seems healthier.  </li>
            <li> One of the few I have found that does the job.......</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your $$!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not really sure</li>
            <li> The product came in a sealed bag - half of the shampoo was out of the container and all in the bag - awful - wasn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li> It was hard to get it throughout my hair.</li>
            <li> The least conditioning shampoo I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> So far, I have not been disappointed at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t recommend this product as it was not great on my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really frustrating when I want volume and my hair just lays there on my head.</li>
            <li> I bought this (along with the conditioner) after seeing it so highly recommended on Amazon and I am stunned at how terrible it is.</li>
            <li> but hey) I didn&#x27;t think it could go wrong.</li>
            <li> sorry about that</li>
            <li> but it just wasn&#x27;t for me :(</li>
            <li> I have never been disappointed w/EO products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am so disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I got TERRIBLE build up</li>
            <li> At any rate, I ordered and received the lavender shampoo and conditioner, and they were terrible.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks horrible, as though I hadn&#x27;t showered at all.</li>
            <li> horrible shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It is a horrible product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall feel:  horrible!</li>
            <li> This has a really awful, medicine-ish / herbal smell that reminds me of dandruff shampoo or men&#x27;s deodorant.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Leaves hair clean, light and manageable. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I ordered this once, and never ordered it again. It&#x27;s totally acceptable, and it&#x27;s above average in that it&#x27;s a healthier alternative to most shampoos out there.  But I wanted more of a coconut smell, and I really didn&#x27;t notice anything special about my hair after using it.</li>
            <li> I have tried every shampoo out there for curls, and this one is marvelous! Don&#x27;t expect suds, but keep in mind that SLS (sodium laurel sulfate, the ingredient in most shampoos, was originally developed to clean grease off the floors of manufacturing plants) produces lather but is incredibly harsh. Sulfate-free is the way to go! I LOVE the way my hair looks after using this shampoo with the keratin conditioner. Miraculous!</li>
            <li> I really love what this shampoo does for my hair, but man alive is it STINKY.  the smell is quite medicinal, but the matching conditioner totally erases the effect.  I tried other conditioners with it, but still had a light amount of the smell left over.  I still rate it 5 stars because it cured my scalp condition with its healing keratin and essential oils.  I am VERY impressed with the combo, but I don&#x27;t suggest buying just the shampoo.</li>
            <li> both two of my order (plastic bottles) are came in were leaking when it arrived!</li>
            <li> for me also did not like the smell either.  I terribly surprised because I&#x27;ve always liked EO as a pure product.  Maybe they think everyone likes strong smelling shampoo and are trying to reach that market.  But six votes against the smell.</li>
            <li> The least conditioning shampoo I have ever used.  Hard to even get any lather at all and VERY drying.  Made my hair feel like straw.  Don&#x27;t waste your $$!</li>
            <li> Good shampoo, especially for the summer it deep cleans, without stripping color from your hair, and gives you hair wonderful shine and body!</li>
            <li> As someone who colors her hair, I&#x27;m no stranger to sulfate-free shampoos, but I am not a fan of this particular one. It&#x27;s not real sudsy of course, no sulfate-free shampoo is, but I&#x27;m not sure my hair is actually getting clean using this shampoo. I only wash my hair with shampoo every few days and usually that&#x27;s fine (my hair and scalp are more on the dry than oily side), but with this particular brand my scalp is already oily the day after I shampoo it. Maybe it&#x27;s the oils and botanicals? No clue. I&#x27;m almost done with the bottle but once it&#x27;s empty I will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  It made my look shiny and healthy.  Simply great and it did what it was suppose to do.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  My hair is color-treated and this shampoo keeps it soft, without making it flat.  I also like the scent.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I bought it, but I do not like it. It does not lather that well and my hair feels like stray after using it. I bought Enjoy and it has a great lather and smell and my hair is smooth. I can&#x27;t recommend this product as it was not great on my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using EO Sulfate Free shampoo for 6 months and it works perfectly for my curly red hair.  Doesn&#x27;t strip color or weight down my naturally curly hair, moisturizes and keeps my hair shiny.  Just reordered two more bottles because it works beautifully as a body wash too, it&#x27;s smells delicious!  Recommend this highly.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works pretty good and smells great, but it does not have much lather.  I have been using the L&#x27;Oreal sulfate free shampoo and it is much richer and has a great thick lather.  I won&#x27;t be buying this product again.  I prefer Alba shampoo for natural products.</li>
            <li> I always look for sodium laurel sulfate-free products, so tried this shampoo - and the matching conditioner.  The scent of the essential oils is lovely, and it makes my hair feel soft, encouraging its natural curl without any frizziness.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product for your hair!</li>
            <li> I was really happy when I found this product. Being natural AND for color treated hair (I know, kinda contradicting but hey) I didn&#x27;t think it could go wrong. But unfortunately even though I really wanted to love this product it didn&#x27;t work for me. I got TERRIBLE build up and it didn&#x27;t clean my hair at all. I have super thick long hair so I&#x27;m sure that contributed. But it smells good and I love that it&#x27;s chemical free but it just wasn&#x27;t for me :(</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.  Hair and scalp feels clean.  I wish it came in a larger size.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is very gentle but gets hair really clean.  And it smells great too.  I have never been disappointed w/EO products.</li>
            <li> My hair feels softer and is much more manageable than it used to be.  Tamed a lot of the trouble, seems healthier.  First shampoo I&#x27;ve had in a while that I&#x27;m really happy with.</li>
            <li> I loved the Orange Clarifying Shampoo that I wanted to try others.  No where in the description did it say that it was for Chemically Treated Hair except on the photo of the bottle.  Other than that, I like the scent and the fact that it is sulfate-free.</li>
            <li> I have been using the volumizing shampoo and conditioner for about 5 years which I love. EO recently came out with the sulfate free shampoo. It&#x27;s great, especially for hair with coloring. It cleans great and my hair is so healthy (I&#x27;m 54 and my hair shines).</li>
            <li> This is one of two of my favorite shampoos by EO.  It gives a very clean feeling and smells amazing.  My hair always looks great afterwords and who can beat sulfate free!</li>
            <li> Didnt like the lather. It just seemed... Not rich. But the scent was lovely. I love the scent. Wish it came in a body wash.</li>
            <li> I recently read the book Curly Girl and have been trying out different organic/natural products for my hair that are free of sulfates (very drying), silicones, alcohols and parabens. This shampoo is amazing! It smells fantastic and cleans very well. I use EO&#x27;s restorative conditioner after and my hair looks fabulous and my curls are magazine-worthy!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased an entire line of EO hair products - shampoo, conditioner, pre-shampoo and styling cream and the gel for curly hair. I love every single product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is so refreshing to find a company that offers AFFORDABLE chemical-free hair products that actually work extremely well. Thanks EO Products!!!!</li>
            <li> I recently bought this as I love trying different things that are healthier. This stuff leaves SO much buildup that I can scratch it off my scalp (gross, I know)! It&#x27;s really frustrating when I want volume and my hair just lays there on my head. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> A really good shampoo. I have tried other non sulfate shampoos but they either have a smell or don&#x27;t really lather. So I did not expect the luxurious later of this shampoo. The scent of the hibiscus is very invigorating. Would recommend tis shampoo to daughter for my grandson who has a sensitivity to most shamoos she uses on his hair.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to shampoo. One of the best natural products on the market. I&#x27;ve used this brand for years and this particular scent for the last couple years (since they released it). If you haven&#x27;t previously used natural and organic products, it does take some getting used to. It is not going to feel (nor foam) like conventional products. It&#x27;s not supposed to. After the initial adjustment, I think most ppl will be fine. However, natural/organic products aren&#x27;t for everyone. If your primary priority is the avoid the dangerous chemicals in your body care products this product is ideal.</li>
            <li> I keep coming back to the EO products for my showering needs. The scents are not strong but just enough Aroma-Escape therapy. Its a quality *alternative to shampooing &amp; no&#x27;poo. Would like to see larger sizes.</li>
            <li> This review is the same as the conditioner.  I noticed that the title shows a different scent than the one that I purchased, and of course, it is also not the one that I was sent.  Odd.  At any rate, I ordered and received the lavender shampoo and conditioner, and they were terrible.  Organix products are the way to go!  This was more like washing my hair with unfiltered sea water.  Ick!</li>
            <li> Recently I have begun to believe that high-quality bathing products make a huge difference in my life. For me, bathing and showering is an extremely relaxing experience that helps me wind-down after a long day, regardless of whether that day was good or bad. I used to purchase the cheapest soaps and hair products that were on sale at the grocery store; but recently decided that I wanted to start using products that made me feel good. I noticed EO had some sulfate-free shampoos with some really unique scents, so I decided to give them a shot. So far, I have not been disappointed at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Amazon Subscribe and Save for a lot of my basic necessities (toilet paper, shampoo, soap, plastic wrap, etc.), and noticed that they had a wide variety of EO products available for subscription. I chose the Hibiscus and Coconut &#x27;flavor&#x27; because it was the only one that came in a single-pack. Everything else came in a pack of 3, and I didn&#x27;t want to buy a ton of them if I did not like the brand. When I first received the shampoo, I immediately opened it to smell it. It has a unique smell, and I wasn&#x27;t quite sure that I liked it. After washing my hair with it though, I noticed that it has a real nice calming scent to it. I really liked the way it filled the bathroom, and made me feel like I was somewhere other than my home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I previously mentioned, I am starting to believe that scents and aromatherapy could be really important for me. There is a lot of research and people who swear by the medicinal impact of aromatherapy; but I do not know if I fully believe it. Regardless though, I like the way I feel after using high quality bath products with great scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of the cleaning power of the shampoo and conditioner, I think that it does a really nice job. My skin is naturally oily, and thus, so is my scalp.  I am finding that my scalp is not as oily, and my hair looks and feels a lot cleaner than it ever did with Suave or Pantene. I really love the way my hair feels. It is not silky smooth, but my hair never was to begin with. All I know, is I like washing my hair now, and I am a 29 year old man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely repurchase this product, but I will also be purchasing it in its other scents. Now that I know that I really like this product, I have no problem buying a three pack. Now it is just finding my favorite scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product, but deducted the one star for the scent.

            <li> It is a good product but I do not like the smell. Maybe you will like it. I do  not know.</li>
            <li> My hair looks clumpy and unclean. My scalp is itchy. My hair looks horrible, as though I hadn&#x27;t showered at all. Please avoid this product.</li>
            <li> better off with Dessert essence organics or aubrey organics brand for natural hair care products.  the EO shampoo and conditioner do not hav e a good smell and do not beneift my hair in any way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK but not as good as the Acure shampoo I also use.</li>
            <li> horrible shampoo.  sorry about that</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how this got good reviews. It is a horrible product. Both the shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  the shampoo has a very strong smell of tea tree oil. I happen to like that scent so it didn&#x27;t bother me. The conditioner smelled like cheap hotel lotion (best description I could give it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consistency: the shampoo was thick and felt like normal shampoo texture but didn&#x27;t lather very well. It was hard to get it throughout my hair. As a result my hair did not get a good clean. This was evident by the dry flakes I had after washing and drying my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner was about the consistency of a cheap hotel lotion (noticing a trend?? I&#x27;m thinking they just bottled cheap lotion and called it conditioner).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall feel:  horrible! My hair feels dry ,flaky and very itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so disappointed in this product. That was a waist of money because I will not use this again. Save your money people and stay away from this product. Now I need to research the best sulfate free product for my hair and spend more money. Ugh.</li>
            <li> Smell not so appealing, watered down lavender. But this shampoo is great, makes hair very soft, shiny and it seems to really protect it from damage. Would recommend it again, and would buy it, price so reasonable for such a good shampoo.</li>
            <li> This has a really awful, medicine-ish / herbal smell that reminds me of dandruff shampoo or men&#x27;s deodorant. I only used it once, though, because I disliked the smell so much. So I&#x27;m not really sure how well it works in the long run.</li>
            <li> Very nice product!! Nice to know its free of harmful ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;My hair not only smells great, it feels so clean too!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan S&lt;br /&gt;Buffalo, NY</li>
            <li> I bought this (along with the conditioner) after seeing it so highly recommended on Amazon and I am stunned at how terrible it is. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now and the buildup in my hair is completely unmanageable.  I usually have very easy to care for hair and I&#x27;ve always used sulfate free products, but since I&#x27;ve started using this conditioner my hair has become greasy and clumpy like it has tons of gel in it.  The only styling product that I use is a heat protectant, so I have no idea where all the gunk is coming from.  Also, it smells nothing like coconut or hibiscus.  I probably should have been tipped off by the incorrect product description posted by the manufacturer, but I highly recommend you avoid this product if at all possible.</li>
            <li> Note: It smells like rosemary and eucalyptus, no coconut scent whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;I have curly hair and rarely use shampoo and in the event that I do, my go to is the Garnier Sleek and Shine. I really like that I was able to use this product and my hair didn&#x27;t feel straw-like from being overly stripped by harsh chemicals. I followed up with the conditioner from the same line and let that sit for 15min with a plastic shower cap and it overall I was satisfied. If anything this is a product that I will use on a day that I don&#x27;t have the time to give my hair the tlc it needs. It&#x27;s not super amazing but it&#x27;s not bad either.</li>
            <li> I have never used this line of hair care products before, the shampoo seems fine, but I ordered the coconut hibiscus and it smells like rosemary or eucalyptus, not what I had envisioned. It is labeled as coconut/hibiscus. No complaints about the delivery time, just not what i had expected.</li>
            <li> I like the product, but unsanitary packaging. The product came in a sealed bag - half of the shampoo was out of the container and all in the bag - awful - wasn&#x27;t worth the money. I couldn&#x27;t use half of the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Great for swimmers hair.  One of the few I have found that does the job.......</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t lather well at all but has made an amazing difference.  Switching to sulfate free hair care as well as not washing my scalp each day has changed my scalp and I&#x27;m never going back, very impressed!</li>
            <li> I like that the product is sulfate-free, but I dislike the way it makes my hair feel when I rinse it out. I was doing no-poo for a while to help when the excess secretion of hair oils, then decided I couldn&#x27;t just go without shampooing because it didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; clean. This made my already coarse hair much coarser.  Even combined with the conditioner it still make it feel dry and coarse.</li>
