            <li> Very good product to use for a baby rush! In two days the rush disappeared.</li>
            <li> My horse had summer sores on and in his sheath.  This keeps the flies away and has made him so much more comfortable.  I will keep buying this product as it works.  My horse thanks Sudocrem and Amazon for carrying it.</li>

            <li> I did not buy this cream from Amazon. My daughter-in-law obtained it somehow and used it on my grandson who was GREATLY AGONIZED with a horribly stubborn rash.

He&#x27;s in great health now, PRAISE BE TO ALMIGHTY GOD ! I want parents to know that this cream is AN ABSOLUTE WONDER on very bad rash situations. It also has a very pleasant scent I didn&#x27;t expect. You won&#x27;t be sorry you purchased it.</li>
