    <ol>
            <li>I am a guy, and this even manages to keep me smelling great!</li>
            <li>This is a great deal, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years, and it works great.</li>
            <li>Tom&#x27;s of Maine works great for me</li>
            <li>Goes on very nicely as well.</li>
            <li>It smells good, but once it&#x27;s on</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>It works so well and safely!</li>
            <li>so to each their own.</li>
            <li>Kind of a bummer since I&#x27;ve been using it for years no problem and liked it.</li>
            <li>so when I received it, I liked the smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still searching for the perfect natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>Although It may not be quite as strong an antiperspirant as some aluminum containing products, it is far and away the best non-aluminum one I&#x27;ve tried, and does the job quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this deodorant because it is made of non-toxic ingredients.    </li>
            <li>I have used this deoderant for YEARS, and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like searching around for stuff I love.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m glad that we were able to find it online.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The name of this one caught my attention, as most of the aluminum-free products don&#x27;t claim to have any antiperspirant effect, just to block bacteria that cause odor.</li>
            <li>I use many Dessert Essence products, and now I have added another one to my regimine.</li>
            <li>I had better luck with another all-natural brand, VibesUp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Which ever product you choose, your body will thank you for going aluminum and antiperspirant free!</li>
            <li>What more could I ask for?</li>
            <li>As an antiperspirant this was ok.</li>
            <li>Smells great and worth the stickiness to be organic and aluminum free.</li>
            <li>By far one of the best natural deodorants...I love it!</li>
            <li>Love that this is organic and aluminum free.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m fine.</li>
            <li>While it does have a pleasant scent, it didn&#x27;t last for more than an hour.</li>
            <li>, I had to reapply several times even after showering.&lt;br /&gt;However, one good thing is that it does not leave much residue, if any.&lt;br /&gt;It works just fine in the winter and is good for right after shower/shaving.</li>
            <li>As long as it is applied thoroughly, I think that it works great.</li>
            <li>I have found this deodorant containing chamomile and calendula to be as effective or possibly even better.  </li>
            <li>I love this product so much.</li>
            <li>It is a given that whatever is rubbed on my skin will be absorbed.    </li>
            <li>I was thrilled to discover, upon trying it, that this one does work as an antiperspirant as well as keeping odor away for an entire day, even on sweaty days involving some</li>
            <li>I have the most sensitive skin ever</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several different organic/vegan Deodorants and this one works best by far.</li>
            <li>The chemical reaction aluminum has with sweat has destroyed all my light colored t-shirts, massive bright yellow pit stains.  </li>
            <li>I used the Desert Essence deodorant containing tea tree oil previously and found it to be a good product.  </li>
            <li>This is the best natural deodorant--it actually does the job, and it works pretty much all day long.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried that many - it was the first one I picked out at the local health food store after the doctor told me to stop using aluminum based products which caused me to have a blocked gland once.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to try something without aluminum for the days I do care to put on deodorant, when I know I will be working out, or it&#x27;s gonna be a really hot day.  </li>
            <li>I will need to keep a stick in my locker at work during the hot summer days.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re going to loose so many customers.</li>
            <li>Two stars because it works for a little while, has a light scent and is aluminum free.</li>
            <li>it keeps me from having much of a scent, too.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying a bunch of it now that Whole Foods no longer carries it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I really hope that price hike was a mistake.</li>
            <li>and I sweat way too much.</li>
            <li>Waiting for the product that can really stand up without the metals.</li>
            <li>It takes five days straight of continuous use before I even notice I have a rash, up until then no itching or burning.  </li>
            <li>I do not sweat much and after just an hour or 2</li>
            <li>This deodorant didn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>For someone who sweats a lot, I don&#x27;t think that it will work very well.</li>
            <li>This stuff works very well.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product that I&#x27;ve used exclusively for the past 3 or 4 years.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using it for weeks, and it still works like new!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a variety of natural deodorants because I don&#x27;t really trust the mass produced ones on the market, but this hardly worked (I liked the scent of it,</li>
            <li>I really like the Desert Essence products that I&#x27;ve tried so far, and my boyfriend bought me this 3-pack (Chamomile) at the beginning of summer.</li>
            <li>The one current customer submitted picture is right.</li>
            <li>It was very subtle and good for a man or a woman.</li>
            <li>Wow is all I can say!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s the first natural deodorant I&#x27;ve found that prevents underarm odor or even eradicates it if I forget and apply it later in the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I bought this at a local store after reading the positive reviews but it doesn&#x27;t last the whole day.</li>
            <li>I wish they&#x27;d clearly show which one this product is.</li>
            <li>but the people who created it really need to go back to the drawing board.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>For those of us who like to keep things natural and don&#x27;t want to put aluminium in our pits everyday--this is the closet thing to all day deodorant/antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>claims to have a scent of chamomile and calendula, but I&#x27;ve found it to be nearly unscented.</li>
            <li>is that it doesn&#x27;t discolor the underarms of my clothes the way my old aluminum based stick deodorant did.  </li>
            <li>I would not recommend this to anyone who was looking for an all natural product.</li>
            <li>I need to put up a disclaimer that I have incredibly sensitive skin:</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really sensitive to deodorants</li>
            <li>but I wanted something natural that wouldn&#x27;t be putting toxins like aluminum into my body.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always ended up going back to the aluminum ones, though, because none of the natural ones managed to keep odor away for a full day, and the potential risk of aluminum wasn&#x27;t, in my mind, enough to justify letting myself smell bad.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the customer who commented on the price being $200 per year, not sure what kind of math you are doing but that 3 pack for under $15 will last you an entire year, if not longer.</li>
            <li>I have tried several other deodorants, they completely ravage my underarms, so I&#x27;m settling on this and am going to occasionally use anti-perspirant when the irritation becomes bothersome and when I&#x27;m not wearing a light colored shirt.</li>
            <li>Compared to the deodorant I normally use (Tom&#x27;s of Maine lemongrass deodorant), I found this deodorant just didn&#x27;t last through the entire day, and my armpits would stink by early evening.</li>
            <li>It has almost no smell, and no matter how bad I smell before putting it on, I smell great afterwards.</li>
            <li>My armpits feel sticky right away and after a few hours I can smell a faintness of B.O....</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t make it through a full day if it is hot.  </li>
            <li>Having become aware of the heavy metals our bodies are accumulating, and the tendency of antiperspirants to cake on shirt armpits, I went looking for alternatives.  </li>
            <li>So while this used to be good, something may have changed and it makes the product really bad and unusable.</li>

            <li> So while this used to be good, something may have changed and it makes the product really bad and unusable.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that there is very minor irritation.  </li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t last very long when sweating a lot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried at least a dozen different natural, aluminum-free deodorant products, because I am nervous that there may be long term consequences of putting aluminum on my underarms daily.</li>
            <li> This deodorant seems to help with the sweating, lasts long, and I don&#x27;t recall ever having odor problems.  </li>
            <li> Not only do your armpits smell shortly after application, but MY armpits now have a slight rash.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My body chemistry is the same, I eat the same, health status the same, but all of a sudden this deodorant has been giving me bad body odor, and rather quickly after applying it</li>
            <li> , I almost never get any skin irritation with it, which is very different from other deodorants I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Not much scent, which I like, and</li>
            <li> blonde hair, pale, rosacea, keratosis pilaris, just a lot of problems.  </li>
            <li> Not much to say other than I like the smell, I&#x27;m not stinky when I wear it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s only one real down fall that I have seen.</li>
            <li> like the other products I&#x27;ve tried by Desert Essense...but not this one.</li>
            <li> Judging from the other reviews, it does work for some.  </li>
            <li> I have experience irritated skin when using deodorants made by other companies.  </li>
            <li> I am very leary of anti-perspirants that block the pores with all kinds of questionable chemicals.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worse than Old Spice.</li>
            <li> Dessert Essence is committed to beauty products that are safer for the body and use less chemicals than other products, and this product does just that!</li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t nasty &amp; I can actually go all day at work without sweaty underarms... which is extremely important because I&#x27;m a girl</li>
            <li> , I have some pretty bad BO using this deodorant.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why,</li>
            <li> I am not exactly sure how this works, but I think the tea tree oil kills the bacteria that can contribute to underarm odor, WITHOUT stinging, and uses aloe vera and lavender oil to keep underarms irritation-free.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product does not provide my individual body chemistry with odor protection.  </li>
            <li> I am sad to report back to all my friends that this doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> So after using this for years with no problem, in the past couple months I think something changed with their product.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Desert Essence shampoos, conditioners, and lotions, but I found this product disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it does not really do the job for summer sweat</li>
            <li> At least not with my body chemistry.</li>
            <li> I am not a person that sweats a lot and in general I don&#x27;t think I smell that bad when I do.</li>
            <li> My husband is the same way but not as bad (takes longer for him to stink).  </li>
            <li> but if I left it on over 3-4 hours without a shower then I started to have really bad BO</li>
            <li> now it irritates my skin and leave behind a rash.</li>

            <li> The one current customer submitted picture is right. I wish they&#x27;d clearly show which one this product is. However, the one in the current customer picture is the one I wanted and the one I got. As long as it is applied thoroughly, I think that it works great. This is a great deal, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant because it is made of non-toxic ingredients.    I am very leary of anti-perspirants that block the pores with all kinds of questionable chemicals.    It is a given that whatever is rubbed on my skin will be absorbed.    Thank goodness Desert Essence is aluminum-free and won&#x27;t harm my body over time.</li>
            <li> I have used this deoderant for YEARS, and I love it.  Not much scent, which I like, and it keeps me from having much of a scent, too.  Ha ha.  I&#x27;m buying a bunch of it now that Whole Foods no longer carries it.  I don&#x27;t like searching around for stuff I love.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Desert Essence shampoos, conditioners, and lotions, but I found this product disappointing.  Compared to the deodorant I normally use (Tom&#x27;s of Maine lemongrass deodorant), I found this deodorant just didn&#x27;t last through the entire day, and my armpits would stink by early evening.</li>
            <li> By far one of the best natural deodorants...I love it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years, and it works great. For the customer who commented on the price being $200 per year, not sure what kind of math you are doing but that 3 pack for under $15 will last you an entire year, if not longer. I use this product at once or twice every day and I only buy two to three bottles a year. I love it!</li>
            <li> My husband can&#x27;t have aluminum in his deodorant. The only place we can find this in stores it is really expensive so I&#x27;m glad that we were able to find it online.</li>
            <li> I tried this product a few times before I decided that I hate it.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself smells a bit ammoniated to begin with (which I didn&#x27;t realize initially because I didn&#x27;t smell it before I purchased it).  The final straw was when I put it under my arms after showering this afternoon and then went to my job.&lt;br /&gt;I made it halfway through a 6-hour shift waiting tables when I realized that my armpits stunk.  Not only do your armpits smell shortly after application, but MY armpits now have a slight rash.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to like this product...but the people who created it really need to go back to the drawing board.&lt;br /&gt;I like the other products I&#x27;ve tried by Desert Essense...but not this one.</li>
            <li> This is the best natural deodorant--it actually does the job, and it works pretty much all day long. It isn&#x27;t sticky, leave your skin oily or over saturated, and it doesn&#x27;t stain clothes.  It just all around works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now if you are comparing it to an antiperspirant that has aluminium, then it does not does not work as well.  For those of us who like to keep things natural and don&#x27;t want to put aluminium in our pits everyday--this is the closet thing to all day deodorant/antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> You will apply this deodorant and within a hour you will sweat alot and the smell of B.o. will start to form. Doesnt work well. have to keep applying and then your underarms feel like you lubed up for sex through out the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still searching for the perfect natural deodorant. I bought this at a local store after reading the positive reviews but it doesn&#x27;t last the whole day. I&#x27;d like to try the tea tree one but this version just didn&#x27;t cut it for me. Two stars because it works for a little while, has a light scent and is aluminum free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried at least a dozen different natural, aluminum-free deodorant products, because I am nervous that there may be long term consequences of putting aluminum on my underarms daily. I&#x27;ve always ended up going back to the aluminum ones, though, because none of the natural ones managed to keep odor away for a full day, and the potential risk of aluminum wasn&#x27;t, in my mind, enough to justify letting myself smell bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The name of this one caught my attention, as most of the aluminum-free products don&#x27;t claim to have any antiperspirant effect, just to block bacteria that cause odor. I was thrilled to discover, upon trying it, that this one does work as an antiperspirant as well as keeping odor away for an entire day, even on sweaty days involving some exercise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It claims to have a scent of chamomile and calendula, but I&#x27;ve found it to be nearly unscented. Although It may not be quite as strong an antiperspirant as some aluminum containing products, it is far and away the best non-aluminum one I&#x27;ve tried, and does the job quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product will finally allow me to stay away from a daily aluminum dose.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried that many - it was the first one I picked out at the local health food store after the doctor told me to stop using aluminum based products which caused me to have a blocked gland once.  My local store is now gone, so ordering it online.  I have found an additional benefit of this product is that it doesn&#x27;t discolor the underarms of my clothes the way my old aluminum based stick deodorant did.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love this product so much. It works so well and safely! But I refuse to pay almost $200 for something that I put in my pitts! Guess I&#x27;m going back to the crystal. I really hope that price hike was a mistake. You&#x27;re going to loose so many customers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different organic/vegan Deodorants and this one works best by far. The scent isn&#x27;t nasty &amp; I can actually go all day at work without sweaty underarms... which is extremely important because I&#x27;m a girl and I sweat way too much. This product definitely helped decrease damp shirts for me so five stars.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product that I&#x27;ve used exclusively for the past 3 or 4 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the first natural deodorant I&#x27;ve found that prevents underarm odor or even eradicates it if I forget and apply it later in the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I almost never get any skin irritation with it, which is very different from other deodorants I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> They are still a lot of chemicals in this. I have the most sensitive skin ever and this is by far the worst I&#x27;ve ever tried. It&#x27;s worse than Old Spice. My armpits broke out in hives!!! Awful, will never buy again</li>
            <li> The deodorant works and all, but it leaves my underarms sticky as the day goes on. It wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> I really like the Desert Essence products that I&#x27;ve tried so far, and my boyfriend bought me this 3-pack (Chamomile) at the beginning of summer. Unfortunately, it does not really do the job for summer sweat, I had to reapply several times even after showering.&lt;br /&gt;However, one good thing is that it does not leave much residue, if any.&lt;br /&gt;It works just fine in the winter and is good for right after shower/shaving.</li>
            <li> I do like it.  There is no scent which is what I wanted.  Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t make it through a full day if it is hot.  And it doesn&#x27;t hold up well to a moderate intensity exercise program.  Doesn&#x27;t hold oder at bay under those circumstances.  So when I know I am going somewhere hotter or where it needs to last longer, I still have to go back to aluminum based anti-persperants.  Waiting for the product that can really stand up without the metals.</li>
            <li> The product has been changed it used to be the only deodorant I could use now it irritates my skin and leave behind a rash. I would not recommend this to anyone who was looking for an all natural product. This is obviously isn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a variety of natural deodorants because I don&#x27;t really trust the mass produced ones on the market, but this hardly worked (I liked the scent of it, but I think it maybe worked 3 hours) AND it made my underarms itch (happened multiple times with the same deodorant, so I know it&#x27;s this brand).  Not sure why, but it&#x27;s going in the trash.</li>
            <li> I chose this deodorant because I sweat excessively and don&#x27;t want to use antiperspirant with aluminum, but not because I&#x27;m afraid of health problems.  The chemical reaction aluminum has with sweat has destroyed all my light colored t-shirts, massive bright yellow pit stains.  This deodorant seems to help with the sweating, lasts long, and I don&#x27;t recall ever having odor problems.  The only problem is that there is very minor irritation.  I need to put up a disclaimer that I have incredibly sensitive skin: blonde hair, pale, rosacea, keratosis pilaris, just a lot of problems.  It takes five days straight of continuous use before I even notice I have a rash, up until then no itching or burning.  I have tried several other deodorants, they completely ravage my underarms, so I&#x27;m settling on this and am going to occasionally use anti-perspirant when the irritation becomes bothersome and when I&#x27;m not wearing a light colored shirt.</li>
            <li> Wow is all I can say! Dessert Essence is committed to beauty products that are safer for the body and use less chemicals than other products, and this product does just that! Aluminum has been linked to different diseases and disorders, so they took that out. I am not exactly sure how this works, but I think the tea tree oil kills the bacteria that can contribute to underarm odor, WITHOUT stinging, and uses aloe vera and lavender oil to keep underarms irritation-free. I am a guy, and this even manages to keep me smelling great! I use many Dessert Essence products, and now I have added another one to my regimine. I have been using it for weeks, and it still works like new!</li>
            <li> Yay for the ingredients- nay for the way it works.  I do not sweat much and after just an hour or 2, I have some pretty bad BO using this deodorant.  My husband is the same way but not as bad (takes longer for him to stink).  Tom&#x27;s of Maine works great for me so to each their own.</li>
            <li> Having become aware of the heavy metals our bodies are accumulating, and the tendency of antiperspirants to cake on shirt armpits, I went looking for alternatives.  Unfortunately this product does not provide my individual body chemistry with odor protection.  No difference from not wearing deodorant at all.  Judging from the other reviews, it does work for some.  I had better luck with another all-natural brand, VibesUp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which ever product you choose, your body will thank you for going aluminum and antiperspirant free!</li>
            <li> This product works well I do not have any allergic symptoms that I get from regular commercial antiperspirants and deodorants. It controls the oders and seems to help with perspiration. I am not entirely find of the scent, it is acceptable but I would have preferred the lavendar.</li>
            <li> This deodorant didn&#x27;t really work. While it does have a pleasant scent, it didn&#x27;t last for more than an hour. At least not with my body chemistry. I would suggest that you buy one bottle and see how it works for you.</li>
            <li> I am not a smelly person.  Sometimes I don&#x27;t even wear deodorant and I&#x27;m fine. I wanted to try something without aluminum for the days I do care to put on deodorant, when I know I will be working out, or it&#x27;s gonna be a really hot day.  I am sad to report back to all my friends that this doesn&#x27;t work. It smells good, but once it&#x27;s on I feel like it creates a stench that was never there to start off with.  My armpits feel sticky right away and after a few hours I can smell a faintness of B.O....Once I finish this off I will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I like this deodorant because it helps keep me dry without the nasty aluminum,  Goes on very nicely as well.</li>
            <li> Not much to say other than I like the smell, I&#x27;m not stinky when I wear it. What more could I ask for? Amiright?  *Update So after using this for years with no problem, in the past couple months I think something changed with their product. My body chemistry is the same, I eat the same, health status the same, but all of a sudden this deodorant has been giving me bad body odor, and rather quickly after applying it I might add. I wrote the company but they have never returned my e-mail asking if the changed something.  So while this used to be good, something may have changed and it makes the product really bad and unusable. Kind of a bummer since I&#x27;ve been using it for years no problem and liked it.</li>
            <li> I looked at a lot of reviews and prices before ordering this product. I&#x27;m really sensitive to deodorants but I wanted something natural that wouldn&#x27;t be putting toxins like aluminum into my body. I bought this for me and my husband so when I received it, I liked the smell. It was very subtle and good for a man or a woman. My husband hasn&#x27;t tried it yet but I am not going to be using the product. I am not a person that sweats a lot and in general I don&#x27;t think I smell that bad when I do. As an antiperspirant this was ok. For someone who sweats a lot, I don&#x27;t think that it will work very well. What I did notice is that after 3-4 hours it just seemed to stop working. Not only that, but if I left it on over 3-4 hours without a shower then I started to have really bad BO like it was making me smell worse than if I had nothing on at all. Reapplication didn&#x27;t help at all. Maybe it is just the way it works with my body chemistry but at the end of the day I felt gross and smelly.</li>
            <li> I needed to stop poisoning myself with aluminum. This stuff works very well. One stick lasts a lot longer than any others I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s only one real down fall that I have seen. I will need to keep a stick in my locker at work during the hot summer days. This doesn&#x27;t last very long when sweating a lot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only deodorant I use anymore. It has almost no smell, and no matter how bad I smell before putting it on, I smell great afterwards.</li>
            <li> Love that this is organic and aluminum free. Still adjusting to the stickiness of this product. Smells great and worth the stickiness to be organic and aluminum free.</li>
            <li> I used the Desert Essence deodorant containing tea tree oil previously and found it to be a good product.  I have found this deodorant containing chamomile and calendula to be as effective or possibly even better.  I have experience irritated skin when using deodorants made by other companies.  The Desert Essence deodorants do not irritate my skin.</li>
