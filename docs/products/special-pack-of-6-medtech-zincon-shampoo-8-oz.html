    <ol>
            <li> great stuff use it all the time</li>
            <li> Please stock this ASAP. I have loved it and used it for 40 years</li>
            <li> This is the only product that will help dandruff.  My husband has used this for over twenty years.  Just uses it once sometimes twice&lt;br /&gt;a week.</li>
            <li> I have been using for years now. have used several other brands with no success. Would highly recommend, but is hard to find.</li>
            <li> I am so grateful that Zincon is still making this shampoo, which is the very best I have ever used in my adult years. It has a nice texture and fragrance, and most of all it is so beneficial to control dandruff, as well as bringing about a nice texture for the hair itself. I have been using this product for probably twenty years or so. I was so grateful that Amazon carries this shampoo. No other drugstore around me even stocks this product any more. Thank you Medtech. Thank you Amazon. It is so reassuring and wonderful that such a quality product is still being produced and is still able to be purchased. Very best wishes. Barbara S., Stoneham, MA.</li>
            <li> Your price is $8.25 per bottle (for 6 pack).  If I buy individually, it is $8.00.  I thought you would give a quantity discount.</li>
            <li> keeps head from itching and really cleans scalp</li>
            <li> eliminates dandruff and leaves hair soft and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;been using it for years and hope not to need to use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;cannot purchase in any stores, grateful for the web</li>
            <li> using this shampoo for years and love it.  The whole family uses it, and it leaves hair fluffy and clean-no dandruff</li>
            <li> I have had an acne-like scalp condition for years. My doctor recommended Zincon, and it works. Not only does it medicate my scalp, it leaves my hair squeaky clean and soft. It rinses out easily and smells good.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other medicated shampoos (coal tar types and others with zinc in them), but none work as well or leave my hair in such good condition as Zincon. I would recommend it without reservation.&lt;br /&gt;I would pay any price for Zincon, because it&#x27;s the only one that works for me.</li>
            <li> Refreshing wash.  Leaves hair easy to manage. Like how it lathers. Relieves itching and scaling.This my second purchase. The first time I tried Zicon I purchased only one bottle. My second purchase was for 6 bottles.  I don&#x27;t want to run out.  The price for 6 bottles was reasonable.</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for many years. It is a wonderful product. The skin doctor originally told me about it. I have sensitive skin and scalp. It leaves my hair manageable with plenty of body.. I used to buy it at the drug store, but now I can buy it thru amazon.com. Very happy with this purchase. .</li>
            <li> I used to use another dandruff shampoo that got barred from sale for containing a carcinogenic.  I switched to Zincon which works fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS I forgot to mention that the packaging was fine and it was the best price I could find.</li>
            <li> Received as promised .Excellent service and follow up.</li>
            <li> we use this shampoo instead of over the counter dandruff because it actually works!! I used to have sebhorria on the backside of my head I used to scratch myself to bleeding once I started using zincon faithfully 10 yrs ago I have not had one speck of a problem and my husband used to occasionally have a dandruff issue and since he has been also using the zincon faithfully he has not had another issue!!!! thank you zincon we highly recommend this shampoo and it does NOT smell bad at all!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff works great and can be used everyday. I makes my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I use Zincon and buying the pack of six saved on the price.  Local store only sell by the bottle and at a higher price.</li>
            <li> This is just theproduct my Doctor informed me of, I actually use this as a facial cleanser, not somuch as a shampoo [my head is shaved bald -- sooooo] -- Try it, Great price and free shipping !!! :o)</li>
            <li> yhru my stupidity i bought twice as much of this product as i had intended to.  i could not find this in local stores and did want a supply.  it is a good product and i will put my now lifetime supply to good use.</li>
            <li> The shampoo bottles were not tightly closed and leaked into the box.  That seems pretty dumb. Even a three-year-old can learn how to close a screw cap.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I works well.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works to keep dandruff away, hair shinny, and no nasty smell. It&#x27;s the zinc that makes it work!</li>
