            <li>I use it along with my eyebrow pencil for my perfect shade!</li>
            <li>Great value for the quality and price!</li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li>I have searched for the perfect eyebrow makeup for me and this is it!</li>
            <li>I had hoped this would be the answer to my quest for the perfect brow kit.</li>
            <li>The packaging was beautiful too, with a hand written thank you note.  </li>
            <li>So happy I found this.</li>
            <li>The color is great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just as great of quality as Benefit, though I haven&#x27;t used any of the brow wax that came with the package.</li>
            <li>and I love it!!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!!</li>
            <li>Good seller...not a great color for me...</li>
            <li>Seller is fantastic also!!</li>
            <li>So Pleased!</li>
            <li>Like every eyebrow powder I have tried it&#x27;s just okay!</li>
            <li>It goes on so nice and blends well.</li>
            <li>I liked the fact they gave me a powder to lighten it</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Great product, well worth the purchase, goes on easily and stays all day.</li>
            <li>I love this combination of brow powder and wax.</li>
            <li>I like this product to make my eyebrows more distinguishable.</li>
            <li>The look is very natural and an additional very nice eyebrow brush was included with my order.  </li>
            <li>This product is really good almost the same as the Bar Minerals one I used for many years but has now been discontinued why I do not know as it was so popular.  </li>
            <li>Great product goes on easy, looks natural.</li>
            <li>It was so easy to use and stays on all day.</li>
            <li>You can lighten the color yourself if it is too dark and the seller will even help to find your perfect shade if you ask.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, I know when my eyebrows start to look like I used a sharpie marker as filler</li>
            <li>I have been using bare minerals for years and loved it.  </li>
            <li>Now that I look at their site a bit more, their prices really can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>Other than that it is great.</li>
            <li>The eyebrow powder with the wax is far superior to Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li>I have been using Bare Minerals eyebrow powder for many years</li>
            <li>Easy to use and looks natural</li>
            <li>and I really wanted a small one (-1 star) and the packaging isn&#x27;t great because I had some oil in a makeup bag that opened</li>
            <li>I did use this, as I ordered too dark a color.&lt;br /&gt;Products arrived beautifully packaged with a personalized handwritten note, and a coupon for a subsequent purchase.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very affordable</li>
            <li>It was only because the plastic container they package it in is cheap stackable.</li>
            <li>This powder is practically the same shade, but they also throw in a free light power to lighten up the color if necessary, or highlight under the brow.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product and this company.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>so I quickly ditched the pencils and searched for loose powder.</li>
            <li>I was disappointed when they discontinued it, but I am so happy I found this!  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t  look natural at all.</li>
            <li>This product is every bit as good, if not better, for an unbelievable price.  </li>
            <li>Sucks (-1 star for cheap packaging).</li>
            <li>I bought this when bare minerals phased out their eyebrow powder.</li>
            <li>This seamlessly fills in where the last ended.</li>
            <li>I used brunette in bare minerals and the dark brown color in this product matched really well.  </li>
            <li>I miss my bare essentials dark blonde so much.</li>

            <li> Also included was a small packet of off-white eyebrow powder, in order to lighten the main color if necessary.</li>
            <li> but the brush was a long tapered brush</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used loose powders for my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> and this product wasn&#x27;t sealed tight enough to keep it out so 80% of the brown powder had to be discarded which upset me.</li>
            <li> Bare Escentuals dark blonde which again was an ATF (and again, discontinued), the Clinique brow powder (not really a great product), and finally this.</li>
            <li> I had used the &amp;#34;blonde&amp;#34; shade before, being a very dirty blonde, to light brown.</li>
            <li> I had been using Bare Minerals eyebrow powder, but no more!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for this for a few months now</li>
            <li> For 10 bucks I got brow color, wax, porcelain powder for adjusting the color, a small brow brush, and a longer handled brow brush.  </li>
            <li> I was worried that the wax would be hard to cleanse but not at all.</li>

            <li> It is very easy to use. The color is great.  I&#x27;m a brunette with red highlights.  Stays on all day. I was worried that the wax would be hard to cleanse but not at all.</li>
            <li> Great product goes on easy, looks natural. Lasts all day. I would recommend this product and use again. It&#x27;s very affordable</li>
            <li> never used a wax with the brow powder. It was so easy to use and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> I have been using bare minerals for years and loved it.  I was disappointed when they discontinued it, but I am so happy I found this!

            <li> Great product, well worth the purchase, goes on easily and stays all day. Would buy again for future use for my eyebrows</li>
            <li> I ordered Lip Blam and the eyebrow powder. I have been using Bare Minerals eyebrow powder for many years and now I must thank them for discontinuing the powder. The eyebrow powder with the wax is far superior to Bare Minerals. The look is very natural and an additional very nice eyebrow brush was included with my order.  I am a convert and will recommend these products to my friends.</li>
            <li> I love this combination of brow powder and wax. I had been using Bare Minerals eyebrow powder, but no more! Also included was a small packet of off-white eyebrow powder, in order to lighten the main color if necessary.

            <li> Cumbersome. Doesn&#x27;t  look natural at all. I don&#x27;t recommend the product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product. You can lighten the color yourself if it is too dark and the seller will even help to find your perfect shade if you ask.  Great value for the quality and price!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! Easy to use and looks natural; everyone I told about it had no idea I even fill my eyebrows. Easier than just powder, or pencil.</li>
            <li> I like this product to make my eyebrows more distinguishable.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!! I have searched for the perfect eyebrow makeup for me and this is it! Thank you.</li>
            <li> This product is really good almost the same as the Bar Minerals one I used for many years but has now been discontinued why I do not know as it was so popular.  This one is also cheaper but the only thing I would say the shipping costs cost the same amount as to purchase the brow powder which makes it more expensive.  Other than that it is great.</li>
            <li> Good seller...not a great color for me...</li>
            <li> I miss my bare essentials dark blonde so much. I had hoped this would be the answer to my quest for the perfect brow kit. I&#x27;ve tried the Chanel brow duo which was my ATF (discontinued) and then the  bareMinerals | Bare Escentuals dark blonde which again was an ATF (and again, discontinued), the Clinique brow powder (not really a great product), and finally this. I liked the fact they gave me a powder to lighten it but the brush was a long tapered brush and I really wanted a small one (-1 star) and the packaging isn&#x27;t great because I had some oil in a makeup bag that opened and it got all over and this product wasn&#x27;t sealed tight enough to keep it out so 80% of the brown powder had to be discarded which upset me. It was only because the plastic container they package it in is cheap stackable. No liner to keep out air and moisture so I&#x27;m out my powder now. Sucks (-1 star for cheap packaging). The search continues.</li>
            <li> I bought this when bare minerals phased out their eyebrow powder. This seamlessly fills in where the last ended. I had used the &amp;#34;blonde&amp;#34; shade before, being a very dirty blonde, to light brown. This powder is practically the same shade, but they also throw in a free light power to lighten up the color if necessary, or highlight under the brow. Now that I look at their site a bit more, their prices really can&#x27;t be beat. I&#x27;ll likely be trying out their shadows in the future too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used loose powders for my eyebrows. When I realized Benefit no longer made my powder and went strictly to gel pencils, I tried making the switch. Fortunately, I know when my eyebrows start to look like I used a sharpie marker as filler so I quickly ditched the pencils and searched for loose powder. FOUND IT. It&#x27;s just as great of quality as Benefit, though I haven&#x27;t used any of the brow wax that came with the package.</li>
            <li> Like every eyebrow powder I have tried it&#x27;s just okay!</li>
