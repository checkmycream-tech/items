    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This Glitter Mascara Set Comes in 10 beautiful colors, but the wand in so skimpy that it does not apply ANY mascara to your eye lashes!</li>
            <li>Perfect eye sparkle for brightening eye color.</li>
            <li>These are perfect for me!</li>
            <li>They help create that awesome look!</li>
            <li>But might be good for a craft project!</li>
            <li>Still a great bargain for the price.</li>
            <li>huh lol</li>
            <li>They are very nice</li>
            <li>I have had a good while to use these</li>
            <li>They are so good.</li>
            <li>Who absolutely loved these.</li>
            <li>I tried using a better wand &amp; still, nothing!</li>
            <li>I love  glitter!</li>
            <li>I absolutly LOVE the colored, glittery mascara set that I ordered from you!</li>
            <li>I will be getting atleast 6 more sets asap for my sisters and friends as Christmas gifts!</li>
            <li>(not trying to toot my own horn</li>
            <li>- I received this item in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very easy to remove it</li>
            <li>you want these glitter colors to stick out more your best bet would be to apply over your normal black/brown mascara or even over a colored mascara.</li>
            <li>They look better in the bottle.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying this product.</li>
            <li>I have had to try using a q-tip applicator to see if I could get a better coating.</li>
            <li>:-/&lt;br /&gt;I love glittery/sparkly make up and was hoping to get a look simular to the advertised picture.</li>
            <li>I should have known better.</li>
            <li>I love it, and get so many compliments on it</li>
            <li>I love all of the colors</li>
            <li>Love these and will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>and my eyes were pretty gorgeous  </li>
            <li>Very pretty and eye catching.</li>
            <li>I am just glad it was so cheap</li>
            <li>I like how they are easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very pretty colors Make up fans dream I&#x27;ve never had or seen so many color options in glitter mascara ♡♥</li>
            <li>these are more of a glitter than a mscara and add so much fun to your look.</li>
            <li>No wonder it was so cheap.</li>
            <li>It is a smooth mascara does not clump up when putting it on.</li>
            <li>It is easier if you use a different applicator brush so it will apply better but they are really good.</li>
            <li>I really love them very much</li>
            <li>, i first use my Covergirl mascara to thicken my lashes and to make them longer, then I use the glitter mascara, i feel it works better this way.</li>
            <li>These are fun!</li>
            <li>This comes in 10 fun colors and they are really easy to use, the wand is skinny and packs a lot of glitter onto it.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced and I love the look of them on me.</li>
            <li>Also, It is waterproof, it doesn&#x27;t have an odor, and it dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Love these products and will buy more in the future when I run out.  </li>
            <li>This is a fun set of glitter mascara.</li>
            <li>but it isn&#x27;t worth the purchase - I promise you.</li>
            <li>is definitely worth it</li>
            <li>I got this for the fun look and it was what i was looking for.</li>
            <li>They are cute for my 12 year old who Cheers to add some sparkle to her eyes or she will put a streak in her hair.</li>
            <li>Great colors for the teen and early twenties crowd.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for drama this in not the right product for you.</li>
            <li>Only down issue is they aren&#x27;t waterproof. :-) :-) :-)</li>
            <li>well if you put on regular mascara first which I have to do as my eyelashes are very light.</li>
            <li>It cost way too much for what you get!</li>
            <li>This mascara works better when you use a regular mascara</li>
            <li>This mascara is very transparent and does not change the color of your lashes very much.</li>
            <li>I cannot and would LOVE to find a company that would make some of these cosmetics for those of us that are limited as to which ones we can use.</li>
            <li>I think the bacteria really holds up well in the glitter gunk that comes out of these bottles.</li>
            <li>and she really likes it</li>
            <li>It was okay not much glitter stays on the eyelashes.</li>
            <li>its really glittery and doesnt really show the color.</li>
            <li>but there isn&#x27;t really color</li>
            <li>I recommend using this on top of the black mascara from earlier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>I was looking for an opaque mascara for vibrantly colored lashes.</li>
            <li>but I later realized that if I put on my normal black mascara it shows up fine (2 applications of the glitter)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>I ended up getting an eye infection after wearing one of the blue colored mascaras for a couple weeks straight.</li>
            <li>You need to use it over regular mascara but the glitter doesn&#x27;t show very well.</li>
            <li>I ended up giving these to my 12 year old.</li>
            <li>They are mainly just glitter no actual color.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t show up well unless you do three coats and has major clumping</li>
            <li>but I mean thats fine</li>
            <li>When using this please add black mascara to you eye lashes first to bring out the glitter look.</li>
            <li>The glitter really does not show up that much on eyelashes; but it is okay--the cost was minimal; I would rate the item below average.</li>
            <li>The glitter-based mascara is chunky, hard to apply, and more than once got into my eye, causing extreme irritation and comfort (of course I&#x27;m not surprised by that).</li>

            <li> Didn&#x27;t last long but wasn&#x27;t expected especially when she can wear any and all brands of makeup.</li>
            <li> but it adds a subtle sparkle depending on how much you put on.</li>
            <li> and I decided to come back and update my previous review.</li>
            <li> amazing!i use them a lot when i go out or just when i want a little extra in my look for the day!</li>
            <li> This product is lighter than expected.</li>
            <li> not what I expected</li>
            <li> but the colors were what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> not worth the money</li>
            <li> Your eyelashes do look slightly funky</li>
            <li> I tried over black mascara</li>
            <li> It is as though they are dried up.</li>
            <li> Lokked like it was described but no color went on lashes and very very little glitter.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste the money!</li>
            <li> just a waste of money!</li>
            <li> The glitter colors are hard to see, but the &amp;#34;shimmer&amp;#34; from the glitter does show.  </li>
            <li> but i received it a day late.</li>
            <li> Product is very hard to get off of the mascara brush.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to tell if you have got any of the product on your eyelashes.</li>
            <li> very poor quality....</li>
            <li> Ugh, bad idea.</li>
            <li> The wand is worthless.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> This s horrible, the glitter color does not even come out on the application brush-</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> They look better in the bottle. I have to wear an undercoat for it to show up. I do have blonde eye lashes so that might be the problem. Ended up giving them all away.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: I have had a good while to use these and I decided to come back and update my previous review. I&#x27;m changing the 3 stars to a 4. Here&#x27;s why...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. My first complaint was that the glitter couldn&#x27;t be seen but I later realized that if I put on my normal black mascara it shows up fine (2 applications of the glitter)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It use to clump but I learned that moving the brush back and forth while applying it helps it not clump as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. It draws that wanted attention to your eyes, especially in the sunlight. I took pics while at the pool and my eyes were pretty gorgeous  (not trying to toot my own horn lol)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want these glitter colors to stick out more your best bet would be to apply over your normal black/brown mascara or even over a colored mascara. Also, It is waterproof, it doesn&#x27;t have an odor, and it dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this product.</li>
            <li> NOT ONE OF THE MASCARAS work the way they are advertised!  Glitter does not appear ANYWHERE on a lash!  Did a test on my skin and again, no glitter presented.  DO NOT PURCHASE!</li>
            <li> these are more of a glitter than a mscara and add so much fun to your look. It does not BLING out your eyelashes but it adds a subtle sparkle depending on how much you put on. This comes in 10 fun colors and they are really easy to use, the wand is skinny and packs a lot of glitter onto it. I recommend using this on top of the black mascara from earlier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note - I received this item in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> These glitter mascaras do not deposit any glitter effect to the eyelashes.  It is as though they are dried up.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t show up well unless you do three coats and has major clumping</li>
            <li> Bless this set. Reasonably priced and I love the look of them on me. I get compliments all of the time.</li>
            <li> Product is very hard to get off of the mascara brush. It is very hard to tell if you have got any of the product on your eyelashes. I have had to try using a q-tip applicator to see if I could get a better coating. Coverage IS NOTHING like the advertised pictures. :-/&lt;br /&gt;I love glittery/sparkly make up and was hoping to get a look simular to the advertised picture. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Too glittery. It won&#x27;t stick to your eyelashes and is a pain to take off. The wand is worthless. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> This product is lighter than expected. The colors don&#x27;t show up that well if you put on regular mascara first which I have to do as my eyelashes are very light. But overall I like it as it does add some shimmer to my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I used them. It is easier if you use a different applicator brush so it will apply better but they are really good.</li>
            <li> This is a fun set of glitter mascara. I wanted a lot of glitter in my mascara. Some of these have enough for me and some don&#x27;t. Still a great bargain for the price.</li>
            <li> To achieve awesome-looking lashes, I went ahead and purchased this set. Ugh, bad idea. The glitter-based mascara is chunky, hard to apply, and more than once got into my eye, causing extreme irritation and comfort (of course I&#x27;m not surprised by that). I ended up getting an eye infection after wearing one of the blue colored mascaras for a couple weeks straight. I should have known better. I think the bacteria really holds up well in the glitter gunk that comes out of these bottles. Your eyelashes do look slightly funky/colorful but it isn&#x27;t worth the purchase - I promise you.</li>
            <li> The glitter really does not show up that much on eyelashes; but it is okay--the cost was minimal; I would rate the item below average.</li>
            <li> Made my lashes feel brittle &amp; damaged, definitely won&#x27;t be using as mascara again. But might be good for a craft project!</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, Don&#x27;t bother.  I can not even get the stuff out the tubes.  No wonder it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> These go with everything! They are so good. Only down issue is they aren&#x27;t waterproof. :-) :-) :-)</li>
            <li> these are amazing!i use them a lot when i go out or just when i want a little extra in my look for the day!</li>
            <li> This Glitter Mascara Set Comes in 10 beautiful colors, but the wand in so skimpy that it does not apply ANY mascara to your eye lashes! I tried using a better wand &amp; still, nothing! I have no clue what is in this product, but mascara is not any part of it! It cost way too much for what you get! I wouldn&#x27;t waste the money!</li>
            <li> This s horrible, the glitter color does not even come out on the application brush-just a waste of money! Which I seem to be running into on the internet!!!</li>
            <li> I have been looking in stores everywhere for glitter mascara and I finally found it.  I love it, and get so many compliments on it</li>
            <li> Love these products and will buy more in the future when I run out.  Perfect eye sparkle for brightening eye color.</li>
            <li> gift for granddaughter and she really likes it</li>
            <li> You need to use it over regular mascara but the glitter doesn&#x27;t show very well.</li>
            <li> I really love them very much</li>
            <li> Very pretty colors Make up fans dream I&#x27;ve never had or seen so many color options in glitter mascara ♡♥</li>
            <li> The glitter colors are hard to see, but the &amp;#34;shimmer&amp;#34; from the glitter does show.  They &amp;#34;will do&amp;#34; but i doubt i will order these again from this manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I love  glitter! These are perfect for me!</li>
            <li> Lokked like it was described but no color went on lashes and very very little glitter. I am just glad it was so cheap, I guess that should have give me a clue huh lol</li>
            <li> It was okay not much glitter stays on the eyelashes. It just makes them all clamp together not what I expected</li>
            <li> Who absolutely loved these. All the colors she has tried already each has delivered. Very pretty and eye catching. However, if you do not get this all off before you sleep, you may have eye irritation in the morning. Didn&#x27;t last long but wasn&#x27;t expected especially when she can wear any and all brands of makeup. I cannot and would LOVE to find a company that would make some of these cosmetics for those of us that are limited as to which ones we can use.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 sets one for me &amp; one for my boyfriends daughter.  I haven&#x27;t tried it yet but the colors were what I expected it to be. and was sent out when it was stated or before</li>
            <li> They are very nice I wear them to school the glitter isn&#x27;t always like out there like I wanted to but I mean thats fine you can see it when you are in the sun and it&#x27;s very easy to remove it is definitely worth it and I will recommend that.</li>
            <li> I absolutly LOVE the colored, glittery mascara set that I ordered from you! I will be getting atleast 6 more sets asap for my sisters and friends as Christmas gifts!</li>
            <li> its really glittery and doesnt really show the color. when its time to take it off its a total nightmare. i like the brush but the product rips eyelashes out when you try to use multiple coats. would not rebuy</li>
            <li> It would&#x27;ve been 5 stars but i received it a day late. I heard the color didn&#x27;t show but there isn&#x27;t really color it&#x27;s just colored glitter. One of the caps wasn&#x27;t connected to the brush which was upsetting but it still works.</li>
            <li> When using this please add black mascara to you eye lashes first to bring out the glitter look. I love all of the colors</li>
            <li> I got this for the fun look and it was what i was looking for. Its was what it said it would be.</li>
            <li> very poor quality....not worth the money</li>
            <li> I ended up giving these to my 12 year old. They are mainly just glitter no actual color. I tried over black mascara but then it seems to clump. They are cute for my 12 year old who Cheers to add some sparkle to her eyes or she will put a streak in her hair. If you are looking for drama this in not the right product for you.</li>
            <li> This mascara works better when you use a regular mascara, i first use my Covergirl mascara to thicken my lashes and to make them longer, then I use the glitter mascara, i feel it works better this way. However I wish the brushes for the glitter mascara were thicker so I can only rate 3 stars.</li>
            <li> Great colors for the teen and early twenties crowd.  It is a smooth mascara does not clump up when putting it on.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an opaque mascara for vibrantly colored lashes. This mascara is very transparent and does not change the color of your lashes very much.</li>
            <li> These are fun! I like how they are easy to use. They help create that awesome look! Love these and will be ordering more.</li>
