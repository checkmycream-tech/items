            <li>I got this at a really great price to test in return of my honest opinion!!</li>
            <li>The picture does no justice to the beautiful purple that this iron has.</li>

            <li>The screen is great too.</li>
            <li>This straightener works great to defrizz your hair  and</li>
            <li>I think it does a great job.</li>
            <li>1-inch size is great for dual usage of straightening and curling if you have longer hair like myself.</li>
            <li>Comes with a heat-resistant case that is great for protective and portability</li>
            <li>I was so happy when I was chosen to review this product during a promotional period for my unbiased opinions.  </li>
            <li>It has a highly sophisticated microprocessor that has a LCD control display so it allows you to personalize your heat settings to your desired style and hair type &amp; it has convenient buttons on the side of the appliance to control the heat setting!!</li>
            <li>This is an amazing straightener!</li>
            <li>If a person is satisfied with the 3 temperature settings, then it might be perfect for that person.</li>
            <li>On top of all those amazing features it comes with a travel and storage case lined with heat resistant material!!!</li>
            <li>I love the lock at the end of the wand that is perfect for storage.  </li>
            <li>It has an easy to read LCD temperature display, and an auto off feature that I think is really awesome!</li>
            <li>well as two great safety features ( my favorite! )</li>
            <li>The temp controls are not located on the inside so that&#x27;s good because it decreases your chance of getting burned if you try to readjust the temp after the iron has been turned on.</li>
            <li>never tried this brand before, but definitely a good brand.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so good after using it.</li>

            <li>It would be better if it would go up one degree at a time.</li>
            <li>And I love the auto shut off and the LED screen.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I received a free sample in order to make an informed review but my opinions are my own</li>

            <li>so you know how close you are to being able to use it.</li>
            <li>I love the mix of metallic purple and black.&lt;br</li>
            <li>you get a dial, not buttons, and they are usually more inside the top and bottom part of the iron.</li>
            <li>I love all of your products.</li>
            <li>The curls come out looking better than if I had used a curling iron most of the time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Truly one of my favorite hair tools</li>
            <li>I love the color.</li>
            <li>The Dolce comes with a heat safe bag for the safest storage after use.  </li>
            <li>I can adjust the heating to what I want to make sure I&#x27;m not overheating and damaging my hair.</li>
            <li>started off working real good then all of a sudden</li>
            <li>Received iron for free for product review to give honest opinion.</li>
            <li>hair has always been wavy and frizzy, despite trying many styling products and always using a hair dryer.  </li>

            <li>I love the straightner</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so cute.</li>
            <li>It does heat up real quick but it doesn&#x27;t do anything to my hair, tried curling it and it won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I also love the heat proof bag that comes with it.</li>
            <li>and I love that you can control the temperature.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my hair since using it.</li>

            <li>Another awesome thing about this straightener is that it has a digital display letting you know the temperature of the iron.</li>
            <li>One thing that I love about XTAVA is that they always send a heat protectant bag with their hair curlers and irons.</li>
            <li>I love this option because I straighten my bangs on a lower temp than the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li>There has been no need to go over the hair more than once on the highest setting</li>
            <li>options that go up to 430 degrees Fahrenheit which is sure to make this flat iron perfect for everyone and every type of hair</li>

            <li>/&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li>I received this product complimentary to share my honest opinion.</li>

            <li>I can easily lower the heat if I need</li>
            <li>buttons on this are easy to use, and well labelled.</li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly, which is one thing that I truly appreciate.</li>
            <li>The 360 degree cord made it easy to reach all of my hair without getting all wound</li>
            <li>That attracted me to it in the first place to be honest.</li>
            <li>Fine for me.</li>
            <li>My oldest daughters hair is fine and wavy.</li>
            <li>Super cute and sleek design.</li>
            <li>The quality is super!</li>
            <li>What I love about this iron is that it is super light weight</li>
            <li>The display screen is nice and large so all it takes is a glance at the screen.</li>
            <li>The buttons are easily accessible and easy to push.</li>
            <li>Plates do not glide through smoothly and does not work with giving your hair curl.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight.</li>
            <li>but I use an iron to smooth it out.</li>
            <li>My hair feels silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I recieved this product free of charge in exchange for my unbiased review</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I have every used a straightener this light before,</li>
            <li>Really cheap quality hair</li>
            <li>Lightweight, feels cheap.</li>
            <li>I was very impressed at how well it worked and how my hair instantly went straight without having to re use it over and over again.</li>
            <li>I was very impressed at how well it worked and how my hair instantly went straight without having to re use it over and over again.</li>
            <li>I also really like the fact that is has purple on it!!!</li>
            <li>and I love that I can set the temperature to be safe for my newly highlighted hair!</li>
            <li>/&gt;360 degree swivel cord making it super easy to use</li>
            <li>We love the color and sleek design of this iron, my daughter especially, being that purple is one of her very favorite colors.</li>
            <li>( in fact it isn&#x27;t recommended ) and leaves her hair sleek and smooth with no static or fly away hairs!</li>
            <li>As it is, its just as good as others I&#x27;ve bought at major department stores.</li>
            <li>The blue LED screen is bright, and I can easily read it.</li>
            <li>About 15 years ago, flat irons seemed to be very popular</li>
            <li>I was excited.</li>
            <li>I was nervous because I never heard of the brand, but in the end we were not disappointed @ all.</li>
            <li>The DOLCE is loaded with lots of great features, and is much more modern than my 15-year-old flat iron (which has no features - it plugs in and is on, and that&#x27;s it!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so this iron has been a huge, tremendous help.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight, has a swivel cord, and heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>I am a licensed cosmetologist and naturally I&#x27;m always looking for the next best thing.</li>
            <li>is our second product from Xtava and I have to say that so far we have been very impressed.</li>
            <li>The heat safe bag is also a really nice addition, especially when traveling.&lt;br</li>
            <li>flat iron is very light weight, and the plates seem to come together nicely.</li>
            <li>temperature is easy to set, and my hair glides right through the ceramic plates without getting snagged on anything.</li>
            <li>up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really impressed with the XTAVA flat iron and would recommend to a beginner OR a professional hair person.  </li>
            <li>in More magazine it suggested that once you are a certain age, you should upgrade tools.  </li>
            <li>Pissed right now!</li>
            <li>/&gt;First and foremost, I love being able to select and easily read the temperature on this flat iron.</li>
            <li>everything I expected at a great price..</li>
            <li>but these are cool just lighter</li>
            <li>As soon as I received it I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it, I absolutely love it, leaves your hair so nice &amp; smooth &amp; definitely sleak, heats up fast &amp; hair straight within minutes!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and easy to use, easy to use while moving around, it glides over the hair and straightens with complete ease!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know what that means until she told me that&#x27;s a good feature because it prevents the flat iron from overheating and burning my hair.</li>
            <li>Her fine, highlighted hair would easily break with a high heat setting.</li>
            <li>Using the 355&#x27; temperature, it straightened my hair quickly, and it looked great!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It automatically shuts off after 5 mins and for me I need more time to work on my hair than that,so I had to turn it on a couple of times,but I would rather be safe than sorry,so it wasn&#x27;t a big deal for me to do.</li>
            <li>My hair is super curly and this has made it straighter than it has ever been before.</li>
            <li>It cools quickly which is a plus.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try a CHI, but quickly noticed that it does not come with a temperature setting.</li>
            <li>I had been looking at Chi&#x27;s and different high end flat irons, but this one had good reviews and a great price.  </li>
            <li>Makes hair silky smooth and straight!</li>
            <li>straighter - Purchased due to the excellent reviews, but if you have previously used a professional hair starightner before then you will not be happy.</li>
            <li>easy and fast to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy and fast to use, I&#x27;m done in about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>The blue LED light is really easy to read and there are buttons on the side of the iron that are within easy reach.  </li>
            <li>It is quick, reliable and well worth the money with the time saved in doing your hair.</li>
            <li>The reviews were positive in features important to me.  </li>
            <li>It has fast heating ceramic plates and reaches temperatures of up to 430- degrees Fahrenheit!!</li>
            <li>My hair is super straight, smooth, and shiny.</li>
            <li>My flat iron arrived packaged great, in new, unused condition.</li>
            <li>With its slimmer design, and light weight body it makes the task of straightening my hair much easier.</li>
            <li>I hope you enjoy yours as much as I will and also</li>
            <li>Feels cheap, doesn&#x27;t heat up as much as it says have to go over a strand of hair</li>
            <li>It heated up really fast and is comfortable to handle and use.</li>
            <li>I set it to 390 degrees and in just one pass it got my hair straight and smooth.</li>
            <li>On of my many favorite features is a lock that will keep the iron closed for storage.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair shiny and it is worth the money.</li>
            <li>I was given the opportunity to test this product complimentary, and share my opinions and feedback.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>The iron is thin and sleek making it great to use in a salon or to give as a gift!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to test it out as I have been in need of a new hair straightener!!</li>

            <li>I am loving the purple DOLCE Ceramic Ionic Tourmaline Flat Iron/Straightener for hair!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>all the flat iron arrived nicely packaged in a sturdy box, contained in a heat proof zip case.</li>
            <li>The flat iron comes with it&#x27;s own carrying case to store when not in use.</li>
            <li>The insulated bag is an added bonus because I can put the flat iron away even if it is still warm</li>
            <li>The insulated bag is an added bonus because I can put the flat iron away even if it is still warm</li>
            <li>One glide and my hair straightens right away and it leaves my hair shiny.</li>
            <li>Or when we are heading out on a trip, and I do my hair right before we go</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s glides right through my wavy, frizzy, stubborn hair.</li>
            <li>My Daughter and I are really loving the DOLCE Ceramic Ionic Tourmaline Flat Iron!</li>
            <li>It feels cheap and very light, when ironing my hair I had to go over my hair multiple times in order for it to be straight.</li>
            <li>It gets hot enough to straighten her hair just as good as my high dollar Chi iron, but I didn&#x27;t have to spend $100 on it.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this flat iron/hair straightener for the purposes of testing and reviewing, and my overall opinion is that this product is a great value for the many features it offers.</li>
            <li>This flat iron just has such a sleek and beautiful look.</li>
            <li>This flat iron has so many cool features to discover that I have yet to find anything I don&#x27;t like about</li>
            <li>Of course always use a heat protector with any heat element on your hair but this does not burn or singe my hair and being able to easily change the heat setting due to there being buttons on the SIDE of the iron</li>
            <li>This is a great flat iron for someone who doesn&#x27;t want to cough up the money for a high end flat iron, but wants a device that will deliver fantastic results!  </li>
            <li>It also heats up super fast</li>
            <li>use this to straighten my hair for a very straight line, without any bumps or bends in my hair.</li>
            <li>Very user friendly, and works very well.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a beautiful VERY HIGH QUALITY flat iron.</li>
            <li>for this price this is a really awesome flat iron I have see flat irons with way less features go for way more money than this one .&lt;br</li>
            <li>would definitely recommend this for beginner to skilled user.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it, my only wish was that it stayed on longer.</li>
            <li>I recommend it to anyone that wants to straighten their hair!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get as hot as it says.</li>
            <li>It works the first time.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Now lets talk aesthetics, yes in fact I do like my beauty tools to be pretty.</li>
            <li>First, I have colored hair, so I set the heat at 320 degrees.</li>
            <li>Pretty good!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the digital temp reading.</li>
            <li>I love the digital LCD as well as the heat control; it&#x27;s pretty neat.</li>
            <li>and I most definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>This lightweight hair straightener from XTAVA definitely holds up in my top list of must have hair devices.</li>
            <li>Purchased it yesterday and used it for the first time.</li>
            <li>That is how much I like this one!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better to go and buy a straightner at your local salon or Sally&#x27;s..</li>
            <li>and it got too hot for my hair.  </li>
            <li>It holds the style the whole day!</li>
            <li>Tells me exactly what temp it&#x27;s at.</li>
            <li>I really like this iron!</li>
            <li>However, it worked at first, but after a day it wouldn&#x27;t stay shut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like the bigger ones better</li>
            <li>The next 2 features are my favorite as a Mom:</li>
            <li>stylish Blue LCD screen for temperature display</li>
            <li>Handle got almost as hot as the plates.</li>
            <li>Iron would not get hot.  </li>
            <li>flat iron was very smooth while in use.</li>
            <li>It is a huge relief to know that this flat iron will shut off on its own if I inadvertantly left it on.  </li>
            <li>I pretty well much love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>I have a flat iron that I was happy with as long as I used a lot of heat spray.  </li>
            <li>I use this Ionic flat iron now more than my other more popular flat iron with three letter name.</li>
            <li>love this flat iron</li>
            <li>I love my ceramic ionic flat iron!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>Love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>I really love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I was really pleased with this flat iron.</li>
            <li>just LOVE the sleek look of this flat iron!</li>
            <li>I ordered this flat iron as a sample for review and evaluation and so far I love it!</li>
            <li>I honestly feel that my hair looks different than with my old straightener.</li>
            <li>When I chose this specific iron, I chose it with her in mind, which makes all of the safety features so much more appreciated.</li>
            <li>My mom and I own a beauty studio, and we have been slowly introducing Xtava products because our clients tend to enjoy how cool and professional they</li>
            <li>Spend the extra money and buy a good flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I have used Xtava products in the past also, it is a good trusted brand.</li>
            <li>I was able to quickly do my hair in less than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>I received this at little or no cost to give my honest opinion and that is exactly what I have done.</li>
            <li>It was easy to open.</li>
            <li>It has super sleek plates that glide over the hair and dont pull it out, it straightens completely and my hair feels silky afterwards.</li>
            <li>ALso 2 Screws are freaking missing so the top plate is coming off !</li>
            <li>One stroke usually gets it perfect, some extremely stubborn parts take two.</li>
            <li>and I thought I would take a chance and try one, despite their very high price.  </li>
            <li>Considering this was my first time, I was so pleased with the professional results that this flat iron gave me.</li>
            <li>curls.&lt;br /&gt;+ Swivel cord makes it easy to move the flat iron in all directions.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love my new flat iron.</li>
            <li>I used it once and considered trading her (haha).</li>
            <li>I have very Curly hair...</li>
            <li>I really like the packing this came in.</li>
            <li>It is really well made and seems durable.</li>
            <li>Before I ordered this iron I was using a very chunky iron that didn&#x27;t work quite as well.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the Ceramic</li>
            <li>Fast heat up time also straightnes with out frizziness</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have very curly hair</li>
            <li>and I am really liking a lot of things about it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight and heats up really fast.</li>
            <li>I have a much easier time.</li>
            <li>I used it on my hair, and after 2 to 3 swipes, my hair was straight as an arrow.</li>
            <li>I like the lock feature, so that I can make sure it stays closed upon storing it.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how straight it made my hair.</li>
            <li>The item was received on time and was packaged very well.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast buttons are on the side</li>
            <li>I checked out a lot of straighteners and wanted to get one that really worked.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and straightens my hair well,  The temperature control button is the reason I bought this iron.  </li>
            <li>I really like that.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this product absolutely.</li>
            <li>I really like that</li>
            <li>There is a switch at the bottom of the iron that is meant to hold the iron closed, which is lovely for traveling.</li>
            <li>I bought this on the pretenses of promising picture.</li>
            <li>It heats up incredibly fast as well, I was all around</li>
            <li>I have 3 kids and always seem to be rushing around while getting ready.</li>
            <li>Thanks for sticking with me for this rather lengthy review, but there was so much I wanted to touch on.</li>
            <li>Thanks for sticking with me for this rather lengthy review, but there was so much I wanted to touch on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great value and performs well, especially with such a low cost.  </li>
            <li>Would turn off every few minutes on its own while straightening my hair.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a flat iron that would make her hair smooth and straight.</li>
            <li>So much better than all the other straightners I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Ok I got this straightener the other day.</li>
            <li>Please see our video for how we style her hair using the DOLCE Ceramic Ionic Tourmaline Flat Iron and if you have any questions regarding this product or how we use it, please feel free to ask!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>safety features on this flat iron are also fantastic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy enough for my 9 year old to use!</li>
            <li>tried this one, and honestly at first I didn&#x27;t think it was going to live up to my high expectations.</li>
            <li>I would highly suggest the Dolce by XTAVA to anyone who is looking to achieve the salon straight look at an affordable price.   </li>
            <li>Compared with the different brand I already own, which was half the cost as this, it is ok, but I get better, slicker results with my cheaper flat iron and less frizz.</li>
            <li>black and purple are my two favorite color combo.</li>
            <li>I do think they if they spent less on the packaging and a bit more on the acutal product it would be a much more professional grade product.</li>
            <li>but after just a few minutes of taming my wavy course hair, it&#x27;s perfectly straight and looks fantastic!</li>
            <li>That is when I was lucky enough to receive a discount on the XTAVA....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been the owner of numerous straighteners ranging in prices including some that cost a very pretty penny.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really high quality</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I cant tell you how many times I accidently turned off my flat iron because the switch was to close to where my hand needs to be in order to use it properly .</li>
            <li>Along the sames lines, so many times once we have made it out the door I have second guessed myself about whether or not I turned my flat iron off.</li>
            <li>Along the sames lines, so many times once we have made it out the door I have second guessed myself about whether or not I turned my flat iron off.</li>
            <li>I wore my hair natural, no hair sprays or anything and the style stayed straight for a decent 5 hours.</li>
            <li>The flat iron itself, heated quickly and worked well.</li>
            <li>and so far it is working really well.</li>
            <li>Cheap and not very substantial.</li>
            <li>that normally my hair does not have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love the Xtava DOLCE Ceramic Ionic Tourmaline Flat Iron, which has all the features I need in a flat iron!  </li>
            <li>I have pretty thick, wavy and dry hair; but if you look at my after pictures, my hair looks very healthy and completely straight.</li>
            <li>It comes in a very professional sleek black box with very detailed clear instructions on how to use its functions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>As a busy mom, I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I have worried that I left my flat iron on.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed about the Dolce Flat Iron is that it is very lightweight.</li>
            <li>It has a temperature control lcd that lights up as soon as you turn it on with multiple function buttons right next to it,so it is easy to change how your flat iron works.</li>
            <li>I received this complimentary flat iron for testing and reviewing purposes</li>
            <li>I had it for 4 years and figured time for a new one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new fave hair straightener.</li>
            <li>&amp;&amp; I ordered a NEW one</li>
            <li>Some of the pattern designs are just too childish for me, but this is sleek, stylish, and classy.</li>
            <li>not as hot as a chi .. actually ordered a new chi because the Dolce ceramic pulls your hair because the two plates do not meet correctly..</li>
            <li>I just got a new hair due and was so excited to straighten my wild curly hair!</li>
            <li>This definitely does its job of making your hair pin straight!</li>
            <li>, you need to hold the power button down for a couple seconds till you see the screen light up.</li>
            <li>Such a nice little added bonus!</li>
            <li>This straightener has a stunning sleek purple &amp; black design!!</li>
            <li>this is my first time using a flat iron on my hair.</li>
            <li>After the first use of this DOLCE I was ready to turn in my other straightener.</li>
            <li>so it will last a longer time before needing a new one!!</li>
            <li>This flat iron heats up fast and left my daughters hair the exact way she wanted it.....smooth and sleek without the damage.</li>
            <li>Just plug in and press the power button, a nice blue led display appears on the handle and shows the starting temperature, and well as 3 little lines showing you that the product is heating up but alternating lines.</li>
            <li>it clearly shows the temperature settings and you have a safety on off</li>
            <li>Both products came packaged nicely, clear instructions, well made and work just as promised.</li>
            <li>Both products came packaged nicely, clear instructions, well made and work just as promised.</li>
            <li>Although it does not have the 450 degree temp recommended for the keratin treatment, I have had the treatment done professionally with the recommended temp and found that my hair was winding up in the shower drain.</li>
            <li>Especially how the whole device turns off when I tilt it from side to side</li>
            <li>so I can get the natural curl that is around my face, it has a swivel cord, and it comes with a heat resistance storage bag.</li>
            <li>The temp control is not completely customizable - be aware and read specifics.  </li>
            <li>With the digital read out on this one I can absolutely see what temp I have it set at, and it reads out the temp as it heats up</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to repeatedly straighten my hair with this compared to my old ones.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair shiny and soft without any frizz.</li>
            <li>I have naturally frizzy hair</li>
            <li>It far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>so I need professional grade tools to get my hair</li>
            <li>None so far.</li>
            <li>The ceramic tiles make your hair shiney and soft</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to wait for it to cool down.</li>
            <li>Upon first inspection, the only thing I notice is that it is very light (which could be a perk for some) and seems less hardy than my current flat iron.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light weight that I wondered if it would live up to some heavy duty straightening!</li>
            <li>My daughter has fine thin hair and mine is total opposite, so it&#x27;s easy to change it around to work.</li>
            <li>It heats up and cools down quickly.</li>
            <li>I have curly frizzy hair and after using this flat iron my hair was straight as a pin with no frizz in sight.</li>
            <li>The hair comes out shiny and very manageable and the flat iron gives my hair a lift</li>
            <li>With the XTAVA flat iron I had my whole head done in 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li>It was obvious right away that a flat iron was</li>
            <li>The LCD screen gives it such a high tech look.</li>
            <li>A flat iron means no need for styling products (which make my fine hair look weighed down and</li>
            <li>The only downside so far is that for me is seems a little light and flimsy compared to what I am used to.</li>
            <li>The only downside so far is that for me is seems a little light and flimsy compared to what I am used to.</li>
            <li>Very sleek and modern with the all black look.</li>
            <li>However it is getting older, so I am always looking for a decent flat iron that will work just as well when that one finally kicks the bucket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have thin fine hair that is relatively straight</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this flat iron to anyone.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend spraying your hair with a heat treatment before flat ironing to avoid damage.  </li>
            <li>But if you have thick wavy hair like mine I would continue looking for something a little better and plan on spending a little more money.</li>
            <li>Once all the lines are solid the flat iron is ready to use.</li>
            <li>Because I am new to using a flat iron</li>
            <li>My hair is really long and fine, but gets out of control once it is dried.</li>
            <li>It still leaves waves and end up going back over it AGAIN after I&#x27;m completely done.</li>
            <li>This one is the complete opposite of that.</li>
            <li>She has a cheap one that wont work on her thick hair.</li>
            <li>This flat iron tames my mess of hair, and does it rather quickly.</li>
            <li>This flat iron comes in a heat resistant bag large enough for your flat iron and supplies.</li>
            <li>Bought this straightener because of all the positive reviews and it is not worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I probably searched the web for 2 hours before settling on this straightener and what really sold it for me were the photos other reviewers posted.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because my old flat iron would catch my hair in it every time I passed it through and rip out a lot of my hair.</li>
            <li>I like the digital screen to tell to how hot it is and the lock on it to keep it open of closed.</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore several features that this flat iron has to offer that my current one does not, the digital temperature read out,</li>
            <li>I was a little stumped how to turn it on at first</li>
            <li>you go up or down to a certain preset temperature.</li>
            <li>My last flat iron didn&#x27;t completely straighten unless on a really high heat, pulled hair out, and afterwards left my hair feeling really dry.</li>
            <li>The texture and thickness of my hair makes it difficult to style, so I was thrilled to see that the Dolce Flat Iron can by programmed up to 430° Fahrenheit.</li>
            <li>The build of the straightener also felt very cheap not sturdy like it would break if I placed it down to hard.</li>
            <li>iron has ceramic plates and has a thin design so its really easy to control.</li>
            <li>I have super thick hair</li>
            <li>have a slight wave to my otherwise straight hair, so using a straightener is the only way to make it stick</li>
            <li>Although it may be sleek and small it is a powerful flat iron.</li>
            <li>My hair is super hard to manage without using a flat iron</li>
            <li>I have flat irons from 6 other brands, and they were all pricier than this particular one without the same amount of features.</li>
            <li>In less than 60 seconds the flat iron was ready to go.</li>
            <li>This makes it easy to get the flat iron at an optimal temperature, instead of the guessing game I often use with a dial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I continue to be very impressed with this product, as I just straightened my hair</li>
            <li> I especially am glad that it shuts off after 60 minutes.</li>
            <li> I got this at a really great price to test in return of my honest opinion!!</li>
            <li> The picture does no justice to the beautiful purple that this iron has.</li>
            <li> and we both are very pleased with the results!</li>
            <li> This hair straightener works amazingly &amp; yet again I am extremely impressed with Xtava as this is my 4th product I have from them!!</li>

            <li> The screen is great too.</li>
            <li> This straightener works great to defrizz your hair  and</li>
            <li> I think it does a great job.</li>
            <li> 1-inch size is great for dual usage of straightening and curling if you have longer hair like myself.</li>
            <li> Comes with a heat-resistant case that is great for protective and portability</li>
            <li> I was so happy when I was chosen to review this product during a promotional period for my unbiased opinions.  </li>

            <li> This is an amazing straightener!</li>
            <li> If a person is satisfied with the 3 temperature settings, then it might be perfect for that person.</li>
            <li> On top of all those amazing features it comes with a travel and storage case lined with heat resistant material!!!</li>
            <li> I love the lock at the end of the wand that is perfect for storage.  </li>
            <li> It has an easy to read LCD temperature display, and an auto off feature that I think is really awesome!</li>
            <li> well as two great safety features ( my favorite! )</li>
            <li> The temp controls are not located on the inside so that&#x27;s good because it decreases your chance of getting burned if you try to readjust the temp after the iron has been turned on.</li>
            <li> never tried this brand before, but definitely a good brand.</li>

            <li> It would be better if it would go up one degree at a time.</li>
            <li> And I love the auto shut off and the LED screen.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I received a free sample in order to make an informed review but my opinions are my own</li>

            <li> so you know how close you are to being able to use it.</li>
            <li> I love the mix of metallic purple and black.&lt;br</li>
            <li> you get a dial, not buttons, and they are usually more inside the top and bottom part of the iron.</li>
            <li> I love all of your products.</li>

            <li> I can adjust the heating to what I want to make sure I&#x27;m not overheating and damaging my hair.</li>
            <li> started off working real good then all of a sudden</li>
            <li> Received iron for free for product review to give honest opinion.</li>

            <li> It does heat up real quick but it doesn&#x27;t do anything to my hair, tried curling it and it won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I also love the heat proof bag that comes with it.</li>
            <li> and I love that you can control the temperature.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my hair since using it.</li>

            <li> One thing that I love about XTAVA is that they always send a heat protectant bag with their hair curlers and irons.</li>
            <li> I love this option because I straighten my bangs on a lower temp than the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li> There has been no need to go over the hair more than once on the highest setting</li>
            <li> options that go up to 430 degrees Fahrenheit which is sure to make this flat iron perfect for everyone and every type of hair</li>

            <li> However, if you are someone who has a lot of hair to straighten, the feather light weight may be an upside. :-)</li>

            <li> The 360 degree cord made it easy to reach all of my hair without getting all wound</li>
            <li> That attracted me to it in the first place to be honest.</li>
            <li> Fine for me.</li>
            <li> My oldest daughters hair is fine and wavy.</li>
            <li> Super cute and sleek design.</li>
            <li> The quality is super!</li>
            <li> What I love about this iron is that it is super light weight</li>
            <li> The display screen is nice and large so all it takes is a glance at the screen.</li>
            <li> The buttons are easily accessible and easy to push.</li>
            <li> Plates do not glide through smoothly and does not work with giving your hair curl.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight.</li>
            <li> but I use an iron to smooth it out.</li>
            <li> My hair feels silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product free of charge in exchange for my unbiased review</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I have every used a straightener this light before,</li>
            <li> Really cheap quality hair</li>
            <li> Lightweight, feels cheap.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed at how well it worked and how my hair instantly went straight without having to re use it over and over again.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed at how well it worked and how my hair instantly went straight without having to re use it over and over again.</li>
            <li> I also really like the fact that is has purple on it!!!</li>
            <li> and I love that I can set the temperature to be safe for my newly highlighted hair!</li>
            <li> /&gt;360 degree swivel cord making it super easy to use</li>
            <li> We love the color and sleek design of this iron, my daughter especially, being that purple is one of her very favorite colors.</li>
            <li> ( in fact it isn&#x27;t recommended ) and leaves her hair sleek and smooth with no static or fly away hairs!</li>
            <li> As it is, its just as good as others I&#x27;ve bought at major department stores.</li>
            <li> The blue LED screen is bright, and I can easily read it.</li>
            <li> About 15 years ago, flat irons seemed to be very popular</li>
            <li> I was excited.</li>
            <li> I was nervous because I never heard of the brand, but in the end we were not disappointed @ all.</li>
            <li> The DOLCE is loaded with lots of great features, and is much more modern than my 15-year-old flat iron (which has no features - it plugs in and is on, and that&#x27;s it!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so this iron has been a huge, tremendous help.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight, has a swivel cord, and heats up quickly.</li>
            <li> I am a licensed cosmetologist and naturally I&#x27;m always looking for the next best thing.</li>
            <li> is our second product from Xtava and I have to say that so far we have been very impressed.</li>
            <li> The heat safe bag is also a really nice addition, especially when traveling.&lt;br</li>
            <li> flat iron is very light weight, and the plates seem to come together nicely.</li>
            <li> temperature is easy to set, and my hair glides right through the ceramic plates without getting snagged on anything.</li>
            <li> up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really impressed with the XTAVA flat iron and would recommend to a beginner OR a professional hair person.  </li>
            <li> in More magazine it suggested that once you are a certain age, you should upgrade tools.  </li>
            <li> Pissed right now!</li>
            <li> /&gt;First and foremost, I love being able to select and easily read the temperature on this flat iron.</li>
            <li> everything I expected at a great price..</li>
            <li> but these are cool just lighter</li>
            <li> As soon as I received it I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it, I absolutely love it, leaves your hair so nice &amp; smooth &amp; definitely sleak, heats up fast &amp; hair straight within minutes!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and easy to use, easy to use while moving around, it glides over the hair and straightens with complete ease!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what that means until she told me that&#x27;s a good feature because it prevents the flat iron from overheating and burning my hair.</li>
            <li> Her fine, highlighted hair would easily break with a high heat setting.</li>
            <li> Using the 355&#x27; temperature, it straightened my hair quickly, and it looked great!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It automatically shuts off after 5 mins and for me I need more time to work on my hair than that,so I had to turn it on a couple of times,but I would rather be safe than sorry,so it wasn&#x27;t a big deal for me to do.</li>
            <li> My hair is super curly and this has made it straighter than it has ever been before.</li>
            <li> It cools quickly which is a plus.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a CHI, but quickly noticed that it does not come with a temperature setting.</li>
            <li> I had been looking at Chi&#x27;s and different high end flat irons, but this one had good reviews and a great price.  </li>
            <li> Makes hair silky smooth and straight!</li>
            <li> straighter - Purchased due to the excellent reviews, but if you have previously used a professional hair starightner before then you will not be happy.</li>
            <li> easy and fast to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy and fast to use, I&#x27;m done in about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> The blue LED light is really easy to read and there are buttons on the side of the iron that are within easy reach.  </li>
            <li> It is quick, reliable and well worth the money with the time saved in doing your hair.</li>
            <li> The reviews were positive in features important to me.  </li>
            <li> It has fast heating ceramic plates and reaches temperatures of up to 430- degrees Fahrenheit!!</li>
            <li> My hair is super straight, smooth, and shiny.</li>
            <li> My flat iron arrived packaged great, in new, unused condition.</li>
            <li> With its slimmer design, and light weight body it makes the task of straightening my hair much easier.</li>
            <li> I hope you enjoy yours as much as I will and also</li>
            <li> Feels cheap, doesn&#x27;t heat up as much as it says have to go over a strand of hair</li>
            <li> It heated up really fast and is comfortable to handle and use.</li>
            <li> I set it to 390 degrees and in just one pass it got my hair straight and smooth.</li>
            <li> On of my many favorite features is a lock that will keep the iron closed for storage.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair shiny and it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to test this product complimentary, and share my opinions and feedback.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> The iron is thin and sleek making it great to use in a salon or to give as a gift!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to test it out as I have been in need of a new hair straightener!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is all around a fantastic flat iron with many features</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is all around a fantastic flat iron with many features</li>
            <li> I am loving the purple DOLCE Ceramic Ionic Tourmaline Flat Iron/Straightener for hair!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> all the flat iron arrived nicely packaged in a sturdy box, contained in a heat proof zip case.</li>
            <li> The flat iron comes with it&#x27;s own carrying case to store when not in use.</li>
            <li> The insulated bag is an added bonus because I can put the flat iron away even if it is still warm</li>
            <li> The insulated bag is an added bonus because I can put the flat iron away even if it is still warm</li>
            <li> One glide and my hair straightens right away and it leaves my hair shiny.</li>
            <li> Or when we are heading out on a trip, and I do my hair right before we go</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s glides right through my wavy, frizzy, stubborn hair.</li>
            <li> My Daughter and I are really loving the DOLCE Ceramic Ionic Tourmaline Flat Iron!</li>
            <li> It feels cheap and very light, when ironing my hair I had to go over my hair multiple times in order for it to be straight.</li>
            <li> It gets hot enough to straighten her hair just as good as my high dollar Chi iron, but I didn&#x27;t have to spend $100 on it.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this flat iron/hair straightener for the purposes of testing and reviewing, and my overall opinion is that this product is a great value for the many features it offers.</li>
            <li> This flat iron just has such a sleek and beautiful look.</li>
            <li> This flat iron has so many cool features to discover that I have yet to find anything I don&#x27;t like about</li>
            <li> Of course always use a heat protector with any heat element on your hair but this does not burn or singe my hair and being able to easily change the heat setting due to there being buttons on the SIDE of the iron</li>
            <li> This is a great flat iron for someone who doesn&#x27;t want to cough up the money for a high end flat iron, but wants a device that will deliver fantastic results!  </li>
            <li> It also heats up super fast</li>
            <li> use this to straighten my hair for a very straight line, without any bumps or bends in my hair.</li>
            <li> Very user friendly, and works very well.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a beautiful VERY HIGH QUALITY flat iron.</li>
            <li> for this price this is a really awesome flat iron I have see flat irons with way less features go for way more money than this one .&lt;br</li>
            <li> would definitely recommend this for beginner to skilled user.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it, my only wish was that it stayed on longer.</li>
            <li> I recommend it to anyone that wants to straighten their hair!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get as hot as it says.</li>
            <li> It works the first time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Now lets talk aesthetics, yes in fact I do like my beauty tools to be pretty.</li>
            <li> First, I have colored hair, so I set the heat at 320 degrees.</li>
            <li> Pretty good!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the digital temp reading.</li>
            <li> I love the digital LCD as well as the heat control; it&#x27;s pretty neat.</li>
            <li> and I most definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This lightweight hair straightener from XTAVA definitely holds up in my top list of must have hair devices.</li>
            <li> Purchased it yesterday and used it for the first time.</li>
            <li> That is how much I like this one!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better to go and buy a straightner at your local salon or Sally&#x27;s..</li>
            <li> and it got too hot for my hair.  </li>
            <li> It holds the style the whole day!</li>
            <li> Tells me exactly what temp it&#x27;s at.</li>
            <li> I really like this iron!</li>
            <li> However, it worked at first, but after a day it wouldn&#x27;t stay shut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like the bigger ones better</li>
            <li> The next 2 features are my favorite as a Mom:</li>
            <li> stylish Blue LCD screen for temperature display</li>
            <li> Handle got almost as hot as the plates.</li>
            <li> Iron would not get hot.  </li>
            <li> flat iron was very smooth while in use.</li>
            <li> It is a huge relief to know that this flat iron will shut off on its own if I inadvertantly left it on.  </li>
            <li> I pretty well much love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have a flat iron that I was happy with as long as I used a lot of heat spray.  </li>
            <li> I use this Ionic flat iron now more than my other more popular flat iron with three letter name.</li>
            <li> love this flat iron</li>
            <li> I love my ceramic ionic flat iron!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I really love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I was really pleased with this flat iron.</li>
            <li> just LOVE the sleek look of this flat iron!</li>
            <li> I ordered this flat iron as a sample for review and evaluation and so far I love it!</li>
            <li> I honestly feel that my hair looks different than with my old straightener.</li>
            <li> When I chose this specific iron, I chose it with her in mind, which makes all of the safety features so much more appreciated.</li>
            <li> My mom and I own a beauty studio, and we have been slowly introducing Xtava products because our clients tend to enjoy how cool and professional they</li>
            <li> Spend the extra money and buy a good flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I have used Xtava products in the past also, it is a good trusted brand.</li>
            <li> I was able to quickly do my hair in less than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I received this at little or no cost to give my honest opinion and that is exactly what I have done.</li>
            <li> It was easy to open.</li>
            <li> It has super sleek plates that glide over the hair and dont pull it out, it straightens completely and my hair feels silky afterwards.</li>
            <li> ALso 2 Screws are freaking missing so the top plate is coming off !</li>
            <li> One stroke usually gets it perfect, some extremely stubborn parts take two.</li>
            <li> and I thought I would take a chance and try one, despite their very high price.  </li>
            <li> Considering this was my first time, I was so pleased with the professional results that this flat iron gave me.</li>
            <li> curls.&lt;br /&gt;+ Swivel cord makes it easy to move the flat iron in all directions.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love my new flat iron.</li>
            <li> I used it once and considered trading her (haha).</li>
            <li> I have very Curly hair...</li>
            <li> I really like the packing this came in.</li>
            <li> It is really well made and seems durable.</li>
            <li> Before I ordered this iron I was using a very chunky iron that didn&#x27;t work quite as well.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the Ceramic</li>
            <li> Fast heat up time also straightnes with out frizziness</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have very curly hair</li>
            <li> and I am really liking a lot of things about it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight and heats up really fast.</li>
            <li> I have a much easier time.</li>
            <li> I used it on my hair, and after 2 to 3 swipes, my hair was straight as an arrow.</li>
            <li> I like the lock feature, so that I can make sure it stays closed upon storing it.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how straight it made my hair.</li>
            <li> The item was received on time and was packaged very well.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast buttons are on the side</li>
            <li> I checked out a lot of straighteners and wanted to get one that really worked.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and straightens my hair well,  The temperature control button is the reason I bought this iron.  </li>
            <li> I really like that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this product absolutely.</li>
            <li> I really like that</li>
            <li> There is a switch at the bottom of the iron that is meant to hold the iron closed, which is lovely for traveling.</li>
            <li> I bought this on the pretenses of promising picture.</li>
            <li> It heats up incredibly fast as well, I was all around</li>
            <li> I have 3 kids and always seem to be rushing around while getting ready.</li>
            <li> Thanks for sticking with me for this rather lengthy review, but there was so much I wanted to touch on.</li>
            <li> Thanks for sticking with me for this rather lengthy review, but there was so much I wanted to touch on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great value and performs well, especially with such a low cost.  </li>
            <li> Would turn off every few minutes on its own while straightening my hair.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a flat iron that would make her hair smooth and straight.</li>
            <li> So much better than all the other straightners I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Ok I got this straightener the other day.</li>
            <li> Please see our video for how we style her hair using the DOLCE Ceramic Ionic Tourmaline Flat Iron and if you have any questions regarding this product or how we use it, please feel free to ask!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> safety features on this flat iron are also fantastic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy enough for my 9 year old to use!</li>
            <li> tried this one, and honestly at first I didn&#x27;t think it was going to live up to my high expectations.</li>
            <li> I would highly suggest the Dolce by XTAVA to anyone who is looking to achieve the salon straight look at an affordable price.   </li>
            <li> Compared with the different brand I already own, which was half the cost as this, it is ok, but I get better, slicker results with my cheaper flat iron and less frizz.</li>
            <li> black and purple are my two favorite color combo.</li>
            <li> I do think they if they spent less on the packaging and a bit more on the acutal product it would be a much more professional grade product.</li>
            <li> but after just a few minutes of taming my wavy course hair, it&#x27;s perfectly straight and looks fantastic!</li>
            <li> That is when I was lucky enough to receive a discount on the XTAVA....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been the owner of numerous straighteners ranging in prices including some that cost a very pretty penny.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really high quality</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I cant tell you how many times I accidently turned off my flat iron because the switch was to close to where my hand needs to be in order to use it properly .</li>
            <li> Along the sames lines, so many times once we have made it out the door I have second guessed myself about whether or not I turned my flat iron off.</li>
            <li> Along the sames lines, so many times once we have made it out the door I have second guessed myself about whether or not I turned my flat iron off.</li>
            <li> I wore my hair natural, no hair sprays or anything and the style stayed straight for a decent 5 hours.</li>
            <li> The flat iron itself, heated quickly and worked well.</li>
            <li> and so far it is working really well.</li>
            <li> Cheap and not very substantial.</li>
            <li> that normally my hair does not have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> love the Xtava DOLCE Ceramic Ionic Tourmaline Flat Iron, which has all the features I need in a flat iron!  </li>
            <li> I have pretty thick, wavy and dry hair; but if you look at my after pictures, my hair looks very healthy and completely straight.</li>
            <li> It comes in a very professional sleek black box with very detailed clear instructions on how to use its functions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> As a busy mom, I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I have worried that I left my flat iron on.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about the Dolce Flat Iron is that it is very lightweight.</li>
            <li> It has a temperature control lcd that lights up as soon as you turn it on with multiple function buttons right next to it,so it is easy to change how your flat iron works.</li>
            <li> I received this complimentary flat iron for testing and reviewing purposes</li>
            <li> I had it for 4 years and figured time for a new one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my new fave hair straightener.</li>
            <li> &amp;&amp; I ordered a NEW one</li>
            <li> Some of the pattern designs are just too childish for me, but this is sleek, stylish, and classy.</li>
            <li> not as hot as a chi .. actually ordered a new chi because the Dolce ceramic pulls your hair because the two plates do not meet correctly..</li>
            <li> I just got a new hair due and was so excited to straighten my wild curly hair!</li>
            <li> This definitely does its job of making your hair pin straight!</li>
            <li> , you need to hold the power button down for a couple seconds till you see the screen light up.</li>
            <li> Such a nice little added bonus!</li>
            <li> This straightener has a stunning sleek purple &amp; black design!!</li>
            <li> this is my first time using a flat iron on my hair.</li>
            <li> After the first use of this DOLCE I was ready to turn in my other straightener.</li>
            <li> so it will last a longer time before needing a new one!!</li>
            <li> This flat iron heats up fast and left my daughters hair the exact way she wanted it.....smooth and sleek without the damage.</li>
            <li> Just plug in and press the power button, a nice blue led display appears on the handle and shows the starting temperature, and well as 3 little lines showing you that the product is heating up but alternating lines.</li>
            <li> it clearly shows the temperature settings and you have a safety on off</li>
            <li> Both products came packaged nicely, clear instructions, well made and work just as promised.</li>
            <li> Both products came packaged nicely, clear instructions, well made and work just as promised.</li>
            <li> Although it does not have the 450 degree temp recommended for the keratin treatment, I have had the treatment done professionally with the recommended temp and found that my hair was winding up in the shower drain.</li>
            <li> Especially how the whole device turns off when I tilt it from side to side</li>
            <li> so I can get the natural curl that is around my face, it has a swivel cord, and it comes with a heat resistance storage bag.</li>
            <li> The temp control is not completely customizable - be aware and read specifics.  </li>
            <li> With the digital read out on this one I can absolutely see what temp I have it set at, and it reads out the temp as it heats up</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to repeatedly straighten my hair with this compared to my old ones.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair shiny and soft without any frizz.</li>
            <li> I have naturally frizzy hair</li>
            <li> It far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> so I need professional grade tools to get my hair</li>
            <li> None so far.</li>
            <li> The ceramic tiles make your hair shiney and soft</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to wait for it to cool down.</li>
            <li> Upon first inspection, the only thing I notice is that it is very light (which could be a perk for some) and seems less hardy than my current flat iron.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so light weight that I wondered if it would live up to some heavy duty straightening!</li>
            <li> My daughter has fine thin hair and mine is total opposite, so it&#x27;s easy to change it around to work.</li>
            <li> It heats up and cools down quickly.</li>
            <li> I have curly frizzy hair and after using this flat iron my hair was straight as a pin with no frizz in sight.</li>
            <li> The hair comes out shiny and very manageable and the flat iron gives my hair a lift</li>
            <li> With the XTAVA flat iron I had my whole head done in 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li> It was obvious right away that a flat iron was</li>
            <li> The LCD screen gives it such a high tech look.</li>
            <li> A flat iron means no need for styling products (which make my fine hair look weighed down and</li>
            <li> The only downside so far is that for me is seems a little light and flimsy compared to what I am used to.</li>
            <li> The only downside so far is that for me is seems a little light and flimsy compared to what I am used to.</li>
            <li> Very sleek and modern with the all black look.</li>
            <li> However it is getting older, so I am always looking for a decent flat iron that will work just as well when that one finally kicks the bucket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have thin fine hair that is relatively straight</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this flat iron to anyone.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend spraying your hair with a heat treatment before flat ironing to avoid damage.  </li>
            <li> But if you have thick wavy hair like mine I would continue looking for something a little better and plan on spending a little more money.</li>
            <li> Once all the lines are solid the flat iron is ready to use.</li>
            <li> Because I am new to using a flat iron</li>
            <li> My hair is really long and fine, but gets out of control once it is dried.</li>
            <li> It still leaves waves and end up going back over it AGAIN after I&#x27;m completely done.</li>
            <li> This one is the complete opposite of that.</li>
            <li> She has a cheap one that wont work on her thick hair.</li>
            <li> This flat iron tames my mess of hair, and does it rather quickly.</li>
            <li> This flat iron comes in a heat resistant bag large enough for your flat iron and supplies.</li>
            <li> Bought this straightener because of all the positive reviews and it is not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I probably searched the web for 2 hours before settling on this straightener and what really sold it for me were the photos other reviewers posted.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because my old flat iron would catch my hair in it every time I passed it through and rip out a lot of my hair.</li>
            <li> I like the digital screen to tell to how hot it is and the lock on it to keep it open of closed.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore several features that this flat iron has to offer that my current one does not, the digital temperature read out,</li>
            <li> I was a little stumped how to turn it on at first</li>
            <li> you go up or down to a certain preset temperature.</li>
            <li> My last flat iron didn&#x27;t completely straighten unless on a really high heat, pulled hair out, and afterwards left my hair feeling really dry.</li>
            <li> The texture and thickness of my hair makes it difficult to style, so I was thrilled to see that the Dolce Flat Iron can by programmed up to 430° Fahrenheit.</li>
            <li> The build of the straightener also felt very cheap not sturdy like it would break if I placed it down to hard.</li>
            <li> iron has ceramic plates and has a thin design so its really easy to control.</li>
            <li> I have super thick hair</li>
            <li> have a slight wave to my otherwise straight hair, so using a straightener is the only way to make it stick</li>
            <li> Although it may be sleek and small it is a powerful flat iron.</li>
            <li> My hair is super hard to manage without using a flat iron</li>
            <li> I have flat irons from 6 other brands, and they were all pricier than this particular one without the same amount of features.</li>
            <li> In less than 60 seconds the flat iron was ready to go.</li>
            <li> This makes it easy to get the flat iron at an optimal temperature, instead of the guessing game I often use with a dial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I definitely need the hotter end of that scale, but anyone with fine or thin hair can adjust the heat and still use the flat iron with no issue.</li>
            <li> Compared to my current flat iron this one would be my preferred.</li>
            <li> I like locking feature and the carry bag, however didn&#x27;t seem to straighten my hair as well as my current flat iron.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this flat iron to anyone looking to get salon quality results.</li>
            <li> Often times I turn my flat iron on and leave the room and come back once it is heated.</li>
            <li> The flat iron can be adjusted to go as low as 250°.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It took her about 45 minutes to flat iron my hair and after 30 minutes of flat ironing my hair, the flat iron automatically &#x27;paused&#x27; to cool down (which took about a few seconds) before allowing her to continue on with flat ironing my hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter was always wanting to come in my bathroom and use my Chi flat iron.</li>
            <li> I tried the flat iron again, and it worked even better!&lt;br</li>
            <li> fried ends, or noticeable flat iron streaks!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The Dolce flat iron has an automatic safety mechanism that will turn off the device when not in use.</li>
            <li> also when you purchase this flat iron you help women around the world because Xtava donates a percentage of their profits to charities that benefit women.</li>
            <li> This is the prettiest flat iron I have seen.</li>
            <li> THIS flat iron has all of those kinks worked out of the flat iron design AND works the kinks out of my hair too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> This does take some practice but with my xtava flat iron</li>
            <li> I like that this came with a insulated case that I can put the flat iron in after use.</li>
            <li> My bf&#x27;s sister who&#x27;s in hair school tested this out on my hair and she loves this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I used the flat iron on my hair.</li>
            <li> I received the DOLCE Ceramic Flat Iron as part of a company promotion for the express purpose of testing and providing feedback for their product.</li>
            <li> Gone are the days of trying to find a non-flammable surface where I can balance the flat iron,</li>
            <li> This has not been a problem with XTAVA&#x27;s flat iron.</li>
            <li> If you take too long straightening your hair, this iron will actually turn itself off so that you don&#x27;t have an accident.</li>
            <li> DOLCE ceramic flat iron.</li>
            <li> When I checked I could not believe how flat this iron had gotten my hair.  </li>
            <li> Programed with 3 heat settings I was able to tame awful bedhead on just the first (lowest) temperature &amp; just one quick treatment.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is the bomb diggidy!</li>
            <li> Allows you to see the temperature setting (although I have a hard time seeing it really well).</li>
            <li> It made it too hard for me to get ready in the mornings</li>
            <li> I like styling in little chunks so that I don&#x27;t miss any piece, but my old straighteners have been known to smell crispy after a long session of straightening.</li>
            <li> Because it is only 1 inch wide, it is small enough for me to wrap my hair around for natural waves/</li>
            <li> I actually should put this back in the box and send it back because it&#x27;s just sitting in the drawer what a waste of money...</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to wait long at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only  wish it could be used wet.</li>
            <li> Xtava products are awesome, never lets me down when I am having a bad hair day!!</li>
            <li> I have a very expensive $200+ GHD flat iron that I use and absolutely love.</li>
            <li> It seems as though it&#x27;s not very hot while you&#x27;re flat ironing your hair</li>
            <li> I have spent money at the hair salon to get my hair to look like this, but now that I have this flat iron, I am saving a lot of money.</li>
            <li> As with other customers, once opened the actual product appeared to be scratched</li>
            <li> I actually had my other one break</li>
            <li> It gives me peace of mind to know that once this flat iron is lock it stays in the closed position</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s completely dry</li>
            <li> loose</li>
            <li> The straightener gives you the option to set the temperature using the up and down arrows and the digital LED screen to see what temp it is at.</li>
            <li> For one thing on other flat irons I can never see the dial that says what the heat setting is!</li>
            <li> This is my first bad product I&#x27;ve bought at Amazon, so I don&#x27;t complain much.</li>
            <li> The only things I would change are that the power button could be a little easier to push, and I wish this heated up faster and that it would get hotter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The flat iron came in a black bag.  </li>
            <li> Since the straight flat iron is thin it is much less of a hassle to curl my hair in this method.</li>
            <li> Has potential,  however... mine was a defect and the lock mechanism did not securely lock into place.</li>
            <li> and it works they way I expected, if I have any issue I will update my review</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pull the hair or drag.</li>
            <li> I had to use it as soon as I got it,so I took my shower and washed my hair and blow dried it to make it frizzy and then broke out the flat iron.</li>
            <li> I had to use it as soon as I got it,so I took my shower and washed my hair and blow dried it to make it frizzy and then broke out the flat iron.</li>
            <li> Instructions as well as an additional promotional code for other Xtava products were also included.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not hot</li>
            <li> other irons</li>
            <li> My other iron didn&#x27;t have one</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and it takes twice as long to straighten with this flat iron.</li>
            <li> with this flat iron you have to hold down the button for a few secs .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Usually when I blow it dry, which isn&#x27;t often because it takes so long, it takes about half an hour.  </li>
            <li> does not seem to consistently stay locked on heat... very frustrating.</li>
            <li> and I have had no way to pack my flat iron in the past.  </li>
            <li> No more forgetting to turn off the flat iron and coming home to a burnt smell wafting through the house!&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
            <li> I feel that this flat iron doesn&#x27;t seem to heat up the body of the iron quite as much as others I have used in the past, making it less scary for my daughter as she learns to use it for flattening and for curling.</li>
            <li> Keeps shutting off after you sit it down</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall for the price of this, and how well it performs, it hands down deserves a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> Well I was not let down by purchasing this straightener.</li>
            <li> I do wish that instead of a handful of preset temperatures you could customize the temperature 1 degree up or down at a time.</li>
            <li> I did not feel the need to spray my hair to keep frizzes down because I didn&#x27;t have any.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several other flat irons in the last few years and they just weren&#x27;t cutting it.</li>
            <li> The iron is a sleek purple and black with a swivel cord to prevent tangles.</li>
            <li> Taking less than 2 minutes to heat up</li>
            <li> I have a rather small bathroom and this one seemingly small feature has made a big difference to me.</li>
            <li> Now my hair is thick, coarse and is past my shoulders.  </li>
            <li> It has a feature toward the tip of the iron that allows you to close the iron heads a little tighter around the hair without burning your fingers.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed because I was really excited .</li>
            <li> other ones I have had in the past</li>
            <li> A waste if money</li>
            <li> but rather heavy handling at the facility where its manufactured and shipped.</li>
            <li> I did not enjoy this styler.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This left unwanted fly-away&#x27;s and broken pieces of hair.</li>
            <li> I am terrible about making sure my hair tools are unplugged and turned off, so this is one less worry for me.  </li>
            <li> The swivel base for the cord makes using this flat iron incredibly smooth and much less awkward.</li>
            <li> it makes your hair super silky to the touch also,so your hair does not feel nasty and dry after you use it.</li>
            <li> It was one of those things I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing out on until I had it!</li>
            <li> and it isn&#x27;t cluttering up my small bathroom</li>
            <li> and it isn&#x27;t cluttering up my small bathroom</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do well at all with thick hair</li>
            <li> I mean look at my before and after pictures.</li>
            <li> No more accidentally heat damaged hair!</li>
            <li> I find these cumbersome, difficult to get to, and as I said, impossible to read those tiny numbers on the dial on the inside of the other irons.</li>
            <li> A little disappointing when compared to the reviews.</li>
            <li> Although thin, I find it easier and quicker to maneuver.  </li>
            <li> Not happy</li>
            <li> Practically useless</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say this</li>
            <li> , I can set custom temperatures, it&#x27;s very thin</li>
            <li> it kept cutting off by itself.</li>
            <li> Disappointed</li>
            <li> That was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I sometimes have that awful dreaded frizzy hair that all of us woman hate.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m horrible about not turning mine off</li>
            <li> This is horrible.</li>
            <li> Received them damaged and in horrible condition.</li>
            <li> Piece of CRAP!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it!  The BEST straightener I have ever owned in my entire life!!</li>
            <li> The cord has a shortage and it doesn&#x27;t stay on</li>
            <li> Bought this straightener because of all the positive reviews and it is not worth the money.  You could by a con air hair straightener for cheaper that does the same.  Plates do not glide through smoothly and does not work with giving your hair curl.  I am a licensed cosmetologist And would not use this on a clients hair.  Spend the extra money and buy a good flat iron.  The build of the straightener also felt very cheap not sturdy like it would break if I placed it down to hard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright. Honestly my $25 Conair worked better. I had it for 4 years and figured time for a new one. I have to go over my hair several times with this one. It still leaves waves and end up going back over it AGAIN after I&#x27;m completely done. It is a nice design thought. Very sleek, the heat resistant case is great. But if you have thick wavy hair like mine I would continue looking for something a little better and plan on spending a little more money. Ok for the cost.</li>
            <li> wonderful...everything I expected at a great price..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight. Allows you to see the temperature setting (although I have a hard time seeing it really well). The temp controls are not located on the inside so that&#x27;s good because it decreases your chance of getting burned if you try to readjust the temp after the iron has been turned on. I just did my hair (keratin treatment) and it came out nice. It has a feature toward the tip of the iron that allows you to close the iron heads a little tighter around the hair without burning your fingers. I like it. It has a snazzy color. Although it does not have the 450 degree temp recommended for the keratin treatment, I have had the treatment done professionally with the recommended temp and found that my hair was winding up in the shower drain. I figured I would go with a lower temp (although the iron does say that it will work for the treatment). My hair came out nice and fewer hairs in the shower drain so I think this iron is a good fit for my hair.</li>
            <li> Gave it 3 stars because you can&#x27;t adjust the temperature to your desired setting. I desire 360 for my hair. When you turn the power on it automatically goes to 355 degrees. If you press the +setting, it goes to 390 degrees. It would be better if it would go up one degree at a time. It is lightweight and I like the fact that the power and temperature controls are on the side  and not between the flatirons. If a person is satisfied with the 3 temperature settings, then it might be perfect for that person.</li>
            <li> My daughter was always wanting to come in my bathroom and use my Chi flat iron. It made it too hard for me to get ready in the mornings so I bought her this one for her birthday. She has a cheap one that wont work on her thick hair. This one worked wonderfully!! It gets hot enough to straighten her hair just as good as my high dollar Chi iron, but I didn&#x27;t have to spend $100 on it. And I love the auto shut off and the LED screen. It&#x27;s easy enough for my 9 year old to use! I used it once and considered trading her (haha).</li>
            <li> Has potential,  however... mine was a defect and the lock mechanism did not securely lock into place.</li>
            <li> I am editing this review because the iron will not currently shut off I have to unplug it to shut it off I have used it about twice a week since this review was made&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this flat iron it clearly shows the temperature settings and you have a safety on off so you do not accidentally turn it off while using it. I cant tell you how many times I accidently turned off my flat iron because the switch was to close to where my hand needs to be in order to use it properly . with this flat iron you have to hold down the button for a few secs .&lt;br /&gt;I loved that it heated up very quickly and has a very good high setting . for this price this is a really awesome flat iron I have see flat irons with way less features go for way more money than this one .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample in order to make an informed review but my opinions are my own</li>
            <li> Keeps shutting off after you sit it down</li>
            <li> When I opened the box this cheap straightener had fingerprints and scratches ALL over it! The box looked pre opened and dare I say it.. Used. This is my first bad product I&#x27;ve bought at Amazon, so I don&#x27;t complain much. I would not recommend this to anyone. Especially how the whole device turns off when I tilt it from side to side, how else am I supposed to achieve flawless bang flips? Practically useless</li>
            <li> excellent product, excellent service</li>
            <li> I have very Curly hair...some areas it doesn&#x27;t get the entire wavw out but foe the price it is a very good straightener.</li>
            <li> If it was possible to give no stars I would have with this one. Does not get up to temp and it looked used....literally used.</li>
            <li> My hair is super hard to manage without using a flat iron so when I was offered to test and reviews this I was excited. I really like the packing this came in. It was easy to open. I love the colors black and purple are my two favorite color combo. It is really well made and seems durable. I love that it has a swivel cord. I don&#x27;t have to fight with the cord. It heats up and cools down quickly. Temperature is easy to adjust and I love that it has a LCD display screen that is easy to read. I pretty well much love this flat iron. It works great and straightens my hair faster than my old one. Plus this one has a safety feature and I&#x27;m horrible about not turning mine off so no worrying with this one. I highly recommend this flat iron to anyone.</li>
            <li> Beautiful product!! Just received it today and it is perfect! This flat iron comes in a heat resistant bag large enough for your flat iron and supplies. The iron is a sleek purple and black with a swivel cord to prevent tangles. On of my many favorite features is a lock that will keep the iron closed for storage. The buttons are easy to read and display screen is great. It tells you what temperature you are at and when it has reached the desired set temp. I have seen others say that there is a gap between the plates, but I have found that if used correctly no gap is visible. This would work well with all hair types, as well as thicknesses. Compared to my current flat iron this one would be my preferred. With its slimmer design, and light weight body it makes the task of straightening my hair much easier. Thank you to review loop for allowing me to test this product at no cost for my review and opinion.</li>
            <li> I love this DOLCE Ceramic Ionic Tourmaline Hair Straightener by Xtava!!!When I received this hair straightener in the mail I was so excited to test it out as I have been in need of a new hair straightener!! This hair straightener works amazingly &amp; yet again I am extremely impressed with Xtava as this is my 4th product I have from them!! This straightener has a stunning sleek purple &amp; black design!! This straighter is made of high quality materials, which is great so it will last a longer time before needing a new one!! It has fast heating ceramic plates and reaches temperatures of up to 430- degrees Fahrenheit!! It has a highly sophisticated microprocessor that has a LCD control display so it allows you to personalize your heat settings to your desired style and hair type &amp; it has convenient buttons on the side of the appliance to control the heat setting!! It also has a safety feature built in the straightener, it&#x27;s equipped with an automatic safety mechanism that will turn off the device when not in use as well as a digital locking function to prevent any tampering with the unit!!! On top of all those amazing features it comes with a travel and storage case lined with heat resistant material!!! I&#x27;m really impressed with this hair straightener &amp; I would definitely recommend this product by Xtava to everyone!!!</li>
            <li> Great flat iron at a great price!</li>
            <li> The best!!!  See for yourself!!!</li>
            <li> I am loving the purple DOLCE Ceramic Ionic Tourmaline Flat Iron/Straightener for hair!&lt;br /&gt;I was able to get into on a promotional offer to test this product out in my home, and share my results.&lt;br /&gt;First of all the flat iron arrived nicely packaged in a sturdy box, contained in a heat proof zip case. Instructions as well as an additional promotional code for other Xtava products were also included.&lt;br /&gt;The flat iron is very light weight, and the plates seem to come together nicely. I read up on the best temperature for my color treated hair and it recommended the factory setting of 355&#x27;, so that&#x27;s what I started with.&lt;br /&gt;Very easy and fast to use. Just plug in and press the power button, a nice blue led display appears on the handle and shows the starting temperature, and well as 3 little lines showing you that the product is heating up but alternating lines. Once all the lines are solid the flat iron is ready to use. I&#x27;d say it took about 30 seconds to warm up. No audible tone.&lt;br /&gt;The flat iron was very smooth while in use. No hair pulling. Using the 355&#x27; temperature, it straightened my hair quickly, and it looked great!&lt;br /&gt;I have a slight wave to my otherwise straight hair, so using a straightener is the only way to make it stick straight.&lt;br /&gt;After I was done, I increased the temperature by clicking the + sign. I tried the flat iron again, and it worked even better!&lt;br /&gt;No fried ends, or noticeable flat iron streaks!&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this for beginner to skilled user. Very user friendly, and works very well. Makes hair silky smooth and straight!</li>
            <li> I like locking feature and the carry bag, however didn&#x27;t seem to straighten my hair as well as my current flat iron.</li>
            <li> I like it,  never tried this brand before, but definitely a good brand.</li>
            <li> not as hot as a chi .. actually ordered a new chi because the Dolce ceramic pulls your hair because the two plates do not meet correctly..I actually should put this back in the box and send it back because it&#x27;s just sitting in the drawer what a waste of money...</li>
            <li> I ordered this flat iron as a sample for review and evaluation and so far I love it! I have thin fine hair that is relatively straight but I use an iron to smooth it out. Before I ordered this iron I was using a very chunky iron that didn&#x27;t work quite as well. What I love about this iron is that it is super light weight, I can hold the tip and it&#x27;s not hot, I can set custom temperatures, it&#x27;s very thin so I can get the natural curl that is around my face, it has a swivel cord, and it comes with a heat resistance storage bag. I am also starting to experiment with giving my hair some curl with this and so far it is working really well. Overall I haven&#x27;t had any quality issues with this and it works they way I expected, if I have any issue I will update my review but so far I am very happy with this.</li>
            <li> This Dolce Ceramic ionic Tourmaline Flat Iron works great!! I had to use it as soon as I got it,so I took my shower and washed my hair and blow dried it to make it frizzy and then broke out the flat iron. It heated with in a matter of seconds  to 400 degrees and I started to use it. I was very impressed at how well it worked and how my hair instantly went straight without having to re use it over and over again. Thanks to the Ceramic it makes your hair super silky to the touch also,so your hair does not feel nasty and dry after you use it. It has a temperature control lcd that lights up as soon as you turn it on with multiple function buttons right next to it,so it is easy to change how your flat iron works. I absolutely love it, my only wish was that it stayed on longer. It automatically shuts off after 5 mins and for me I need more time to work on my hair than that,so I had to turn it on a couple of times,but I would rather be safe than sorry,so it wasn&#x27;t a big deal for me to do. Over all I think the flat iron is great!! It comes in a really nice carrying case,which will come in handy while i&#x27;m on the go:)  I received this at little or no cost to give my honest opinion and that is exactly what I have done. I hope you enjoy yours as much as I will and also my daughter:)</li>
            <li> Super cute and sleek design. Looks even better in person. Although it may be sleek and small it is a powerful flat iron. Giving you optimum straight sleek shiny hair. The LCD screen gives it such a high tech look. The Dolce flat iron has an automatic safety mechanism that will turn off the device when not in use. I really love that it comes with a travel and storage case with heat resistant material included with the unit. also when you purchase this flat iron you help women around the world because Xtava donates a percentage of their profits to charities that benefit women. I have curly frizzy hair and after using this flat iron my hair was straight as a pin with no frizz in sight. I received this product in return for my honest review</li>
            <li> This straightener has done wonders for my hair. My hair is super curly and this has made it straighter than it has ever been before. It is easy to use and adjustable. I recommend it to anyone that wants to straighten their hair!</li>
            <li> So much better than all the other straightners I&#x27;ve used. Fast heat up time also straightnes with out frizziness</li>
            <li> This is horrible. Doesn&#x27;t get as hot as it says. I don&#x27;t even have very curly hair just wavy and it didn&#x27;t do anything&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money. I sent mine back.</li>
            <li> Feels cheap, doesn&#x27;t heat up as much as it says have to go over a strand of hair several times lock doesn&#x27;t work.  A waste if money</li>
            <li> I have a flat iron that I was happy with as long as I used a lot of heat spray.  I was trying to reduce products and in More magazine it suggested that once you are a certain age, you should upgrade tools.  I have my hair cut very short now and did not want to spend over a $100 for one.  Enter this.  The reviews were positive in features important to me.  It works the first time.  Although thin, I find it easier and quicker to maneuver.  The temp control is not completely customizable - be aware and read specifics.  It is in three jumps.  Fine for me. It cools quickly which is a plus. comes with carrying case.</li>
            <li> Love my new flat iron. My hair feels silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I tested this the moment I got it and I am really liking a lot of things about it. For one thing on other flat irons I can never see the dial that says what the heat setting is! With the digital read out on this one I can absolutely see what temp I have it set at, and it reads out the temp as it heats up so you know how close you are to being able to use it. It also heats up super fast so you don&#x27;t have to wait long at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I like the locking mechanism so you can store it neatly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The swivel cord is a total win!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now lets talk aesthetics, yes in fact I do like my beauty tools to be pretty. This is the prettiest flat iron I have seen. Some of the pattern designs are just too childish for me, but this is sleek, stylish, and classy. I love the mix of metallic purple and black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are excellent leaving smooth frizz free hair. Of course always use a heat protector with any heat element on your hair but this does not burn or singe my hair and being able to easily change the heat setting due to there being buttons on the SIDE of the iron I can easily lower the heat if I need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On other irons you get a dial, not buttons, and they are usually more inside the top and bottom part of the iron. I find these cumbersome, difficult to get to, and as I said, impossible to read those tiny numbers on the dial on the inside of the other irons. THIS flat iron has all of those kinks worked out of the flat iron design AND works the kinks out of my hair too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Xtava - I love all of your products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight and heats up really fast. Leaves my hair shiny and it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Xtava products are awesome, never lets me down when I am having a bad hair day!! I love my ceramic ionic flat iron!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this to straighten my hair for a very straight line, without any bumps or bends in my hair. The hair comes out shiny and very manageable and the flat iron gives my hair a lift that normally my hair does not have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I will use my straightener to curl my hair. This does take some practice but with my xtava flat iron I have a much easier time. Since the straight flat iron is thin it is much less of a hassle to curl my hair in this method. The curls come out looking better than if I had used a curling iron most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The temperature is easy to set, and my hair glides right through the ceramic plates without getting snagged on anything. Truly one of my favorite hair tools and I would be lost without it in my morning routine. Sample provided for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> I have a very expensive $200+ GHD flat iron that I use and absolutely love. However it is getting older, so I am always looking for a decent flat iron that will work just as well when that one finally kicks the bucket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this one, and honestly at first I didn&#x27;t think it was going to live up to my high expectations. I wasn&#x27;t comparing it to my GHD since lets face it, they are in 2 big different brackets. But I was seeing how well it would perform. First, I have colored hair, so I set the heat at 320 degrees. In less than 60 seconds the flat iron was ready to go. Very impressed! I used it on my hair, and after 2 to 3 swipes, my hair was straight as an arrow. My hair didn&#x27;t feel fried, or over heated. I was happy. I wore my hair natural, no hair sprays or anything and the style stayed straight for a decent 5 hours. Pretty good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The buttons on this are easy to use, and well labelled. I like that this came with a insulated case that I can put the flat iron in after use. Makes life a million times better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall for the price of this, and how well it performs, it hands down deserves a 5 star rating. This is a great flat iron for someone who doesn&#x27;t want to cough up the money for a high end flat iron, but wants a device that will deliver fantastic results!  Well done Xtava!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do well at all with thick hair</li>
            <li> Cheap and not very substantial. Returned immediately!</li>
            <li> I received this on a discounted price and I love that it glides nicely in my hair. I don&#x27;t have to repeatedly straighten my hair with this compared to my old ones. One glide and my hair straightens right away and it leaves my hair shiny. I love the color. The quality is super! It&#x27;s sleek and I just love it! It&#x27;s my new fave hair straightener.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing straightener! My hair feels so good after using it. I love the digital temp reading. I only  wish it could be used wet.</li>
            <li> My bf&#x27;s sister who&#x27;s in hair school tested this out on my hair and she loves this flat iron. I mean look at my before and after pictures. That&#x27;s my hair without any products on it and it&#x27;s completely dry (I washed it the night before). It took her about 45 minutes to flat iron my hair and after 30 minutes of flat ironing my hair, the flat iron automatically &#x27;paused&#x27; to cool down (which took about a few seconds) before allowing her to continue on with flat ironing my hair. I didn&#x27;t know what that means until she told me that&#x27;s a good feature because it prevents the flat iron from overheating and burning my hair. I have pretty thick, wavy and dry hair; but if you look at my after pictures, my hair looks very healthy and completely straight. I did not put any products on my hair (no shiny mist and no oil), this is the result from this wonderful flat iron. I have spent money at the hair salon to get my hair to look like this, but now that I have this flat iron, I am saving a lot of money. Overall, this is a beautiful VERY HIGH QUALITY flat iron. I love the digital LCD as well as the heat control; it&#x27;s pretty neat. I received this complimentary flat iron for testing and reviewing purposes and I most definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This lightweight hair straightener from XTAVA definitely holds up in my top list of must have hair devices. I&#x27;ve been the owner of numerous straighteners ranging in prices including some that cost a very pretty penny. After the first use of this DOLCE I was ready to turn in my other straightener. Programed with 3 heat settings I was able to tame awful bedhead on just the first (lowest) temperature &amp; just one quick treatment. Taking less than 2 minutes to heat up I was able to quickly do my hair in less than 5 minutes.The Dolce comes with a heat safe bag for the safest storage after use.  I would highly suggest the Dolce by XTAVA to anyone who is looking to achieve the salon straight look at an affordable price.   * I recieved this product free of charge in exchange for my unbiased review</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron. I feel like I&#x27;m getting the best treatment, like I would at a salon. I can adjust the heating to what I want to make sure I&#x27;m not overheating and damaging my hair. I was given the opportunity to test this product complimentary, and share my opinions and feedback. I like the lock feature, so that I can make sure it stays closed upon storing it. The buttons are easily accessible and easy to push. The blue LED screen is bright, and I can easily read it. My hair is really long and fine, but gets out of control once it is dried. This flat iron tames my mess of hair, and does it rather quickly. It leaves my hair looking bright, and straight. I would definitely recommend this flat iron to anyone looking to get salon quality results.</li>
            <li> Pissed right now! Purchased it yesterday and used it for the first time. started off working real good then all of a sudden it kept cutting off by itself. I want my money back ASAP!!!</li>
            <li> Received iron for free for product review to give honest opinion. I worey hair curly today and when I got home I used the flat iron on my hair. I was amazed at how straight it made my hair. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I can&#x27;t wait to try tomorrow on my hair after it is washed. I like the digital screen to tell to how hot it is and the lock on it to keep it open of closed. It comes in awesome carry case too. I definitely recommend</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t  work, I would give it zero stars if I could.</li>
            <li> does not seem to consistently stay locked on heat... very frustrating.</li>
            <li> I received the DOLCE Ceramic Flat Iron as part of a company promotion for the express purpose of testing and providing feedback for their product. The item was received on time and was packaged very well. As with other customers, once opened the actual product appeared to be scratched but I don&#x27;t think it was used but rather heavy handling at the facility where its manufactured and shipped. The flat iron comes with it&#x27;s own carrying case to store when not in use. The flat iron itself, heated quickly and worked well. I like the digital display as part of its features. I&#x27;ve used it several times and had no problem with it heating or straightening my hair.  I do think they if they spent less on the packaging and a bit more on the acutal product it would be a much more professional grade product. As it is, its just as good as others I&#x27;ve bought at major department stores.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:35bb78c4ea89c0d2d486e83381d920d9]] I don&#x27;t have lots of time to dedicate to my hair, and I am always looking for things that make my life easier.  About 15 years ago, flat irons seemed to be very popular and I thought I would take a chance and try one, despite their very high price.  It was obvious right away that a flat iron was life changing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair has always been wavy and frizzy, despite trying many styling products and always using a hair dryer.  A flat iron means no need for styling products (which make my fine hair look weighed down and greasy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the Xtava DOLCE Ceramic Ionic Tourmaline Flat Iron, which has all the features I need in a flat iron!  The DOLCE is loaded with lots of great features, and is much more modern than my 15-year-old flat iron (which has no features - it plugs in and is on, and that&#x27;s it!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the shut-off mechanism on the DOLCE.  As a busy mom, I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I have worried that I left my flat iron on.  It is a huge relief to know that this flat iron will shut off on its own if I inadvertantly left it on.  Plus, it has a locking function so that my kids can&#x27;t turn it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that this product comes with an insulated case. Gone are the days of trying to find a non-flammable surface where I can balance the flat iron, all while keeping it out of reach from my kids!  Or when we are heading out on a trip, and I do my hair right before we go and I have had no way to pack my flat iron in the past.  Now I can pop it in the case and I&#x27;m set to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Xtava DOLCE Hair Straightener is an inexpensive way to get your hair looking straight and beautiful.  The only things I would change are that the power button could be a little easier to push, and I wish this heated up faster and that it would get hotter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided in exchange for an honest review.  I use this DOLCE Hair Straightener every time I wash my hair, because it is so easy to straighten my hair and get great results in just a matter of minutes.in just a matter of minutes.</li>
            <li> As soon as I received it I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it, I absolutely love it, leaves your hair so nice &amp; smooth &amp; definitely sleak, heats up fast &amp; hair straight within minutes!!!</li>
            <li> it gets the job done, but often burns my hand.</li>
            <li> I use this Ionic flat iron now more than my other more popular flat iron with three letter name. I actually had my other one break and I received my replacement around the same time I got this iron and I haven&#x27;t even opened it!!! That is how much I like this one! It works great and I love that I can set the temperature to be safe for my newly highlighted hair!</li>
            <li> I really love this straightener. Heats up fast buttons are on the side I haven&#x27;t had a problem with hitting the buttons. I have problems with the buttons on top! I haven&#x27;t had hair pull are snag onto a corner piece of the straightener. I also really like the fact that is has purple on it!!! I got this at a really great price to test in return of my honest opinion!!</li>
            <li> I did not enjoy this styler. It feels cheap and very light, when ironing my hair I had to go over my hair multiple times in order for it to be straight. I do not recommend this iron.</li>
            <li> I checked out a lot of straighteners and wanted to get one that really worked. Well I was not let down by purchasing this straightener. It works great. Leaves my hair shiny and soft without any frizz. Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love the straightner it&#x27;s so cute. It does heat up real quick but it doesn&#x27;t do anything to my hair, tried curling it and it won&#x27;t work. &amp;&amp; I ordered a NEW one and I got one that was already used. It was scratched and looked like it had glue on it. That was very disappointing. I&#x27;m sorry to say this but I don&#x27;t recommend that you buy this. It&#x27;s a waste of money. It&#x27;s better to go and buy a straightner at your local salon or Sally&#x27;s..</li>
            <li> This flat iron just has such a sleek and beautiful look. The picture does no justice to the beautiful purple that this iron has. It heats up very quickly, which is one thing that I truly appreciate. I like styling in little chunks so that I don&#x27;t miss any piece, but my old straighteners have been known to smell crispy after a long session of straightening. This has not been a problem with XTAVA&#x27;s flat iron. The smooth ceramic plates allow for a frizz free look and the lightness of this iron is incredible. It has a 360 degree swivel cord that allows for a freehanded curling session. It also comes with a heat resistant bag so that you can travel with it if you&#x27;d like without any damage. If you take too long straightening your hair, this iron will actually turn itself off so that you don&#x27;t have an accident. I like how it has a lock because I&#x27;ve been prone to burns with open irons. I have naturally frizzy hair so this iron has been a huge, tremendous help.</li>
            <li> Great for curling hair</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron.  It heats up fast and straightens my hair well,  The temperature control button is the reason I bought this iron.  My other iron didn&#x27;t have one and it got too hot for my hair.  I also love the heat proof bag that comes with it.</li>
            <li> Received them damaged and in horrible condition. I was so disappointed because I was really excited .</li>
            <li> this is my first time using a flat iron on my hair. It heated up really fast and is comfortable to handle and use. I set it to 390 degrees and in just one pass it got my hair straight and smooth. Considering this was my first time, I was so pleased with the professional results that this flat iron gave me.</li>
            <li> Iron does not stay on! Not happy</li>
            <li> I probably searched the web for 2 hours before settling on this straightener and what really sold it for me were the photos other reviewers posted. This definitely does its job of making your hair pin straight! I purchased this because my old flat iron would catch my hair in it every time I passed it through and rip out a lot of my hair. This left unwanted fly-away&#x27;s and broken pieces of hair. I do not have this problem at all with this straightener and I love that you can control the temperature. I used the straightener to curl my hair as well and it was a breeze. Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it! I wish I had this years ago. It&#x27;s so light weight that I wondered if it would live up to some heavy duty straightening! Well it does. It far exceeded my expectations. I honestly feel that my hair looks different than with my old straightener.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron. I&#x27;ve owned several other flat irons in the last few years and they just weren&#x27;t cutting it. My last flat iron didn&#x27;t completely straighten unless on a really high heat, pulled hair out, and afterwards left my hair feeling really dry. This one is the complete opposite of that. It has super sleek plates that glide over the hair and dont pull it out, it straightens completely and my hair feels silky afterwards. Your hair will stay pin straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been so happy with this straightener. My hair is super straight, smooth, and shiny. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my hair since using it. It&#x27;s glides right through my wavy, frizzy, stubborn hair. One stroke usually gets it perfect, some extremely stubborn parts take two. It&#x27;s so easy and fast to use, I&#x27;m done in about 15 minutes. It&#x27;s light weight, has a swivel cord, and heats up quickly. It has an easy to read LCD temperature display, and an auto off feature that I think is really awesome! I am happy to recieve this wonderful flat iron to review. It&#x27;s really high quality and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Ok I got this straightener the other day. I am a licensed cosmetologist and naturally I&#x27;m always looking for the next best thing. So I loved this product. It not only doubles as a straightener but a perfect curling iron as well. It has the smoothest edges ever. It doesn&#x27;t pull the hair or drag. It&#x27;s smooth and honestly glides through the hair. It holds the style the whole day! I was a little stumped how to turn it on at first, you need to hold the power button down for a couple seconds till you see the screen light up. And vice versa with turning it off. The screen is great too. Tells me exactly what temp it&#x27;s at. So I&#x27;m not looking at a dot just guessing what temperature it is. I really like that. My daughter has fine thin hair and mine is total opposite, so it&#x27;s easy to change it around to work. I like the sleek colors, look and feel. Very sleek and modern with the all black look. I&#x27;d recommend this product absolutely.</li>
            <li> Im giving this 2 stars only because i do like the design &amp; straightner but I just recieved my product and it has smudges all over it loks used. ALso 2 Screws are freaking missing so the top plate is coming off ! what the heck they couldnt even finish making the product</li>
            <li> Compared with the different brand I already own, which was half the cost as this, it is ok, but I get better, slicker results with my cheaper flat iron and less frizz. This has a slimmer design making bangs easier and the heat up time is quicker. Overall, I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;d buy this brand/manufacturer again. A little disappointing when compared to the reviews.</li>
            <li> I somewhat like this straightener, I found that it doesnt seem to straighten as well as other ones I have had in the past. I have thick hair and it takes twice as long to straighten with this flat iron.</li>
            <li> Im only giving it three stars just cause im a guy... nd i bought thus for my lovely girlfreind for her bday cus her old one went out of service on her lol. So i figured this was the best i could find for a reasonable price. I hope she loves it. Give it t9 her today.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is the bomb diggidy! It straightened my moms relaxed hair with one pass on 390 degrees ! I love how it came with a pouch and it has temperature settings ! Glad I made this purchase !</li>
            <li> This straightener is my favorite color PURPLE. That attracted me to it in the first place to be honest. I have used Xtava products in the past also, it is a good trusted brand. I sometimes have that awful dreaded frizzy hair that all of us woman hate. This straightener works great to defrizz your hair  and smooth/straighten it. Frizz is like POOF be gone! Another awesome thing about this straightener is that it has a digital display letting you know the temperature of the iron. I really like that so I don&#x27;t burn my hair! This is a must have and as I said Xtava is an awesome company that I will buy again from.</li>
            <li> I just got a new hair due and was so excited to straighten my wild curly hair! I really like this iron! I think it does a great job. One thing that I love about XTAVA is that they always send a heat protectant bag with their hair curlers and irons. I always use mine as a placemat when I am using my irons. It&#x27;s a great help! The first thing I noticed about the Dolce Flat Iron is that it is very lightweight. I don&#x27;t think I have every used a straightener this light before, so it&#x27;s a nice plus. You can carry it in your bags without ever knowing it is there. The straightener gives you the option to set the temperature using the up and down arrows and the digital LED screen to see what temp it is at. I love this option because I straighten my bangs on a lower temp than the rest of my hair. There is a switch at the bottom of the iron that is meant to hold the iron closed, which is lovely for traveling. However, it worked at first, but after a day it wouldn&#x27;t stay shut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The purple color is really beautiful and stylish. The iron is thin and sleek making it great to use in a salon or to give as a gift! Overall, I like the Dolce iron. It isn&#x27;t my favorite, but I do use it often! I received this product complimentary to share my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Like the bigger ones better but these are cool just lighter</li>
            <li> I have super thick hair so I need professional grade tools to get my hair the way I like it. I bought this on the pretenses of promising picture. It was very ok. Worked like something very cheap you could get at Walmart</li>
            <li> My flat iron arrived packaged great, in new, unused condition. I have attached pictures. I state that only because I have seen reviews where people say their item arrived looking used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just LOVE the sleek look of this flat iron! Upon first inspection, the only thing I notice is that it is very light (which could be a perk for some) and seems less hardy than my current flat iron. It is also a bit skinnier as well. I absolutely adore several features that this flat iron has to offer that my current one does not, the digital temperature read out, the temperature + and - buttons, the swivel cord, the locking feature, the time out feature and of course the insulated bag for storage or travel! It heats up incredibly fast as well, I was all around impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First and foremost, I love being able to select and easily read the temperature on this flat iron. No more accidentally heat damaged hair! The display screen is nice and large so all it takes is a glance at the screen. I do wish that instead of a handful of preset temperatures you could customize the temperature 1 degree up or down at a time. As it is now when you hit the &amp;#34;+ or -&amp;#34; buttons you go up or down to a certain preset temperature. The booklet it comes with does offer suggested settings based on hair types, so that was helpful. The swivel base for the cord makes using this flat iron incredibly smooth and much less awkward. I have a rather small bathroom and this one seemingly small feature has made a big difference to me. It was one of those things I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing out on until I had it! The next 2 features are my favorite as a Mom: the locking option and the built in time out. I have 3 kids and always seem to be rushing around while getting ready. Often times I turn my flat iron on and leave the room and come back once it is heated. It gives me peace of mind to know that once this flat iron is lock it stays in the closed position and I don&#x27;t have to worry about my kids accidentally grabbing it and getting burned. Along the sames lines, so many times once we have made it out the door I have second guessed myself about whether or not I turned my flat iron off. Well, now I can put my Mother mind at ease knowing it will shut off on it&#x27;s own if forgotten. :-) The insulated bag is an added bonus because I can put the flat iron away even if it is still warm and then I KNOW I shut it off and it isn&#x27;t cluttering up my small bathroom counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is all around a fantastic flat iron with many features you don&#x27;t get with a lot of others. The only downside so far is that for me is seems a little light and flimsy compared to what I am used to. However, if you are someone who has a lot of hair to straighten, the feather light weight may be an upside. :-) Thanks for sticking with me for this rather lengthy review, but there was so much I wanted to touch on. I would definitely recommend this item.kids accidentally grabbing it and getting burned.

            <li> [[VIDEOID:4e78e10351f147a60507b503739fd14]] My Daughter and I are really loving the DOLCE Ceramic Ionic Tourmaline Flat Iron! It comes in a very professional sleek black box with very detailed clear instructions on how to use its functions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It features :&lt;br /&gt;A stylish Blue LCD screen for temperature display&lt;br /&gt;Temperature options that go up to 430 degrees Fahrenheit which is sure to make this flat iron perfect for everyone and every type of hair&lt;br /&gt;360 degree swivel cord making it super easy to use&lt;br /&gt;As well as two great safety features ( my favorite! ) 60 min shut off, meaning that I can rest assured that my straightener isn&#x27;t laying on my counter left on all day while I am on, as well as a locking feature!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it comes with a heat resistant travel case which makes it so easy to use when we aren&#x27;t at home and are on the move! Such a nice little added bonus! We love the color and sleek design of this iron, my daughter especially, being that purple is one of her very favorite colors. When I chose this specific iron, I chose it with her in mind, which makes all of the safety features so much more appreciated. We have used this on her hair several times now and we both are very pleased with the results! It&#x27;s light and easy to use, easy to use while moving around, it glides over the hair and straightens with complete ease! There has been no need to go over the hair more than once on the highest setting ( in fact it isn&#x27;t recommended ) and leaves her hair sleek and smooth with no static or fly away hairs! I feel that this flat iron doesn&#x27;t seem to heat up the body of the iron quite as much as others I have used in the past, making it less scary for my daughter as she learns to use it for flattening and for curling. Please see our video for how we style her hair using the DOLCE Ceramic Ionic Tourmaline Flat Iron and if you have any questions regarding this product or how we use it, please feel free to ask!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is our second product from Xtava and I have to say that so far we have been very impressed. Both products came packaged nicely, clear instructions, well made and work just as promised. We received this product to try out in our home and have provided our honest opinion in return.d product from Xtava and I have to say that so far we have been very impressed.

            <li> Returned it. Handle got almost as hot as the plates. Disappointed</li>
            <li> Piece of CRAP! Do not buy. I had to return.</li>
            <li> Wow---I was thoroughly impressed with this flat iron.  I had been looking at Chi&#x27;s and different high end flat irons, but this one had good reviews and a great price.  You can set the temperature to 450 degrees (although my hair stylist told me to not go over 400).  It seems as though it&#x27;s not very hot while you&#x27;re flat ironing your hair but after just a few minutes of taming my wavy course hair, it&#x27;s perfectly straight and looks fantastic! This is a wonderful product!  Comes with an auto shut off and a bag to store it in.  Highly recommend spraying your hair with a heat treatment before flat ironing to avoid damage.  I bought the TreSemme and it works great!!  Thank you!!!!!</li>
            <li> My oldest daughters hair is fine and wavy. I have been searching for a flat iron that would make her hair smooth and straight. I wanted to try a CHI, but quickly noticed that it does not come with a temperature setting. Her fine, highlighted hair would easily break with a high heat setting. That is when I was lucky enough to receive a discount on the XTAVA....DOLCE ceramic flat iron. I was nervous because I never heard of the brand, but in the end we were not disappointed @ all. This flat iron heats up fast and left my daughters hair the exact way she wanted it.....smooth and sleek without the damage. I continue to be very impressed with this product, as I just straightened my hair w it &amp; the results were fab!</li>
            <li> The best thing about this particular brand, Xtava, is that their products all look so sleek and are incredibly well-designed for aesthetic appeal. My mom and I own a beauty studio, and we have been slowly introducing Xtava products because our clients tend to enjoy how cool and professional they look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+ LCD control display is stylish and easy to understand and use.&lt;br /&gt;+ 1-inch size is great for dual usage of straightening and curling if you have longer hair like myself. Because it is only 1 inch wide, it is small enough for me to wrap my hair around for natural waves/loose curls.&lt;br /&gt;+ Swivel cord makes it easy to move the flat iron in all directions.&lt;br /&gt;+ Built-in automatic safety mechanism. No more forgetting to turn off the flat iron and coming home to a burnt smell wafting through the house!&lt;br /&gt;+ Comes with a heat-resistant case that is great for protective and portability purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- None so far. This flat iron has so many cool features to discover that I have yet to find anything I don&#x27;t like about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this flat iron/hair straightener for the purposes of testing and reviewing, and my overall opinion is that this product is a great value for the many features it offers. I have flat irons from 6 other brands, and they were all pricier than this particular one without the same amount of features. Definitely a very effective styling tool that is both functional and aesthetically appealing.</li>
            <li> Talk about heating up quickly!!  It heats up to over 330 in 30 seconds!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whats in the box?  The flat iron came in a black bag.  On the inside of the bag has a heat resistant material for storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This iron has ceramic plates and has a thin design so its really easy to control. The blue LED light is really easy to read and there are buttons on the side of the iron that are within easy reach.  Because I am new to using a flat iron I used the setting that was programmed into it already. But it heats up to over 430.  WOW!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Now my hair is thick, coarse and is past my shoulders.  Usually when I blow it dry, which isn&#x27;t often because it takes so long, it takes about half an hour.  With the XTAVA flat iron I had my whole head done in 15 minutes.  I did it sitting in a chair in my living room because the directions say you shouldn&#x27;t use it in the bathroom.  When I checked I could not believe how flat this iron had gotten my hair.  With this iron, when I got to the ends of my hair I turned inward so my hair would &amp;#34;frame&amp;#34; my face and curl under.  The 360 degree cord made it easy to reach all of my hair without getting all wound up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really impressed with the XTAVA flat iron and would recommend to a beginner OR a professional hair person.  My hair is not frizzy at all. I did not feel the need to spray my hair to keep frizzes down because I didn&#x27;t have any. It is quick, reliable and well worth the money with the time saved in doing your hair. I love the lock at the end of the wand that is perfect for storage.  I was so happy when I was chosen to review this product during a promotional period for my unbiased opinions.  I really love this flat iron.  My daughter straightens her hair every day and she&#x27;s already got her eye on this.  Good thing I love her and and don&#x27;t mind sharing!</li>
            <li> Really cheap quality hair straighter - Purchased due to the excellent reviews, but if you have previously used a professional hair starightner before then you will not be happy.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t heat up enough for m hair. Lightweight, feels cheap.</li>
            <li> Must have gotten a faulty one. Would turn off every few minutes on its own while straightening my hair. It also snagged my hair breaking it between the plates and the holder. Asked for a refund and shipped it back the same day.</li>
            <li> The texture and thickness of my hair makes it difficult to style, so I was thrilled to see that the Dolce Flat Iron can by programmed up to 430° Fahrenheit. I definitely need the hotter end of that scale, but anyone with fine or thin hair can adjust the heat and still use the flat iron with no issue. The flat iron can be adjusted to go as low as 250°.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The LCD screen is also a nice step up from the temperature dials that I&#x27;m used to. This makes it easy to get the flat iron at an optimal temperature, instead of the guessing game I often use with a dial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The safety features on this flat iron are also fantastic. I like the locking mechanism, especially useful when there are children around. I especially am glad that it shuts off after 60 minutes. I am terrible about making sure my hair tools are unplugged and turned off, so this is one less worry for me.  The heat safe bag is also a really nice addition, especially when traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I was really pleased with this flat iron. It&#x27;s a great value and performs well, especially with such a low cost.  *Product was provided by the company to facilitate this review, but all opinions are honest and my own.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s pretty good. Especially for the cost.  I like that it comes with a heat resistant bag too for trips.  I don&#x27;t have to wait for it to cool down.</li>
            <li> Iron would not get hot.  I returned.</li>
            <li> This Dolce Ceramic ionic Tourmaline Flat Iron works great!! I had to use it as soon as I got it,so I took my shower and washed my hair and blow dried it to make it frizzy and then broke out the flat iron. It heated with in a matter of seconds to 400 degrees and I started to use it. I was very impressed at how well it worked and how my hair instantly went straight without having to re use it over and over again. The ceramic tiles make your hair shiney and soft I recommend this item</li>
