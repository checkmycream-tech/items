            <li> do believe I am seeing a slight difference in my skin, but not only that</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s all we want minus the face lift or tons of plastic surgery.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s from this product or from the vitamin c serums, plant stem serums, rosehip seed oil or other products</li>
            <li> He has very dry skin, and he said his skin feels softer and I notice a slight difference in both of our crows feet!</li>
            <li> My crows feet around my eyes are getting SIGNIFICANTLY less visible.</li>
            <li> she&#x27;s taking this for few days.as of now does&#x27;nt complain</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a waste your money</li>
            <li> then this product I give it a 0 bottom line in a waste of my money find something with rice derived plant-derived ceramides that&#x27;s all I can say</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a waste of money</li>
            <li> and I feel like everyday</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item on apr 2015 but was not satisfied with results though I patiently completed the bottle .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking this for the past week or so.</li>
            <li> hopefully they wont make it too expensive.</li>
            <li> I think every one who is insecure and cannot go a day without makeup should try this!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any change on my skin :-(</li>
            <li> darker cheeks looked like shadows that I hated.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using phytoceramides for about 6 months and have tried so many brands. Lately, however, my skin looks really good! I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s from this product or from the vitamin c serums, plant stem serums, rosehip seed oil or other products lol. I use a lot to soften the aging process , but it&#x27;s working! I&#x27;m 40 years old but have always looked younger than my age, and I am aiming to stay that way. Pytoceramides will remain a part of my daily regimen for sure.</li>
            <li> I liked it; there was a glow to may skin.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any change on my skin :-(</li>
            <li> I give this to my friend as a gift and she likes it she&#x27;s taking this for few days.as of now does&#x27;nt complain,she&#x27;s happy of what i give her, i&#x27;ll update later of what she feel.</li>
            <li> I love these. I ordered more.. thanx for a great product at a terrific price</li>
            <li> This really makes a difference in the appearance of my skin.  I ordered 2 bottles and took as directed and saw slight improvements within a week and big improvements by the end of 1 month.  I didn&#x27;t reorder right away, thinking I would do a trial run without them....this product makes a huge difference in the way my skin and face looks and feels.  I use several brands of face products and this compliments each of them perfectly.  It is now on my monthly shopping list.  Thank you for a great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> never buy it again I take care of my skin no wrinkles but this stuff don&#x27;t seem to help nothingthis is no face lift in a bottle trust me it&#x27;s a waste your money its not rise derived plant its a bunch of chemicals no phytocermides in the product it might be for some people but not for me that will be the last bottle I ever buy of this brand I did my research please people do your research before buying even if the it says 5 stars one with rice is far much better then this product I give it a 0 bottom line in a waste of my money find something with rice derived plant-derived ceramides that&#x27;s all I can say right now!!beware I&#x27;m telling you it&#x27;s a waste of money this product I&#x27;m so upset about this product if you think it&#x27;s going to work in 60 days it might for. You. The chemicals o yes they have vitamin A none of the above that&#x27;s about it on that product</li>
            <li> Who does want healthier skin? Who doesn&#x27;t love natural products? Phytoceramodes is 100% plant derived. It helps with aging skin line wrinkles and natural skin firming agent. I love the feeling I get when I take them in the mornings and I feel like everyday I&#x27;m going to be having better skin and that&#x27;s all we want minus the face lift or tons of plastic surgery.&lt;br /&gt;I was able to recieve this product for free with my own personal biased opinion and review</li>
            <li> My face is looking mor radiant with these love it! I received this item in exchange for an unbiased review.</li>
            <li> This product was definitely amazing. My mom is 50 years old and decided that she wanted to try this because it is Gluten Free and she is Gluten intolerant. She also is a huge fan of all natural products because of the amount of chemicals and such that appear within Genetically Modified foods. My mom said she has noticed a huge difference in her skin feeling a lot softer and fine lines are fading away quickly. She couldn&#x27;t be happier. I was given the opportunity to receive the Phytoceramides in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I love that this supplement is made from plants! I&#x27;m a pretty big health nut and I am trying the all natural thing..The capsules are light and easy to swallow and made in the USA. I try not to smell any supplements before I take them because most of them don&#x27;t smell very nice, but I seem to be ok with these! Oh, did I mention that they are gluten free? Awesome :) I was given this product for no charge to review, but I only review products I have used, know, like and trust.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a facelift in a bottle! I have enjoyed the compliments! This will be a regular purchase for me! Also a great price. This stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li> This is a good product but when i first brought it it was 20 dollars and last time i checked it was 27. hopefully they wont make it too expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used topical ceramide creams/lotions that seemed to work. So after reading that phytoceramides keeps your skin hydrated &amp; plump I thought I would give them a try. I chose this brand because of: price, plant based, gluten free &amp; made in USA.</li>
            <li> No difference. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I am very happy and order come on time.</li>
            <li> The 5 star is for the wrinkle effect; however unless I&#x27;ve mixed up the brands, the gluten bothered name after a couple of days. The rice based ones don&#x27;t seem to work as well, but I can&#x27;t tolerate the gluten in this one.</li>
            <li> This is 2nd time I am trying to contact seller but no response . I purchased this item on apr 2015 but was not satisfied with results though I patiently completed the bottle . I seek refund but seller is silent.&lt;br /&gt;I saw no difference</li>
            <li> My husband and I decided to give this a try. We are approaching our late 40s and are starting to see some fine lines. No money for surgery... so we decided to try this. What attracted us  is that it is 100% natural, only one dosage a day, and that it is Gluten Free. After a week of trying it, we actually see a difference! He has very dry skin, and he said his skin feels softer and I notice a slight difference in both of our crows feet! YAY! I can&#x27;t wait to see the difference in a month. Great price! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I tried out my phytoceramides last week, and after taking 1 capsule a day for exactly a week I already notice results. My crows feet around my eyes are getting SIGNIFICANTLY less visible. I&#x27;m in the sun a lot, so I&#x27;m happy I&#x27;ve found a product that repairs all of my exposure. I think every one who is insecure and cannot go a day without makeup should try this! It&#x27;s plant derived and gluten free, so what is there to worry about? Nothing!</li>
            <li> I am three weeks into it.  I was not skeptical i was hopeful.  Just noticed that I looked better this morning.  Younger even.  But I really knew something was going on when I was talking to my husband and felt my face. IT WAS PLUMPER!  No doubt.  I had darker cheeks looked like shadows that I hated.  I even had treatments with a BBL laser, no luck.  They are almost gone now.  This stuff is amazing.  Ordering more right now.  It says it guarantees results in 60 days , I bought 2 bottles so I best buy more after the 60 days, as I understand you have to continue taking them to maintain your results,  or do you?</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a couple of weeks ago.  I have never tried any phytoceramides before.  What I love about this product is that it is natural, gluten - free, and I didn&#x27;t have any side effects from taking it.&lt;br /&gt;I do believe I am seeing a slight difference in my skin, but not only that, I know I am adding nutrients that my body needs on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;Highly reccomended.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how well this would work on me. I&#x27;ve never taken a supplement to help with my skin before. I&#x27;ve had issues with my skin since I was a teenager. I have combination/oily skin but suffer from dry patches if I don&#x27;t moisturize enough. I&#x27;ve been taking this for the past week or so. I&#x27;ve seen a big difference in my skin. My face looks a lot clearer and feels smoother. I haven&#x27;t changed my skin routine much, so the changes I see must be coming from the supplement. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I love the way my skin looks right now. I look forward to finishing this bottle. I definitely will be repurchasing when I&#x27;m finished!</li>
