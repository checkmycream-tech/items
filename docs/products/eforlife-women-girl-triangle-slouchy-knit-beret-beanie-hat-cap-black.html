            <li>Cute hat</li>
            <li>I was looking for something that looked more knitted as in home made.</li>

            <li>I love the price and the product.  </li>
            <li>Love</li>

            <li>Its thinner than I thought it would be but other than that it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li>Despite that it was still adorable and a great birthday present for my niece.</li>
            <li>Love the design on it and looks very pretty.</li>
            <li>it was so cheap</li>
            <li>I really love this hat , didn&#x27;t expect too love it as much as I do considering</li>

            <li>Very upset.</li>
            <li>Sure to keep my head and ears warm during cold Northcoast winters.</li>
            <li>It fits great, but it smelled horrible and the first time I washed it there was a huge hole that I has to sew</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as large in the back as I thought it was.</li>
            <li>Always skeptical of these clothing items most likely made in China, but this beanie looks exactly like the picture, is classy, warm and not cheaply made.  </li>

            <li> it slipping off your head.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too tight for me and gives me headaches.</li>
            <li> it is thick material, so dont expect the loose hang look.</li>
            <li> Small for my head</li>
            <li> A bit small so it is not &amp;#34;slouchy&amp;#34; as I had imagined.</li>
            <li> Thin yarn, what you&#x27;d expect for the price.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely thick hair so that might have something to do with the hat feeling small.    </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t get it unless you&#x27;ve got a small head or thin hair.</li>
            <li> Not only will I never shop from these people, I&#x27;m also warning my friends about their bad quality and what I consider false advertising.</li>
            <li> Very thick.</li>

            <li> I love this hat, it is more a hat than beanie, but you can wear a high ponytail, or bun under it with out it slipping off your head.  The quality is strong, and you can still look feminine while keeping warm.  My head is 21&amp;#34; 1/2 and it is comfy and won&#x27;t slip off if under a hoodie.</li>
            <li> A lovely hat, good quality, great price, and plus free shipping, I can not be happier when I received the product.  I live in California and this hat works for me beautifully and perfectly !!!</li>
            <li> Stylish and keeps my head warm!</li>
            <li> Cute hat if you have the right head shape for it. Good quality, tight knit. Wears a lot smaller than the photo makes it look. Gave it to my teenaged daughter after trying it at various angles. Just not flattering for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as large in the back as I thought it was. It&#x27;s too tight for me and gives me headaches. I have extremely thick hair so that might have something to do with the hat feeling small.    I wouldn&#x27;t get it unless you&#x27;ve got a small head or thin hair.</li>
            <li> for the price, its awesome. it is thick material, so dont expect the loose hang look. it feels like and looks like a beanie when you first try it on. i just flattened mine in the back and i could make it look just like the picture. fits great and is really cute! great quality, would buy again.</li>
            <li> Nothing like it looks in the photo</li>
            <li> Great quality, very cute</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that looked more knitted as in home made. Despite that it was still adorable and a great birthday present for my niece. She loves it and it goes with any outfit for any season.</li>
            <li> Very cute hat, fit well. Took forever to get delivered.</li>
            <li> It is a bit thin so it stays put. Nice color. A bit small so it is not &amp;#34;slouchy&amp;#34; as I had imagined. Must be my big head</li>
            <li> The hat is so cute.  I love the price and the product.  It  was very affordable and worth the wait for it.</li>
            <li> I was expecting my order that came in to look like the hat in the picture. Boy was I wrong. Instead of a buret, I got a straight up beanie. the disign and everything was completely different from the picture. Not only will I never shop from these people, I&#x27;m also warning my friends about their bad quality and what I consider false advertising. Very upset.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loved the hat. She received it for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Looks just like the pictured.  Thin yarn, what you&#x27;d expect for the price.  Love the design on it and looks very pretty.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t need it right away, it&#x27;s a great item. Love it.&lt;br /&gt;It took about 6 weeks to arrive, but I knew it would take a while having read the reviews.</li>
            <li> Always skeptical of these clothing items most likely made in China, but this beanie looks exactly like the picture, is classy, warm and not cheaply made.  It was a good price.  It took quite a while to get here, but if you aren&#x27;t in a hurry, order now to have it for winter/Christmas.</li>
            <li> Item was as described. Good quality. Very thick. Sure to keep my head and ears warm during cold Northcoast winters.</li>
            <li> This beanie fits great, is well made and looks cool on. Its thinner than I thought it would be but other than that it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, just a beannie and something I could have bought anywhere.  It will come in handy though in winter time.</li>
