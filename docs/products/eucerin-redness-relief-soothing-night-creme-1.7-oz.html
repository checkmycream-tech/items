            <li>This cream is a wonderful hand cream, but it says it&#x27;s suitable for rosacea.  </li>
            <li>This cream is amazing!</li>
            <li>The delivery was good and she is happy.</li>
            <li>I love it , it works great !</li>
            <li>Really nice!</li>
            <li>This is a great product and a good value for a night cream.  </li>
            <li>Pleasant texture and scent, and</li>
            <li>Pleasant feel to this cream;</li>
            <li>The Eucerin is a good product.</li>
            <li>I use this at night because it&#x27;s fairly greasy, or during the days I get to stay home without makeup.  </li>
            <li>It must work; she is gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>Feels good, not greasy.</li>
            <li>I have had people comment on how good my skin looks.</li>
            <li>I wanted to tell everyone who is wondering how good this may</li>
            <li>This is a good product, but doesn&#x27;t help with redness.</li>
            <li>A good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>good product..like the consistency..</li>
            <li>It is a good moisturizer</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;d still continue to use it since it&#x27;s a good cream</li>
            <li>Good night creme, I use it during the day as well as night.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s silky smooth and delicious, as well as soothing for my roscea.</li>
            <li>Even my esthetician says that Eucerin products were created by dermatologists, which is maybe why they are so good.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d rather not screw over a good company.  </li>
            <li>the good work.</li>
            <li>It controls the redness but is also of a good consistency and spreads well without being sticky.</li>
            <li>In 4 weeks time will tell if my redness has diminished or gone away for good.</li>
            <li>It works and I am delighted.</li>
            <li>The cream does feel good on my face or I would have given it a one star.</li>
            <li>It feels good on skin .</li>
            <li>Adequate is the best word to describe it.</li>
            <li>I was initially impressed with how quickly this stuff worked.</li>
            <li>Fine product at a very fair price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been happy and satisfied of Eucerine.</li>
            <li>so am very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with product and service received.</li>
            <li>my nose and face look 95% better and feel great.</li>
            <li>Works great, as intented. :-)</li>
            <li>I have been so happy :)</li>
            <li>Nice soothing cream......feels good</li>
            <li>In the first 2 days which is awesome.</li>
            <li>(Yes, middle-age means more hair removal for face, dangit!).</li>
            <li>Love this cream for the price!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>or so it might be even better!</li>
            <li>I love this product, its a god sent!  </li>
            <li>Will be ordering more of this!</li>
            <li>This stuff is magic!  </li>
            <li>Have ordered more!</li>
            <li>Although I believe diet plays the biggest role in addressing skin issues, this cream has been AMAZING at keeping redness at bay.</li>
            <li>It sounded great; calms redness, is oil free.  </li>
            <li>well I can&#x27;t tell you how amazing that feels.</li>
            <li>I am Happy it is fragrance free,oil free and non comedogenic</li>
            <li>I would give this product 3 stars because it does not work as effectively as I thought it would in reducing redness on my face.</li>
            <li>The absolute best cream I have encountered for redness relief, used both during the day and at night.</li>
            <li>The cream feels nice on skin.</li>
            <li>Plus the moisturizer is really nice, not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>Nice night cream in any case.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for my face to be more healthy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but since it&#x27;s suppose to be a redness reducer and hasn&#x27;t been that effective in that regard for me, I gave it four stars.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not oily and my face feels nice.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for about a month now and honestly have not seen any improvement in redness.  </li>
            <li>It has caused no acne or rash/reaction of any kind</li>
            <li>This is a nice night cream.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a nice product for the price.</li>
            <li>Nice creamy moisturizer.</li>
            <li>but it does make a nice soothing night cream.</li>
            <li>smells nice, feels nice, doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out.</li>
            <li>I love all Eucerin products, not greasy, and most important, no smell!!!</li>
            <li>excellent product light feeling but give moisture and a super glow to your skin nice</li>
            <li>and it is wonderful to feel normal and look</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and blush very easily and sun burn easily.</li>
            <li>The return process was very easy with Amazon.</li>
            <li>This cream is awesome for my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>I was glad to be able to find this again!</li>
            <li>I have all the Redness Relief products and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!  </li>
            <li>Eucerin should be proud of this product and have it more accessible.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve used many high end products and this one is the best.</li>
            <li>Awesome product for redness, sensitive skin, rosacea.</li>
            <li>She likes it the best of the 3, but she says it can build up with frequent use.</li>
            <li>Good and light in texture.</li>
            <li>So far this has been the best night cream for my face.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft, but it&#x27;s not the best product I ever used.</li>
            <li>By far the best moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>This cream is wonderful for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The three together defenitely take out the redness and leave my skin soft, the instructions say best results after 4wks</li>
            <li>I have tried many creams and lotions/potions and so far this is the best one.</li>
            <li>Gave this a try and did EXACTLY what it said and I am happy with the results.</li>
            <li>useful，and more cheaper</li>
            <li>I noticed results after just one use and it just got better and better.</li>
            <li>OK moisturizer, didn&#x27;t reduce redness.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>I find that I need something more moisturizing, but it might work for some.</li>
            <li>So pleased with it. .</li>
            <li>ABSOLUTEY LOVE</li>
            <li>MAY ORDER MORE.</li>
            <li>I do love the Eucerin Redness Relief Soothing Night Crème.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>made a fan of me, that;s for sure</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fantastic !</li>
            <li>Great packaging and very timely delivery.</li>
            <li>Better than skin lotion.</li>
            <li>Very soothing and calming to the skin you will be happy you tried it.</li>
            <li>Love it...cheaper than walmart</li>
            <li>I usually love Eucerin products, but this one didn&#x27;t work for me at all.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to return it to the store since it was opened, so I contacted the company Eucerin, and they gave me a refund.</li>
            <li>I am glad that I found it in Amazon</li>
            <li>Most discount stores do not carry this line of products.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I have chronic dermatitis/eczema issues, notably on my cheeks and bridge of nose.</li>
            <li>purchased this product from ULTA originally, but see that Amazon has a much better price!  </li>
            <li>It did make my rosacea &#x27;feel&#x27; better but did nothing for the redness.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just okay</li>
            <li>Love this nighttime lotion.</li>
            <li>I love this night cream.</li>
            <li>We are satisfied with it and plan to continue using it.</li>
            <li>A nice light nightime creme.  </li>
            <li>So this may be a great moisturizing product, it didn&#x27;t reduce my redness much.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and it helps to calm the redness.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok for using it as a night cream.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>and my skin is looking better.</li>
            <li>Hopefully I&#x27;ll see more improvement.</li>
            <li>Glad you had phone assistance.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love Love ALL EUCERIN products..</li>
            <li>Already I can see a striking improvement in my years-long case of rosecea</li>
            <li>Even if it never gets any better than what it is now, I will continue to use this product forever.  </li>
            <li>and I have tried so many products that just haven&#x27;t helped.  </li>
            <li>but I see my skin getting better .</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s more than I can say for most drugstore</li>
            <li>Love Love Love this product , soothes the burning redness caused by rosacea.</li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>I used it just for couple of days, but definitely have to say that it is great product for good price.</li>
            <li>I was expecting more or better results.  </li>
            <li>If it reduced my redness more I would give it five stars</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This is awesome cleared my redness up enough to notice in 1 application.</li>
            <li>I must say that these products are mostly for allergic reactions and rashes.</li>
            <li>But now my face is breaking out and am noticing more patches of redness.</li>
            <li>will love you for</li>
            <li>Today my face feels so much better</li>
            <li>Hopefully with continued use I will see more changes in my skin but to even have one day of no itching or flaking</li>
            <li>, I feel that&#x27;s a better product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll figure it</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>The soothing night creme seemed to be the most helpful one for me.</li>
            <li>Out of the 3, I have been using this the most and after about I week</li>
            <li>I love this night cream.</li>
            <li>I now get it on subscribe and save, so it&#x27;s an even better deal than it already is on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love all of eucerin products  </li>
            <li>My shoulders didn&#x27;t tolerate it either, so I thought I&#x27;d share my experience because i don&#x27;t think it has the required sensitivity rating needed to say it&#x27;s ok for those with rosacea.  </li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>but, My face is so much better now.</li>
            <li>That said, it seems to be an okay moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>Amazon is great, always in stock and ships fast.</li>
            <li>Using this cream at night overtime made my face more durable.</li>
            <li>My cheeks are more prone to pimples, but they&#x27;re not horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still there, but it is better.  </li>
            <li>, one more thing.  </li>
            <li>I love this creme and so does my skin.</li>
            <li>I love it if she loves it.  </li>
            <li>She hasn&#x27;t been able to apply lotion to her face or anything because she reacts to everything.  </li>
            <li>i love this stuff.</li>
            <li>but this seems to be much better in spite of it.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I am a pharmacist, and I&#x27;ve tried many prescription and OTC products to help with my psoriasis.</li>
            <li>Seems like I need more for each use.</li>
            <li>Works ok for rosacea.</li>
            <li>Still works better than most though.</li>
            <li>I like this even better.</li>
            <li>It does keep my skin hydrated without causing any breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;Overall this cream is just ok.</li>
            <li>I had hoped it would have worked better, but I did get some relief.</li>
            <li>but i love it.</li>
            <li>It works wonder for me and I am so glad I got the product.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found it helpful in managing my redness, but it is soothing for the most part.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a heaven send for sure.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also having him use it on his eczema spots on his body with great results though not as fast as it was for his face.</li>
            <li>So right now I am looking for a good alternative for the coming moisture summer time.</li>
            <li>I also love how rich and moisturizing it is!</li>
            <li>Nourish and calm the skin, very love</li>
            <li>I gave the creme 3 stars because for a normal user this would probably be a great creme.  </li>
            <li>I also use their spf 30 day cream too and it&#x27;s pretty good too.</li>
            <li>After using this product the redness went away significantly!</li>
            <li>The cleanser is amazing; my skin feels so calm after washing;</li>
            <li>BUT SO FAR IT IS GREAT</li>
            <li>I love this for my nightly moisturizing routine because it is light and odorless.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t lie, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever be able to leave the house without makeup on comfortably but before, the redness of my skin would pop through my foundation.</li>
            <li>Another good thing about this night cream is that it is not greasy at all - it soaks into the skin very well.</li>
            <li>Good product at a reasonable price</li>
            <li>I rarely give glowing reviews to anything, but I am thrilled with this product.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find the product in my local drugstore, so I was super glad to get it on Amazon!!!</li>
            <li>This really is one of the very best moisturizing creams I have ever encountered, even despite having tried what is supposedly the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; of them (I live in Switzerland, which is known for its advanced skincare products).</li>
            <li>Maybe a very mild rosacea?</li>
            <li>I have the kind of rosacea that just makes the skin bright red all the time, but I have not been diagnosed by a doctor</li>
            <li>That being said, as a night cream, it&#x27;s a hell of a lot better than most of the powerfully fragrant, cosmetic stuff they push to us women.</li>
            <li>The smell did not make it easy to fall asleep</li>
            <li>It is creamy, easy to apply and helps with the redness .</li>
            <li>It has no smell and absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li>(I think I have very mild rosacea) since I was about 13 (now 20), and after two days of using this night cream I could not stop looking in the mirror...</li>
            <li>In the event that anyone reading this is on their own search for something that will work for them, I&#x27;ve had a really good experience with, of all brands, Wal-Mart&#x27;s Equate brand&#x27;s Ultra-Gentle Facial Moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I have good skin but feel this has helped keep it that way as I get older.</li>
            <li>Rather strong, but with time it might work.</li>
            <li>After 5 weeks of using this wonderful cream, I met up with a friend from high school who complimented me on how young I look!</li>
            <li>I have a full review &amp; video on my blog if you&#x27;d like to hear more about my thoughts on this product:  </li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite nighttime lotion that I have ever used, and the low price makes it even more awesome.</li>
            <li>I have very VERY fair (cannot find foundation) skin, and it&#x27;s pretty sensitive.  </li>
            <li>And it works fine.</li>
            <li>It absorbs into my skin just fine</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have allergies, it would probably be fine.</li>
            <li>The cream is light and does not feel greasy, nor does it have a strong scent.  </li>
            <li>Very good product for very dry skin</li>
            <li>The lotion is easy to absorb, has no scent, and worth more than its cost.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work QUITE as well, but it does a pretty good job, which I think is good enough for me when you consider the huge price difference between the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The best result of this cream is that the licorice root extract used to reduce redness has also minimized my dark under eye circles!</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of Aquaphor and figured that anything else form</li>
            <li>and my face cleared up within 3 days and is now silky smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy, rather light, goes on smoothly and evenly and the moisture lasts.</li>
            <li>I experienced no change in my facial redness at all.  </li>
            <li>This creme is fantastic for my rosacea.</li>
            <li>I suffer from acne rosacea and this product helps me to keep my complexion free of blemishes and redness.</li>
            <li>And because Eucerin cream does such a great job on my body, I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.</li>
            <li>Feels smooth &amp; creamy upon application.</li>
            <li>but my skin is so smooth.</li>
            <li>Using this creme feels like having an angel&#x27;s satiny hands smooth away all the irritated, itchy redness while you sleep.</li>
            <li>makes my skin smooth and comfortable.</li>
            <li>It looks smooth.</li>
            <li>I have never been diagnosed with rosacea, but after 30 minutes on WebMD, I have diagnosed myself with a light case of it.</li>
            <li>really enjoy the cooling sensation you get upon applying it to your face.</li>
            <li>This is a great facial moisturizer for any time of day.</li>
            <li>It also seems to help smooth my skin when it has been irritated.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know how it would work for a more severe redness, but it might be worth a try.</li>
            <li>It is light and not greasy.  </li>
            <li>My derm recommended  just using the night cream on my 40-something face even in the daytime so after I used up all my free samples I just bought the night cream and the green-tint SPF 15 lotion.  </li>
            <li>I like the way the cream feels nice and light, however, that being said, it did absolutely nothing for redness.</li>
            <li>but it makes your skin really soft and smells good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good night creme from a brand that can be trusted not to irritate sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This  cream can be used both night &amp; day after cleansing with Eucerin&#x27;s Redness Relief Facial Cleanser - best for preventing redness from too much heat/cold</li>
            <li>it is soft and has a good smell.</li>
            <li>It is light, unscented, easy to apply, makes my skin feel great, and lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad night cream, but I haven&#x27;t seen it do anything to lessen the redness of my rosacea, and I have a very mild case.  </li>
            <li>It works very nicely to moisturize and soothe after any sort of facial attention (whether it&#x27;s plucking, shaving, exfoliating, or removing a whitehead/pimple).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty confident you&#x27;ll benefit from this product.</li>
            <li>Great long term results.</li>
            <li>Eucerin is more expensive but for those stubborn, more severe rashes it&#x27;s probably your best bet.</li>
            <li>The next day, even better, and better and better.</li>
            <li>it makes a significant difference in what you want to be changed</li>
            <li>The first time I applied the cream it stung a bit and made my skin more read.</li>
            <li>rich and creamy night treatment, not greasy</li>
            <li>It has a unique consistency, it&#x27;s almost like the custard in donuts.</li>
            <li>, i haven&#x27;t noticed any significant changes in my skin</li>
            <li>Worth the purchase!  </li>
            <li>I originally read about this cream in a book I have that is written by a dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>If you have acne and are looking for a good moisturizer, I highly recommend Neutrogena oil free moisture for sensitive skin :)</li>
            <li>Works great on my dry skin during the winter time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m 50/50 on using this immediately after showering so that my face is clean.</li>
            <li>Has helped clean up the redness in my face with out clogging my poors...</li>
            <li>I ave mild rosacea  and this cream as been fantastic.</li>
            <li>I have tried multiple moisturizers over the years, this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best OTC one I have found, and I use it daily after I shower before I go to bed.  </li>
            <li>I usually do not post reviews, but this product was just so amazing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy that I can use this product having rosasea, and not have a skin reaction, it&#x27;s hard to find creams that my skin can stand.</li>
            <li>When I mow the lawn I look like I&#x27;m going to pass out - like a bright red tomato!  </li>
            <li>After using it, I looked pale...compared to bright red!  </li>
            <li>my nose and cheeks would turn bright red and break out.</li>
            <li>I really like most of the Eucerin product as they don&#x27;t add fragrance</li>
            <li>Does not feel super greasy and has a clean almost no scent smell.</li>
            <li>fast shipping, Lovely cream</li>
            <li>I have been using this cream for 5 years now, and I love it that much..</li>
            <li>I love this so much</li>
            <li>I have been using this for several months, and I discovered that my face looked good if I didn&#x27;t moisturize.</li>
            <li>Not a bad lotion.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for dry, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Think I would prefer it in a tube - for cleanliness, other than that it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>I have mild rosacea</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>, it is not oily and dries quite quickly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t suffer from severe redness, just mild.</li>
            <li>I would say that I wish it was sliiightly more moisturizing if I had to be nitpicky, but I still think it does a decent job.</li>
            <li>apply this creme after taking a shower, and it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t get sticky.</li>
            <li>it does provide adequate moisturization without leaving a greasy film.</li>
            <li>but my doctor diagnosed me with a mild case of rosacea.</li>
            <li>All their products are super.</li>
            <li>I have mild case of rosecea.</li>
            <li>What I really like about this moisturizer is that it is light but not too light, and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out in any way, which is never the case with anything I put on my face.</li>
            <li>Good lotion that lasts a long time</li>
            <li>I love that this cream is so rich and is very helpful for excessive dryness, but it hasn&#x27;t been very effective for my reactive redness.</li>
            <li>Once I started using this cream with the bootie overnight socks, my skin smoothed out more quickly and is soft by morning!</li>
            <li>I notice less redness as well but the moisturizing aspect works great.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about 6 months now and it has not taken the redness away from my face; however it feels good on my face and works for the dry skin.</li>
            <li>As for any positive aspects: it feels smooth going on, I suppose.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many items before for my mild redness on my face and nothing I have tried thus far worked.</li>
            <li>This cream really does seem to soothe the irritation, and smooth my skin.  </li>
            <li>After a week I noticed a change, I primarily use it after a chemical peel now, it&#x27;s very soothing.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed that when I wale up my skin is calm and looks so refreshed.</li>
            <li>This product brings so much relief, I literally want to soak my face in a huge tub of it.</li>
            <li>The texture is light (if you use the correct amount, which is sparingly) and it is very soothing.</li>
            <li>and I liked the results so ordered a regular size jar.</li>
            <li>Some did work somewhat but never did as good as I expected...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the $15.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products to help clear this condition, but like the others, this one did not work for him.</li>
            <li>And I need 6 more words to complete this review.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s effective since I only use it for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>As I have aged, the redness in my skin has become more prominent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soothing and it is definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money to me.</li>
            <li>And I can yawn now and smile also.</li>
            <li>&amp; I wake up really really fresh looking skin</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>I wait 5-10 minutes for it to be absorbed then apply the SPF green-tint lotion.  </li>
            <li>This product is great for dry skin if you need a thicker cream than normal products are.  </li>
            <li>regardless, it&#x27;s a good moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t give me acne breakout on other parts of my face.</li>
            <li>I put it on at night and it soothes right away.</li>
            <li>Does anyone else have any results where it didn&#x27;t work right away but over time showed an improvement?  </li>
            <li>It just seems to soak right in.  </li>
            <li>Stings your face right away.</li>
            <li>you can apply and go right to sleep.</li>
            <li>I have started to use this cream for 3 days, and I  see result right away.</li>
            <li>I am positive that if I continue to use this product there will be no redness at all!</li>
            <li>I recently was diagnosed with rosacea and this has turned out to be the best cream for calming down my skin without irritation.</li>
            <li>This is certainly limited to MY OWN skin, so this reaction should be taken as a rare exception.</li>
            <li>Love Eucerine products in general</li>
            <li>This stuff does really work well for mild Rosacea.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice gel-cream moisturizer, has virtually no scent, and applies smoothly and does not feel heavy on the skin.</li>
            <li>I have fair, sensitive skin with a red undertone.  </li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive skin, so finding a product that would not irritate my skin is also important.  </li>
            <li>I recently went for my first facial and she told me my skin was in great condition considering my age (38).  </li>
            <li>Not many companies are honest, please don&#x27;t ruin that policy if it really works for you :)</li>
            <li>but once I get outside in the sun it pops right through again especially if it&#x27;s hot and humid out.  </li>
            <li>Also very fast shipping</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very heavy moisturizer which i thought was going to be problem but wasn&#x27;t (most of things I&#x27;ve been using is very light).  </li>
            <li>However, I just couldn&#x27;t give it five stars because even though I love the way it makes my skin feel, I haven&#x27;t seen any reduction in the redness on my face after several months of using it.</li>
            <li>I have added the entire line including the scrub and daytime lotion, and love all the products in the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much</li>
            <li>Most of my face really isn&#x27;t red.</li>
            <li>Obviously people with more red areas in their face will need to use a bit more cream.        </li>
            <li>and I tried so many different creams.</li>
            <li>They sent me the cleanser at first</li>
            <li>i will recommend any one have sensitive skin and red skin ,its give the skin smooth and baby face love it</li>
            <li>I was hoping for the best with this cream, but too expensive for the results.</li>
            <li>Some of these rashes are pretty severe w/dry, flaky skin.</li>
            <li>Every time I apply it on my face,  it made my skin more red.</li>
            <li>it helped the first night i put it on.</li>
            <li>That makes sense, but in order to see the effects you need to be pretty disciplined in its application.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to suggest that my skin type is just not compatible with this product.  </li>
            <li>Eucerin soothing cream does exactly what it says..sooths skin..</li>
            <li>It really helps to calm your skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried different cleansers and lotions, but this one has been my favorite.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t just sit on the top of the skin like regular lotions.</li>
            <li>thought I would throw a bit more money at the problem and get Eucerin Redness Relief Night Creme, Daily Perfecting Lotion SPF 15, and the TriDerma Redness Repair creme.</li>
            <li>It helps with my sensitive skin, and is oil free so doesn&#x27;t cause break outs.  </li>
            <li>This works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>I started to use this on Monday&lt;br /&gt;the 26th and for the first time in over a year my swelling in the nose has gone and</li>
            <li>and itchy.when I first try,</li>
            <li>I use the night cream first thing in the morning after my shower.  </li>
            <li>My son&#x27;s face is back to a healthy color,</li>
            <li>Good for dry and sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Works really well, takes the redness right out, it cools and soothes.</li>
            <li>A little bit of this really does go a long way as it feels good on your face and goes on smooth, however, I don&#x27;t see a significant change in the redness.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an antique white, and against the pure whiteness of the jar - it always surprises me and makes me think it is off, but that&#x27;s just a quirk on my part.  :-)</li>
            <li>I will keep using it unless I find a product that actually dose reduce redness for me, since I love pretty much everything else about it.</li>
            <li>:) But if you need some extra-soothing after facial treatments of any sort, this is very useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I read most of the reviews here and had such high hopes!  </li>
            <li>it does have a positive impact on the redness in my cheeks.</li>
            <li>I ordered this with the redness relief cleanser and daytime moisturizer, the night cream is very nice, it is a smaller jar than I expected</li>
            <li>I have been on the hunt for a long, long time for a lotion that will just keep the scalies and bright redness away, something worth</li>
            <li>This is the first one that really seems to be helping.</li>
            <li>This turned out to be better for my dry skin than the lotion</li>
            <li>When I use this at night, my face is definitely paler and more normal looking in the morning - unless I have eaten something that creates a flare up.     </li>
            <li>However, if you have super sensitive skin then I cannot recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This makes my skin soft and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>, this has definitely helped cool and calm my skin at night.</li>
            <li>I first got free samples from my dermatologist about 5 years ago and since then it is the only moisturizer I use.  </li>
            <li>Went on easily and acted as a terrific moisturizer at night.</li>
            <li>It did help after a while to calm down some of his redness on his face, but not on his neck area which just had too many years of accumulated sun damage.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been officially diagnosed with Rosacea but am fairly certain I have it.</li>
            <li>It is extremely lightweight and gentle and goes on very easy.</li>
            <li>Has a slight lotion scent, clean, but goes away very quickly once applied she says.  </li>
            <li>I had very high hopes for this creme.  </li>
            <li>I find the price very reasonable, considering some of the high end creams I have used that did absolutely nothing for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves the face a little bit sticky, but it&#x27;s quite effective</li>
            <li>I rub a little in the affected area at night and the next morning the flakiness is gone and the redness is greatly reduced, if not gone.</li>
            <li>However within the third day of use I saw a huge difference.</li>
            <li>That might sound gross to put on your face, but it coats and you can really feel it soak into your skin.</li>
            <li>and they work really well on my skin.  </li>
            <li>&quot; photos of my cheeks so I could check if this product was really working for me.</li>
            <li>I really wish I had taken some \\&quot;before\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It never broke out, and wasn&#x27;t really all that bumpy.</li>
            <li>If you have redness in your face, you really should try this cream.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is also very oily, it does not look like it absorbs well</li>
            <li>this is too much.</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>Nothing seemed to help,but this stuff is so gentle and soothing.</li>
            <li>This cream is very moisturizing and calming.</li>
            <li>Product is working all ready.</li>
            <li>I use the whole regimen from cleanser to day cream.</li>
            <li>This product feels like your putting yogurt on your face; it is very creamy despite what the description says (although that might be because I&#x27;d used too much).</li>
            <li>I tried the day cream and not so much on that one.</li>
            <li>Hope it really works for redness.</li>
            <li>Based on the reviews, this product works really well for some with rosacea and redness, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>This product has really worked for me within days of use.</li>
            <li>I think the combo works really well together.)</li>
            <li>It is a very noce and moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li>Moisturizers very well.  </li>
            <li>It does have parabens but the amount that is needed is so insignificant that it was well worth me to step away from &#x27;all natural&#x27; cremes for this product.</li>
            <li>Thanks again.</li>
            <li>While it hasn&#x27;t relieved much redness it does sooth the face without clogging pores.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because I really like Eucerin products and a number of reviewers</li>
            <li>said that it really helped with the redness from rosacea.</li>
            <li>I also got clogged pores and pimples using it, but my skin is very finicky.  </li>
            <li>Mom says this stuff really moisturizes her skin and is soothing.</li>
            <li>So, this is a cream you apply gently and leave alone.</li>
            <li>not helping the redness so much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had so, so much improvement just by quitting face wash and keeping moisturized.</li>
            <li>It has helped redness in my skin so much.</li>
            <li>Very helpful for rosacea.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product before and really like the way it works</li>
            <li>Really didn&#x27;t work on me😑</li>
            <li>they really do the job..</li>
            <li>Yes, this really happened.  </li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>Really settles my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too soon to say whether it&#x27;ll fix the bumps and redness, but already I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I have rosacea and this cream really seems to help.</li>
            <li>Very well priced, and it does what it says it will.</li>
            <li>and they are gone or really softened up.</li>
            <li>There is no smell, it is not greasy, light enough to even be used in the day, and soaks in fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I could not see real results as as &amp;#34;redness relief.</li>
            <li>It has not helped redness that much with my skin, maybe 20%, but it has done wonders for my over all complexion, I no longer have acne flare ups.  </li>
            <li>really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really helps.  </li>
            <li>Within two weeks of using this product, the redness has been severely reduced and appears much calmer.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t really see much difference.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li>But, a cream is not going to cure your rosacea nor improve it all that much.</li>
            <li>, if you want a cream to apply to your rosacea that might really help - try cold-pressed virgin coconut oil of whatever brand you like.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 28 year old male who has always had somewhat bright, red cheeks.</li>
            <li>and this cream really works</li>
            <li>This really works are relieving redness.  </li>
            <li>Also, it has an extremely light scent that is only noticeable while putting it on my face.</li>
            <li>I really dislike any perfume</li>
            <li>First started using this product when my Mom&#x27;s dermatologist gave her a free sample back in the early 2000s, and have used it consistently since.</li>
            <li>But after going through one jar, I really can&#x27;t see much (if any) difference my skin&#x27;s appearance.</li>
            <li>Very calming.</li>
            <li>My skin Absolutely loves this stuff.</li>
            <li>The creme really helped to relieve the redness and the dryness.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping this would work to reduce the redness in my face</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t expect this to work</li>
            <li>So I just moisturized when absolutely needed.  </li>
            <li>I really bought into the \\&quot;redness relief\\&quot; promise and just figured I couldn&#x27;t solve it.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve used the whole thing now and will buy it again.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it is doing much for the rosacea.</li>
            <li>Feels really soothing when you use at night and moisturizes well.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this cream.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just that it hasn&#x27;t done any better of a job with my redness than any other half decent lotion, which is kind of it&#x27;s purpose,</li>
            <li>I have combo skin that has reddish tones, large pore areas and can be sensitive, so Im pretty picky about moisturizers.</li>
            <li>Works better for me than any other redness cream out there.</li>
            <li>Is cheaper than the other &amp;#34;name&amp;#34;  brands,and works better.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many other products and all they do is make my cheeks redder and cost me money.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s perfectly normal all the drs say!</li>
            <li>Most of you will ignore this..for those of you that are actually interested, do a little search on the internet</li>
            <li>For the first time in years, my complexion has a more normal color to it and is much less pink/reddish than before.</li>
            <li>not sure how well it works to alleviate that, but overall a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Of course, if you&#x27;re struggling with redness I would still recommend this solely because of its exceptional price to at least give it a shot.</li>
            <li>facial redness has reduced significantly, and highly recommend the redness relief range for roscea sufferers.</li>
            <li>it may help you, but if you have sensitive skin that turns red easily</li>
            <li>A dermatologist had recently told me that my reddish complexion is due mostly to genetics and can be considered mild rosacea.</li>
            <li>I am very sorry for those of you who are allergic to it, because it has been wonderful.</li>
            <li>I have very fair, sensitive dry skin that is VERY cool-toned, which brings a lot of pink into my skin especially on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li>I do NOT have sensitive skin but this product made me break out, only worsening my mild redness !</li>
            <li>I have tried other moisturizers for sensitive skin that turn me bright red.  </li>
            <li>But it does handle new flares of redness very well.</li>
            <li>I was just diagnosed with rosacea,and someone told me about the Eucerin Red Relief, I&#x27;ve used this for a few weeks and have had huge success!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;-I think this has slightly reduced the redness in my face, though I should have taken pictures to be absolutely sure.</li>
            <li>I like the safety seal on the lid and the cream is a cream yellowish color and feels velvety smooth on my dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have tried many and more expensive.</li>
            <li>I have mainly been using this as a moisturizer during the day under my foundation.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mainly on my cheeks and nose.  </li>
            <li>the older i get.</li>
            <li>I know we all have different reactions to different products, so it may work ok for someone else.  </li>
            <li>In the summer or when I travel to a  particularly sunny destination I will use Clinique City Block 25 (which I have also reviewed vary favorably) after the Redness Relief night cream instead of the SPF 15 product.  </li>
            <li>better results than the more expensive brands I normally use.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend giving it a shot.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend both.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend you try it.</li>
            <li>It feels soothing and my skin looks a little more relaxed.</li>
            <li>Was hoping for more but does help a little.</li>
            <li>But anything that just helps a little is better than nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product smooths in easily and, over time, reduces the dry irritation and redness I normally have, leaving my skin feeling soft and supple.</li>
            <li>It is odorless and a little goes a long ways, so there&#x27;s good value.</li>
            <li>Although it feels soft and creamy when putting it on, it really does nothing special as far as my facial redness goes.</li>
            <li>I heard it was discontinued which is really bad because this is an excellent product for skin redness.</li>
            <li>The cream seems to be very helpful so far.</li>
            <li>It is a clear, non greasy cream, which feels very moisturizing on my face.</li>
            <li>Works fast and leaves my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>very soothing for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>so far I haven;t seen much difference in my skin</li>
            <li>I have moderate adult acne, mostly around my mouth and especially my chin.  </li>
            <li>probably anyone with normal, combination, or oily skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If your skin is normal, I&#x27;d try it.  </li>
            <li>she continued to use it for a few more day, &amp;#34;Just to be sure&amp;#34; she said.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist compared the ingredients to those found in my normal lotion, and suspects the offender to be the formaldehyde.  </li>
            <li>Within a couple of days, my skin looks normal again.</li>
            <li>I generally re-apply at some point during the day when I want to re-apply the SPF green tint  - I think it or anything goes on the face better if it is first smoothed over by a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>the next morning I felt my face more softer and not too dry as it was.</li>
            <li>But, i mean, you dont want to buy a kind of just mosturizing night cream, dont you?</li>
            <li>and FINALLY I was sent the right item.  </li>
            <li>Sucks that I am only able to find this product online, since for whatever reason, many drugstores don&#x27;t sell Eucerin Facial products.</li>
            <li>I used to have very dry skin and using this product at least 5 times a week has made a great improvement to my skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth to apply, it&#x27;s not oily like some other products.  </li>
            <li>My wife needs this product, but can not find it where we live.</li>
            <li>new me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just mentioning to save you time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosacea is a relatively new development in my life.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t super potent, but was enough to be noticeable and hard to ignore.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did; the Eucerin product isn&#x27;t really a moisturizer, at least for my 66-year-old skin, so using both is the answer.</li>
            <li>Or maybe the product was very old</li>
            <li>and I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and I&#x27;ve been using Eucerin products for a while.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive skin or clog my pores.</li>
            <li>It works like a charm and her face feels very soft.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and perfumes/creams don&#x27;t work for my face.  </li>
            <li>Other topical so work better.</li>
            <li>A small dab of this can cover most of your face.</li>
            <li>Last night was my first use, so I have no idea</li>
            <li>I know everybody&#x27;s skin is different but this stuff really worked for me!</li>
            <li>I bought this a week after I started using the Eucerin cleanser and moisturizer for redness relief, and wow, what a difference!  </li>
            <li>Eucerin&#x27;s redness relief night creme, third in the redness relief lineup, is a light oil-free gel-creme that claims to be non-irritating despite the company&#x27;s use of parabens which can potentially irritate sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>condition was most likely eczema due to some irritant or allergy.</li>
            <li>Even though it is a night cream, I used it during the day the first week and then started using it only at night.</li>
            <li>A complete surprise!</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for the first time and for 3 days and already am seeing a difference in the redness and overall look of my skin on my face.</li>
            <li>i put it on before bed and after the first use, my red blotchy skin has gone away</li>
            <li>I have mild roseacea and very dry skin.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommend it for dry seasons, but it can get oily occasionally.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t confirm if Eucerin was the sole factor in my success but it seemed like it played a major role.</li>
            <li>The cream goes on smooth, has a slight cooling feel, and after about a minute, you can&#x27;t tell its there.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s because while the diet was better than the average american diet..it still didn&#x27;t get rid of systemic</li>
            <li>the product is ok, it is just bland, it has no smell or specific feeling on my face.</li>
            <li>You only need a very tiny amount and it&#x27;s super creamy and blends</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually found using pure aloe on my face in the morning and night has done the trick.</li>
            <li>The Eucerin products that address redness have all been extremely helpful in controlling my rosacea, which is mild, but maybe they are helping keep it that way.</li>
            <li>roscea can get extremely itchy and super sensitive.</li>
            <li>It is very greasy when applied so you only need a little dab to go a long ways, which is a great benefit, since it will last a long time.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s clear &amp; does what it says it does.</li>
            <li>I have not seen a difference in the overall redness of my skin, but it has really helped with hydration and does not sting.</li>
            <li>addition, this does not provide any meaningful moisturizing benefit, at least for me.  </li>
            <li>I bought the cream at a rite-aid for about 11 bucks and judging by how much I used last night,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy or oily, and I didn&#x27;t notice any scent from it.     </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much redness relief from usage - and I have used the entire jar.</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel soft.</li>
            <li>I noticed my redness almost completely fade overnight.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the cleanser and moisturizer for 3 weeks, and the night crème for 2 weeks, and the redness is almost completely gone and the bumps are going away.  </li>
            <li>I do not recommend this product to anyone who has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I recommend this if you have the beginnings of rosacea and want to try a natural solution before medications.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, the consistency is silky smooth and while the night creme does feel &#x27;heavy&#x27;, it does not feel the slightest bit greasy.</li>
            <li>When this runs near out  </li>
            <li>I have rosacea and this cream, by far, beats anything I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s sensitive, I&#x27;d stay away.</li>
            <li>I use it every evening and it really helps with Rosacea (in addition to medical creams)</li>
            <li>I am 58 years old.</li>
            <li>So far, I can see a difference in the texture and tone of my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was completely healed and my skin felt soft and brand</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy or oily, if you&#x27;ve ever had the baby oil-like experience of using the Eucerin cream,</li>
            <li>Agfordable substitute for PCA.perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So while I think this is a quality product, it doesn&#x27;t do much for my actual redness.</li>
            <li>But EUCERIN keep skin Soft.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, I wouldn&#x27;t risk buying this.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only face creme that really &#x27;calms&#x27; my skin after I wash my face.</li>
            <li>Not for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>and I see a marked difference.</li>
            <li>And this is marketed for sensitive redness prone skin</li>
            <li>It does seem to help fade the redness, but as we are talking about blood vessels, it can only do so much.</li>
            <li>No cream can do that - you need a laser to rid yourself if old damage and redness.</li>
            <li>In one night, it completely transformed my skin and now I have reduced eye wrinkles by probably 50%.</li>
            <li>As a moisturizer for those with sensitive skin, I would give it five stars.  </li>
            <li>but it hasn&#x27;t done what it&#x27;s claimed so far.  </li>
            <li>and it does hydrate my sensitive skin well.</li>
            <li>However, I haven&#x27;t noticed a real difference in how red my skin is.</li>
            <li>I have Rosasea and this really helps minimize the effects especially in the winter here in Canada.  </li>
            <li>ON making my skin sort of soft..</li>
            <li>I needed something for redness relief of sensitive skin caused by pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to buy this product after reading the reviews on Amazon about it for redness relief for Rosacea etc.</li>
            <li>I did not think there was anything that was going to help, me for sensitive skin, but this stuff is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have been using this cream because at least it does not cause more redness.  </li>
            <li>I bought it based on the reviews I read from people with sensitive skin and rosacea condition.</li>
            <li>uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to try VaniCream for sensitive skin...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just turning 40 yrs old.</li>
            <li>and I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  </li>
            <li>As far as night creams go, it seems to serve the purpose as well as helping to keep the redness under control.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s working, but so far (for me)</li>
            <li>Got this for my mom, she has extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I would recommend for any face it is not heavy or oily.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin velvety soft.  </li>
            <li>I can get the same type of cream cheaper that won&#x27;t claim to make the redness in my face a bit better - waste of money,</li>
            <li>I could be dishonest and return it empty, but this is a good company</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have rosacea but am an older woman with very dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Just tried applying a small amount of this night cream to the entire face after cleansing and drying, and a few hours later I have a deeper flare up of more pronounced bumps and more redness.</li>
            <li>For the first few minutes my skin is actually bright-ER red (that is the initial reaction of ANYTHING touching my sensitive skin), but then my skin color becomes much more calm and noticeably less red though no-one will ever mistake me for anything other than Irish!  </li>
            <li>It is a rich, so if you use it during the day and wear makeup, wait a few minutes after putting on before applying makeup.</li>
            <li>I have problems with facial redness, particularly around my nose.</li>
            <li>For the last ten years all I have seen in the mirror or in pictures of myself is RED RED and more RED.  </li>
            <li>This is a tiny price to pay for my continued clear and normal nose</li>
            <li>I can see no real signs that my facial redness has decreased, but I am very fair and have always had red cheeks.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend ALL Eucerin products for red skin.</li>
            <li>I am definitely going to purchase again and highly recommend it for roscacea.</li>
            <li>It also has a great price compared to the products I used to purchase from my dermatologist, which were very expensive.</li>
            <li>I have convinced him to start treating his nose for rosacea and it is starting to return to normal</li>
            <li>have been rubbing a little on my skin each morning after I take a shower and before going to bed at night, and my God, I have been totally red free every since.</li>
            <li>While surfing amazon for various skin products I stumbled across this little gem which is extremely cheap.</li>
            <li>recommend this cream and will be purchasing more on Amazon as it is hard to find in my local stores.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also partial to Simple&#x27;s Replenishing Rich Moisturizer, which I picked up at Target and has a soothing effect I&#x27;ve found actually works.</li>
            <li>few more important notes:  if you have rosacea and your eyes are itchy or dry or if it is hard to see out of them sometimes wearing your glasses or not, you may have</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t live with out it actually..</li>
            <li>This has really reduced the redness on my face, and since my skin is on the dry side, I use it day and night.</li>
            <li>The redness has reduced, my overall skin tone is more even and my skin is less dry.</li>
            <li>I never had acne problems as a teen or young adult, but now as a \\&quot;mature\\&quot; woman I find myself with pimples, bumps and redness on my cheeks and forehead.</li>
            <li>/&gt;ALSO, rosacea can cause the bulbous red nose that older people can get (Think classic fisherman&#x27;s red nose), even if the rest of their skin is not red.  </li>
            <li>A lot of the time, my facial redness gives off heat, especially at night, so that feature is one that I really appreciate.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and using Eucerin helped to get rid of redness on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>I have a pre rosacea condition, so my redness is not extreme by any measure.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference in terms of the redness of my skin, though, so you probably can find a different product that costs less that will do the same job.</li>
            <li>calm being the only word I can think of to describe the sensation, or maybe lack of the sensation, I get with other products.</li>
            <li>It felt great on my skin and moisturized very well, however within the first few days of using it, the few active breakout I had got about 10 times worse, and new breakouts were forming all over my forehead.  </li>
            <li>My facial redness may need some more serious help than this.</li>
            <li>While traveling back from a vacation, my skin started to get two decent size red patches on both cheeks.</li>
            <li>The weird thing is that I tried probably hundreds of lotions of any types in my life, even some very cheap made in china ones, and this is the very fist that causes me such a reaction.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Price is cheap compared to other similar products, and since I only use it on my cheeks it will last a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall I love the way my face feels the next day ( a little goes a long way).</li>
            <li>If your skin doesn&#x27;t react badly to it, this is really a great product.</li>
            <li>I deal with eczema, rosacea and dermatitis in general.</li>
            <li>Seems to last a while to as long as you don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li>It works when I put it on, and seems to reduce redness on my skin, but you have to apply it all the time to keep your red skin clear.</li>
            <li>Numerous steroid creams, foams and ointments did nothing to clear it up.  </li>
            <li>My face is rather sensitive and often reacts to facial cream with added fragrance.  </li>
            <li>and it was readilly apparent.  </li>
            <li>be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have atopic skin and have been always having red sensitive and irritated skin for YEARS.</li>
            <li>I initially bought this as it promoted towards those with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend for people suffering from redness caused by sensitive skin, which is the condition I have.</li>
            <li>It stings on my face, and was not tolerated by my sensitive rosacea facial skin at all.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for years and is the only moisturizer i can use that does not irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>For eight months my 13 year old son has been suffering with blotchy red skin on his face.  </li>
            <li>It just felt like this laid on top of my skin, and maybe even make the redness worse.  </li>
            <li>it made it even more worse looks like I have sunburn now</li>
            <li>For the first time I developed dry flaky skin, red bumps - some with tiny amounts of fluid.</li>
            <li>I had very minor rosacea on my nose and to the left and right of my nose, almost like minor sunburn all the time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this stuff feels good on the skin, but sad to say didn&#x27;t really work for me and caused me to get a few extra pimples, probally from blocked pores</li>
            <li>This product is supposed to be specifically designed for sensitive and red skin but it still stings when I put it on, which is not what I&#x27;m going for especially in the winter.  </li>
            <li>I am a 24 year old male who has a genetic disposition for rosacea that is starting to show up now.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m also not getting some WOW results, but for me its a big step to not having a red complexion because I yawn.</li>
            <li>but it ended up making my face more red, irritating, and itchy.</li>
            <li>I much prefer plain old Oil of Olay night time cream</li>
            <li>and I now barely have any red on my face.  </li>
            <li>Tried this a few times as instructed, it cause my first acne &amp;#34;break out&amp;#34; in about 20 years.  </li>
            <li>, so thought I would try this for the occasional redness I have developed over the years before ordering a more expensive product.</li>
            <li>I was never able to yawn or smile all the way or else</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone with some facial redness and/or some dry facial skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, my skin has always been so sensitive that most lotions and other treatments cause worse skin problems than the redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I was pretty shocked at how much better my skin was doing after one day.</li>
            <li>My skin is extremely dry and sensitive.</li>
            <li>I have EXTREMELY dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is dry and sensitive</li>
            <li>As soon as I switched to a lighter, less greasy cream the redness was much improved.</li>
            <li>I have dry sensitive skin and</li>
            <li>this is greasier than the Lubriderm cream I generally use, it doesn&#x27;t actually feel greasy and gross to me.</li>
            <li>The cream is not too thick and it absorbs quickly if you have semi-dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have mild rosacea (subtype 2) with redness, very very dry patches, some bumpiness and a few visible capillaries.</li>
            <li>One week later, the redness has gone down, my skin is smoother, and I am so much happier with my appearance.</li>
            <li>It certainly made my skin softer and did not break me out, but it did little or nothing for my redness.</li>
            <li>After reading reviews about this product I decided to give it a try and have been amazed by how quickly it worked - no more flakes!  </li>
            <li>(And yes, my jaw dropped, because for years I&#x27;ve had to wear heavy concealer on certain parts of my face.).</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work as well as it was described , yes it helped a little but not as much as everyone made it out too be.</li>
            <li>I had very dry, sensitive, red skin, and it is all cleared up.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that I wish it would absorb a little better - it does leave my skin a bit sticky -</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m also going to investigate the potential connection between my rosacea and SIBO (small intestine bacteria overgowth) and heliocopter pilori, the bacteria responsible for ulcers, which we apparently all carry on our skin.</li>

            <li> company has a very nice return policy, from what I&#x27;ve read.  </li>
            <li> This cream is a wonderful hand cream, but it says it&#x27;s suitable for rosacea.  </li>
            <li> This cream is amazing!</li>
            <li> The delivery was good and she is happy.</li>
            <li> I love it , it works great !</li>
            <li> Really nice!</li>
            <li> This is a great product and a good value for a night cream.  </li>
            <li> Pleasant texture and scent, and</li>
            <li> Pleasant feel to this cream;</li>
            <li> The Eucerin is a good product.</li>
            <li> I use this at night because it&#x27;s fairly greasy, or during the days I get to stay home without makeup.  </li>
            <li> It must work; she is gorgeous.  </li>
            <li> Feels good, not greasy.</li>
            <li> I have had people comment on how good my skin looks.</li>
            <li> I wanted to tell everyone who is wondering how good this may</li>
            <li> This is a good product, but doesn&#x27;t help with redness.</li>
            <li> A good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> good product..like the consistency..</li>
            <li> It is a good moisturizer</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;d still continue to use it since it&#x27;s a good cream</li>
            <li> Good night creme, I use it during the day as well as night.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s silky smooth and delicious, as well as soothing for my roscea.</li>
            <li> Even my esthetician says that Eucerin products were created by dermatologists, which is maybe why they are so good.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d rather not screw over a good company.  </li>
            <li> the good work.</li>
            <li> It controls the redness but is also of a good consistency and spreads well without being sticky.</li>
            <li> In 4 weeks time will tell if my redness has diminished or gone away for good.</li>
            <li> It works and I am delighted.</li>
            <li> The cream does feel good on my face or I would have given it a one star.</li>
            <li> It feels good on skin .</li>
            <li> Adequate is the best word to describe it.</li>
            <li> I was initially impressed with how quickly this stuff worked.</li>
            <li> Fine product at a very fair price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been happy and satisfied of Eucerine.</li>
            <li> so am very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with product and service received.</li>
            <li> my nose and face look 95% better and feel great.</li>
            <li> Works great, as intented. :-)</li>
            <li> I have been so happy :)</li>
            <li> Nice soothing cream......feels good</li>
            <li> In the first 2 days which is awesome.</li>
            <li> (Yes, middle-age means more hair removal for face, dangit!).</li>
            <li> Love this cream for the price!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> or so it might be even better!</li>
            <li> I love this product, its a god sent!  </li>
            <li> Will be ordering more of this!</li>
            <li> This stuff is magic!  </li>
            <li> Have ordered more!</li>
            <li> Although I believe diet plays the biggest role in addressing skin issues, this cream has been AMAZING at keeping redness at bay.</li>
            <li> It sounded great; calms redness, is oil free.  </li>
            <li> well I can&#x27;t tell you how amazing that feels.</li>
            <li> I am Happy it is fragrance free,oil free and non comedogenic</li>
            <li> I would give this product 3 stars because it does not work as effectively as I thought it would in reducing redness on my face.</li>
            <li> The absolute best cream I have encountered for redness relief, used both during the day and at night.</li>
            <li> The cream feels nice on skin.</li>
            <li> Plus the moisturizer is really nice, not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li> Nice night cream in any case.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for my face to be more healthy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but since it&#x27;s suppose to be a redness reducer and hasn&#x27;t been that effective in that regard for me, I gave it four stars.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not oily and my face feels nice.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a month now and honestly have not seen any improvement in redness.  </li>
            <li> It has caused no acne or rash/reaction of any kind</li>
            <li> This is a nice night cream.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a nice product for the price.</li>
            <li> Nice creamy moisturizer.</li>
            <li> but it does make a nice soothing night cream.</li>
            <li> smells nice, feels nice, doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out.</li>
            <li> I love all Eucerin products, not greasy, and most important, no smell!!!</li>
            <li> excellent product light feeling but give moisture and a super glow to your skin nice</li>
            <li> and it is wonderful to feel normal and look</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and blush very easily and sun burn easily.</li>
            <li> The return process was very easy with Amazon.</li>
            <li> This cream is awesome for my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I was glad to be able to find this again!</li>
            <li> I have all the Redness Relief products and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!  </li>
            <li> Eucerin should be proud of this product and have it more accessible.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used many high end products and this one is the best.</li>
            <li> Awesome product for redness, sensitive skin, rosacea.</li>
            <li> She likes it the best of the 3, but she says it can build up with frequent use.</li>
            <li> Good and light in texture.</li>
            <li> So far this has been the best night cream for my face.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling soft, but it&#x27;s not the best product I ever used.</li>
            <li> By far the best moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> This cream is wonderful for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The three together defenitely take out the redness and leave my skin soft, the instructions say best results after 4wks</li>
            <li> I have tried many creams and lotions/potions and so far this is the best one.</li>
            <li> Gave this a try and did EXACTLY what it said and I am happy with the results.</li>
            <li> useful，and more cheaper</li>
            <li> I noticed results after just one use and it just got better and better.</li>
            <li> OK moisturizer, didn&#x27;t reduce redness.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> I find that I need something more moisturizing, but it might work for some.</li>
            <li> So pleased with it. .</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTEY LOVE</li>
            <li> MAY ORDER MORE.</li>

            <li> Love it...cheaper than walmart</li>
            <li> I usually love Eucerin products, but this one didn&#x27;t work for me at all.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to return it to the store since it was opened, so I contacted the company Eucerin, and they gave me a refund.</li>
            <li> I am glad that I found it in Amazon</li>
            <li> Most discount stores do not carry this line of products.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I have chronic dermatitis/eczema issues, notably on my cheeks and bridge of nose.</li>
            <li> purchased this product from ULTA originally, but see that Amazon has a much better price!  </li>
            <li> It did make my rosacea &#x27;feel&#x27; better but did nothing for the redness.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just okay</li>
            <li> Love this nighttime lotion.</li>
            <li> I love this night cream.</li>
            <li> We are satisfied with it and plan to continue using it.</li>
            <li> A nice light nightime creme.  </li>
            <li> So this may be a great moisturizing product, it didn&#x27;t reduce my redness much.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and it helps to calm the redness.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok for using it as a night cream.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> and my skin is looking better.</li>
            <li> Hopefully I&#x27;ll see more improvement.</li>
            <li> Glad you had phone assistance.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Love Love ALL EUCERIN products..</li>
            <li> Already I can see a striking improvement in my years-long case of rosecea</li>
            <li> Even if it never gets any better than what it is now, I will continue to use this product forever.  </li>
            <li> and I have tried so many products that just haven&#x27;t helped.  </li>
            <li> but I see my skin getting better .</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s more than I can say for most drugstore</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this product , soothes the burning redness caused by rosacea.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.</li>
            <li> I used it just for couple of days, but definitely have to say that it is great product for good price.</li>
            <li> I was expecting more or better results.  </li>
            <li> If it reduced my redness more I would give it five stars</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> This is awesome cleared my redness up enough to notice in 1 application.</li>
            <li> I must say that these products are mostly for allergic reactions and rashes.</li>
            <li> But now my face is breaking out and am noticing more patches of redness.</li>
            <li> will love you for</li>
            <li> Today my face feels so much better</li>
            <li> Hopefully with continued use I will see more changes in my skin but to even have one day of no itching or flaking</li>
            <li> , I feel that&#x27;s a better product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll figure it</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> The soothing night creme seemed to be the most helpful one for me.</li>
            <li> Out of the 3, I have been using this the most and after about I week</li>
            <li> I love this night cream.</li>
            <li> I now get it on subscribe and save, so it&#x27;s an even better deal than it already is on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love all of eucerin products  </li>
            <li> My shoulders didn&#x27;t tolerate it either, so I thought I&#x27;d share my experience because i don&#x27;t think it has the required sensitivity rating needed to say it&#x27;s ok for those with rosacea.  </li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> but, My face is so much better now.</li>
            <li> That said, it seems to be an okay moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li> Amazon is great, always in stock and ships fast.</li>
            <li> Using this cream at night overtime made my face more durable.</li>
            <li> My cheeks are more prone to pimples, but they&#x27;re not horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still there, but it is better.  </li>
            <li> , one more thing.  </li>
            <li> I love this creme and so does my skin.</li>
            <li> I love it if she loves it.  </li>
            <li> She hasn&#x27;t been able to apply lotion to her face or anything because she reacts to everything.  </li>
            <li> i love this stuff.</li>
            <li> but this seems to be much better in spite of it.</li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I am a pharmacist, and I&#x27;ve tried many prescription and OTC products to help with my psoriasis.</li>
            <li> Seems like I need more for each use.</li>
            <li> Works ok for rosacea.</li>
            <li> Still works better than most though.</li>
            <li> I like this even better.</li>
            <li> It does keep my skin hydrated without causing any breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;Overall this cream is just ok.</li>
            <li> I had hoped it would have worked better, but I did get some relief.</li>
            <li> but i love it.</li>
            <li> It works wonder for me and I am so glad I got the product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found it helpful in managing my redness, but it is soothing for the most part.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a heaven send for sure.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also having him use it on his eczema spots on his body with great results though not as fast as it was for his face.</li>
            <li> So right now I am looking for a good alternative for the coming moisture summer time.</li>
            <li> I also love how rich and moisturizing it is!</li>
            <li> Nourish and calm the skin, very love</li>
            <li> I gave the creme 3 stars because for a normal user this would probably be a great creme.  </li>
            <li> I also use their spf 30 day cream too and it&#x27;s pretty good too.</li>
            <li> After using this product the redness went away significantly!</li>
            <li> The cleanser is amazing; my skin feels so calm after washing;</li>
            <li> BUT SO FAR IT IS GREAT</li>
            <li> I love this for my nightly moisturizing routine because it is light and odorless.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t lie, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever be able to leave the house without makeup on comfortably but before, the redness of my skin would pop through my foundation.</li>
            <li> Another good thing about this night cream is that it is not greasy at all - it soaks into the skin very well.</li>
            <li> Good product at a reasonable price</li>
            <li> I rarely give glowing reviews to anything, but I am thrilled with this product.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find the product in my local drugstore, so I was super glad to get it on Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> This really is one of the very best moisturizing creams I have ever encountered, even despite having tried what is supposedly the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; of them (I live in Switzerland, which is known for its advanced skincare products).</li>
            <li> Maybe a very mild rosacea?</li>
            <li> I have the kind of rosacea that just makes the skin bright red all the time, but I have not been diagnosed by a doctor</li>
            <li> That being said, as a night cream, it&#x27;s a hell of a lot better than most of the powerfully fragrant, cosmetic stuff they push to us women.</li>
            <li> The smell did not make it easy to fall asleep</li>
            <li> It is creamy, easy to apply and helps with the redness .</li>
            <li> It has no smell and absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li> (I think I have very mild rosacea) since I was about 13 (now 20), and after two days of using this night cream I could not stop looking in the mirror...</li>
            <li> In the event that anyone reading this is on their own search for something that will work for them, I&#x27;ve had a really good experience with, of all brands, Wal-Mart&#x27;s Equate brand&#x27;s Ultra-Gentle Facial Moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have good skin but feel this has helped keep it that way as I get older.</li>
            <li> Rather strong, but with time it might work.</li>
            <li> After 5 weeks of using this wonderful cream, I met up with a friend from high school who complimented me on how young I look!</li>
            <li> I have a full review &amp; video on my blog if you&#x27;d like to hear more about my thoughts on this product:  </li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite nighttime lotion that I have ever used, and the low price makes it even more awesome.</li>
            <li> I have very VERY fair (cannot find foundation) skin, and it&#x27;s pretty sensitive.  </li>
            <li> And it works fine.</li>
            <li> It absorbs into my skin just fine</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have allergies, it would probably be fine.</li>
            <li> The cream is light and does not feel greasy, nor does it have a strong scent.  </li>
            <li> Very good product for very dry skin</li>
            <li> The lotion is easy to absorb, has no scent, and worth more than its cost.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work QUITE as well, but it does a pretty good job, which I think is good enough for me when you consider the huge price difference between the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The best result of this cream is that the licorice root extract used to reduce redness has also minimized my dark under eye circles!</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Aquaphor and figured that anything else form</li>
            <li> and my face cleared up within 3 days and is now silky smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy, rather light, goes on smoothly and evenly and the moisture lasts.</li>
            <li> I experienced no change in my facial redness at all.  </li>
            <li> This creme is fantastic for my rosacea.</li>
            <li> I suffer from acne rosacea and this product helps me to keep my complexion free of blemishes and redness.</li>
            <li> And because Eucerin cream does such a great job on my body, I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.</li>
            <li> Feels smooth &amp; creamy upon application.</li>
            <li> but my skin is so smooth.</li>
            <li> Using this creme feels like having an angel&#x27;s satiny hands smooth away all the irritated, itchy redness while you sleep.</li>
            <li> makes my skin smooth and comfortable.</li>
            <li> It looks smooth.</li>
            <li> I have never been diagnosed with rosacea, but after 30 minutes on WebMD, I have diagnosed myself with a light case of it.</li>
            <li> really enjoy the cooling sensation you get upon applying it to your face.</li>
            <li> This is a great facial moisturizer for any time of day.</li>
            <li> It also seems to help smooth my skin when it has been irritated.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how it would work for a more severe redness, but it might be worth a try.</li>
            <li> It is light and not greasy.  </li>
            <li> My derm recommended  just using the night cream on my 40-something face even in the daytime so after I used up all my free samples I just bought the night cream and the green-tint SPF 15 lotion.  </li>
            <li> I like the way the cream feels nice and light, however, that being said, it did absolutely nothing for redness.</li>
            <li> but it makes your skin really soft and smells good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good night creme from a brand that can be trusted not to irritate sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This  cream can be used both night &amp; day after cleansing with Eucerin&#x27;s Redness Relief Facial Cleanser - best for preventing redness from too much heat/cold</li>
            <li> it is soft and has a good smell.</li>
            <li> It is light, unscented, easy to apply, makes my skin feel great, and lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad night cream, but I haven&#x27;t seen it do anything to lessen the redness of my rosacea, and I have a very mild case.  </li>
            <li> It works very nicely to moisturize and soothe after any sort of facial attention (whether it&#x27;s plucking, shaving, exfoliating, or removing a whitehead/pimple).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty confident you&#x27;ll benefit from this product.</li>
            <li> Great long term results.</li>
            <li> Eucerin is more expensive but for those stubborn, more severe rashes it&#x27;s probably your best bet.</li>
            <li> The next day, even better, and better and better.</li>
            <li> it makes a significant difference in what you want to be changed</li>
            <li> The first time I applied the cream it stung a bit and made my skin more read.</li>
            <li> rich and creamy night treatment, not greasy</li>
            <li> It has a unique consistency, it&#x27;s almost like the custard in donuts.</li>
            <li> , i haven&#x27;t noticed any significant changes in my skin</li>
            <li> Worth the purchase!  </li>
            <li> I originally read about this cream in a book I have that is written by a dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> If you have acne and are looking for a good moisturizer, I highly recommend Neutrogena oil free moisture for sensitive skin :)</li>
            <li> Works great on my dry skin during the winter time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m 50/50 on using this immediately after showering so that my face is clean.</li>
            <li> Has helped clean up the redness in my face with out clogging my poors...</li>
            <li> I ave mild rosacea  and this cream as been fantastic.</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple moisturizers over the years, this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best OTC one I have found, and I use it daily after I shower before I go to bed.  </li>
            <li> I usually do not post reviews, but this product was just so amazing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy that I can use this product having rosasea, and not have a skin reaction, it&#x27;s hard to find creams that my skin can stand.</li>
            <li> When I mow the lawn I look like I&#x27;m going to pass out - like a bright red tomato!  </li>
            <li> After using it, I looked pale...compared to bright red!  </li>
            <li> my nose and cheeks would turn bright red and break out.</li>
            <li> I really like most of the Eucerin product as they don&#x27;t add fragrance</li>
            <li> Does not feel super greasy and has a clean almost no scent smell.</li>
            <li> fast shipping, Lovely cream</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for 5 years now, and I love it that much..</li>
            <li> I love this so much</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several months, and I discovered that my face looked good if I didn&#x27;t moisturize.</li>
            <li> Not a bad lotion.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for dry, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Think I would prefer it in a tube - for cleanliness, other than that it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I have mild rosacea</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> , it is not oily and dries quite quickly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t suffer from severe redness, just mild.</li>
            <li> I would say that I wish it was sliiightly more moisturizing if I had to be nitpicky, but I still think it does a decent job.</li>
            <li> apply this creme after taking a shower, and it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t get sticky.</li>
            <li> it does provide adequate moisturization without leaving a greasy film.</li>
            <li> but my doctor diagnosed me with a mild case of rosacea.</li>
            <li> All their products are super.</li>
            <li> I have mild case of rosecea.</li>
            <li> What I really like about this moisturizer is that it is light but not too light, and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out in any way, which is never the case with anything I put on my face.</li>
            <li> Good lotion that lasts a long time</li>
            <li> I love that this cream is so rich and is very helpful for excessive dryness, but it hasn&#x27;t been very effective for my reactive redness.</li>
            <li> Once I started using this cream with the bootie overnight socks, my skin smoothed out more quickly and is soft by morning!</li>
            <li> I notice less redness as well but the moisturizing aspect works great.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 6 months now and it has not taken the redness away from my face; however it feels good on my face and works for the dry skin.</li>
            <li> As for any positive aspects: it feels smooth going on, I suppose.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many items before for my mild redness on my face and nothing I have tried thus far worked.</li>
            <li> This cream really does seem to soothe the irritation, and smooth my skin.  </li>
            <li> After a week I noticed a change, I primarily use it after a chemical peel now, it&#x27;s very soothing.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed that when I wale up my skin is calm and looks so refreshed.</li>
            <li> This product brings so much relief, I literally want to soak my face in a huge tub of it.</li>
            <li> The texture is light (if you use the correct amount, which is sparingly) and it is very soothing.</li>
            <li> and I liked the results so ordered a regular size jar.</li>
            <li> Some did work somewhat but never did as good as I expected...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the $15.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products to help clear this condition, but like the others, this one did not work for him.</li>
            <li> And I need 6 more words to complete this review.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s effective since I only use it for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> As I have aged, the redness in my skin has become more prominent.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soothing and it is definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money to me.</li>
            <li> And I can yawn now and smile also.</li>
            <li> &amp; I wake up really really fresh looking skin</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> I wait 5-10 minutes for it to be absorbed then apply the SPF green-tint lotion.  </li>
            <li> This product is great for dry skin if you need a thicker cream than normal products are.  </li>
            <li> regardless, it&#x27;s a good moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t give me acne breakout on other parts of my face.</li>
            <li> I put it on at night and it soothes right away.</li>
            <li> Does anyone else have any results where it didn&#x27;t work right away but over time showed an improvement?  </li>
            <li> It just seems to soak right in.  </li>
            <li> Stings your face right away.</li>
            <li> you can apply and go right to sleep.</li>
            <li> I have started to use this cream for 3 days, and I  see result right away.</li>
            <li> I am positive that if I continue to use this product there will be no redness at all!</li>
            <li> I recently was diagnosed with rosacea and this has turned out to be the best cream for calming down my skin without irritation.</li>
            <li> This is certainly limited to MY OWN skin, so this reaction should be taken as a rare exception.</li>
            <li> Love Eucerine products in general</li>
            <li> This stuff does really work well for mild Rosacea.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice gel-cream moisturizer, has virtually no scent, and applies smoothly and does not feel heavy on the skin.</li>
            <li> I have fair, sensitive skin with a red undertone.  </li>
            <li> I also have very sensitive skin, so finding a product that would not irritate my skin is also important.  </li>
            <li> I recently went for my first facial and she told me my skin was in great condition considering my age (38).  </li>
            <li> Not many companies are honest, please don&#x27;t ruin that policy if it really works for you :)</li>
            <li> but once I get outside in the sun it pops right through again especially if it&#x27;s hot and humid out.  </li>
            <li> Also very fast shipping</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very heavy moisturizer which i thought was going to be problem but wasn&#x27;t (most of things I&#x27;ve been using is very light).  </li>
            <li> However, I just couldn&#x27;t give it five stars because even though I love the way it makes my skin feel, I haven&#x27;t seen any reduction in the redness on my face after several months of using it.</li>
            <li> I have added the entire line including the scrub and daytime lotion, and love all the products in the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much</li>
            <li> Most of my face really isn&#x27;t red.</li>
            <li> Obviously people with more red areas in their face will need to use a bit more cream.        </li>
            <li> and I tried so many different creams.</li>
            <li> They sent me the cleanser at first</li>
            <li> i will recommend any one have sensitive skin and red skin ,its give the skin smooth and baby face love it</li>
            <li> I was hoping for the best with this cream, but too expensive for the results.</li>
            <li> Some of these rashes are pretty severe w/dry, flaky skin.</li>
            <li> Every time I apply it on my face,  it made my skin more red.</li>
            <li> it helped the first night i put it on.</li>
            <li> That makes sense, but in order to see the effects you need to be pretty disciplined in its application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to suggest that my skin type is just not compatible with this product.  </li>
            <li> Eucerin soothing cream does exactly what it says..sooths skin..</li>
            <li> It really helps to calm your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different cleansers and lotions, but this one has been my favorite.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t just sit on the top of the skin like regular lotions.</li>
            <li> thought I would throw a bit more money at the problem and get Eucerin Redness Relief Night Creme, Daily Perfecting Lotion SPF 15, and the TriDerma Redness Repair creme.</li>
            <li> It helps with my sensitive skin, and is oil free so doesn&#x27;t cause break outs.  </li>
            <li> This works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> I started to use this on Monday&lt;br /&gt;the 26th and for the first time in over a year my swelling in the nose has gone and</li>
            <li> and itchy.when I first try,</li>
            <li> I use the night cream first thing in the morning after my shower.  </li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s face is back to a healthy color,</li>
            <li> Good for dry and sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Works really well, takes the redness right out, it cools and soothes.</li>
            <li> A little bit of this really does go a long way as it feels good on your face and goes on smooth, however, I don&#x27;t see a significant change in the redness.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an antique white, and against the pure whiteness of the jar - it always surprises me and makes me think it is off, but that&#x27;s just a quirk on my part.  :-)</li>
            <li> I will keep using it unless I find a product that actually dose reduce redness for me, since I love pretty much everything else about it.</li>
            <li> :) But if you need some extra-soothing after facial treatments of any sort, this is very useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I read most of the reviews here and had such high hopes!  </li>
            <li> it does have a positive impact on the redness in my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I ordered this with the redness relief cleanser and daytime moisturizer, the night cream is very nice, it is a smaller jar than I expected</li>
            <li> I have been on the hunt for a long, long time for a lotion that will just keep the scalies and bright redness away, something worth</li>
            <li> This is the first one that really seems to be helping.</li>
            <li> This turned out to be better for my dry skin than the lotion</li>
            <li> When I use this at night, my face is definitely paler and more normal looking in the morning - unless I have eaten something that creates a flare up.     </li>
            <li> However, if you have super sensitive skin then I cannot recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin soft and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> , this has definitely helped cool and calm my skin at night.</li>
            <li> I first got free samples from my dermatologist about 5 years ago and since then it is the only moisturizer I use.  </li>
            <li> Went on easily and acted as a terrific moisturizer at night.</li>
            <li> It did help after a while to calm down some of his redness on his face, but not on his neck area which just had too many years of accumulated sun damage.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been officially diagnosed with Rosacea but am fairly certain I have it.</li>
            <li> It is extremely lightweight and gentle and goes on very easy.</li>
            <li> Has a slight lotion scent, clean, but goes away very quickly once applied she says.  </li>
            <li> I had very high hopes for this creme.  </li>
            <li> I find the price very reasonable, considering some of the high end creams I have used that did absolutely nothing for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves the face a little bit sticky, but it&#x27;s quite effective</li>
            <li> I rub a little in the affected area at night and the next morning the flakiness is gone and the redness is greatly reduced, if not gone.</li>
            <li> However within the third day of use I saw a huge difference.</li>
            <li> That might sound gross to put on your face, but it coats and you can really feel it soak into your skin.</li>
            <li> and they work really well on my skin.  </li>
            <li> &quot; photos of my cheeks so I could check if this product was really working for me.</li>
            <li> I really wish I had taken some \\&quot;before\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It never broke out, and wasn&#x27;t really all that bumpy.</li>
            <li> If you have redness in your face, you really should try this cream.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is also very oily, it does not look like it absorbs well</li>
            <li> this is too much.</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> Nothing seemed to help,but this stuff is so gentle and soothing.</li>
            <li> This cream is very moisturizing and calming.</li>
            <li> Product is working all ready.</li>
            <li> I use the whole regimen from cleanser to day cream.</li>
            <li> This product feels like your putting yogurt on your face; it is very creamy despite what the description says (although that might be because I&#x27;d used too much).</li>
            <li> I tried the day cream and not so much on that one.</li>
            <li> Hope it really works for redness.</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews, this product works really well for some with rosacea and redness, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> This product has really worked for me within days of use.</li>
            <li> I think the combo works really well together.)</li>
            <li> It is a very noce and moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li> Moisturizers very well.  </li>
            <li> It does have parabens but the amount that is needed is so insignificant that it was well worth me to step away from &#x27;all natural&#x27; cremes for this product.</li>
            <li> Thanks again.</li>
            <li> While it hasn&#x27;t relieved much redness it does sooth the face without clogging pores.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because I really like Eucerin products and a number of reviewers</li>
            <li> said that it really helped with the redness from rosacea.</li>
            <li> I also got clogged pores and pimples using it, but my skin is very finicky.  </li>
            <li> Mom says this stuff really moisturizes her skin and is soothing.</li>
            <li> So, this is a cream you apply gently and leave alone.</li>
            <li> not helping the redness so much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had so, so much improvement just by quitting face wash and keeping moisturized.</li>
            <li> It has helped redness in my skin so much.</li>
            <li> Very helpful for rosacea.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product before and really like the way it works</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t work on me😑</li>
            <li> they really do the job..</li>
            <li> Yes, this really happened.  </li>
            <li> It really works.  </li>
            <li> Really settles my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too soon to say whether it&#x27;ll fix the bumps and redness, but already I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and this cream really seems to help.</li>
            <li> Very well priced, and it does what it says it will.</li>
            <li> and they are gone or really softened up.</li>
            <li> There is no smell, it is not greasy, light enough to even be used in the day, and soaks in fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I could not see real results as as &amp;#34;redness relief.</li>
            <li> It has not helped redness that much with my skin, maybe 20%, but it has done wonders for my over all complexion, I no longer have acne flare ups.  </li>
            <li> really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really helps.  </li>
            <li> Within two weeks of using this product, the redness has been severely reduced and appears much calmer.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t really see much difference.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li> But, a cream is not going to cure your rosacea nor improve it all that much.</li>
            <li> , if you want a cream to apply to your rosacea that might really help - try cold-pressed virgin coconut oil of whatever brand you like.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 28 year old male who has always had somewhat bright, red cheeks.</li>
            <li> and this cream really works</li>
            <li> This really works are relieving redness.  </li>
            <li> Also, it has an extremely light scent that is only noticeable while putting it on my face.</li>
            <li> I really dislike any perfume</li>
            <li> First started using this product when my Mom&#x27;s dermatologist gave her a free sample back in the early 2000s, and have used it consistently since.</li>
            <li> But after going through one jar, I really can&#x27;t see much (if any) difference my skin&#x27;s appearance.</li>
            <li> Very calming.</li>
            <li> My skin Absolutely loves this stuff.</li>
            <li> The creme really helped to relieve the redness and the dryness.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping this would work to reduce the redness in my face</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect this to work</li>
            <li> So I just moisturized when absolutely needed.  </li>
            <li> I really bought into the \\&quot;redness relief\\&quot; promise and just figured I couldn&#x27;t solve it.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve used the whole thing now and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it is doing much for the rosacea.</li>
            <li> Feels really soothing when you use at night and moisturizes well.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this cream.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just that it hasn&#x27;t done any better of a job with my redness than any other half decent lotion, which is kind of it&#x27;s purpose,</li>
            <li> I have combo skin that has reddish tones, large pore areas and can be sensitive, so Im pretty picky about moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Works better for me than any other redness cream out there.</li>
            <li> Is cheaper than the other &amp;#34;name&amp;#34;  brands,and works better.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many other products and all they do is make my cheeks redder and cost me money.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s perfectly normal all the drs say!</li>
            <li> Most of you will ignore this..for those of you that are actually interested, do a little search on the internet</li>
            <li> For the first time in years, my complexion has a more normal color to it and is much less pink/reddish than before.</li>
            <li> not sure how well it works to alleviate that, but overall a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Of course, if you&#x27;re struggling with redness I would still recommend this solely because of its exceptional price to at least give it a shot.</li>
            <li> facial redness has reduced significantly, and highly recommend the redness relief range for roscea sufferers.</li>
            <li> it may help you, but if you have sensitive skin that turns red easily</li>
            <li> A dermatologist had recently told me that my reddish complexion is due mostly to genetics and can be considered mild rosacea.</li>
            <li> I am very sorry for those of you who are allergic to it, because it has been wonderful.</li>
            <li> I have very fair, sensitive dry skin that is VERY cool-toned, which brings a lot of pink into my skin especially on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> I do NOT have sensitive skin but this product made me break out, only worsening my mild redness !</li>
            <li> I have tried other moisturizers for sensitive skin that turn me bright red.  </li>
            <li> But it does handle new flares of redness very well.</li>
            <li> I was just diagnosed with rosacea,and someone told me about the Eucerin Red Relief, I&#x27;ve used this for a few weeks and have had huge success!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I think this has slightly reduced the redness in my face, though I should have taken pictures to be absolutely sure.</li>
            <li> I like the safety seal on the lid and the cream is a cream yellowish color and feels velvety smooth on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried many and more expensive.</li>
            <li> I have mainly been using this as a moisturizer during the day under my foundation.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mainly on my cheeks and nose.  </li>
            <li> the older i get.</li>
            <li> I know we all have different reactions to different products, so it may work ok for someone else.  </li>
            <li> In the summer or when I travel to a  particularly sunny destination I will use Clinique City Block 25 (which I have also reviewed vary favorably) after the Redness Relief night cream instead of the SPF 15 product.  </li>
            <li> better results than the more expensive brands I normally use.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend giving it a shot.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend both.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend you try it.</li>
            <li> It feels soothing and my skin looks a little more relaxed.</li>
            <li> Was hoping for more but does help a little.</li>
            <li> But anything that just helps a little is better than nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product smooths in easily and, over time, reduces the dry irritation and redness I normally have, leaving my skin feeling soft and supple.</li>
            <li> It is odorless and a little goes a long ways, so there&#x27;s good value.</li>
            <li> Although it feels soft and creamy when putting it on, it really does nothing special as far as my facial redness goes.</li>
            <li> I heard it was discontinued which is really bad because this is an excellent product for skin redness.</li>
            <li> The cream seems to be very helpful so far.</li>
            <li> It is a clear, non greasy cream, which feels very moisturizing on my face.</li>
            <li> Works fast and leaves my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> very soothing for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> so far I haven;t seen much difference in my skin</li>
            <li> I have moderate adult acne, mostly around my mouth and especially my chin.  </li>
            <li> probably anyone with normal, combination, or oily skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If your skin is normal, I&#x27;d try it.  </li>
            <li> she continued to use it for a few more day, &amp;#34;Just to be sure&amp;#34; she said.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist compared the ingredients to those found in my normal lotion, and suspects the offender to be the formaldehyde.  </li>
            <li> Within a couple of days, my skin looks normal again.</li>
            <li> I generally re-apply at some point during the day when I want to re-apply the SPF green tint  - I think it or anything goes on the face better if it is first smoothed over by a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> the next morning I felt my face more softer and not too dry as it was.</li>
            <li> But, i mean, you dont want to buy a kind of just mosturizing night cream, dont you?</li>
            <li> and FINALLY I was sent the right item.  </li>
            <li> Sucks that I am only able to find this product online, since for whatever reason, many drugstores don&#x27;t sell Eucerin Facial products.</li>
            <li> I used to have very dry skin and using this product at least 5 times a week has made a great improvement to my skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth to apply, it&#x27;s not oily like some other products.  </li>
            <li> My wife needs this product, but can not find it where we live.</li>
            <li> new me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just mentioning to save you time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosacea is a relatively new development in my life.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t super potent, but was enough to be noticeable and hard to ignore.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did; the Eucerin product isn&#x27;t really a moisturizer, at least for my 66-year-old skin, so using both is the answer.</li>
            <li> Or maybe the product was very old</li>
            <li> and I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and I&#x27;ve been using Eucerin products for a while.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive skin or clog my pores.</li>
            <li> It works like a charm and her face feels very soft.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and perfumes/creams don&#x27;t work for my face.  </li>
            <li> Other topical so work better.</li>
            <li> A small dab of this can cover most of your face.</li>
            <li> Last night was my first use, so I have no idea</li>
            <li> I know everybody&#x27;s skin is different but this stuff really worked for me!</li>
            <li> I bought this a week after I started using the Eucerin cleanser and moisturizer for redness relief, and wow, what a difference!  </li>
            <li> Eucerin&#x27;s redness relief night creme, third in the redness relief lineup, is a light oil-free gel-creme that claims to be non-irritating despite the company&#x27;s use of parabens which can potentially irritate sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> condition was most likely eczema due to some irritant or allergy.</li>
            <li> Even though it is a night cream, I used it during the day the first week and then started using it only at night.</li>
            <li> A complete surprise!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the first time and for 3 days and already am seeing a difference in the redness and overall look of my skin on my face.</li>
            <li> i put it on before bed and after the first use, my red blotchy skin has gone away</li>
            <li> I have mild roseacea and very dry skin.</li>
            <li> Strongly recommend it for dry seasons, but it can get oily occasionally.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t confirm if Eucerin was the sole factor in my success but it seemed like it played a major role.</li>
            <li> The cream goes on smooth, has a slight cooling feel, and after about a minute, you can&#x27;t tell its there.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s because while the diet was better than the average american diet..it still didn&#x27;t get rid of systemic</li>
            <li> the product is ok, it is just bland, it has no smell or specific feeling on my face.</li>
            <li> You only need a very tiny amount and it&#x27;s super creamy and blends</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually found using pure aloe on my face in the morning and night has done the trick.</li>
            <li> The Eucerin products that address redness have all been extremely helpful in controlling my rosacea, which is mild, but maybe they are helping keep it that way.</li>
            <li> roscea can get extremely itchy and super sensitive.</li>
            <li> It is very greasy when applied so you only need a little dab to go a long ways, which is a great benefit, since it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s clear &amp; does what it says it does.</li>
            <li> I have not seen a difference in the overall redness of my skin, but it has really helped with hydration and does not sting.</li>
            <li> addition, this does not provide any meaningful moisturizing benefit, at least for me.  </li>
            <li> I bought the cream at a rite-aid for about 11 bucks and judging by how much I used last night,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy or oily, and I didn&#x27;t notice any scent from it.     </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much redness relief from usage - and I have used the entire jar.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel soft.</li>
            <li> I noticed my redness almost completely fade overnight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the cleanser and moisturizer for 3 weeks, and the night crème for 2 weeks, and the redness is almost completely gone and the bumps are going away.  </li>
            <li> I do not recommend this product to anyone who has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I recommend this if you have the beginnings of rosacea and want to try a natural solution before medications.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, the consistency is silky smooth and while the night creme does feel &#x27;heavy&#x27;, it does not feel the slightest bit greasy.</li>
            <li> When this runs near out  </li>
            <li> I have rosacea and this cream, by far, beats anything I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s sensitive, I&#x27;d stay away.</li>
            <li> I use it every evening and it really helps with Rosacea (in addition to medical creams)</li>
            <li> I am 58 years old.</li>
            <li> So far, I can see a difference in the texture and tone of my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was completely healed and my skin felt soft and brand</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy or oily, if you&#x27;ve ever had the baby oil-like experience of using the Eucerin cream,</li>
            <li> Agfordable substitute for PCA.perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So while I think this is a quality product, it doesn&#x27;t do much for my actual redness.</li>
            <li> But EUCERIN keep skin Soft.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, I wouldn&#x27;t risk buying this.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only face creme that really &#x27;calms&#x27; my skin after I wash my face.</li>
            <li> Not for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> and I see a marked difference.</li>
            <li> And this is marketed for sensitive redness prone skin</li>
            <li> It does seem to help fade the redness, but as we are talking about blood vessels, it can only do so much.</li>
            <li> No cream can do that - you need a laser to rid yourself if old damage and redness.</li>
            <li> In one night, it completely transformed my skin and now I have reduced eye wrinkles by probably 50%.</li>
            <li> As a moisturizer for those with sensitive skin, I would give it five stars.  </li>
            <li> but it hasn&#x27;t done what it&#x27;s claimed so far.  </li>
            <li> and it does hydrate my sensitive skin well.</li>
            <li> However, I haven&#x27;t noticed a real difference in how red my skin is.</li>
            <li> I have Rosasea and this really helps minimize the effects especially in the winter here in Canada.  </li>
            <li> ON making my skin sort of soft..</li>
            <li> I needed something for redness relief of sensitive skin caused by pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to buy this product after reading the reviews on Amazon about it for redness relief for Rosacea etc.</li>
            <li> I did not think there was anything that was going to help, me for sensitive skin, but this stuff is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream because at least it does not cause more redness.  </li>
            <li> I bought it based on the reviews I read from people with sensitive skin and rosacea condition.</li>
            <li> uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to try VaniCream for sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just turning 40 yrs old.</li>
            <li> and I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  </li>
            <li> As far as night creams go, it seems to serve the purpose as well as helping to keep the redness under control.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s working, but so far (for me)</li>
            <li> Got this for my mom, she has extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I would recommend for any face it is not heavy or oily.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin velvety soft.  </li>
            <li> I can get the same type of cream cheaper that won&#x27;t claim to make the redness in my face a bit better - waste of money,</li>
            <li> I could be dishonest and return it empty, but this is a good company</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have rosacea but am an older woman with very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Just tried applying a small amount of this night cream to the entire face after cleansing and drying, and a few hours later I have a deeper flare up of more pronounced bumps and more redness.</li>
            <li> For the first few minutes my skin is actually bright-ER red (that is the initial reaction of ANYTHING touching my sensitive skin), but then my skin color becomes much more calm and noticeably less red though no-one will ever mistake me for anything other than Irish!  </li>
            <li> It is a rich, so if you use it during the day and wear makeup, wait a few minutes after putting on before applying makeup.</li>
            <li> I have problems with facial redness, particularly around my nose.</li>
            <li> For the last ten years all I have seen in the mirror or in pictures of myself is RED RED and more RED.  </li>
            <li> This is a tiny price to pay for my continued clear and normal nose</li>
            <li> I can see no real signs that my facial redness has decreased, but I am very fair and have always had red cheeks.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend ALL Eucerin products for red skin.</li>
            <li> I am definitely going to purchase again and highly recommend it for roscacea.</li>
            <li> It also has a great price compared to the products I used to purchase from my dermatologist, which were very expensive.</li>
            <li> I have convinced him to start treating his nose for rosacea and it is starting to return to normal</li>
            <li> have been rubbing a little on my skin each morning after I take a shower and before going to bed at night, and my God, I have been totally red free every since.</li>
            <li> While surfing amazon for various skin products I stumbled across this little gem which is extremely cheap.</li>
            <li> recommend this cream and will be purchasing more on Amazon as it is hard to find in my local stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also partial to Simple&#x27;s Replenishing Rich Moisturizer, which I picked up at Target and has a soothing effect I&#x27;ve found actually works.</li>
            <li> few more important notes:  if you have rosacea and your eyes are itchy or dry or if it is hard to see out of them sometimes wearing your glasses or not, you may have</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t live with out it actually..</li>
            <li> This has really reduced the redness on my face, and since my skin is on the dry side, I use it day and night.</li>
            <li> The redness has reduced, my overall skin tone is more even and my skin is less dry.</li>
            <li> I never had acne problems as a teen or young adult, but now as a \\&quot;mature\\&quot; woman I find myself with pimples, bumps and redness on my cheeks and forehead.</li>
            <li> /&gt;ALSO, rosacea can cause the bulbous red nose that older people can get (Think classic fisherman&#x27;s red nose), even if the rest of their skin is not red.  </li>
            <li> A lot of the time, my facial redness gives off heat, especially at night, so that feature is one that I really appreciate.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and using Eucerin helped to get rid of redness on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I have a pre rosacea condition, so my redness is not extreme by any measure.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference in terms of the redness of my skin, though, so you probably can find a different product that costs less that will do the same job.</li>
            <li> calm being the only word I can think of to describe the sensation, or maybe lack of the sensation, I get with other products.</li>
            <li> It felt great on my skin and moisturized very well, however within the first few days of using it, the few active breakout I had got about 10 times worse, and new breakouts were forming all over my forehead.  </li>
            <li> My facial redness may need some more serious help than this.</li>
            <li> While traveling back from a vacation, my skin started to get two decent size red patches on both cheeks.</li>
            <li> The weird thing is that I tried probably hundreds of lotions of any types in my life, even some very cheap made in china ones, and this is the very fist that causes me such a reaction.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Price is cheap compared to other similar products, and since I only use it on my cheeks it will last a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall I love the way my face feels the next day ( a little goes a long way).</li>
            <li> If your skin doesn&#x27;t react badly to it, this is really a great product.</li>
            <li> I deal with eczema, rosacea and dermatitis in general.</li>
            <li> Seems to last a while to as long as you don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li> It works when I put it on, and seems to reduce redness on my skin, but you have to apply it all the time to keep your red skin clear.</li>
            <li> Numerous steroid creams, foams and ointments did nothing to clear it up.  </li>
            <li> My face is rather sensitive and often reacts to facial cream with added fragrance.  </li>
            <li> and it was readilly apparent.  </li>
            <li> be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have atopic skin and have been always having red sensitive and irritated skin for YEARS.</li>
            <li> I initially bought this as it promoted towards those with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend for people suffering from redness caused by sensitive skin, which is the condition I have.</li>
            <li> It stings on my face, and was not tolerated by my sensitive rosacea facial skin at all.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for years and is the only moisturizer i can use that does not irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> For eight months my 13 year old son has been suffering with blotchy red skin on his face.  </li>
            <li> It just felt like this laid on top of my skin, and maybe even make the redness worse.  </li>
            <li> it made it even more worse looks like I have sunburn now</li>
            <li> For the first time I developed dry flaky skin, red bumps - some with tiny amounts of fluid.</li>
            <li> I had very minor rosacea on my nose and to the left and right of my nose, almost like minor sunburn all the time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this stuff feels good on the skin, but sad to say didn&#x27;t really work for me and caused me to get a few extra pimples, probally from blocked pores</li>
            <li> This product is supposed to be specifically designed for sensitive and red skin but it still stings when I put it on, which is not what I&#x27;m going for especially in the winter.  </li>
            <li> I am a 24 year old male who has a genetic disposition for rosacea that is starting to show up now.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m also not getting some WOW results, but for me its a big step to not having a red complexion because I yawn.</li>
            <li> but it ended up making my face more red, irritating, and itchy.</li>
            <li> I much prefer plain old Oil of Olay night time cream</li>
            <li> and I now barely have any red on my face.  </li>
            <li> Tried this a few times as instructed, it cause my first acne &amp;#34;break out&amp;#34; in about 20 years.  </li>
            <li> , so thought I would try this for the occasional redness I have developed over the years before ordering a more expensive product.</li>
            <li> I was never able to yawn or smile all the way or else</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone with some facial redness and/or some dry facial skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, my skin has always been so sensitive that most lotions and other treatments cause worse skin problems than the redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I was pretty shocked at how much better my skin was doing after one day.</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely dry and sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have EXTREMELY dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is dry and sensitive</li>
            <li> As soon as I switched to a lighter, less greasy cream the redness was much improved.</li>
            <li> I have dry sensitive skin and</li>
            <li> this is greasier than the Lubriderm cream I generally use, it doesn&#x27;t actually feel greasy and gross to me.</li>
            <li> The cream is not too thick and it absorbs quickly if you have semi-dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have mild rosacea (subtype 2) with redness, very very dry patches, some bumpiness and a few visible capillaries.</li>
            <li> One week later, the redness has gone down, my skin is smoother, and I am so much happier with my appearance.</li>
            <li> It certainly made my skin softer and did not break me out, but it did little or nothing for my redness.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews about this product I decided to give it a try and have been amazed by how quickly it worked - no more flakes!  </li>
            <li> (And yes, my jaw dropped, because for years I&#x27;ve had to wear heavy concealer on certain parts of my face.).</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as it was described , yes it helped a little but not as much as everyone made it out too be.</li>
            <li> I had very dry, sensitive, red skin, and it is all cleared up.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I wish it would absorb a little better - it does leave my skin a bit sticky -</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m also going to investigate the potential connection between my rosacea and SIBO (small intestine bacteria overgowth) and heliocopter pilori, the bacteria responsible for ulcers, which we apparently all carry on our skin.</li>
            <li> I have used many expensive (Lancôme and other European brands) as well as not so expensive (Avon, Olay, etc) brands, but for my sensitive skin, Eucerin Redness Relief is my favorite.</li>
            <li> For some people it was too thick but for me it&#x27;s just right.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The night cream did burn a little, but after only four days, my skin was beyond back to normal.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, if you put too much on it won&#x27;t absorb well.</li>
            <li> Maybe that&#x27;s why my skin didn&#x27;t get sensitive like it did after other product I used .</li>
            <li> (this may calm down some when he cools down, but not completely).  </li>
            <li> The only problem, I could find on this is: its a tiny jar and does not last very long.</li>
            <li> I tried everything from changing my diet, drinking more water, cutting caffiene, and general lotions but nothing helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough or frequently enough to say</li>
            <li> it almost seemed like a constant rash and has been red for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> how long the effects from each treatment with the cream will last last.</li>
            <li> Personally, I did not see any redness reduction and found the cream to be too heavy for my post-accutane skin that is slowly but surely returning to normal after a raw red dry spell.</li>
            <li> The container is almost porcelain like, so it is very prone to breaking and just overall very heavy.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from increasingly sensitive skin lately - I have been searching for new moisturizers and makeup for a couple of months.  </li>
            <li> There are not really any cons other than maybe my expectations were too high.  </li>
            <li> Not sure which ingredient is responsible for that.</li>
            <li> It does not take much and this product with the Daily Perfecting Lotion has cut my redness back by 50% at least.</li>
            <li> I also like that it seems to be pretty thick and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> They are very expensive however so I&#x27;m always on the look-out for cheaper and equally effective products.</li>
            <li> I continue to use it because it is a good moisturizer, but I am disappointed about the lack of effect it has on the redness.</li>
            <li> My skin is easily irritated and breaks out in a heart beat with the wrong product.</li>
            <li> I use it during the day because I have such dry skin.</li>
            <li> I no longer purchase the others, and this product line is impossible to find in stores now, but I like to keep this night creme handy in case of a rosacea outbreak.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my dermatologist to cure my dry skin that I started developing all of a sudden.</li>
            <li> It definitely works for my dry patches by mouth and chin.  </li>
            <li> Hi everybody,&lt;br /&gt;I have been dealing with dry, red skin over 2 years.</li>
            <li> but I noticed an improvement on several patches of red or rough skin on my face.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly, actually, feels soft and creamy from its little tub, goes a long way, and has no cloying fragrance to boot.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, sensitive, blemish prone skin due to severe environmental allergies.</li>
            <li> After 2 days, I could definitely tell a difference in the redness and irritation which is worse right out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream both in the morning and at night for the past week, and I do definitely seem to be noticing that not only is my face much softer, but it also appears less dry, irritated and red.</li>
            <li> The break out and black heads that appeared overnight were far too alarming and atypical for me.</li>
            <li> It works a little bit doesnt clear the redness 100%</li>
            <li> Within a few days I was all clear.</li>
            <li> It didnt take long: about 3 minutes</li>
            <li> It seemed a long shot, but I had to try it if there was a chance.    </li>
            <li> I would consider it a minor rash.</li>
            <li> Shipment received as expected in proper packaging.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had rosy checks for a long time, and I think I&#x27;m getting some rosacea</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t going to make dilated blood vessels, ie long term damage disappear.</li>
            <li> This cream moisturizes well with just a dab, so a jar lasts a long time too.    </li>
            <li> My skin has always been red around my nose - I, not very affectionately, call it my &#x27;muzzle.&#x27;</li>
            <li> I suffer from Rosacea &amp; minor redness</li>
            <li> This stuff goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> so it lasts a long time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Items received earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Works well on my minor redness.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t thick or greasy at all, and really reduces the redness like it says.</li>
            <li> For anyone looking for redness relief, it might be worth a try - worse case, it ends up being just a moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li> I definitely wouldn&#x27;t replace a prescription for rosacea with this as other reviewers were saying</li>
            <li> Other times I just put it on before bed if I showered earlier.</li>
            <li> Recently the bumps have become extreme, and after doing some reading, I realized what I was dealing with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half Irish, and have very dry skin, especially during the winter).</li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend this cream to anyone that has either very dry skin and/or also suffers from a red complexion/mild rosacea.</li>
            <li> Every winter my forehead becomes dry and flaky, and every year I search for a night cream that will end the flakes.  </li>
            <li> Provides relief from my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Like I said, no redness reduction for me, but if you suffer from chronic dry skin (and rosacea)</li>
            <li> I use this cream every night after I wash my face and it helps with my dry skin.</li>
            <li> or I get painfully dry skin.</li>
            <li> Has worked well for my dry skin-</li>
            <li> I noticed that the creme makes my eyes kinda dry??</li>
            <li> I started looking around for a night cream that would relieve my winter dry skin as well as the redness.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have redness that needed relief - just dry skin.</li>
            <li> It does not look dry flaky and vile.</li>
            <li> In addition to redness I have dry skin.</li>
            <li> Since I have dry skin</li>
            <li> I like it for dry elbows and my dry feet when I&#x27;m wearing the bootie socks.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on more expensive creams.</li>
            <li> Ever since I used this I seemed to be getting no new pimples or anything.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost odd seeing my entire face one even tone after having the redness there for so long.</li>
            <li> I mean, I haven&#x27;t gone outside without 50 SPF block and full body coverage plus wide brimmed hat for at least a decade.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m not a normal user.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always difficult to tell whether any of the glowing reviews for cosmetics are actually true.</li>
            <li> I started using this cream in February 2015, when my area was in the midst of a very dry and snowy spell, and my skin was really dry.  </li>
            <li> My skin has calmed down a bit but no big difference in the redness.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that the redness has gone down a lot and all are left</li>
            <li> My kid has a few red spots on his back after swimming and the other ointments didn&#x27;t help, but this worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> I thought that it was a feature of the cream to &amp;#34;tingle,&amp;#34; but switching back to my usual night cream removed the redness the next night (and with no tingle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Appears to be helping my facial skin and making it less agitated</li>
            <li> My skin is only slightly red/pink on the cheeks and it still didn&#x27;t have an effect.</li>
            <li> and I was hoping this would make my face less red</li>
            <li> My cheeks are so dry there are rough scaly patches on them, so I use this AM &amp; PM.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this product and saw a turn around less than a month.  </li>
            <li> I am noticing less red.</li>
            <li> The main problem I have is the upper part of my cheeks (under my eyes about an inch or two and about an inch off each side of my nose, but my nose is never red, so it&#x27;s weird)</li>
            <li> and so they will get different results, and hardly anyone actually tells you how long they used it and how they are using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different creams over the past few years to try to lessen the redness that I&#x27;ve developed in my complexion.</li>
            <li> I find it a little bit too thick and don&#x27;t like the green tint but was delivered quickly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few nights and my face is already noticeably less red during the day!</li>
            <li> Im a little dissapointed, but everyone is different</li>
            <li> I can see this one little jar lasting me a couple of months.</li>
            <li> If my skin is extra irritated, by the end of the day, this cream will sting a little after washing with the Eucerin Redness Relief face wash.</li>
            <li> and it works extremely well for my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I found this product to be no more or no less than any other night creme</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t great, but it isn&#x27;t horrible.</li>
            <li> I bought this product from amazon.com because is harder and harder to find it at my pharmacy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lady that everyone knows for her pink complexion.</li>
            <li> Product was what I expected.</li>
            <li> I have facial redness, it looks like I have a sunburn all year round.  </li>
            <li> Careful is you have any sort of sensitiveness with your skin.</li>
            <li> I really do not see a difference in  the redness of my skin from this product.</li>
            <li> I think the thickness and greasiness of the cream actually irritated my skin and trapped heat in my face.</li>
            <li> Has softened rough patchy skin areas .</li>
            <li> feeling like my face has gotten all oily like other heavier creams have done, and the small amount that i use in any other product would leave my skin feeling parched, but even the cleanser leaves my skin feeling soft and balanced before I put this on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been battling redness in the cheek area now for about 2 years, and believe it to be rosacea but am not positive.</li>
            <li> It is raw red and itchy.</li>
            <li> I found that sleeping with a humidifier in the room has also helped my skin to be less dry and reddish.</li>
            <li> My rosacea has suddenly gotten a lot worse, so I needed something to help soothe the dry, red, breakouts on the apples of my cheeks and across my nose.  </li>
            <li> (Dumb, but I can only make hubby do so much) and never burns (at least visibly) noticed his nose is getting bumpy and bulbous.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t greasy and a little went a long way.</li>
            <li> but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The morning after I used it my redness had almost completely vanished and all that was left behind was a little bit of flaky skin.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve just resorted to using it on other areas of my skin for dryness.</li>
            <li> Overall I ended up being allergic to this type of product, not sure from what or why</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m seeing results - this after months of trying all sorts of other remedies.</li>
            <li> Since then I&#x27;ve purchased the other products in this line and like them so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Anyone have any other over-the-counter recommendations?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do use it on my neck and  other areas; but not my face</li>
            <li> It says night creme, but I use a small bit as a daily moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Soothing and has not caused allergic or other irritation.</li>
            <li> I needed something to relief the itching I was experiencing at night due to my rosacea.  </li>
            <li> I am also not a huge fan of the way it smells and how long it takes to absorb.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way</li>
            <li> I used to break out since I had a little bit of dry skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very heavy facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have over active oil glands</li>
            <li> Anyway, when I wear a shirt and it fits me snug in these areas, or if I wear a heavy jacket that causes my shirts to press firmly against my skin, I always get red blotches on my skin around my neck and collar bones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a little Rosacea and very dry, flaky skin.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it has made a difference with redness but at least it&#x27;s not worse from a harsh product.</li>
            <li> but , other then that its not worth buying at all...</li>
            <li> It is a little greasy though so be careful not to let it get in your eyes.</li>
            <li> I suffer from some pretty bad rosacea, which gets worse in hot weather or when I sweat.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried very expensive face creams, Vaseline (after an flight attendant told me it is what she used), increased humidity - a lot of different things.  </li>
            <li> My wife has actually been using this lately instead of her $60 night creams.</li>
            <li> (duh), on my forehead, cheeks, and nose with tiny scaly bumps localized on my forehead.  </li>
            <li> The only negative for me</li>
            <li> the cream itself is not super heavy, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I saw my redness goes down gradually.</li>
            <li> so what a let down.</li>
            <li> Saw results in a little over a week using this and other Eurcerin Redness Relief products.</li>
            <li> No more dry skin.  </li>
            <li> used this product for months with no results, dont waste your money had no effect in redness or any other skin issue.</li>
            <li> As a guy, it seems a little weird to put lotion on my face at night, but this really reduces the redness from rosacea.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad it cost so much for so little</li>
            <li> I do not own a single other skincare product that works as well as this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been less than 1 week</li>
            <li> Some are fake, some people have wildly different expectations and wants/needs from a product, people have very different skin</li>
            <li> I have to use it everyday but at least my face isn&#x27;t red anymore.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m 30 and have had this for at least 15 years) where my face and nose turn red periodically throughout the day for a few hours.</li>
            <li> in a matter of weeks the redness that I have had since i was a child got less and less noticable</li>
            <li> This can be a serious condition AND the treatment is simple so please check it out!  </li>
            <li> are the subtle veins on my upper cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Less redness and burning.</li>
            <li> The only improvement would be if the container could be less delicate and less heavy.</li>
            <li> This product has slightly reduced redness.</li>
            <li> I had a bad experience with this particular cream ( and I use EUCERIN creams regularly ).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not to say I haven&#x27;t been disappointed by high priced luxury items, but generally they don&#x27;t make my face burn.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m currently using a sulfa wash daily which for a while almost completely cleared it up, but here lately, it&#x27;s been bad</li>
            <li> A little goes a ling way.</li>
            <li> you know, if you rub your face, it will roll up into little flecks and balls.</li>
            <li> This little baby helped me out for years when nothing else would.</li>
            <li> I did a little research and found this product.</li>
            <li> It also helps the redness a little.</li>
            <li> A little greasy too on my face too.</li>
            <li> It will soothe your rosacea a little and reduce the redness a little.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little greasy</li>
            <li> It may be a little oily fro some people, but thankfully I don&#x27;t mind it, since I use it overnight</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say is my hands feel a little sticky after applying to my face even if I&#x27;ve rubbed whatever was on my hands together feels sticky.</li>
            <li> I have a super red face all the time, and get very frustrated when I see photos of myself.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this cream due to the fantastic reviews, and I was not the least bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> drawbacks to this cream and the reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars, is it is a little greasy going on, and you need a few minutes to let it absorb.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any heavy smell and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll return with a follow up review in a few months.</li>
            <li> As it stands however, I found the cream to be too heavy for myself and</li>
            <li> I feel that I wasted my money</li>
            <li> I also puchased the day cream that has a green tint to it that is supposed to lessen the look of redness.</li>
            <li> I was on a low-carb diet for a few years and still had rosacea</li>
            <li> And I got tired of constantly being asked if I had been in the sun.  </li>
            <li> A few years ago I tried three of the Eucerin Redness Relief products (face wash, a green-tinted day cream, and this soothing night creme).</li>
            <li> I use it both day &amp; night without any trouble.</li>
            <li> The glass jar container is smal and quite heavy.</li>
            <li> I realized I reviewed the Redness Relief  SPF 15 green-tint lotion product but not this one, and since I use both I thought I should give a few words of support to this product too.  </li>
            <li> I use the night cream product all year round.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise the SPF 15 green tint product does the trick of protecting my face.  </li>
            <li> I found this cream to be too heavy for my face.  </li>
            <li> a bit heavy</li>
            <li> I only used it for a few days since the redness was getting worse, so in the trash it goes.  </li>
            <li> No more patches of dry thick skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched high and low for a cure for my red, raised, flaky, stinging, horrible Rosacea.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years to tame the redness and dryness and it works well.</li>
            <li> No more flaking whatsoever and a little redness relief.</li>
            <li> It is a lot less expensive than another product for curbing redness that I buy at the beauty counter of a local department store.</li>
            <li> so I always end up going back to dermatologist&#x27;s systems, but this works without causing irritation and is much less expensive.</li>
            <li> I have been plagued with very sensitive skin around my collar bones, and by my neck areas where the skin is very thin, or I mean where there is little fat underneath.</li>
            <li> It usually soothes inflamed skin within a few days, so I wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it.</li>
            <li> I would estimate within 24 hours of application the redness went down at least 90%.</li>
            <li> The dry cold winter usually gives me windburn, so I use this cream from November thru March to prevent those red blotches on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I live in Northeastern Ohio and the cold temps along with wind</li>
            <li> moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin type: dry, thin, atopic</li>
            <li> Aside of the drying eyes and funky smell (super cream neutral smell) a bit annoying, but goes away~</li>
            <li> In the winter, my face becomes red and irritated due to the dryness and cold.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not able to use it.</li>
            <li> This has been my routine for the past five years, and it works, so I&#x27;m sticking to it.</li>
            <li> do think the S/H on this seller is excessive.</li>
            <li> I need a product that would help with the sensitivity and excessive dryness.  </li>
            <li> Small bumps and redness.</li>
            <li> and the thing I don&#x27;t like is that when I usually apply a nightly face cream on, it will soak into my skin.</li>
            <li> I have small pores, so I can use the night creme without any breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get past the fact</li>
            <li> cuz i paid for it and ill use it for to get some extra moisture on my face</li>
            <li> I have been suffering/battling with some sort of skin irritation on my forehead for the past year.</li>
            <li> /&gt;a small amount every morning and evening</li>
            <li> Sorry to say it did not work for me, I also used  the facial wash there was 3 in package.</li>
            <li> It feels thick and moisturizing,not too heavy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been really frustrated with it and tried green primers and almost any other lotions out there short of visiting a dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> Less expensive than other creams.  </li>
            <li> tried this on a small section of my face that was a little red and it caused one of the WORST breakouts I have had in several years.</li>
            <li> It made my skin much worse, with pimples and angry red splotches that showed even through makeup.</li>
            <li> Or at least, it didn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> But you might want to at least try this, just in case this works for you too.  </li>
            <li> Lately over the winter my skin has been unbearable.</li>
            <li> I had rosacea for at least 10 years on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> in fact, I&#x27;m terrible and almost never moisturize my face either, but my skin looks fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Having rosacea sucks.</li>
            <li> Having read the reviews here, I expected the perfecting lotion product to be difficult to spread.</li>
            <li> Spreads easily...not too thick.</li>
            <li> cause this stuff is thick</li>
            <li> And, when I say had I mean HAD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (it has gotten worse over the past year).</li>
            <li> I use every single night without fail!  </li>
            <li> Actually it was made in Poland , and Europe is known from banning a lot of bad chemicals .</li>
            <li> Made my face burn and still have bad effect almost 2 weeks later.</li>
            <li> My face was so bad it actually stung when I slathered it on.</li>
            <li> My skin became red and itchy, painfully so.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not, at least not for me!  </li>
            <li> but I still notice my face turns red and oily. :(</li>
            <li> It could be that my skin would be worse without this</li>
            <li> I got the worse the redness was getting.</li>
            <li> Every time I&#x27;ve tried using this creme to help with my rosacea, I wake up and my face is broken out and irritated.</li>
            <li> Product didn&#x27;t help with redness at all, might of even made it worse.</li>
            <li> NO work, and redness worse.</li>
            <li> new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a guy, and I stand behind this product and the Soothing cleanser.</li>
            <li> In fact, the cream seemed to make things a bit worse.</li>
            <li> After growing tired of it, I tried this product and could not be happier.</li>
            <li> I started noticing my rosacea getting worse</li>
            <li> Made rosacea symptoms worse.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s broken when I received it</li>
            <li> I bought this to help with broken capillaries, but it broke me out.  </li>
            <li> , it just made my skin worse and carried a hefty price tag.</li>
            <li> I tried for a month and was looking worse</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have bad smell like other creams , and it&#x27;s not made in China</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years, especially in the summertime when I am usually always barefoot - so have horrible cracked skin on my feet.  </li>
            <li> It cleared up my bad rosacea in a few days.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, because nothing else had worked for me and my condition was getting worse and worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This unfortunately made my rosacea worse over time.</li>
            <li> Works where doctors expensive cream did not.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it clogs my pores as well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect</li>
            <li> Mediocre results for eczema...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it has been as red as it was before on my worst</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the heck would cause that, but unfortunately this product is not for me.  </li>
            <li> Cant go wrong getting this one.</li>
            <li> Within six hours, I knew something was wrong.</li>
            <li> Expensive</li>
            <li> Unfortunately didn&#x27;t work for my Rosacea.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea especially on the cheeks and the worst on the nose where I have redness&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> Works as well as some of the really expensive brands.</li>
            <li> So sad.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed and fell down for this false advertising.</li>
            <li> I hate thick, fragranced creams, so finding this was a relief.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to anyone that suffers from rosacea like symptoms.</li>
            <li> I was desperate to find something</li>
            <li> Broke out horribly and face looked raw.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea, so it has been very difficult to find lotion that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Very DIFFICULT to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> I had a bad allergic reaction</li>
            <li> On a bad day, I&#x27;ve had a couple coworkers ask if I had been exercising.</li>
            <li> I had a really bad allergic reaction from using this product.</li>
            <li> I think the locorice root could trigger a really bad allergic reaction so beware.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a bad case.</li>
            <li> Every time I buy a drugstore product hoping for a bargain, I&#x27;m disappointed.  </li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been faithful about using it :(...  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very very very unhappy.</li>
            <li> I hate rosacea.</li>
            <li> My face was so bad it felt like I was sticking it in boiling water!</li>
            <li> are totally brutal.</li>
            <li> Well this lotion is definitively the worst I have ever tried in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> attempted 3 times to apply it on my skin and each time after about 20 minutes it started causing a terrible redness and burning in the eyes (I had not put it around the eyes though).</li>
            <li> Horrible burned my face and my eyes.</li>
            <li> Not a cream, but shockingly moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Our terrible nutrition is what causes rosacea, not a lack of a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I had horrible rocacea and tried a million products.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been happy and satisfied of Eucerine.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea, so it has been very difficult to find lotion that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I didn&#x27;t try this sooner because I was put off by the price. It feels very good going on and does not cause irritation. It seems to leave a film on my skin, so I would only use this at bedtime.  I have not seen a difference in the overall redness of my skin, but it has really helped with hydration and does not sting. I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from increasingly sensitive skin lately - I have been searching for new moisturizers and makeup for a couple of months.  I replaced my daily moisturizer with this and my face cleared up within 3 days and is now silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I really like most of the Eucerin product as they don&#x27;t add fragrance and they work really well on my skin.  My face is rather sensitive and often reacts to facial cream with added fragrance.  I&#x27;ve never had a problem with any of the Eucerin products, including this one.  Another good thing about this night cream is that it is not greasy at all - it soaks into the skin very well.</li>
            <li> I had very high hopes for this creme.  I am a huge fan of Aquaphor and figured that anything else form Eucerin would be similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I suffer from some pretty bad rosacea, which gets worse in hot weather or when I sweat.  This cream caused immediate burning and redness on my skin after using.  It didnt take long: about 3 minutes and it was readilly apparent.  I thought that it was a feature of the cream to &amp;#34;tingle,&amp;#34; but switching back to my usual night cream removed the redness the next night (and with no tingle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, this does not provide any meaningful moisturizing benefit, at least for me.  I started using this cream in February 2015, when my area was in the midst of a very dry and snowy spell, and my skin was really dry.  This cream didnt abate this at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest moving on and looking for an alternative.</li>
            <li> Instant help for my face that sufferers irritation and red spots.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite nighttime lotion that I have ever used, and the low price makes it even more awesome. It is light, unscented, easy to apply, makes my skin feel great, and lasts a very long time. However, I just couldn&#x27;t give it five stars because even though I love the way it makes my skin feel, I haven&#x27;t seen any reduction in the redness on my face after several months of using it. I bought both the night and the day &amp;#34;redness relief&amp;#34; cream because I have rosacea which makes my cheeks and nose very red, especially in the winter. I will keep using it unless I find a product that actually dose reduce redness for me, since I love pretty much everything else about it. Based on the reviews here it looks like this does work for some people, so I would highly recommend giving it a shot. Even if it doesn&#x27;t reduce redness for you it is still a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> No difference so save your cash and see your dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Eh. Other topical so work better.</li>
            <li> This product smooths in easily and, over time, reduces the dry irritation and redness I normally have, leaving my skin feeling soft and supple. I have added the entire line including the scrub and daytime lotion, and love all the products in the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much better results than the more expensive brands I normally use. And the price here is great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product every night for about 2 months now, and recently started using the day creme as well. A little bit of this really does go a long way as it feels good on your face and goes on smooth, however, I don&#x27;t see a significant change in the redness. I&#x27;ve been battling redness in the cheek area now for about 2 years, and believe it to be rosacea but am not positive. It could be that my skin would be worse without this but it is not the miracle cream others have noted.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea, so when a product came along that promised to reduce redness on my face, I had to try it!    Redness is often caused by blood vessels beneath the surface of the skin that become enlarged or whatever. It seemed a long shot, but I had to try it if there was a chance.    I took \\&quot;before and after\\&quot; photos of my cheeks so I could check if this product was really working for me. It was obvious after 3 and 4 weeks there was no change.</li>
            <li> useful，and more cheaper</li>
            <li> My rosacea has suddenly gotten a lot worse, so I needed something to help soothe the dry, red, breakouts on the apples of my cheeks and across my nose.  This cream really does seem to soothe the irritation, and smooth my skin.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough or frequently enough to say it&#x27;s healing the condition, but, regardless, it&#x27;s a good moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t give me acne breakout on other parts of my face.</li>
            <li> Works great on my dry skin during the winter time. Does not feel super greasy and has a clean almost no scent smell. A small dab of this can cover most of your face.</li>
            <li> I really wish I had taken some \\&quot;before\\&quot; photos that I could upload. Most of my face really isn&#x27;t red. The main problem I have is the upper part of my cheeks (under my eyes about an inch or two and about an inch off each side of my nose, but my nose is never red, so it&#x27;s weird) it almost seemed like a constant rash and has been red for as long as I can remember.I tried acne creams and facial scrubs but all to no avail. It never broke out, and wasn&#x27;t really all that bumpy. Maybe a very mild rosacea? I don&#x27;t know.     I bought this cream last night, and today, no redness. It&#x27;s almost odd seeing my entire face one even tone after having the redness there for so long. Last night was my first use, so I have no idea how long the effects from each treatment with the cream will last last. I bought the cream at a rite-aid for about 11 bucks and judging by how much I used last night, even if I have to use it every night, that jar should last me well over a month maybe even two. Obviously people with more red areas in their face will need to use a bit more cream.        The cream goes on smooth, has a slight cooling feel, and after about a minute, you can&#x27;t tell its there. It&#x27;s not heavy or oily, and I didn&#x27;t notice any scent from it.     If you have redness in your face, you really should try this cream.</li>
            <li> Every winter my forehead becomes dry and flaky, and every year I search for a night cream that will end the flakes.  I&#x27;ve tried very expensive face creams, Vaseline (after an flight attendant told me it is what she used), increased humidity - a lot of different things.  I also have very sensitive skin, so finding a product that would not irritate my skin is also important.  After reading reviews about this product I decided to give it a try and have been amazed by how quickly it worked - no more flakes!  The cream is light and does not feel greasy, nor does it have a strong scent.  The only thing that I find distracting about the product is the color.  It&#x27;s an antique white, and against the pure whiteness of the jar - it always surprises me and makes me think it is off, but that&#x27;s just a quirk on my part.  :-)</li>
            <li> I finally found something that actually reduced the redness on my face! I don&#x27;t have doctor diagnosed rosacea but I had pronounced redness on my cheeks for years. After my 4th pregnancy and the further into my 30&#x27;s I got the worse the redness was getting. This product did not get rid of it all together but reduced it by I would say about 80-90% which is great in my book since nothing else worked at all for me. I noticed results after just one use and it just got better and better. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now. I didn&#x27;t notice any heavy smell and the cream itself is not super heavy, but a little goes a long way. I use this cream every night and use Aveeno Ultra-Calming Daily Mousturizer with SPF during the day. I would recommend this product to anyone with bothersome redness. I know everybody&#x27;s skin is different but this stuff really worked for me!</li>
            <li> OK moisturizer, didn&#x27;t reduce redness.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. My skin finally feels hydrated without being irrated. Not sure if it has made a difference with redness but at least it&#x27;s not worse from a harsh product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK. I didn&#x27;t notice much redness relief from usage - and I have used the entire jar. I find that I need something more moisturizing, but it might work for some.</li>
            <li> works on the redness on the face. Works where doctors expensive cream did not. So pleased with it. . I order several at a time so I won&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> Works as described and I actually saw results within a month of even occasional use.  Did buy again.</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTEY LOVE IT     WHAT IS PRICE AGAIN MAY ORDER MORE.</li>
            <li> Did not help my redness any. Moisturizing but ineffective for rosacea.</li>
            <li> Well this lotion is definitively the worst I have ever tried in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I attempted 3 times to apply it on my skin and each time after about 20 minutes it started causing a terrible redness and burning in the eyes (I had not put it around the eyes though). This is certainly limited to MY OWN skin, so this reaction should be taken as a rare exception. The weird thing is that I tried probably hundreds of lotions of any types in my life, even some very cheap made in china ones, and this is the very fist that causes me such a reaction. Not sure which ingredient is responsible for that. Or maybe the product was very old (I bought it on Ebay from an overstock seller).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also very oily, it does not look like it absorbs well and you might find your pillow oily too if you apply it just before bed.</li>
            <li> This is the second review. I do not think it is necessary to have to this type of emails. We do use Amazon on occasion bu this is too much. The Eucerin is a good product. My wife needs this product, but can not find it where we live. The delivery was good and she is happy.</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> Provides relief from my dry skin. I notice less redness as well but the moisturizing aspect works great.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel soft.</li>
            <li> I do love the Eucerin Redness Relief Soothing Night Crème. It&#x27;s not greasy, rather light, goes on smoothly and evenly and the moisture lasts.</li>
            <li> seems to hydrate quite well. I can see no real signs that my facial redness has decreased, but I am very fair and have always had red cheeks. Maybe nothing will change that. But the creme works well in hydrating my skin.</li>
            <li> My face had been red and irritated for over a year and I tried so many different creams. Nothing seemed to help,but this stuff is so gentle and soothing. I love it. The redness is gone and my face doesnt hurt anymore.</li>
            <li> Every time I&#x27;ve tried using this creme to help with my rosacea, I wake up and my face is broken out and irritated. So I&#x27;ve just resorted to using it on other areas of my skin for dryness. I&#x27;ve even tried to use it in combination with the redness relief facial cleanser. Nothing helps.</li>
            <li> made a fan of me, that;s for sure&lt;br /&gt;huge difference in my skin tone and clarity..and not greasy and no odor...it&#x27;s fantastic !</li>
            <li> I purchased this cream about 3 weeks ago. I have very dry, sensitive, blemish prone skin due to severe environmental allergies. My skin is easily irritated and breaks out in a heart beat with the wrong product. This cream is very moisturizing and calming. I wish it came in a bottle, rather than the jar. If not for the packaging, I&#x27;d have given this 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and this did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> Product is working all ready. In the first 2 days which is awesome. I have very red cheeks for some reason, not rosacea, think it has something to do with age. I would highly recommend ALL Eucerin products for red skin. I use the whole regimen from cleanser to day cream. A miracle. Great packaging and very timely delivery. Will be ordering again when I run out! Thank you!</li>
            <li> It leaves the face a little bit sticky, but it&#x27;s quite effective</li>
            <li> I have t zone redness and sun damage.  I have moderate adult acne, mostly around my mouth and especially my chin.  I have very VERY fair (cannot find foundation) skin, and it&#x27;s pretty sensitive.  I use this at night because it&#x27;s fairly greasy, or during the days I get to stay home without makeup.  After a week I noticed a change, I primarily use it after a chemical peel now, it&#x27;s very soothing.</li>
            <li> This stuff does really work well for mild Rosacea. I noticed my redness almost completely fade overnight. Unfortunately, it clogs my pores as well so I&#x27;m not able to use it. If your skin doesn&#x27;t react badly to it, this is really a great product. Only wish my skin could handle it.</li>
            <li> Great price for the product!</li>
            <li> This product feels like your putting yogurt on your face; it is very creamy despite what the description says (although that might be because I&#x27;d used too much). Overall I ended up being allergic to this type of product, not sure from what or why but it ended up making my face more red, irritating, and itchy. So it&#x27;s just not my product.</li>
            <li> My wife keeps buying this stuff over the years.  It must work; she is gorgeous.  Another female mystery product found under the bathroom sink.</li>
            <li> Very good cream. I saw my redness goes down gradually.</li>
            <li> I had very minor rosacea on my nose and to the left and right of my nose, almost like minor sunburn all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a lot of luck with Eucerin&#x27;s Aquaphor product, so gave this a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used it for three nights in a row, redness is gone and I could not be happier!</li>
            <li> I bought this a week after I started using the Eucerin cleanser and moisturizer for redness relief, and wow, what a difference!  I&#x27;ve been using the cleanser and moisturizer for 3 weeks, and the night crème for 2 weeks, and the redness is almost completely gone and the bumps are going away.  This is a miracle crème.  I am very sorry for those of you who are allergic to it, because it has been wonderful.</li>
            <li> I do NOT have sensitive skin but this product made me break out, only worsening my mild redness !</li>
            <li> I would give this product 3 stars because it does not work as effectively as I thought it would in reducing redness on my face.</li>
            <li> This does feel very good on my face. It is a little greasy though so be careful not to let it get in your eyes.</li>
            <li> I have been using this line of products for around a year.  I have mild rosacea and I now barely have any red on my face.  Not only does it work but, it&#x27;s a great price too!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t try anything else now that I have found this (and I&#x27;ve tried A LOT!). This has really reduced the redness on my face, and since my skin is on the dry side, I use it day and night. I am very happy with this product. I also use the cleanser. I tried the day cream and not so much on that one.</li>
            <li> Eucerin Redness Relief Soothing Night Creme not only does not work, but it burns my face! I do not recommend this product to anyone who has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The absolute best cream I have encountered for redness relief, used both during the day and at night. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I never had acne problems as a teen or young adult, but now as a \\&quot;mature\\&quot; woman I find myself with pimples, bumps and redness on my cheeks and forehead. I read about this product from a Squidoo lens written by an actual user, so I gave it a try. I&#x27;ve been using this creme plus a companion cleanser for redness reduction and they appear to be working. It&#x27;s been less than 1 week and I&#x27;m seeing results - this after months of trying all sorts of other remedies. I recommend this if you have the beginnings of rosacea and want to try a natural solution before medications. I&#x27;ll return with a follow up review in a few months.</li>
            <li> Takes a while but seems to be working</li>
            <li> This product arrived promptly.  I used this product daily along with the lotion for 3 months.  I experienced no change in my facial redness at all.  I have the kind of rosacea that just makes the skin bright red all the time, but I have not been diagnosed by a doctor so I can&#x27;t blame the product.  I felt that this product had to soak in for 15 minutes before going to bed as it smears off on your pillow otherwise.</li>
            <li> Eucerin&#x27;s redness relief night creme, third in the redness relief lineup, is a light oil-free gel-creme that claims to be non-irritating despite the company&#x27;s use of parabens which can potentially irritate sensitive skin. Granted the parabens are almost last on the list of ingredients, but the issue remains. Personally, I did not see any redness reduction and found the cream to be too heavy for my post-accutane skin that is slowly but surely returning to normal after a raw red dry spell. I wish I had known about this product sooner. I suspect that during my course this product would have been perfect. As it stands however, I found the cream to be too heavy for myself and probably anyone with normal, combination, or oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, the consistency is silky smooth and while the night creme does feel &#x27;heavy&#x27;, it does not feel the slightest bit greasy. Like I said, no redness reduction for me, but if you suffer from chronic dry skin (and rosacea) I&#x27;m pretty confident you&#x27;ll benefit from this product.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful for anyone with rosacea.  I don&#x27;t know why I couldn&#x27;t find it at any drug stores or stores that sell it.  They used to.  So I ordered from you.  They sent me the cleanser at first and I had to return it and FINALLY I was sent the right item.  I will order it in the future and hope I get it on time, the next time.</li>
            <li> fast shipping, Lovely cream</li>
            <li> Whatever is in this jar soothes my rosacea,</li>
            <li> I like the way the cream feels nice and light, however, that being said, it did absolutely nothing for redness.</li>
            <li> Calms redness. Feels good, not greasy. A pleasure to use! Think I would prefer it in a tube - for cleanliness, other than that it&#x27;s great. A little goes a ling way.</li>
            <li> My dermonlist gave me a sample and I liked the results so ordered a regular size jar. It&#x27;s not perfect but I noticed an improvement on several patches of red or rough skin on my face. Better than skin lotion.</li>
            <li> Awesome product for redness, sensitive skin, rosacea. Very soothing and calming to the skin you will be happy you tried it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t attest to how it works yet but it makes your skin really soft and smells good.</li>
            <li> Have a try on this. Hope it really works for redness.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years!  Day and night, and I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> this creme is very good!  Mark V.</li>
            <li> Been using for 2 weeks and no change</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews, this product works really well for some with rosacea and redness, but it didn&#x27;t work for me. It made my skin much worse, with pimples and angry red splotches that showed even through makeup. Tried it for a week. Based on several internet searches, I&#x27;m now trying CeraVe moisturizing face lotion and it seems to be working well. The return process was very easy with Amazon.</li>
            <li> excellent product light feeling but give moisture and a super glow to your skin nice</li>
            <li> This product has really worked for me within days of use. It cleared longtime redness on nose and part of face. I am definitely going to purchase again and highly recommend it for roscacea.</li>
            <li> The dry cold winter usually gives me windburn, so I use this cream from November thru March to prevent those red blotches on my cheeks. This has been my routine for the past five years, and it works, so I&#x27;m sticking to it. (I also use the Eucerin Redness Relief face wash during the winter. I think the combo works really well together.)</li>
            <li> It is a very noce and moisturizing cream. owever, it did nothing for any redness that I have.</li>
            <li> ONLY HAD CHANCE TO USE A COUPLE OF TIMES AS JUST RECIEVED BUT SO FAR IT IS GREAT</li>
            <li> Moisturizers very well.  But didn&#x27;t help my rosacea.</li>
            <li> The cream seems to be very helpful so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy that I can use this product having rosasea, and not have a skin reaction, it&#x27;s hard to find creams that my skin can stand.</li>
            <li> Although I believe diet plays the biggest role in addressing skin issues, this cream has been AMAZING at keeping redness at bay. I do not own a single other skincare product that works as well as this. It is extremely lightweight and gentle and goes on very easy. I would recommend to anyone that suffers from rosacea like symptoms. It does have parabens but the amount that is needed is so insignificant that it was well worth me to step away from &#x27;all natural&#x27; cremes for this product.</li>
            <li> Thank you , It did a great job. When this runs near out  I will be back in touch. Thanks again.</li>
            <li> Love it...cheaper than walmart</li>
            <li> Good lotion that lasts a long time</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and this cream, by far, beats anything I&#x27;ve used. I have had people comment on how good my skin looks. Even though it&#x27;s night cream, I use morning and night. It&#x27;s almost like a gel or pudding like. My skin feels so nourished and actually glowing from the moment I use it and all day. For the rosacea, i use the rosacea line by Zenmed which is truly awesome, but I won&#x27;t give up this moisturizer to try the Zenmed moisturizer. Why switch when I&#x27;ve got a good thing!</li>
            <li> This cream is awesome for my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> i will recommend any one have sensitive skin and red skin ,its give the skin smooth and baby face love it</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in hopes that I would get rid of some redness that I have obtained during pregnancy.  It did not. It just felt like this laid on top of my skin, and maybe even make the redness worse.  I usually love Eucerin products, but this one didn&#x27;t work for me at all.  I wasn&#x27;t able to return it to the store since it was opened, so I contacted the company Eucerin, and they gave me a refund.</li>
            <li> Excellent cream ... I use it regularly.</li>
            <li> Works great to take the redness out.</li>
            <li> While it hasn&#x27;t relieved much redness it does sooth the face without clogging pores.  Seems to last a while to as long as you don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li> Product didn&#x27;t help with redness at all, might of even made it worse. I feel that I wasted my money</li>
            <li> I bought this product from amazon.com because is harder and harder to find it at my pharmacy.  I heard it was discontinued which is really bad because this is an excellent product for skin redness.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as it was described , yes it helped a little but not as much as everyone made it out too be. I definitely wouldn&#x27;t replace a prescription for rosacea with this as other reviewers were saying</li>
            <li> Fine product at a very fair price.</li>
            <li> Horrible burned my face and my eyes. Gave my acne and also made my face itch so my face was even redder then before</li>
            <li> I have tried many items before for my mild redness on my face and nothing I have tried thus far worked. Gave this a try and did EXACTLY what it said and I am happy with the results. You cant find it everywhere but when you do I suggest you give it a try!</li>
            <li> This did NOT reduce my redness for rocesea, in fact it made it red and itch. However, I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because it was a great moisturizer for the rest of my face, and it moisturizes quite well. I used to break out since I had a little bit of dry skin. Ever since I used this I seemed to be getting no new pimples or anything.</li>
            <li> Not enough in the bottle. Mediocre results for eczema...I was hoping for the best with this cream, but too expensive for the results.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I really like Eucerin products and a number of reviewers said that it really helped with the redness from rosacea. I used it nightly for two weeks. Not only didn&#x27;t it do anything for the redness, the rosacea flared up because I was replacing one application of my prescription lotion in order to use it.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and I&#x27;ve been using Eucerin products for a while.  I am glad that I found it in Amazon so I can get it without going to the drugstore.  Most discount stores do not carry this line of products.  It is convenient that I can subscribe the scheduled delivery.</li>
            <li> This creme is fantastic for my rosacea. I&#x27;ve been using it for months and the results are excellent. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The Eucerin products that address redness have all been extremely helpful in controlling my rosacea, which is mild, but maybe they are helping keep it that way. Always happy with their products.</li>
            <li> I was just diagnosed with rosacea,and someone told me about the Eucerin Red Relief, I&#x27;ve used this for a few weeks and have had huge success!! I couldn&#x27;t find the product in my local drugstore, so I was super glad to get it on Amazon!!! I love all Eucerin products, not greasy, and most important, no smell!!! It feels so soothing on the face. My rosacea is not severe!</li>
            <li> 2 weeks,nothing changed.</li>
            <li> Every time I buy a drugstore product hoping for a bargain, I&#x27;m disappointed.  It&#x27;s not to say I haven&#x27;t been disappointed by high priced luxury items, but generally they don&#x27;t make my face burn.  This product is supposed to be specifically designed for sensitive and red skin but it still stings when I put it on, which is not what I&#x27;m going for especially in the winter.  I also got clogged pores and pimples using it, but my skin is very finicky.  If your skin is normal, I&#x27;d try it.  If it&#x27;s sensitive, I&#x27;d stay away.</li>
            <li> I love it , it works great !</li>
            <li> I found this product to be no more or no less than any other night creme and it doesn&#x27;t seem to correct &amp;#34;redness&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Mom says this stuff really moisturizes her skin and is soothing. She likes it the best of the 3, but she says it can build up with frequent use.</li>
            <li> I use it every evening and it really helps with Rosacea (in addition to medical creams) Great long term results.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It is perfect for dry, sensitive skin.  I have tried more expensive creams, but I always come back to Eucerin.</li>
            <li> Very good product for very dry skin</li>
            <li> You your kids or someone close, suffering from eczema? Buy this.</li>
            <li> I am 58 years old. After 5 weeks of using this wonderful cream, I met up with a friend from high school who complimented me on how young I look!</li>
            <li> NO work, and redness worse.</li>
            <li> I love this for my nightly moisturizing routine because it is light and odorless. I suffer from acne rosacea and this product helps me to keep my complexion free of blemishes and redness. It also has a great price compared to the products I used to purchase from my dermatologist, which were very expensive.</li>
            <li> I have chronic dermatitis/eczema issues, notably on my cheeks and bridge of nose. I keep this cream not for night use (I have my Kinerase Ultimate for that), but for use after plucking/exfoliating/depilating my face. (Yes, middle-age means more hair removal for face, dangit!). It works very nicely to moisturize and soothe after any sort of facial attention (whether it&#x27;s plucking, shaving, exfoliating, or removing a whitehead/pimple).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does \\&quot;pill\\&quot;, though--you know, if you rub your face, it will roll up into little flecks and balls. So, this is a cream you apply gently and leave alone. Don&#x27;t fuss. Hence, yeah, a night cream. :) But if you need some extra-soothing after facial treatments of any sort, this is very useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think the S/H on this seller is excessive. Hopefully, amazon will carry it with prime to make it simpler and cheaper to get this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Soothing Night Creme as well as the Redness Relief Daily Perfecting Lotion for over a month and I&#x27;m very happy with my results.  They make a great pair!  I have very fair, sensitive dry skin that is VERY cool-toned, which brings a lot of pink into my skin especially on my cheeks.  I need a product that would help with the sensitivity and excessive dryness.  So far, I can see a difference in the texture and tone of my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product from ULTA originally, but see that Amazon has a much better price!  I have a full review &amp; video on my blog if you&#x27;d like to hear more about my thoughts on this product:  http://www.richelleloveslife.com/2015/05/dealing-with-redness-my-skincare.html  I hope these products help you they way they helped me!</li>
            <li> Good product at a reasonable price I find it a little bit too thick and don&#x27;t like the green tint but was delivered quickly</li>
            <li> I take several prescription meds which cause rashes to appear on my face and body. Some of these rashes are pretty severe w/dry, flaky skin. Eucerin worked great in treating these rashes. I rub a little in the affected area at night and the next morning the flakiness is gone and the redness is greatly reduced, if not gone. I&#x27;ve tried lotions like Keri &amp; Vaseline but they can&#x27;t compare. Eucerin is more expensive but for those stubborn, more severe rashes it&#x27;s probably your best bet.</li>
            <li> Every time I apply it on my face,  it made my skin more red.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched high and low for a cure for my red, raised, flaky, stinging, horrible Rosacea. I did find a product which is called \\&quot;Control Cream\\&quot;. This little baby helped me out for years when nothing else would. I recently lost my last container of it and found out the company changed the formula and then pulled the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I did a little research and found this product. I was skeptical, because nothing else had worked for me and my condition was getting worse and worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First day I applied this I noticed my flaky skin stopped pealing. I was amazed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Note** I used this product in conjunction with \\&quot;Eucerin redness relief soothing facial cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The night cream did burn a little, but after only four days, my skin was beyond back to normal. I was completely healed and my skin felt soft and brand new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a guy, and I stand behind this product and the Soothing cleanser.</li>
            <li> I usually do not post reviews, but this product was just so amazing I wanted to tell everyone who is wondering how good this may be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have atopic skin and have been always having red sensitive and irritated skin for YEARS. I tried anything and everything from over the counter skin treatment to prescription and name brand products. Some did work somewhat but never did as good as I expected... but this Eucerin redness relief, oh my gosh this is like a miracle!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only used the night cream to begin with, about a pea size on my face. The next morning, my face was noticeably even toned. The next day, even better, and better and better. Now I use the day cream too, and it is healing up my face like a brand new me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are debating on this item, I suggest you to give it a try!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used for a short time, but it did take away the itching and the dryness. I still have the redness.</li>
            <li> But it didn&#x27;t work for me. I already had some type of topical dermititus on m face....I would consider it a minor rash. Small bumps and redness. Just tried applying a small amount of this night cream to the entire face after cleansing and drying, and a few hours later I have a deeper flare up of more pronounced bumps and more redness. I just washed the cream off with some oatmeal cleanser and I felt an immediate cooling and calming of my skin. :( I had hope this product would work but it actually worsened my condition.</li>
            <li> It felt great on my skin and I used it every night. It did make my rosacea &#x27;feel&#x27; better but did nothing for the redness.</li>
            <li> I was glad to be able to find this again!</li>
            <li> not helping the redness so much.</li>
            <li> I have been having some redness for about a month or so and no matter what lotions or cremes i got. This creme is great it helped the first night i put it on. I do recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I use my prescription cream morning and night for my rosacea and, when it dries, I put the Eucerin edness relief soothing night creme on my face.  It&#x27;s just okay and the thing I don&#x27;t like is that when I usually apply a nightly face cream on, it will soak into my skin. The Eucerin does not soak in, and my face feels oily all night.</li>
            <li> I use this cream every night after I wash my face and it helps with my dry skin. I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference in terms of the redness of my skin, though, so you probably can find a different product that costs less that will do the same job.</li>
            <li> Wife uses it for two weeks and had no side effects. Her rash simply disappeared before the second week but she continued to use it for a few more day, &amp;#34;Just to be sure&amp;#34; she said. My kid has a few red spots on his back after swimming and the other ointments didn&#x27;t help, but this worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> Good for dry and sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lady that everyone knows for her pink complexion. I don&#x27;t have an acne problem, but I do have this problem with my face that doctors think is rosacea or dermatitis or eczema but they just can never decide. Awesome. I also have to keep moisturized or I get painfully dry skin. I have been on the hunt for a long, long time for a lotion that will just keep the scalies and bright redness away, something worth it&#x27;s salt and not just glorified makeup. And because Eucerin cream does such a great job on my body, I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. It&#x27;s not heavy or oily, if you&#x27;ve ever had the baby oil-like experience of using the Eucerin cream, so don&#x27;t worry about that. It absorbs quickly, actually, feels soft and creamy from its little tub, goes a long way, and has no cloying fragrance to boot. And it works fine. It&#x27;s just that it hasn&#x27;t done any better of a job with my redness than any other half decent lotion, which is kind of it&#x27;s purpose, what with being called &#x27;Redness Relief&#x27; and all. I acknowledge that, for people with skin problems, some things work for some people and some things don&#x27;t. I&#x27;m not going to get offended because it wasn&#x27;t a cure-all. But, despite having used it for about a year now, I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in my redness, not even momentarily after I put it on. That being said, as a night cream, it&#x27;s a hell of a lot better than most of the powerfully fragrant, cosmetic stuff they push to us women. In the event that anyone reading this is on their own search for something that will work for them, I&#x27;ve had a really good experience with, of all brands, Wal-Mart&#x27;s Equate brand&#x27;s Ultra-Gentle Facial Moisturizer. Not a cream, but shockingly moisturizing. I&#x27;m also partial to Simple&#x27;s Replenishing Rich Moisturizer, which I picked up at Target and has a soothing effect I&#x27;ve found actually works. I&#x27;ve had so, so much improvement just by quitting face wash and keeping moisturized. Good luck!</li>
            <li> Shipment received as expected in proper packaging.  My skin does not react well to Eucerin products.</li>
            <li> I bought this with the redness relief daily lotion.  This turned out to be better for my dry skin than the lotion so I have been using this every morning and it works extremely well for my dry skin.  I have been using it for about 6 months now and it has not taken the redness away from my face; however it feels good on my face and works for the dry skin.</li>
            <li> Works for me. Agfordable substitute for PCA.perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It has helped redness in my skin so much. It is a great price compared to the prices in dept, stores&lt;br /&gt;for similar products. Feels smooth &amp; creamy upon application.</li>
            <li> Love this cream for the price!</li>
            <li> I have mild roseacea and very dry skin. This is a good product, but doesn&#x27;t help with redness. I use it during the day because I have such dry skin. It doesn&#x27;t relieve any redness but does keep my face moisturized for the day.</li>
            <li> I had a bad allergic reaction</li>
            <li> It works when I put it on, and seems to reduce redness on my skin, but you have to apply it all the time to keep your red skin clear. That makes sense, but in order to see the effects you need to be pretty disciplined in its application.</li>
            <li> Bought this product for my husband for his redness in his face. It is soothing and you can definitely tell the redness is minimized.</li>
            <li> Love this nighttime lotion. It doesn&#x27;t necessarily help with my redness but my skin is so smooth.</li>
            <li> I love this night cream. I have Rosacea and this cream is so soothing to my face without feeling oily or greasy after its applied.</li>
            <li> Lightweight! No fragrance! This face moisturizer is great. I have redness on my face and I&#x27;ve noticed that when I wale up my skin is calm and looks so refreshed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have rosacea but am an older woman with very dry skin.  Very fair, freckled, etc. so am very pleased with this product.  It is a clear, non greasy cream, which feels very moisturizing on my face.</li>
            <li> We have used this before and therefore this was a reorder. We are satisfied with it and plan to continue using it.</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely dry and sensitive. I use this product both at night and during the day.  It helps with the redness, and works well in the summer. In the winter, it doesn&#x27;t provide enough moisture.</li>
            <li> Appears to be helping my facial skin and making it less agitated</li>
            <li> Great cream for Rosacea sufferers.  Less expensive than other creams.  Will definitely continue to use.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on more expensive creams.</li>
            <li> Very helpful for rosacea.  A nice light nightime creme.  Like the ceramic jar it comes in. I dislike plastic containers</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s skin is different. So while I think this is a quality product, it doesn&#x27;t do much for my actual redness. I&#x27;ve actually found using pure aloe on my face in the morning and night has done the trick. I&#x27;ve also begun using unrefined coconut oil at bedtime but it&#x27;s too soon to tell how that&#x27;s working yet. So this may be a great moisturizing product, it didn&#x27;t reduce my redness much.</li>
            <li> Just recently realized that I have rosacea. I have always been prone to red skin but it was in the winter and summer and I always blamed it on the weather. For the first time I developed dry flaky skin, red bumps - some with tiny amounts of fluid. I do plan on going to see a dermatologist but needed something while I wait. This product brings so much relief, I literally want to soak my face in a huge tub of it. Instant relief, so soothing and cooling. The redness and bumps are fading away just after 3 days of application. I have been using it day and night.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always difficult to tell whether any of the glowing reviews for cosmetics are actually true. Some are fake, some people have wildly different expectations and wants/needs from a product, people have very different skin and so they will get different results, and hardly anyone actually tells you how long they used it and how they are using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had rosy checks for a long time, and I think I&#x27;m getting some rosacea (it has gotten worse over the past year). On a bad day, I&#x27;ve had a couple coworkers ask if I had been exercising. I&#x27;ve used this product now for about a month. I have skipped a day here and there, but I have been using it regularly (occasionally twice a day). I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m 50/50 on using this immediately after showering so that my face is clean. Other times I just put it on before bed if I showered earlier. Here are my thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I think this has slightly reduced the redness in my face, though I should have taken pictures to be absolutely sure. I don&#x27;t think it has been as red as it was before on my worst days.&lt;br /&gt;-While this is greasier than the Lubriderm cream I generally use, it doesn&#x27;t actually feel greasy and gross to me. It absorbs into my skin just fine and it feels nice.&lt;br /&gt;-No scent, which is great.&lt;br /&gt;-Price is cheap compared to other similar products, and since I only use it on my cheeks it will last a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue to use this, but I don&#x27;t know if I will purchase another bottle. I may look for something else. Anyone have recommendations?</li>
            <li> Tried this a few times as instructed, it cause my first acne &amp;#34;break out&amp;#34; in about 20 years.  I don&#x27;t know what the heck would cause that, but unfortunately this product is not for me.  The smell did not make it easy to fall asleep (it&#x27;s an evening cleanser).  It wasn&#x27;t super potent, but was enough to be noticeable and hard to ignore.  I&#x27;m willing to suggest that my skin type is just not compatible with this product.  The break out and black heads that appeared overnight were far too alarming and atypical for me.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and it helps to calm the redness.  I have used this product before and really like the way it works</li>
            <li> the product is ok, it is just bland, it has no smell or specific feeling on my face. It&#x27;s ok for using it as a night cream. But, i mean, you dont want to buy a kind of just mosturizing night cream, dont you?</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any difference after using this product. My skin is only slightly red/pink on the cheeks and it still didn&#x27;t have an effect.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t actually know whether it works or not.&lt;br /&gt;But my friend seems loves it.&lt;br /&gt;Hope she will find it working.</li>
            <li> Works well without greasy feel.</li>
            <li> A great product for anyone to use. It helps to keep the red out of my face. Use all of their products.</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t work on me😑</li>
            <li> It works a little bit doesnt clear the redness 100% but it clears it enough it makes a significant difference in what you want to be changed</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  While traveling back from a vacation, my skin started to get two decent size red patches on both cheeks. It looked like I had smeared two blobs of rouge on my face, and it stung. After several weeks it still hadn&#x27;t gone away, so I knew it was time to do something about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this cream due to the fantastic reviews, and I was not the least bit disappointed. The texture is light (if you use the correct amount, which is sparingly) and it is very soothing. The morning after I used it my redness had almost completely vanished and all that was left behind was a little bit of flaky skin. Since then I&#x27;ve purchased the other products in this line and like them so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My condition was most likely eczema due to some irritant or allergy. For those who say it didn&#x27;t help them, I wonder if they might have genetically red/rosy skin or some form of severe rosacea that needs medical attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try. It&#x27;s worth the $15.</li>
            <li> My son has KP on his face which causes some bumps and a lot of flushing redness. I have tried many products to help clear this condition, but like the others, this one did not work for him. I will keep searching.</li>
            <li> I have problems with facial redness, particularly around my nose. I started using this around 3 weeks ago and my skin is looking better. It&#x27;s still red, but has improved. Hopefully I&#x27;ll see more improvement. I also love how rich and moisturizing it is!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful cream! I put it on at night and it soothes right away. Can also be used during the day if necessary. It cleared up my bad rosacea in a few days. My face was so bad it felt like I was sticking it in boiling water! And now feels wonderful. During the day I use derma-ced redness redux. Highly recommend both.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, however I needed help in making the order. Glad you had phone assistance.</li>
            <li> So, obviously the name of the product should lead you to assume it will \\&quot;relieve redness.\\&quot;  It doesn&#x27;t. Or at least, it didn&#x27;t for me. I have eczema on my face and I was hoping this would make my face less red and it didn&#x27;t. In fact, the cream seemed to make things a bit worse. As for any positive aspects: it feels smooth going on, I suppose.  I only used it for a few days since the redness was getting worse, so in the trash it goes.  Hope it works for others.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a life safer. I have to use it everyday but at least my face isn&#x27;t red anymore.</li>
            <li> Works better for me than any other redness cream out there. I have tried many and more expensive. Clinique, zenmed, aveeno, simple, you name it. I use it inn  the morning and at night after a shower. No more flaking whatsoever and a little redness relief.</li>
            <li> The cream feels nice on skin. A little goes a very long way so I&#x27;ll be using this for the next year since it is a big pot. My skin has calmed down a bit but no big difference in the redness.</li>
            <li> I have EXTREMELY dry and sensitive skin. I was even suffering from windburn on my cheek. The first time I applied the cream it stung a bit and made my skin more read. However within the third day of use I saw a huge difference. The redness has reduced, my overall skin tone is more even and my skin is less dry. The best result of this cream is that the licorice root extract used to reduce redness has also minimized my dark under eye circles!</li>
            <li> Using this creme feels like having an angel&#x27;s satiny hands smooth away all the irritated, itchy redness while you sleep. It&#x27;s heavenly face butter. But really--I have suffered from rosacea for years and just recently started using this product. After a week, the bumpy redness was basically gone. And my face is finally happy.</li>
            <li> used this product for months with no results, dont waste your money had no effect in redness or any other skin issue.</li>
            <li> This is the wife&#x27;s go to night cream. Cant go wrong getting this one. And I need 6 more words to complete this review.</li>
            <li> I tried this after reading the reviews here hoping to help the redness from my Rosacea.  It left my skin greasy and made my face break out.  It did nothing for the redness.  I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought Eucerin Redness Relief after trying several products, including the more expensive ones.  I have a little Rosacea and very dry, flaky skin.  I love this product.  It soothes and moisturizes.  Even though it is a night cream, I used it during the day the first week and then started using it only at night. It is a rich, so if you use it during the day and wear makeup, wait a few minutes after putting on before applying makeup.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in hopes it would help with the redness caused by roseca but it doesn&#x27;t.    I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Product was what I expected. I am very satisfied with product and service received. Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Go ahead &amp; spend hundreds of dollars on wrinkle reducing night creams; I won&#x27;t because I have this product. And I&#x27;d bet the more expensive ones don&#x27;t even work as well.</li>
            <li> I have all the Redness Relief products and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!  I have used many expensive (Lancôme and other European brands) as well as not so expensive (Avon, Olay, etc) brands, but for my sensitive skin, Eucerin Redness Relief is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working. It is creamy, easy to apply and helps with the redness . A good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Bought it for someone else.  They use it all the time.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product! I have chronic facial redness (I&#x27;m 30 and have had this for at least 15 years) where my face and nose turn red periodically throughout the day for a few hours. After using this product the redness went away significantly!</li>
            <li> Love Love ALL EUCERIN products..they really do the job..NOTHING gets rid of wrinkles,  But EUCERIN keep skin Soft.</li>
            <li> I rarely give glowing reviews to anything, but I am thrilled with this product.  Already I can see a striking improvement in my years-long case of rosecea and I&#x27;ve only been using this product for four days.  Even if it never gets any better than what it is now, I will continue to use this product forever.  I went the drugstore today without wearing makeup, and the clerk there actually complimented me on my skin.  Yes, this really happened.  (And yes, my jaw dropped, because for years I&#x27;ve had to wear heavy concealer on certain parts of my face.). I can&#x27;t promise this will work for you as well as it did for me.  I have a feeling that different things work for different people and I have tried so many products that just haven&#x27;t helped.  But you might want to at least try this, just in case this works for you too.  Plus the moisturizer is really nice, not greasy at all.  Good luck!</li>
            <li> So far so good.  Has helped clean up the redness in my face with out clogging my poors...</li>
            <li> I have been using this product along with the Redness Relief Daily Perfecting Lotion and facial cleanser. I apply it after washing my face before bed. Although it feels soft and creamy when putting it on, it really does nothing special as far as my facial redness goes. I&#x27;ve been using it since Christmas (it&#x27;s February now), and no change in my skin. I will probably stick to the Olay lotion I was using before when this bottle is used up, or try another brand.</li>
            <li> I initially bought this as it promoted towards those with sensitive skin.  I have eczema, and wanted a product to boost to my moisturizing routine.  I thought this would work perfectly.  24 hours after initially using this product, my face turned into one big rash.  My dermatologist compared the ingredients to those found in my normal lotion, and suspects the offender to be the formaldehyde.  It doesn&#x27;t state this on the ingredient list that amazon has posted, but if you look elsewhere you will see that it contains DMDM hydatoin (a form of formaldehyde), which a known allergen.  If you have sensitive skin, I wouldn&#x27;t risk buying this.  As I resist the urge to scratch my bumpy red face covered in  gooey hydro-cortisone ointment, I wish I hadn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It really works.  Is cheaper than the other &amp;#34;name&amp;#34;  brands,and works better.  Very DIFFICULT to find in stores.  Eucerin should be proud of this product and have it more accessible.  Hope they never discontinue it.</li>
            <li> I use it for after sun, after shave, and anytime my face feels irritated. It also helps the redness a little.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for 5 years now, and I love it that much..&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t live with out it actually..&lt;br /&gt;N.</li>
            <li> I use it at night only and it seems to help a bit. Not a big difference but I see my skin getting better . Doesn&#x27;t have bad smell like other creams , and it&#x27;s not made in China lol . Actually it was made in Poland , and Europe is known from banning a lot of bad chemicals . Maybe that&#x27;s why my skin didn&#x27;t get sensitive like it did after other product I used .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Rosacea all my life without knowing what caused my red, blotchy skin.  My skin is very sensitive so I can&#x27;t use makeup or trendy skin care products, but this Eucerin Night Creme is wonderful!  It&#x27;s the only face creme that really &#x27;calms&#x27; my skin after I wash my face.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t great, but it isn&#x27;t horrible. Adequate is the best word to describe it. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s done anything to soothe my skin or reduce redness, but it hasn&#x27;t irritated it further either. That&#x27;s more than I can say for most drugstore moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin type: dry, thin, atopic</li>
            <li> Finally something that works for me. Really settles my skin. I love this so much I bought it for some friends for christmas.</li>
            <li> as the title of this review says, this product relieves redness but leaves grease on your face. I started to notice the change after three consecutive use of this creme every night.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything to reduce the redness.</li>
            <li> I am not formally diagnosed with rosacea, but I do have the bumps, redness, sensitivity and all that is tied to it. I hate thick, fragranced creams, so finding this was a relief. It&#x27;s a nice gel-cream moisturizer, has virtually no scent, and applies smoothly and does not feel heavy on the skin. It&#x27;s too soon to say whether it&#x27;ll fix the bumps and redness, but already I really like this product. It feels soothing and my skin looks a little more relaxed.</li>
            <li> makes my skin smooth and comfortable.</li>
            <li> works like charm.  I have been using for 1 year now, and I did not have the flare up of my cheeks; I have eczema condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it is not oily and dries quite quickly.</li>
            <li> Not for sensitive skin.  This made my skin burn and I had to wash it off.</li>
            <li> May help with redness to some extent.  Nice night cream in any case.  Would buy it again just in case.</li>
            <li> I have a super red face all the time, and get very frustrated when I see photos of myself. I have been using this for two weeks and I see a marked difference. Pleasant texture and scent, and it seems to do the job.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and this cream really seems to help. I wonder why I cannot find it in any stores?</li>
            <li> This works wonders on my red skin. I&#x27;ve been using this product for years to tame the redness and dryness and it works well. I use it as an aide to a more expensive product and carry it in my purse for emergency dryness attacks. Wish it had sunscreen in it though because I can only use it at night.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this product , soothes the burning redness caused by rosacea. Works fast and leaves my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!! Isn&#x27;t thick or greasy at all, and really reduces the redness like it says.</li>
            <li> good product..like the consistency..but don&#x27;t see results for redness</li>
            <li> I had a really bad allergic reaction from using this product. I noticed that when I use it , the next morning, the areas around my eyes , nose and mouth becomes very red , sore and itchy. And this is marketed for sensitive redness prone skin so what a let down. I think the locorice root could trigger a really bad allergic reaction so beware. Very disappointed and fell down for this false advertising.</li>
            <li> Was hoping for more but does help a little.</li>
            <li> Eucerin soothing cream does exactly what it says..sooths skin..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad night cream, but I haven&#x27;t seen it do anything to lessen the redness of my rosacea, and I have a very mild case.  So if you&#x27;re looking for rosacea help, I&#x27;d pass this by and keep on looking.</li>
            <li> I recently was diagnosed with rosacea and this has turned out to be the best cream for calming down my skin without irritation. It does seem to help fade the redness, but as we are talking about blood vessels, it can only do so much. It isn&#x27;t going to make dilated blood vessels, ie long term damage disappear. No cream can do that - you need a laser to rid yourself if old damage and redness. But it does handle new flares of redness very well. When I use this at night, my face is definitely paler and more normal looking in the morning - unless I have eaten something that creates a flare up.     I love this cream. Very well priced, and it does what it says it will. Eucerin is a company I have always trusted, and they have come through again. This cream moisturizes well with just a dab, so a jar lasts a long time too.    I hate rosacea.</li>
            <li> I deal with eczema, rosacea and dermatitis in general. I thought this would be something to try so I bought it and used one application. Within six hours, I knew something was wrong. My skin became red and itchy, painfully so. The cream triggered a reaction around my nose and mouth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for my face to be more healthy.&lt;br /&gt;I like it.</li>
            <li> I used it just for couple of days, but definitely have to say that it is great product for good price. It has no smell and absorbs very quickly. For some people it was too thick but for me it&#x27;s just right. I have combination skin, and even it might leave some oiliness, it keeps my skin moist throughout all night.</li>
            <li> I have redness (rosacea) my cheek area, and take an antibiotic daily for this skin condition. I don&#x27;t have a bad case. I used the redness relief facial wash and just started using this cream. It has made a difference. I live in Northeastern Ohio and the cold temps along with wind are totally brutal. I have tried many other products and all they do is make my cheeks redder and cost me money. Eucerin products are quality made and recommended by my dermatologist at the Cleveland Clinic.</li>
            <li> So I am a believer I ordered this after seeing reviews I have had a red face since I was a kid!! There is no condition it&#x27;s perfectly normal all the drs say! I received this 11/13 and started using it 11/14 before bed I took before pictures 11/15 I attached them I just took pictures again today 11/21 there is a big difference maybe after another week or so it might be even better!</li>
            <li> I plan to buy this forever. In one night, it completely transformed my skin and now I have reduced eye wrinkles by probably 50%. I keep expecting to see the lines around my eyes in the morning and they are gone or really softened up. My wife has actually been using this lately instead of her $60 night creams. There is no smell, it is not greasy, light enough to even be used in the day, and soaks in fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great, great product.</li>
            <li> I see the difference when I use it at night time and the nights that I don&#x27;t . It does help with the redness.</li>
            <li> My face is still red and it oesn&#x27;t work well for me. A little greasy too on my face too.</li>
            <li> Good and light in texture. Don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s effective since I only use it for 2 weeks. Hope it will.</li>
            <li> I was expecting more or better results.  A mositurizer this is but I could not see real results as as &amp;#34;redness relief.</li>
            <li> I have mainly been using this as a moisturizer during the day under my foundation.  It has not helped redness that much with my skin, maybe 20%, but it has done wonders for my over all complexion, I no longer have acne flare ups.  If it reduced my redness more I would give it five stars but since it&#x27;s suppose to be a redness reducer and hasn&#x27;t been that effective in that regard for me, I gave it four stars.  As a moisturizer for those with sensitive skin, I would give it five stars.  I have over active oil glands and this has done wonders for my complexion in that regard, I haven&#x27;t noticed oiliness at all on my skin since using this product.</li>
            <li> I have facial redness, it looks like I have a sunburn all year round.  It&#x27;s mainly on my cheeks and nose.  I can cover it with foundation for a while but once I get outside in the sun it pops right through again especially if it&#x27;s hot and humid out.  When I mow the lawn I look like I&#x27;m going to pass out - like a bright red tomato!  I&#x27;ve been really frustrated with it and tried green primers and almost any other lotions out there short of visiting a dermatologist.  I&#x27;m self-diagnosing as rosacea but, again, I don&#x27;t know that that&#x27;s what it is.  I was desperate to find something and  that would help and I read most of the reviews here and had such high hopes!  I almost couldn&#x27;t wait to get it in the mail I was praying it would be a miracle cream but it&#x27;s not, at least not for me!  I have only been using it for about 1.5 weeks.  I know I read somewhere you should use it every night for a month so maybe it will change with time!  I&#x27;ve been putting it on two or three times a day, not just at night.  You only need a very tiny amount and it&#x27;s super creamy and blends really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference at all and I&#x27;ve been faithful about using it :(...  It is a good moisturizer but with all the reviews I read I was hoping it would work the same for me.  Does anyone else have any results where it didn&#x27;t work right away but over time showed an improvement?  I&#x27;m hoping it will help after continued use.  I think I&#x27;d still continue to use it since it&#x27;s a good cream but it hasn&#x27;t done what it&#x27;s claimed so far.  Totally bummed...  Anyone have any other over-the-counter recommendations?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;February 2013 - Not at all impressed with this.  It&#x27;s overpriced and did nothing for me.  I can get the same type of cream cheaper that won&#x27;t claim to make the redness in my face a bit better - waste of money, oh well!  It may work for others but not for me.</li>
            <li> This cream moisturizes my skin without causing any blemishes, and it reduces the redness on my face from rosacea and psoriasis.  I highly recommend it to anyone with some facial redness and/or some dry facial skin.  I love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> rich and creamy night treatment, not greasy</li>
            <li> Really helps.  Please keep making this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried for YEARS to get rid of the redness underneath my eyes and on my nose. I&#x27;ve never been officially diagnosed with Rosacea but am fairly certain I have it. I&#x27;ve tried countless products and creams to rid myself of the redness to no avail. Within two weeks of using this product, the redness has been severely reduced and appears much calmer. This product also keeps my skin well moisturized. 5 stars. Love it.</li>
            <li> So far this has been the best night cream for my face. It&#x27;s not oily and my face feels nice. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Has worked well for my dry skin- but definitely not a miracle product.</li>
            <li> My skin has always been red around my nose - I, not very affectionately, call it my &#x27;muzzle.&#x27; After growing tired of it, I tried this product and could not be happier. One week later, the redness has gone down, my skin is smoother, and I am so much happier with my appearance. I won&#x27;t lie, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever be able to leave the house without makeup on comfortably but before, the redness of my skin would pop through my foundation. Now I feel as if no one can tell I have any problems with my skin. My only complaint is that I wish it would absorb a little better - it does leave my skin a bit sticky - but I can&#x27;t argue with the results. I&#x27;ll happily deal with the stickiness if my skin continues to look the way it does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few nights and my face is already noticeably less red during the day! I don&#x27;t suffer from severe redness, just mild. The cream is not too thick and it absorbs quickly if you have semi-dry skin. Really nice!</li>
            <li> I like the feel of the cream and it does hydrate my sensitive skin well. However, I haven&#x27;t noticed a real difference in how red my skin is.</li>
            <li> This irritated my face and caused me to rinse it off. I do use it on my neck and  other areas; but not my face</li>
            <li> I have used this night creme for over a year. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this product, its a god sent!  I combined this one with Prosacea Rosacea Treatment Gel, 0.75 Ounce Tubes  and I have seen the results.  Thank you and yes I would suggest this product to my friends in a heart beat!</li>
            <li> I have Rosasea and this really helps minimize the effects especially in the winter here in Canada.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Not soothing to my skin, started to irritate, stopped using it after a week.</li>
            <li> Expensive and I didn&#x27;t really see much difference.</li>
            <li> I noticed that the creme makes my eyes kinda dry?? I use this creme about two hours before sleeping, but have tried during different times of the day. Aside of the drying eyes and funky smell (super cream neutral smell) a bit annoying, but goes away~ it seems to be doing it&#x27;s job ON making my skin sort of soft.. but I still notice my face turns red and oily. :(</li>
            <li> This is awesome cleared my redness up enough to notice in 1 application. Will be ordering more of this! A complete surprise!</li>
            <li> I ave mild rosacea  and this cream as been fantastic. It relly seems to help balance my skin. I put it on before bed after washing with the redness wash as well.</li>
            <li> in a matter of weeks the redness that I have had since i was a child got less and less noticable</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have rosacea, but I&#x27;ve still always been as red as a stop sign.  after using this product every night, and their soothing lotion every morning, for about 2 weeks, I&#x27;m now a color found on the standard human spectrum.  The difference is amazing, i&#x27;m so happy!  no longer look like i&#x27;m constantly blushing or about to burst into flames!!  couldn&#x27;t be happier!!!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product. It sounded great; calms redness, is oil free.  It felt great on my skin and moisturized very well, however within the first few days of using it, the few active breakout I had got about 10 times worse, and new breakouts were forming all over my forehead.  If you have acne and are looking for a good moisturizer, I highly recommend Neutrogena oil free moisture for sensitive skin :)</li>
            <li> Made my face burn and still have bad effect almost 2 weeks later. Careful is you have any sort of sensitiveness with your skin.</li>
            <li> I have been plagued with very sensitive skin around my collar bones, and by my neck areas where the skin is very thin, or I mean where there is little fat underneath. Anyway, when I wear a shirt and it fits me snug in these areas, or if I wear a heavy jacket that causes my shirts to press firmly against my skin, I always get red blotches on my skin around my neck and collar bones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried hydro-cortisone cream, benadryl cream, Itch X, and Cortisone 10, all of these products did not help me any. I must say that these products are mostly for allergic reactions and rashes. I needed something for redness relief of sensitive skin caused by pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to buy this product after reading the reviews on Amazon about it for redness relief for Rosacea etc. I thought I would just give it a try. It is very greasy when applied so you only need a little dab to go a long ways, which is a great benefit, since it will last a long time. Once rubbed into the skin it soon dries up and becomes non oily, so it does not stain your shirts, another benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied some to the areas I get redness from wearing shirts, and put on a shirt that always makes me get red, because it fits snug. When I removed the shirt before going to bed that night, I had absolutely no red blotches at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been rubbing a little on my skin each morning after I take a shower and before going to bed at night, and my God, I have been totally red free every since. I did not think there was anything that was going to help, me for sensitive skin, but this stuff is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have Rosacea it may help you, but if you have sensitive skin that turns red easily it might be the wonder product you have been looking for. I am very happy I purchased it!</li>
            <li> Good night creme, I use it during the day as well as night. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I started noticing my rosacea getting worse the older i get. I have fair skin and blush very easily and sun burn easily. But now my face is breaking out and am noticing more patches of redness. I started looking around for a night cream that would relieve my winter dry skin as well as the redness. I also puchased the day cream that has a green tint to it that is supposed to lessen the look of redness. I did not find that either one worked to my satisfaction. Im a little dissapointed, but everyone is different,what didnt work for me might work for someone else. I will keep looking</li>
            <li> Great night/day cream.  It&#x27;s pricey, however, so now i don&#x27;t use it.  I didn&#x27;t have redness that needed relief - just dry skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s silky smooth and delicious, as well as soothing for my roscea. You&#x27;re face will love you for it.&lt;br /&gt;My roscea can get extremely itchy and super sensitive. I was at a loss trying to find a cream/product/s that worked.&lt;br /&gt;My facial redness has reduced significantly, and highly recommend the redness relief range for roscea sufferers.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream because at least it does not cause more redness.  I have tried other moisturizers for sensitive skin that turn me bright red.  This one does not.</li>
            <li> I like it!  It&#x27;s a good night creme from a brand that can be trusted not to irritate sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have known I have Rosecea for years. Lately over the winter my skin has been unbearable. It is raw red and itchy. I have tried everything.  $150.00 moisturizers, Wonderbar, Cerave, Cetaphil, Mama Nature, stuff given to me by aesthetician, olive oil! Yes oil on my face and nothing helped.  Yesterday I decided to try this product. My face was so bad it actually stung when I slathered it on. I put it on again a second time before I went to bed and this time no sting. Today my face feels so much better and you can see a VISIBLE difference in its condition. It does not look dry flaky and vile. It looks smooth. I do not expect anything to actually take the redness away but to finally get it to respond to a moisturizer that actually hydrated it was a relief! Hopefully with continued use I will see more changes in my skin but to even have one day of no itching or flaking well I can&#x27;t tell you how amazing that feels.</li>
            <li> I really do not see a difference in  the redness of my skin from this product. It&#x27;s a very heavy facial moisturizer. It leaves my skin feeling soft, but it&#x27;s not the best product I ever used.I much prefer plain old Oil of Olay night time cream, I feel that&#x27;s a better product.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the thing - this product does what it can, considering what it is.  It will soothe your rosacea a little and reduce the redness a little.  But, a cream is not going to cure your rosacea nor improve it all that much. I had rosacea for at least 10 years on my cheeks.  And, when I say had I mean HAD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have rosacea anymore..in fact, I&#x27;m terrible and almost never moisturize my face either, but my skin looks fantastic.  Why?  Quite simply because I&#x27;m on an anti-inflammatory/anti-candida diet.  Our terrible nutrition is what causes rosacea, not a lack of a moisturizer.  I was on a low-carb diet for a few years and still had rosacea but that&#x27;s because while the diet was better than the average american diet..it still didn&#x27;t get rid of systemic candida.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I&#x27;m not here to point you to a website or sell you anything.  I&#x27;m here simply to tell you that this cream isn&#x27;t going to cure your rosacea - YOU making a DRASTIC change in the way you feed your body is the only thing that will cure it.  Most of you will ignore this..for those of you that are actually interested, do a little search on the internet and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll figure it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, if you want a cream to apply to your rosacea that might really help - try cold-pressed virgin coconut oil of whatever brand you like.  But, again, the diet is the answer not what you rub on the skin.</li>
            <li> I have fair, sensitive skin with a red undertone.  As I have aged, the redness in my skin has become more prominent.  In the winter, my face becomes red and irritated due to the dryness and cold.  Eucerin takes the sting out of my skin and helps reduce the redness.  I use the night creme in addition to the daily perfecting lotion to neutralize the redness.  I have small pores, so I can use the night creme without any breakouts.  I have tried a number of more expensive moisturizers, but none have worked as well as Eucerin.  I have recommended this product to a number of people.</li>
            <li> Works really well, takes the redness right out, it cools and soothes. The only problem, I could find on this is: its a tiny jar and does not last very long.</li>
            <li> Been using the cream for about a month. It really helps to calm your skin. Its a must try for everyone with skin problems.</li>
            <li> I bought it based on the reviews I read from people with sensitive skin and rosacea condition. As soon as I put it on my face I had to run to wash my face. It made my face red and uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to try VaniCream for sensitive skin... fingers crossed.</li>
            <li> This stuff is magic!  For the last ten years all I have seen in the mirror or in pictures of myself is RED RED and more RED.  I couldn&#x27;t get past the fact I looked like I had a permanent sunburn.  And I got tired of constantly being asked if I had been in the sun.  I mean, I haven&#x27;t gone outside without 50 SPF block and full body coverage plus wide brimmed hat for at least a decade.  I couldn&#x27;t understand why my face was still so darn red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, my skin has always been so sensitive that most lotions and other treatments cause worse skin problems than the redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FInally I got turned on to this product.  After a month of using this faithfully plus the day time redness relief and the redness relief cleanser, the redness is vastly improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few more important notes:  if you have rosacea and your eyes are itchy or dry or if it is hard to see out of them sometimes wearing your glasses or not, you may have \\&quot;Ocular Rosacea\\&quot; even if your eyelids are not red.  I didn&#x27;t know this existed but after reading about it, I have been treating my eyes every night (simply wash your eyelids with diluted baby shampoo or with one of the products sold for the condition) and I am no longer having the problems I had been having.  This can be a serious condition AND the treatment is simple so please check it out!  Your eyes will appreciate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO, rosacea can cause the bulbous red nose that older people can get (Think classic fisherman&#x27;s red nose), even if the rest of their skin is not red.  My husband who NEVER uses sunscreen (Dumb, but I can only make hubby do so much) and never burns (at least visibly) noticed his nose is getting bumpy and bulbous.  I have convinced him to start treating his nose for rosacea and it is starting to return to normal shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product will be in my beauty routine for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 28 year old male who has always had somewhat bright, red cheeks. I have never been diagnosed with rosacea, but after 30 minutes on WebMD, I have diagnosed myself with a light case of it. I&#x27;ve tried different cleansers and lotions, but this one has been my favorite.  It has a unique consistency, it&#x27;s almost like the custard in donuts. That might sound gross to put on your face, but it coats and you can really feel it soak into your skin. It doesn&#x27;t just sit on the top of the skin like regular lotions. I use the [[ASIN:B000P1S0NI Eucerin Redness Relief Soothing Facial Cleanser-6.8 oz]]. I&#x27;m a believer.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I bought this as a less-expense replacement for the Clinique version of this product, and I have to say that I&#x27;m quite impressed. It doesn&#x27;t work QUITE as well, but it does a pretty good job, which I think is good enough for me when you consider the huge price difference between the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoy the cooling sensation you get upon applying it to your face. A lot of the time, my facial redness gives off heat, especially at night, so that feature is one that I really appreciate. I also like that it seems to be pretty thick and moisturizing. I would say that I wish it was sliiightly more moisturizing if I had to be nitpicky, but I still think it does a decent job. Would definitely recommend for people suffering from redness caused by sensitive skin, which is the condition I have.</li>
            <li> A few years ago I tried three of the Eucerin Redness Relief products (face wash, a green-tinted day cream, and this soothing night creme). The soothing night creme seemed to be the most helpful one for me. I no longer purchase the others, and this product line is impossible to find in stores now, but I like to keep this night creme handy in case of a rosacea outbreak. It usually soothes inflamed skin within a few days, so I wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it.</li>
            <li> I am a 24 year old male who has a genetic disposition for rosacea that is starting to show up now. I tried everything from changing my diet, drinking more water, cutting caffiene, and general lotions but nothing helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I would throw a bit more money at the problem and get Eucerin Redness Relief Night Creme, Daily Perfecting Lotion SPF 15, and the TriDerma Redness Repair creme. Out of the 3, I have been using this the most and after about I week I have noticed that the redness has gone down a lot and all are left are the subtle veins on my upper cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply this creme after taking a shower, and it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t get sticky.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and it is a marellous night cream.  I have good skin but feel this has helped keep it that way as I get older.</li>
            <li> Not a bad lotion. Didn&#x27;t notice a change in redness. My facial redness may need some more serious help than this.</li>
            <li> This is a great facial moisturizer for any time of day.</li>
            <li> I love this night cream. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive skin or clog my pores. It also seems to help smooth my skin when it has been irritated.  I have been using it for almost seven years, since I was in my 20s</li>
            <li> Very very very unhappy. Went to Ulta , started using dermalogica ,  very very very Happy!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a month now and honestly have not seen any improvement in redness.  I am also not a huge fan of the way it smells and how long it takes to absorb.  Will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I used this product for 1 month, every night, and applied it liberally. It certainly made my skin softer and did not break me out, but it did little or nothing for my redness.</li>
            <li> By far the best moisturizer.  It says night creme, but I use a small bit as a daily moisturizer.  It helps with my sensitive skin, and is oil free so doesn&#x27;t cause break outs.  I have tried multiple moisturizers over the years, this is by far the best. I now get it on subscribe and save, so it&#x27;s an even better deal than it already is on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about 6 months now. I have mild rosacea (subtype 2) with redness, very very dry patches, some bumpiness and a few visible capillaries. I&#x27;m just turning 40 yrs old. I have tried many creams and lotions/potions and so far this is the best one. My cheeks are so dry there are rough scaly patches on them, so I use this AM &amp; PM. It moisturizes well, and seems to decrease redness, scaling and bumps. It has caused no acne or rash/reaction of any kind and I have extremely sensitive skin. Seems to work well under make-up if you give it that time to sink in. I find the price very reasonable, considering some of the high end creams I have used that did absolutely nothing for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only drawbacks to this cream and the reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars, is it is a little greasy going on, and you need a few minutes to let it absorb. I also avoid using it on my eyelids prior to eye makeup application because of this issue. Plus I dislike dipping my fingers in a jar of cream and wish it was in a pump of some sort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this cream and will be purchasing more on Amazon as it is hard to find in my local stores.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a change</li>
            <li> I love all of eucerin products  and this cream really works</li>
            <li> It didnt make my redness go away at all ,so im gonna keep using it cuz i paid for it and ill use it for to get some extra moisture on my face but , other then that its not worth buying at all...</li>
            <li> This cream is a wonderful hand cream, but it says it&#x27;s suitable for rosacea.  It stings on my face, and was not tolerated by my sensitive rosacea facial skin at all.  Therefore, I thought I would keep it for a body lotion.  My shoulders didn&#x27;t tolerate it either, so I thought I&#x27;d share my experience because i don&#x27;t think it has the required sensitivity rating needed to say it&#x27;s ok for those with rosacea.  I know we all have different reactions to different products, so it may work ok for someone else.  However, if you have super sensitive skin then I cannot recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love Eucerine products in general, so thought I would try this for the occasional redness I have developed over the years before ordering a more expensive product. This works perfectly for me. Within a couple of days, my skin looks normal again. Don&#x27;t know how it would work for a more severe redness, but it might be worth a try.</li>
            <li> Made rosacea symptoms worse. Go to the dermatologist and get the prescribed cream. May work for others</li>
            <li> I have Rosacea that has flared up.  I have been using this product for the first time and for 3 days and already am seeing a difference in the redness and overall look of my skin on my face. I also have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  It just seems to soak right in.  My dermatologist has always recommended the Eucerin brand for my hands but this redness relief creme is wonderful and may save a trip to the dermatologist and a RX medication for me for now.  I am not making a medical claim just stating what I am seeing.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin soft and absorbs quickly. Although it&#x27;s not a &#x27;miracle fix&#x27; for redness, it does help a lot.</li>
            <li> WARNING: SPOT TEST BEFORE USING THIS PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this on a small section of my face that was a little red and it caused one of the WORST breakouts I have had in several years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s broken when I received it</li>
            <li> This really works are relieving redness.  It&#x27;s soothing and it is definitely worth the money.  As a guy, it seems a little weird to put lotion on my face at night, but this really reduces the redness from rosacea.</li>
            <li> To me this stuff is bordering on being a miracle cream. Also, it has an extremely light scent that is only noticeable while putting it on my face. I really dislike any perfume and I have no objections on that count. It does not make the skin feel greasy at all.</li>
            <li> First started using this product when my Mom&#x27;s dermatologist gave her a free sample back in the early 2000s, and have used it consistently since. Although it doesn&#x27;t reduce the redness (that I notice) it does provide adequate moisturization without leaving a greasy film. I can apply my foundation a couple of minutes after applying this cream and it doesn&#x27;t interfere with my makeup. I recently went for my first facial and she told me my skin was in great condition considering my age (38).  She was astonished when I told her I have smoked for 13 of the last 18 years!</li>
            <li> Stings your face right away.</li>
            <li> Seems to help. It is a lot less expensive than another product for curbing redness that I buy at the beauty counter of a local department store.</li>
            <li> This works pretty well.  It&#x27;s a little greasy but it&#x27;s for night time so that&#x27;s okay.  After using it, I looked pale...compared to bright red!  It&#x27;s worth the money to me.</li>
            <li> Very nice and creamy. I tried the green-colored day version cream and didn&#x27;t like it at all. This has helped a lot to soothe my skin at night. Don&#x27;t use it on a sunburn though! It will burn and irritate the skin. While this isn&#x27;t my 100% solution (I don&#x27;t know what is!), this has definitely helped cool and calm my skin at night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying this stuff has healed me because I do believe I have a medical problem but, My face is so much better now. Less redness and burning. No more patches of dry thick skin. I&#x27;m sad it cost so much for so little but, I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> The night cream has a yellow tint color and it just cools all the redness on my face. I use almost every night.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help with broken capillaries, but it broke me out.  Rather strong, but with time it might work.</li>
            <li> I have been suffering/battling with some sort of skin irritation on my forehead for the past year. Its been embarrassing for me to go out in public with my skin looking the way it did. It looked like contact dermatitis to me but my doctor diagnosed me with a mild case of rosacea. Either way, I took a bunch of different approaches to clearing it up and the metro gel the doctor prescribed didn&#x27;t help, it just made my skin worse and carried a hefty price tag. While surfing amazon for various skin products I stumbled across this little gem which is extremely cheap. I was initially impressed with how quickly this stuff worked. I would estimate within 24 hours of application the redness went down at least 90%. Within a few days I was all clear. I would apply this cream twice a day once in morning after my routine face washing and then in evening or after shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also note that I&#x27;m also using an organic face wash and probiotics. I can&#x27;t confirm if Eucerin was the sole factor in my success but it seemed like it played a major role.</li>
            <li> I have a pre rosacea condition, so my redness is not extreme by any measure.  But after going through one jar, I really can&#x27;t see much (if any) difference my skin&#x27;s appearance. That said, it seems to be an okay moisturizer.  For anyone looking for redness relief, it might be worth a try - worse case, it ends up being just a moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li> This is a nice night cream. My skin is dry and sensitive so I always end up going back to dermatologist&#x27;s systems, but this works without causing irritation and is much less expensive.</li>
            <li> This unfortunately made my rosacea worse over time. I think the thickness and greasiness of the cream actually irritated my skin and trapped heat in my face. As soon as I switched to a lighter, less greasy cream the redness was much improved. I currently use Clinique&#x27;s rosacea products. They are very expensive however so I&#x27;m always on the look-out for cheaper and equally effective products.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product.  I have been using it for years and is the only moisturizer i can use that does not irritate my sensitive skin.  I use it both day &amp; night without any trouble.</li>
            <li> Great for rosacea. Very calming.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different creams over the past few years to try to lessen the redness that I&#x27;ve developed in my complexion. This is the first one that really seems to be helping. I&#x27;ve been using this cream both in the morning and at night for the past week, and I do definitely seem to be noticing that not only is my face much softer, but it also appears less dry, irritated and red. For the first time in years, my complexion has a more normal color to it and is much less pink/reddish than before. (Note: A dermatologist had recently told me that my reddish complexion is due mostly to genetics and can be considered mild rosacea. I&#x27;m half Irish, and have very dry skin, especially during the winter). I would strongly recommend this cream to anyone that has either very dry skin and/or also suffers from a red complexion/mild rosacea. This really is one of the very best moisturizing creams I have ever encountered, even despite having tried what is supposedly the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; of them (I live in Switzerland, which is known for its advanced skincare products). But I will continue ordering this from the States. ;)  Note: I found that sleeping with a humidifier in the room has also helped my skin to be less dry and reddish. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> product works well enough, i haven&#x27;t noticed any significant changes in my skin but it&#x27;s a nice product for the price.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my dermatologist to cure my dry skin that I started developing all of a sudden. Overall I love the way my face feels the next day ( a little goes a long way). It may be a little oily fro some people, but thankfully I don&#x27;t mind it, since I use it overnight and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out or anything. I didn&#x27;t have any red skin to begin with, so not sure how well it works to alleviate that, but overall a great moisturizer. Amazon is great, always in stock and ships fast. Sucks that I am only able to find this product online, since for whatever reason, many drugstores don&#x27;t sell Eucerin Facial products. The only improvement would be if the container could be less delicate and less heavy. The container is almost porcelain like, so it is very prone to breaking and just overall very heavy.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately didn&#x27;t work for my Rosacea. I tried for a month and was looking worse so I sttoped to use. But sometimes what it doesn&#x27;t work for my rosacea maybe works for yours.</li>
            <li> This cream is amazing! I have dry sensitive skin and this cream does wonders at night. Even my esthetician says that Eucerin products were created by dermatologists, which is maybe why they are so good. I also use their spf 30 day cream too and it&#x27;s pretty good too.</li>
            <li> Nourish and calm the skin, very love</li>
            <li> Eucerin is a great cream.  I have been using it now for about three years.  All their products are super.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this product and saw a turn around less than a month.  I had very dry, sensitive, red skin, and it is all cleared up. Awesome product, great price. It doesn&#x27;t take a lot for it to work.</li>
            <li> As far as night creams go, it seems to serve the purpose as well as helping to keep the redness under control.</li>
            <li> Having rosacea sucks. I was never able to yawn or smile all the way or else my nose and cheeks would turn bright red and break out. Using this cream at night overtime made my face more durable. And I can yawn now and smile also. I know this might not work for every one and I&#x27;m also not getting some WOW results, but for me its a big step to not having a red complexion because I yawn.</li>
            <li> My skin Absolutely loves this stuff. I put it on every night &amp; I wake up really really fresh looking skin it&#x27;s clear &amp; does what it says it does. Definitely will buy again. I suffer from Rosacea &amp; minor redness this product is great</li>
            <li> I use this every night. It does not take much and this product with the Daily Perfecting Lotion has cut my redness back by 50% at least.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for a week now. I&#x27;ll try to remember to update my review when I&#x27;ve been using it longer.  There are not really any cons other than maybe my expectations were too high.  I&#x27;ve been dealing with Rosacea for about 3 years now and am OVER it.  I used metrogel (didn&#x27;t work), I&#x27;m currently using a sulfa wash daily which for a while almost completely cleared it up, but here lately, it&#x27;s been bad so I reached out on here and found this.  Just for clarity, my rosacea is red (duh), on my forehead, cheeks, and nose with tiny scaly bumps localized on my forehead.  My cheeks are more prone to pimples, but they&#x27;re not horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;ve been using this nightly for a week now and that is the only difference to my routine.  It&#x27;s a very heavy moisturizer which i thought was going to be problem but wasn&#x27;t (most of things I&#x27;ve been using is very light).  After 2 days, I could definitely tell a difference in the redness and irritation which is worse right out of the shower.  It&#x27;s still there, but it is better.  I think it&#x27;s working, but so far (for me) it&#x27;s not a miracle cure.  But anything that just helps a little is better than nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, one more thing.  This stuff goes a long way.  I can see this one little jar lasting me a couple of months.</li>
            <li> This  cream can be used both night &amp; day after cleansing with Eucerin&#x27;s Redness Relief Facial Cleanser - best for preventing redness from too much heat/cold</li>
            <li> This a great cream for rosacea an dev Ryan soothing. Use at night before going to bed.</li>
            <li> I have dealt with redness on my face (I think I have very mild rosacea) since I was about 13 (now 20), and after two days of using this night cream I could not stop looking in the mirror...the redness is dramatically reduced. I am positive that if I continue to use this product there will be no redness at all! I highly recommend you try it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to post this same review to the perfecting lotion, cleanser, and night creme, so if you read one, you&#x27;ve read them all. Just mentioning to save you time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosacea is a relatively new development in my life. Recently the bumps have become extreme, and after doing some reading, I realized what I was dealing with. Wanting to address the problem as thoroughly as possible, I bought the redness relief perfecting lotion, the cleanser, and the night cream. I am amazed at the results after only 24 hours; my husband even noticed! Redness is dramatically reduced and the bumps are much smaller. Having read the reviews here, I expected the perfecting lotion product to be difficult to spread. The review suggested mixing this product with another moisturizer to increase \\&quot;spreadability.\\&quot; But they must have changed the formula, because it isn&#x27;t. Of course I didn&#x27;t know that when I was shopping, so I also bought an Aveeno redness calming moisturizer. I&#x27;m glad I did; the Eucerin product isn&#x27;t really a moisturizer, at least for my 66-year-old skin, so using both is the answer. The cleanser is amazing; my skin feels so calm after washing; calm being the only word I can think of to describe the sensation, or maybe lack of the sensation, I get with other products. And the night creme doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes. I&#x27;m giving those two products 5 stars; the 4 stars for the perfecting lotion is only because I need additional moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also going to investigate the potential connection between my rosacea and SIBO (small intestine bacteria overgowth) and heliocopter pilori, the bacteria responsible for ulcers, which we apparently all carry on our skin. I&#x27;m not medical, so don&#x27;t quote me on this, but there&#x27;s a lot of info out there.</li>
            <li> I love this creme and so does my skin. In addition to redness I have dry skin. The creme really helped to relieve the redness and the dryness.</li>
            <li> Got this for my mom, she has extremely sensitive skin and it turns red with anything you put on her.  Her face especially!  She&#x27;s been using this and she says her skin is actually softer, it&#x27;s hydrating her skin.  Her face doesn&#x27;t react to it, so it&#x27;s not red.  It&#x27;s smooth to apply, it&#x27;s not oily like some other products.  Has a slight lotion scent, clean, but goes away very quickly once applied she says.  I love it if she loves it.  Makes me happy that she&#x27;s using it and doesn&#x27;t have issues with it.  She hasn&#x27;t been able to apply lotion to her face or anything because she reacts to everything.  This is the reason I got this for her.  It works like a charm and her face feels very soft.  Packaged well, was sealed well, shipping was on time - everything was perfect, thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This company has a very nice return policy, from what I&#x27;ve read.  They even give you the paper showing if it doesn&#x27;t work, you can return it.  I could be dishonest and return it empty, but this is a good company and I&#x27;d rather not screw over a good company.  Worth the purchase!  Not many companies are honest, please don&#x27;t ruin that policy if it really works for you :)</li>
            <li> This cream is wonderful for sensitive skin.  There are no perfumes.  It is light and not greasy.  It leaves your skin soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> i love this stuff. i&#x27;ve used many high end products and this one is the best. i put it on before bed and after the first use, my red blotchy skin has gone away</li>
            <li> Soothing and has not caused allergic or other irritation. Spreads easily...not too thick.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea especially on the cheeks and the worst on the nose where I have redness&lt;br /&gt;and pustules 6-9 and the nose has a buildup of skin. I started to use this on Monday&lt;br /&gt;the 26th and for the first time in over a year my swelling in the nose has gone and the&lt;br /&gt;redness and pain are gone and the pustules have healed up and I fell no pain or redness.&lt;br /&gt;It is a cooling lotion and my nose and face look 95% better and feel great. I only use&lt;br /&gt;a small amount every morning and evening and it is wonderful to feel normal and look&lt;br /&gt;normal again. This is a tiny price to pay for my continued clear and normal nose and face.&lt;br /&gt;My stress at work does not help but this seems to be much better in spite of it. Thank you&lt;br /&gt;for this wonderful healing lotion, it is wonderful to feel no pain when I apply this lotion.keep&lt;br /&gt;up the good work. After 15 years what a difference!</li>
            <li> Sorry to say it did not work for me, I also used  the facial wash there was 3 in package. Used both products for 5 months no difference in the redness.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever used. It controls the redness but is also of a good consistency and spreads well without being sticky.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping this would work to reduce the redness in my face it made it even more worse looks like I have sunburn now lol</li>
            <li> I used to have very dry skin and using this product at least 5 times a week has made a great improvement to my skin.  I love it is soft and has a good smell.</li>
            <li> I love it.Since I have dry skin and itchy.when I first try, the next morning I felt my face more softer and not too dry as it was.Thank you.</li>
            <li> very soothing for sensitive skin. you can apply and go right to sleep. it does have a positive impact on the redness in my cheeks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been 2 days but I can&#x27;t believe the difference. I had horrible rocacea and tried a million products. I really didn&#x27;t expect this to work but my derm recommended it so I tried it hesitantly. But what a miracle. I hope it continues to work. I finally don&#x27;t feel like I look like a freak and need to pile a ton of makeup on.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and a good value for a night cream.  Works as well as some of the really expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and feel a burning sensation after applying this, but only on occasion.</li>
            <li> I am a pharmacist, and I&#x27;ve tried many prescription and OTC products to help with my psoriasis. This is by far the best OTC one I have found, and I use it daily after I shower before I go to bed.  Not only does it help soothe and moisturize, but also helps prevent flare ups without thinning your skin, like topical steroid creams/ointments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to all my psoriasis and eczema suffering patients.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed. This product is my Subscribe and Save list because I never want to run out.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell if it helps redness or not.</li>
            <li> Seems like I need more for each use.</li>
            <li> Works ok for rosacea. Not the cure all by any means. Some redness still remains. Still works better than most though.</li>
            <li> Works great, as intented. :-)</li>
            <li> This product is great for dry skin if you need a thicker cream than normal products are.  It is almost a Crisco-like texture.  I like it for dry elbows and my dry feet when I&#x27;m wearing the bootie socks.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years, especially in the summertime when I am usually always barefoot - so have horrible cracked skin on my feet.  Once I started using this cream with the bootie overnight socks, my skin smoothed out more quickly and is soft by morning!</li>
            <li> A soothing cream which aids in the tment of rosacea symptoms.  Has softened rough patchy skin areas .</li>
            <li> There is definitely redness releif</li>
            <li> A replacement for a product by Neutrogena that I can no longer buy locally.  I like this even better.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several months, and I discovered that my face looked good if I didn&#x27;t moisturize. So I just moisturized when absolutely needed.  Then testing for a different allergy revealed that I am allergic to parabens.  So now I&#x27;m back to finding a cleanser/moisturizer regiment. So sad.  I really bought into the \\&quot;redness relief\\&quot; promise and just figured I couldn&#x27;t solve it.</li>
            <li> Worked for awhile until I started breaking out from it. I&#x27;m allergic to a lot of things so I imagine that is the problem. It worked for a couple of weeks but then the breakout. If you don&#x27;t have allergies, it would probably be fine.</li>
            <li> I originally read about this cream in a book I have that is written by a dermatologist.  My husband has rosacea and his face as well as neck area get quite red in the summer months when he gets overheated (this may calm down some when he cools down, but not completely).  Since he needed something to address those issues I decided to order this for him. He applied this cream in the evening after his shower.  It did help after a while to calm down some of his redness on his face, but not on his neck area which just had too many years of accumulated sun damage.  He is a \\&quot;true\\&quot; redneck.</li>
            <li> this stuff feels good on the skin, but sad to say didn&#x27;t really work for me and caused me to get a few extra pimples, probally from blocked pores cause this stuff is thick, i can see it working for some people but not all.</li>
            <li> This product has slightly reduced redness. It does keep my skin hydrated without causing any breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;Overall this cream is just ok.</li>
            <li> I have mild case of rosecea. Saw results in a little over a week using this and other Eurcerin Redness Relief products.</li>
            <li> This stuff goes great. A little goes a long way, if you put too much on it won&#x27;t absorb well. But I&#x27;ve used the whole thing now and will buy it again. Definitely saw an improvement in my face. I also tried the day cream but did not like it. Will definitely keep using the night creme.</li>
            <li> I had hoped it would have worked better, but I did get some relief.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and perfumes/creams don&#x27;t work for my face.  This works for me and my face condition.  The only negative for me I&#x27;d say is my hands feel a little sticky after applying to my face even if I&#x27;ve rubbed whatever was on my hands together feels sticky.</li>
            <li> Broke out horribly and face looked raw.</li>
            <li> What I really like about this moisturizer is that it is light but not too light, and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out in any way, which is never the case with anything I put on my face. It is odorless and a little goes a long ways, so there&#x27;s good value. I use it in conjunction with the redness relief cleanser, but I have not found any difference in my rosacea redness. I continue to use it because it is a good moisturizer, but I am disappointed about the lack of effect it has on the redness.</li>
            <li> Sadly, this product made skin more red and had to discontinue use.</li>
            <li> I am noticing less red. Nice creamy moisturizer. I would recommend for any face it is not heavy or oily.</li>
            <li> Pleasant feel to this cream; so far I haven;t seen much difference in my skin but it does make a nice soothing night cream.</li>
            <li> It worked like a charm</li>
            <li> The lotion is easy to absorb, has no scent, and worth more than its cost. I have very sensitive skin and using Eucerin helped to get rid of redness on a daily basis. Strongly recommend it for dry seasons, but it can get oily occasionally. So right now I am looking for a good alternative for the coming moisture summer time.</li>
            <li> I like the safety seal on the lid and the cream is a cream yellowish color and feels velvety smooth on my dry skin. It feels thick and moisturizing,not too heavy but i love it. It definitely works for my dry patches by mouth and chin.  The glass jar container is smal and quite heavy. It is not very big but a quarter size covers all my face. I am Happy it is fragrance free,oil free and non comedogenic I hope this cream works on my red skin and eczema. In 4 weeks time will tell if my redness has diminished or gone away for good. Update then,</li>
            <li> It works wonder for me and I am so glad I got the product.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizing effect!</li>
            <li> Apply at night. definitely helps my red breakouts.</li>
            <li> I needed something to relief the itching I was experiencing at night due to my rosacea.  This creme is not for that and in fact has caused my skin to have a burning sensation after application.  I gave the creme 3 stars because for a normal user this would probably be a great creme.  But I&#x27;m not a normal user.</li>
            <li> I realized I reviewed the Redness Relief  SPF 15 green-tint lotion product but not this one, and since I use both I thought I should give a few words of support to this product too.  I first got free samples from my dermatologist about 5 years ago and since then it is the only moisturizer I use.  My derm recommended  just using the night cream on my 40-something face even in the daytime so after I used up all my free samples I just bought the night cream and the green-tint SPF 15 lotion.  I have reddish skin (Irish DNA!) but not rosacea.  I use the night cream first thing in the morning after my shower.  I wait 5-10 minutes for it to be absorbed then apply the SPF green-tint lotion.  For the first few minutes my skin is actually bright-ER red (that is the initial reaction of ANYTHING touching my sensitive skin), but then my skin color becomes much more calm and noticeably less red though no-one will ever mistake me for anything other than Irish!  I use the night cream product all year round.  I generally re-apply at some point during the day when I want to re-apply the SPF green tint  - I think it or anything goes on the face better if it is first smoothed over by a moisturizer.  I may apply again at night but not always. So applying it basically twice a day I use the jar up in about 8 weeks.  In the summer or when I travel to a  particularly sunny destination I will use Clinique City Block 25 (which I have also reviewed vary favorably) after the Redness Relief night cream instead of the SPF 15 product.  Otherwise the SPF 15 green tint product does the trick of protecting my face.  Like any product where you are looking to \\&quot;correct\\&quot; something you probably need to give it a try for a month. (I do not use the Redness Relief face wash; instead I use Aveeno Creamy Baby Wash -- so soothing and no irritation!)</li>
            <li> I love that this cream is so rich and is very helpful for excessive dryness, but it hasn&#x27;t been very effective for my reactive redness. If my skin is extra irritated, by the end of the day, this cream will sting a little after washing with the Eucerin Redness Relief face wash. I haven&#x27;t found it helpful in managing my redness, but it is soothing for the most part. Of course, if you&#x27;re struggling with redness I would still recommend this solely because of its exceptional price to at least give it a shot.</li>
            <li> Product is exactly what I ordered,  works well for night use, only need small amount so it lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Items received earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> For eight months my 13 year old son has been suffering with blotchy red skin on his face.  Four dermatologists, 3 pediatricians and an allergist all said it was eczema.  I don&#x27;t think it is because it doesn&#x27;t act like or look like the eczema on his body.  Numerous steroid creams, foams and ointments did nothing to clear it up.  Buckets of Vaseline did nothing.  Nothing helped until this Redness Relief.  It worked almost overnight.  To me.....it&#x27;s a miracle.  My son&#x27;s face is back to a healthy color, no embarrassing red splotches.  No more dry skin.  It&#x27;s a heaven send for sure.  I&#x27;m also having him use it on his eczema spots on his body with great results though not as fast as it was for his face.</li>
            <li> It works and I am delighted.</li>
            <li> I have used almost the entire jar and have not noticed any change in my complexion.  It didn&#x27;t do what it was advertised to do.  The cream does feel good on my face or I would have given it a one star.</li>
            <li> Have used for years...great, great product!</li>
            <li> I found this cream to be too heavy for my face.  I have combination skin and this cream made my face too greasy. And it has done nothing for my rosacea.</li>
            <li> I had a bad experience with this particular cream ( and I use EUCERIN creams regularly ). My skin was soooo irritated and red that I felt ashamed to go out the house for days. It didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Works well on my minor redness. I notice if I forget to use it though I will be red cheeked all day the next day.</li>
            <li> smells nice, feels nice, doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out. have only been using for a couple of weeks on and off but seems to be helping the redness on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I use this in morning and night It feels good on skin . a bit heavy but I like that it soaks into the skin well.</li>
            <li> Nice soothing cream......feels good but I don&#x27;t think it is doing much for the rosacea.</li>
            <li> excellent creme,i like</li>
            <li> Feels really soothing when you use at night and moisturizes well.  Have ordered more!</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this cream.  I use every single night without fail!  It greatly helps control redness flare ups (I do not have rosacea).  It leaves my skin velvety soft.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Hi everybody,&lt;br /&gt;I have been dealing with dry, red skin over 2 years. I went to a dermatolijist, and she gave me some cream to use, but it didn&#x27;t solve my problem. I have started to use this cream for 3 days, and I  see result right away. Give a shoot. I added pics. I can see the big differences. I have been so happy :)</li>
            <li> Went on easily and acted as a terrific moisturizer at night. I didn&#x27;t see any reduction in the redness on my cheeks. It wasn&#x27;t greasy and a little went a long way.</li>
            <li> I ordered this with the redness relief cleanser and daytime moisturizer, the night cream is very nice, it is a smaller jar than I expected but a little goes a long way. I have combo skin that has reddish tones, large pore areas and can be sensitive, so Im pretty picky about moisturizers. this cream is perfect for night, i dont wake up in the morning feeling like my face has gotten all oily like other heavier creams have done, and the small amount that i use in any other product would leave my skin feeling parched, but even the cleanser leaves my skin feeling soft and balanced before I put this on. The three together defenitely take out the redness and leave my skin soft, the instructions say best results after 4wks but I was pretty shocked at how much better my skin was doing after one day. Also very fast shipping</li>
