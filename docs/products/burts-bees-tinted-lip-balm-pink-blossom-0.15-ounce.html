    <ol>
            <li>and this is the best I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>This color and Hibiscus are great colors!</li>
            <li>Perfect combination.</li>
            <li>It saves my lip, the color is also beautiful.</li>
            <li>This is my very favorite lip balm!  </li>
            <li>I loved this stuff as soon as I applied it to my lips.</li>
            <li>I love how nice and bright my lips look after using this!</li>
            <li>Product was smooth to apply, non-sticky in nature, and had a beautiful tint.  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>great, very moisturizing , and beautiful color</li>
            <li>Nice product</li>
            <li>I am really amazed by all the great reviews!</li>
            <li>The smell and color are nice.</li>
            <li>I love the color.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely my favorite lip shade in Burt&#x27;s Bees tinted lip balm.</li>
            <li>I love all of Burt&#x27;s bees lip products.  </li>
            <li>Many times, I apply this over lipstick and it does not smear.  </li>
            <li>This is perfect, I am bummed that I cannot find it in any local stores...</li>
            <li>Love the moisture, not sticky at all.</li>
            <li>This feels like a lotion for your lips, because it is incredibly moisturizing, which I love, and I love how it is long wearing.</li>
            <li>This is like a mild hot pink...way too bright, for my taste.  </li>
            <li>We love this because of the pretty color and the smoothness, but even more importantly, it&#x27;s on a list of non-toxic lip products.  </li>
            <li>The tint is so light, you cannot see it.</li>
            <li>Light fruity/floral taste - almost no taste which I prefer over the minty</li>
            <li>I originally got this as a part of a gift...</li>
            <li>this was one I never considered buying for myself considering the higher price range and of all the Burt&#x27;s Bees stuff I enjoyed</li>
            <li>and your lips will look pink, plump and healthy for a good amount of time.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly (with somewhat of an oily feel) and has a pleasant scent, however you would need to reapply it often as it&#x27;s not that moisturizing (or lasts long on your lips) compared to blistex lip balm.</li>
            <li>Overall, good product</li>
            <li>purchased this in Petunia and like it a whole lot more.  </li>
            <li>But this one I love so much, I went out and bought two more (Pink Blossom and Rose).</li>
            <li>(THE COLOR SHADE IS PRETTY!)</li>
            <li>/&gt;• DOES NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE OR VERY MOISTURIZING</li>
            <li>My lips aren&#x27;t too light and it leaves a nice pink on them.</li>
            <li>This product wasn&#x27;t worth the $10.</li>
            <li>This was the second Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm color that I bought since I loved the sheer light color and easy application of the first.</li>
            <li>The color is sheer and smooth and not sticky at all, which I love!&lt;br /&gt;The little case the lip balm tube comes in is very cute, I don&#x27;t want to get rid of it!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this and will definitely be coming back to it when I run out :)</li>
            <li>I am truly bewildered by all the positive comments!</li>
            <li>but was super happy to at least find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s tinted enough that it highlights my natural light mauve lips to look like a dewy Tea Rose color without looking like I slathered on layers of lipstick.</li>
            <li>The Pink Blossom looks like dark rose in the tube but doesn&#x27;t even show a change on my lips, and I&#x27;m fair.</li>
            <li>The only thing that could be better is the tint.</li>
            <li>so let&#x27;s be honest, if you want to maintain color, reapplication is expected but go over your lips twice and put on a gel vitamin e oil (I like the Vitamin Gels from Bite)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty color and is nice but definitely a different formula than the traditional, colorless beeswax lip balm that they sell.</li>
            <li>I really like the lip balm, keeps my lips moist and smooth and has just enough color that I don&#x27;t need to carry or use a lipstick.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and didn&#x27;t have to reapply often.</li>
            <li>This shade is very neutral so it matches well with any outfit.</li>
            <li>maybe it&#x27;s too much shimmer??</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Very natural.</li>
            <li>The color is true to the advertisement (some colors look different after application, not this, looks the same as on the packaging).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a paler, more natural pink that I&#x27;m not as worried about putting on dry lips.</li>
            <li>It adds a touch of natural color and tons of moisture.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Trying this made me completely change my mind.</li>
            <li>Natural looking pigments -</li>
            <li>I was hoping to replace the impossible-to-find Soft Tints lip balm, because I want spf and don&#x27;t like lipstick.</li>
            <li>I was hoping it would taste better, it isn&#x27;t intolerable but it&#x27;s not exactly pleasant.</li>
            <li>The color shows up even for someone with darker pink lips and it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Its a high quality product compared to other lip products.  </li>

            <li> Nothing too crazy, just gives a slighter pink tint to your lips.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I just learned of this carmine additive and it quite frankly grosses me out.</li>
            <li> If your lips are chapped at all, the color gets caught in your dry skin and your lips look awful and gross.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> There is no shimmer, which I hate.</li>

            <li> PINK BLOSSOM&lt;br /&gt;• BURNS MY LIPS SLIGHTLY&lt;br /&gt;• DOES NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE OR VERY MOISTURIZING&lt;br /&gt;• ALMOST NO VISIBLE COLOR (THE COLOR SHADE IS PRETTY!)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty color and is nice but definitely a different formula than the traditional, colorless beeswax lip balm that they sell. I prefer the traditional to the tinted because the tinted feels like a very thin formula that is less hydrating. Overall, good product but I probably won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> Sheer pink color. Enhances your lip color but not that noticeable. Color payoff is minimal as you would expect from a lip balm.  Goes on smoothly (with somewhat of an oily feel) and has a pleasant scent, however you would need to reapply it often as it&#x27;s not that moisturizing (or lasts long on your lips) compared to blistex lip balm.</li>
            <li> Really like the way the moisture this gives to my lips, but the color is not great.</li>
            <li> Product was smooth to apply, non-sticky in nature, and had a beautiful tint.  Product stayed on lips for 2 hours, re-application needed.  I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I love the color.  Nothing too crazy, just gives a slighter pink tint to your lips.</li>
            <li> great, very moisturizing , and beautiful color</li>
            <li> This is definitely my favorite lip shade in Burt&#x27;s Bees tinted lip balm. The color shows up even for someone with darker pink lips and it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I love all of Burt&#x27;s bees lip products.  Its a high quality product compared to other lip products.  Light color without thick fake looking stuff smeared on lips.</li>
            <li> The color is very slight and darker than expected, but looks really natural. Very moisturizing and didn&#x27;t have to reapply often.</li>
            <li> This is my very favorite lip balm!  I must have on lipstick or lip balm on at all times for dry lips and this is the best I&#x27;ve used.  Many times, I apply this over lipstick and it does not smear.  This color and Hibiscus are great colors!</li>
            <li> I have such a hard time finding an everyday color that goes well with my skin tone but is &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; enough in color that I can keep my makeup simple.&lt;br /&gt;This definitely does the trick for me, I got mine in Pink Blossom. The color is sheer and smooth and not sticky at all, which I love!&lt;br /&gt;The little case the lip balm tube comes in is very cute, I don&#x27;t want to get rid of it!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this and will definitely be coming back to it when I run out :)</li>
            <li> This was advertised as being 1 or 2 dollars, but beware, shipping and handling will make it about 6 dollars. This feels like a lotion for your lips, because it is incredibly moisturizing, which I love, and I love how it is long wearing. The only thing that could be better is the tint. The tint is so light, you cannot see it. If you want color, I recommend you get a very dark color.</li>
            <li> This is perfect, I am bummed that I cannot find it in any local stores...but was super happy to at least find it on Amazon. This shade is very neutral so it matches well with any outfit.</li>
            <li> I hate it because it is the exact same color as my natural lips. So there was no color change when I put it on.</li>
            <li> tint wasn&#x27;t as dark of a pink that I was hoping for...maybe it&#x27;s too much shimmer?? just looks like a shiny pale pink on me.</li>
            <li> Nice product but didn&#x27;t work for my dark ethnic lips. Still looking for something that will help lighten my nicotine darkened lips.</li>
            <li> Definitely a pink color. Love the moisture, not sticky at all. Smells like lipstick, not like Burt&#x27;s Bees.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE that the color is just a hint. Very natural.</li>
            <li> I know I shouldn&#x27;t be writing a review this soon because I literally just purchased this lip balm from Walmart a few hours ago. I got it in pink blossom, as soon as I saw it I knew it was the color for me. I loved this stuff as soon as I applied it to my lips. The color is true to the advertisement (some colors look different after application, not this, looks the same as on the packaging). There is no shimmer, which I hate. It adds a touch of natural color and tons of moisture. I love it!</li>
            <li> I gave this to my daughter, who asked for it for Christmas.  We love this because of the pretty color and the smoothness, but even more importantly, it&#x27;s on a list of non-toxic lip products.  Perfect combination.</li>
            <li> I originally got this as a part of a gift... I like Burt&#x27;s Bees stuff and my friend put together an assortment of their products. I actually got to try every one of their lip products... this was one I never considered buying for myself considering the higher price range and of all the Burt&#x27;s Bees stuff I enjoyed, I usually disliked their usual lip balms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trying this made me completely change my mind. I hate the original. I hate the shimmer sticks. But this one I love so much, I went out and bought two more (Pink Blossom and Rose). Very moisturizing. Natural looking pigments - it&#x27;s tinted enough that it highlights my natural light mauve lips to look like a dewy Tea Rose color without looking like I slathered on layers of lipstick. Light fruity/floral taste - almost no taste which I prefer over the minty ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is still lip balm so let&#x27;s be honest, if you want to maintain color, reapplication is expected but go over your lips twice and put on a gel vitamin e oil (I like the Vitamin Gels from Bite) and your lips will look pink, plump and healthy for a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> This was the second Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm color that I bought since I loved the sheer light color and easy application of the first. Unfortunately I just learned of this carmine additive and it quite frankly grosses me out. So into the trash go all of my carmine (crushed beetle dye) contaminated makeup.</li>
            <li> I really like the lip balm, keeps my lips moist and smooth and has just enough color that I don&#x27;t need to carry or use a lipstick. It&#x27;s my third tube of the Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm.</li>
            <li> I love how nice and bright my lips look after using this! My lips aren&#x27;t too light and it leaves a nice pink on them. I use this every day now!</li>
            <li> I am really amazed by all the great reviews! This stuff has an unpleasantly cake-y texture, yet stays on for less than half an hour. But my biggest complaint is the lack of colour. The Pink Blossom looks like dark rose in the tube but doesn&#x27;t even show a change on my lips, and I&#x27;m fair. I was hoping to replace the impossible-to-find Soft Tints lip balm, because I want spf and don&#x27;t like lipstick. This product wasn&#x27;t worth the $10. I am truly bewildered by all the positive comments! Still looking...</li>
            <li> This is like a mild hot pink...way too bright, for my taste.  If your lips are chapped at all, the color gets caught in your dry skin and your lips look awful and gross.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this in Petunia and like it a whole lot more.  It&#x27;s a paler, more natural pink that I&#x27;m not as worried about putting on dry lips.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would taste better, it isn&#x27;t intolerable but it&#x27;s not exactly pleasant. The smell and color are nice. and it works well as a balm.</li>
            <li> It saves my lip, the color is also beautiful.</li>
