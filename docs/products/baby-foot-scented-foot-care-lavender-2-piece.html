            <li>His Podiatrist was impressed the his new &amp;#34;baby feet&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product and will purchase again.</li>
            <li>My feet started peeling sooner (day four) and peeled more than before.  </li>
            <li>- I won&#x27;t be able to hide these hideous hooves in sneakers for that event...</li>
            <li>However I still felt like it could be better.</li>
            <li>and I figured I would use more than one application.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s just more that needs to come off my heels before I have baby feet....</li>
            <li>I love it and it worked wonders on my hubby&#x27;s feet.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This works magically.</li>
            <li>There will be flakes/pieces of skin everywhere, so it&#x27;s best to try and contain them as much as possible.</li>
            <li>More of a strong chemical smell than I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much I got one for my husband as well.</li>
            <li>Easy instructions.</li>
            <li>My hubby was in need of some foot care and this fit the bill as it was so easy.  </li>
            <li>Great present for the guy or gal that have everything.</li>
            <li>Let me tell you this product worked fantastic for me.</li>
            <li>Worth it though because my feet look fabulous!</li>
            <li>It took me weeks to get my wife to actually use the stuff, but it works great.</li>
            <li>You might as well buy Holika Holika&#x27;s similar foot peel, but what is great about this order is the service from the company.</li>
            <li>My feet are significantly smoother, as well as</li>
            <li>Selling company (123 beauty) also was great in resolving a minor issue with shipment.</li>
            <li>I was uber excited to try and review this product.</li>
            <li>For best results, soak your feet in warm water for about 10 minutes and dry them, then be sure to wear socks over the bags so that as much solution as possible comes into contact with your feet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving the product five stars because it is painless, easy to use and is more effective any other product I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Very unusual product !  </li>
            <li>does exactly what it claims it will!</li>
            <li>My feet were very smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth it for touch up use.</li>
            <li>The results were totally worth it.</li>
            <li>to use, fun to help the peeling process and in the end</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s fun to watch how much skin peels leaving your feet smooth like a baby&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>right before I start wearing my sandals.</li>
            <li>The only difference being that I soaked my feet in warm water for 30 min first.  </li>
            <li>The first time, I did not soak my feet, I just put the booties on after a shower.  </li>
            <li>and I needed to order more to get the last layer off.  </li>
            <li>so I read the reviews and decided I&#x27;d try it -  my daughter&#x27;s getting married in August</li>
            <li>I soaked my feet in hot water for 1/2 hour before I used the product.</li>
            <li>It did exactly what it said it would do.</li>
            <li>First time, I followed the directions and kept the booties on for 1 hour.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Baby Feet!</li>
            <li>So, in love with this product, I first received it as a gift, then a year later I purchased it myself.</li>
            <li>Late winter is the best time to use these as your feet are still covered and no one will question your possible leprosy when your skin is shedding everywhere.</li>
            <li>This is my first time I will be using this, so I really don&#x27;t know what to expect.</li>
            <li>The fissures are not completely gone, but are significantly better.</li>
            <li>you feet before and every other day after is the key to great results.</li>
            <li>Both times, feet started peeling after three days and was pretty much over by 1 week.</li>
            <li>The first time I initially used it did a great job with removing a lot of of the dead skin from my feet.</li>
            <li>Another reviewer has the ultimate key to making these work best: soak your feet prior to applying, leave on for around 1 1/2-2 hours, soak your feet after removing, and continue soaking your feet for 30 minutes to 1 hour daily after the first 2-3 days.</li>
            <li>I felt a slight &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; on the top of my right foot.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is a knock off of the real thing or what.  </li>
            <li>Perform better than expected.</li>
            <li>- I really wanted this to work.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product, it works!</li>
            <li>My feet are much smoother now.</li>
            <li>He works 60+ hours a week, on his feet the whole time, and his feet were so calloused.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>IT REALLY WORKS.</li>
            <li>I love this product and have already had several friends order it after they saw how soft my feet were.</li>
            <li>I went the extra mile and applied lotion to my feet in the morning after my shower then hid the peeling mess in a fresh pair of socks - and at night I washed my feet then applied more lotion and another fresh pair of socks before bed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>All the skin peeled off and it left soft smooth feet.</li>
            <li>Many months later I can say that I may not ever have to, because the upkeep is low maintenance now.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Also, I highly recommend wearing socks to bed every night.</li>
            <li>I finally have real baby foot!!</li>
            <li>There is some light flaking of the skin, but no peeling off like other stated.</li>
            <li>My husband is very pleased because he thought there would be nothing to take all of the dead dry skin off of his feet.</li>
            <li>I just used this last night, followed the directions exactly.</li>
            <li>After a week I thought to myself - this isn&#x27;t gonna work on these feet - they&#x27;re too far gone!  </li>
            <li>Wow !</li>
            <li>Now my feet are so soft!</li>
            <li>At first you may think nothing is going to happen because I didn&#x27;t see any reaction untill 5 days later</li>
            <li>My feet as baby soft indeed!</li>
            <li>It takes about 10-14 days for all the peeling to stop and once it does your feet will be feeling soft.</li>
            <li>In all, I peeled off about 3 complete layers of skin.</li>
            <li>Now, the calluses are almost completely gone.  </li>
            <li>Works well, but the very thickest callouses on my heels were not completely removed the first or second time using the product.  </li>
            <li>and I need to get these packs fairly frequently</li>
            <li>A full layer over my whole foot peeled off both times, but I still have fairly thick callouses on my heels.</li>
            <li>It has been almost 2 months since I last used the product and my feet are still soft.</li>
            <li>After 5 days my feet started to peel and a week later they are still at it-baby soft underneath.</li>
            <li>First of all it smelled different from the other times I&#x27;ve used the product.</li>
            <li>Will buy from the other company whose product really works.</li>
            <li>It will gently remove dead skin and restore your feet to their natural state.  </li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical of this product, but it is amazing!  </li>

            <li> It says 2 count, but only received 1 set rather than 2  as expected...</li>
            <li> I cannot believe it took this long to discover Baby Foot.</li>
            <li> They were not completely gone, but they were thinner.  </li>
            <li> Week 2, nothing but MASSIVELY dry and cracked feet.</li>
            <li> Even if you don&#x27;t think you have dry skin on your feet</li>
            <li> I have horribly dry feet.</li>
            <li> Not only did my foot start peeling after 3 days, as I  pulled off one layer, the next day I would peel off another layer of dead skin.</li>
            <li> So I wait a few weeks and did a second treatment which is definitely what sealed the softness of my feet</li>
            <li> Will they turn back the clock in time for darling daughter to prance down the aisle?  </li>
            <li> Only down side is the skin was every where in the house and sweeping was a twice a day thing.</li>
            <li> The key is to soak your feet in plain water for an hour prior to applying the foot solution and then soaking them every other day as well.</li>
            <li> the thick dead cell from high heel was peeled totally in about 7 to 10 days.</li>

            <li> Usually I need the tape to keep the booties on, but with this product I could barely get my foot into the bag.</li>
            <li> The thickness of the skin that peels off does seem to be proportional to the amount of callousing, so that a fairly thick layer peeled off my heels and a very thin layer off the top of my feet.</li>
            <li> So i read all the reviews and decided to take other users advice</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently on day 5, and haven&#x27;t noticed the first bit of peeling, but my feet feel very weird when they touch each other in bed.</li>
            <li> Prior to use I had thick calluses on the bottoms of my feet.  </li>
            <li> It was gross but the extremely thick callouses on my heals were gone gone gone.</li>
            <li> About one and a half weeks.</li>
            <li> The price is almost half of what I have paid in the past with other retailers.</li>
            <li> I just wish it was a little cheaper since my feet look a mess</li>
            <li> it just made my feet more dry and miserable.</li>

            <li> Have these this product in the past, so I know how well they work.</li>
            <li> Does the job and as works as described, if not better.</li>
            <li> It was weird walking on the floor and actually feeling it under my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soaking</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but day 5 the dry skin started peeling off and did so for a week.</li>
            <li> The peeling started and continued for at least a week.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I just used this last night, followed the directions exactly. I felt a slight &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; on the top of my right foot. When I was all done I found a burn on my foot! I will attach a pic if possible, but be forewarned! I will update if necessary.</li>
            <li> As a guy I&#x27;ve always been reluctant to get a pedicure.  I dont like people messing with my feet. This product delivers. I started seeing the peeling by day 3. It takes about 10-14 days for all the peeling to stop and once it does your feet will be feeling soft. Easy instructions. Hardest part was not applying moisturizers or picking at it.</li>
            <li> Great present for the guy or gal that have everything.</li>
            <li> No peeling like it did back in 2013 when I bought it. I don&#x27;t know if this is a knock off of the real thing or what.  But I will not be buying this from this company again. Will buy from the other company whose product really works.</li>
            <li> Have these this product in the past, so I know how well they work. Perform better than expected. Does the job and as works as described, if not better. The price is great. The price is almost half of what I have paid in the past with other retailers.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Really works great!</li>
            <li> Would definitely buy this again!!! Great to get ready for spring and sandals!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best foot treatment I have ever used.  It will gently remove dead skin and restore your feet to their natural state.  If you wear sandles, any type of running or athletic sports-you will greatly appreciate this foot treatment!!</li>
            <li> It says 2 count, but only received 1 set rather than 2  as expected...description misleading. Product worked well.</li>
            <li> does exactly what it claims it will! awesome!  a great buy at the price, better than a pedicure thats for sure</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet. Trying to figure out when I want my feet to be peeling, so it may be at the end of the summer that I try this out. This is my first time I will be using this, so I really don&#x27;t know what to expect.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe it took this long to discover Baby Foot. Let me tell you this product worked fantastic for me. I became obsessed with the peeling part. After applying the product,  I also did the foot soak as recommended. Boy o boy!!! Not only did my foot start peeling after 3 days, as I  pulled off one layer, the next day I would peel off another layer of dead skin. In all, I peeled off about 3 complete layers of skin. Finally something that works.</li>
            <li> My hubby was in need of some foot care and this fit the bill as it was so easy.  His feet were really rough.  His Podiatrist was impressed the his new &amp;#34;baby feet&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I love this product and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> These are amazing!  I&#x27;ve used them twice now.  The first time, I did not soak my feet, I just put the booties on after a shower.  The results were great.  My feet started peeling on day five and peeled for a week.  My feet were very smooth and soft.  Prior to use I had thick calluses on the bottoms of my feet.  They were not completely gone, but they were thinner.  I waited a month and then used the product a second time.  The only difference being that I soaked my feet in warm water for 30 min first.  My feet started peeling sooner (day four) and peeled more than before.  Now, the calluses are almost completely gone.  I&#x27;m giving the product five stars because it is painless, easy to use and is more effective any other product I&#x27;ve tried.  And I&#x27;ve tried multiple lotions, creams, gels, files, and shavers.</li>
            <li> For best results, soak your feet in warm water for about 10 minutes and dry them, then be sure to wear socks over the bags so that as much solution as possible comes into contact with your feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice anything for 3 days, then the calluses began to flake off at a scary rate!  Plan to wear socks for 3-4 days and to do some extra scrubbing!  The non-calloused areas were not affected at all after the 1st layer of dead skin flaked off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately my calluses were over 1/8\\&quot; thick and I needed to order more to get the last layer off.  Another reviewer did say that you could get 2 treatments out of the booties if you taped them up and wrapped them well in the foil package.  I have tried this and the solution will work the 2nd time, but peeling will take longer to start and the 2nd peeling is not as aggressive.  It&#x27;s well worth it for touch up use.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff. I was skeptical before I tried it. The peeling took forever though. About one and a half weeks. The results were totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Week 2, nothing but MASSIVELY dry and cracked feet. There is some light flaking of the skin, but no peeling off like other stated. My feet look like hell with no end in sight. I did the treatment a second time in hopes that it would start the process up...it just made my feet more dry and miserable. Ug</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d be stuck with those nasty looking appendages for yet another year... so I read the reviews and decided I&#x27;d try it -  my daughter&#x27;s getting married in August - I won&#x27;t be able to hide these hideous hooves in sneakers for that event... God forbid I decide to have a few alcoholic beverages and kick off the shoes in a drunken race to the dance floor...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was ecstatic when the box arrived - I couldn&#x27;t wait to try this stuff out.  So i read all the reviews and decided to take other users advice - I really wanted this to work.  I soaked my feet in hot water for 1/2 hour before I used the product. Then I followed the directions on the box to the T praying for a miracle cure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then... I waited... and waited... and waited.  After a week I thought to myself - this isn&#x27;t gonna work on these feet - they&#x27;re too far gone!  but... on the 7th day my miracle arrived.  The peeling started and continued for at least a week.  It was disgusting to say the least.  I had to wear socks to bed to keep the flaking mess out of the sheets - GROSS! My toes peeled, my arch peeled, my heels peeled -  I didn&#x27;t know if it was ever going to stop! With every shower the skin would slough off in sheets.  I started to get concerned thinking this was never going to end!  I went the extra mile and applied lotion to my feet in the morning after my shower then hid the peeling mess in a fresh pair of socks - and at night I washed my feet then applied more lotion and another fresh pair of socks before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now thrilled to announce that the lowland gorilla feet are now GONE!  It works!  Now on to the Collagen supplements.  Will they turn back the clock in time for darling daughter to prance down the aisle?  We&#x27;ll see...</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!! It has been almost 2 months since I last used the product and my feet are still soft. The first time I initially used it did a great job with removing a lot of of the dead skin from my feet. However I still felt like it could be better. So I wait a few weeks and did a second treatment which is definitely what sealed the softness of my feet</li>
            <li> Product  came in a timely manner and worked great.</li>
            <li> My husband is very pleased because he thought there would be nothing to take all of the dead dry skin off of his feet. Even after thousands of pedicures by the best. Thank you Baby Foot!!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but day 5 the dry skin started peeling off and did so for a week. Highly recommend this product, it works!</li>
            <li> I used these and nothing happened. No peeling like everyone claimed. I reread the package to see if I did something wrong and it appears either my feet are too tough or it is just a scam.</li>
            <li> This product is AWESOME. Did not expect it to work. I was wrong it removed all the dead skin. Follow the directions and you can not go wrong.</li>
            <li> It did exactly what it said it would do. All the skin peeled off and it left soft smooth feet. Only down side is the skin was every where in the house and sweeping was a twice a day thing. Worth it though because my feet look fabulous!</li>
            <li> Very unusual product !  I read All the reviews before ordering .  Then followed the directions and customer suggestions and it worked great !  Just know you need to commit to about 10 days to activate  the peeling and the peeling goes on for about 5 of those ten days .  Even if you don&#x27;t think you have dry skin on your feet these hebs and enzymes find it !  Wow !</li>
            <li> Was a little skeptical about how well this product would work, and I was pleasantly surprised. My feet are significantly smoother, as well as my boyfriends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I work 50+ hours in a hospital, always running around. My feet are much smoother now. I have a tattoo on my foot, but I couldn&#x27;t say if this damages the ink at all since I covered the tattoo with a dressing (some chemical peels will fade, and I was being cautious.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; He works 60+ hours a week, on his feet the whole time, and his feet were so calloused. He even had fissures in them. The fissures are not completely gone, but are significantly better. We are doing a second treatment for him now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done everything before for exfoliating my severe heel. everything was just temperate and not that work. But it&#x27;s miracle! I finally have real baby foot!! the thick dead cell from high heel was peeled totally in about 7 to 10 days.</li>
            <li> Loved it and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical of this product, but it is amazing!  I could not believe how much dead skin that it removed.  Now my feet are so soft!</li>
            <li> It works as expected. After 5 days my feet started to peel and a week later they are still at it-baby soft underneath.</li>
            <li> 4 days post use - my feet began to MOLT!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;easy to use, fun to help the peeling process and in the end my rough &amp;#34;picky&amp;#34; heels were GONE GONE GONE.&lt;br /&gt;Bought another immediately after for 3 mos from now.</li>
            <li> Took 5 days before the peeling started but once it started - game on. It was gross but the extremely thick callouses on my heals were gone gone gone. I love this product and have already had several friends order it after they saw how soft my feet were. It was weird walking on the floor and actually feeling it under my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soaking you feet before and every other day after is the key to great results. Read the reviews and follow the tips left by others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definetely reorder this product.</li>
            <li> This is my second order of this product. The two pack was a good price and I figured I would use more than one application.  Works well, but the very thickest callouses on my heels were not completely removed the first or second time using the product.  First time, I followed the directions and kept the booties on for 1 hour.  Second time, about a month later, I left them on for two hours.  Both times, feet started peeling after three days and was pretty much over by 1 week. A full layer over my whole foot peeled off both times, but I still have fairly thick callouses on my heels. The thickness of the skin that peels off does seem to be proportional to the amount of callousing, so that a fairly thick layer peeled off my heels and a very thin layer off the top of my feet. There&#x27;s just more that needs to come off my heels before I have baby feet.... I&#x27;m going to try re-using the booties (which another reviewer suggested you could do if they were sealed well), but applying just to my heels where there are still calloused.</li>
            <li> The product is good but one of pack was leaking the gel inside even the package was not open at all</li>
            <li> Product works as described. Selling company (123 beauty) also was great in resolving a minor issue with shipment. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I only received one pair in box with no tape. Box had obviously been opened.</li>
            <li> Great product. It really works.</li>
            <li> I love it and it worked wonders on my hubby&#x27;s feet.  I will definitely buy again, probably right before I start wearing my sandals.</li>
            <li> Awesome! My feet have been reborn! Lol! Read the directions and adhere to them. Expect to see a horrid sight during the shedding process. I knew what to expect as I have watched a few women do before and afters on youtube.com. Check it out for yourself before you purchase. I saw my feel swell and tighten a bit after the initial application.  Once my feet started to peel,&lt;br /&gt;relief came.  So for that reason only will I give this a 4/5.  I don&#x27;t think I will do this again.  Many months later I can say that I may not ever have to, because the upkeep is low maintenance now. Now my feet are a joy to rub! Thanks Baby Feet!</li>
            <li> I must say. It works !!!!</li>
            <li> It took me weeks to get my wife to actually use the stuff, but it works great. Calluses that have been there 20 years peeled away painlessly.</li>
            <li> So, in love with this product, I first received it as a gift, then a year later I purchased it myself. I loved it so much I got one for my husband as well. At first you may think nothing is going to happen because I didn&#x27;t see any reaction untill 5 days later however when it did begin to Peel it was like a sock of skin. (Eww,  I know) Don&#x27;t Peel it per the instructions but it is oh so tempting.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I just wish it was a little cheaper since my feet look a mess and I need to get these packs fairly frequently</li>
            <li> I was uber excited to try and review this product. IT REALLY WORKS. The key is to soak your feet in plain water for an hour prior to applying the foot solution and then soaking them every other day as well. The soaking speeds up the process. My feet as baby soft indeed!</li>
            <li> I have horribly dry feet. I blame it on wearing flip flops or open shoes every day. This works magically. Plus it&#x27;s fun to watch how much skin peels leaving your feet smooth like a baby&#x27;s. I swear by this stuff. I do it once every couple of months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Baby Foot before, and this product seemed off. First of all it smelled different from the other times I&#x27;ve used the product. More of a strong chemical smell than I&#x27;m used to. The plastic booties were also way smaller. Usually I need the tape to keep the booties on, but with this product I could barely get my foot into the bag. They also leaked through the socks and were dripping onto the floor. I&#x27;m currently on day 5, and haven&#x27;t noticed the first bit of peeling, but my feet feel very weird when they touch each other in bed. Almost like they&#x27;re coated in a thin layer of plastic. Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> You might as well buy Holika Holika&#x27;s similar foot peel, but what is great about this order is the service from the company. There was a misunderstanding on the count, and they remedied it immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The peel is very effective. Expect shedding for a solid two weeks.</li>
            <li> I left mine on for almost 2 hours. Nothing happened for 6 days, then I had Zombie feet, disgusting skin everywhere from heel to toes. Now I have baby feet. I loved it.</li>
            <li> This is my third time buying these bad boys and I would repurchase again and again. Late winter is the best time to use these as your feet are still covered and no one will question your possible leprosy when your skin is shedding everywhere. Another reviewer has the ultimate key to making these work best: soak your feet prior to applying, leave on for around 1 1/2-2 hours, soak your feet after removing, and continue soaking your feet for 30 minutes to 1 hour daily after the first 2-3 days. Then brace yourself for the sick pleasure of watching your skin peel off in sheets. Also, I highly recommend wearing socks to bed every night. There will be flakes/pieces of skin everywhere, so it&#x27;s best to try and contain them as much as possible.</li>
            <li> Will purchase this product again! It does just what it says it is going to do.</li>
