            <li>but i liked the results that I got with the product.</li>

            <li>I love love love this face wash!!</li>

            <li>Just finding more and more things I love!</li>
            <li>If we had more of these family businesses, this country would be flourishing more and more!  </li>
            <li>It worked okay.</li>
            <li>It caused my face to break out more.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to get rid off them.</li>
            <li>and it brought out some more acne</li>
            <li>those product were what was causing more acne and stress to my skin.</li>
            <li>I am glad I have found my solution.</li>
            <li>Make sure when you buy make up your use a non comedogenic product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love the way my skin feels</li>
            <li>I have suffered with acne for 15+ years &amp; like many others, have tried everything under the sun.</li>
            <li>&amp; I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and my skin tone is looking more even.  </li>
            <li>; products are safe</li>
            <li>started to break out much more.</li>
            <li>Really detox your skin.. works great</li>
            <li>I also would love to see an SLS-free version.</li>
            <li>So glad I found diva stuff!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But I have already placed 2 more orders for diva stuff.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff-it works my face is clearer than it has been in a year.</li>
            <li>Mostly, I&#x27;m now dealing with acne scars.  </li>
            <li>I like tea tree oil and a lemon mix better.</li>
            <li>I received two samples in the mail (acne face mask and a scrubbie) and have loved it so much I&#x27;m buying those items as well!</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is made right here in the U.S.A!!</li>
            <li>just start with one wash a day, and make sure you have a good, natural moisturizer to apply when you finish washing.</li>
            <li>This face wash is very gentle, yet effective at treating acne because it contains sulfur.</li>
            <li>An extremely effective and gentle cleanser!</li>
            <li>It certainly isn&#x27;t Diva Stuff&#x27;s fault that I didn&#x27;t read the labeling more closely, but it would have been nice if this ingredient was listed using its full name.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the free samples ladies!!</li>
            <li>I have a huge beef with amazon not requiring companies to list product ingredients, and this is a prime example.</li>
            <li>I coupled this product with Alpha Hydroxy Serum 14% and am using Eucerin cream at night for a moisturizer and Neutrogena Oil Free moisturizer with sunscreen during the day.</li>
            <li>8- Make up glides on smooth, no bumps,</li>
            <li>But so far sooo good.</li>
            <li>The bottle is a very nice size, and you&#x27;ll be set for months  with this one, depending on how much you use and how much you suffer from acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it really helps keep the smell and wetness to a minimum!!!</li>
            <li>The smell is very powerful of sulfer, and it doesn&#x27;t lather up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for one month now and have significant clearing of my cystic acne</li>
            <li>It is wonderful to have found a product with such safe ingredients that actually does what it claims to do!</li>
            <li>within the first two days of use, I could see all the pimples raised on top of surface.</li>
            <li>Right now I am extremely impressed and will do an update in a few weeks.</li>
            <li>Combined with one of Kym&#x27;s acne-preventing face creams (like the Hibiscus Lift-MY FAVORITE,) it really packs a punch towards pesky acne.  </li>
            <li>This cleanser is not bad after all.</li>
            <li>Great for clearing acne and other spots</li>
            <li>Great product would recommend and purchase again and other products.</li>
            <li>My face felt fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>This product helped with my fight against mild acne.  </li>
            <li>I am thrilled with this product - having combination skin that is quite dry in some places while still prone to whiteheads/breakouts makes it challenging to find something that has the right balance.  </li>
            <li>This detoxing wash is working well - it has brought whiteheads completely up to the surface so that they were super easy to remove!  </li>
            <li>It really forces the blackheads to the surface so you can get them easily.</li>
            <li>I was a little disappointed that the ingredients weren&#x27;t exactly like the website lists because I wanted something with a good bit of sulfur in it for my acne but on the bottle the last ingredient is sulfur, but it works absolutely wonderful, my skin is bright and clear, my acne scars are almost gone which is great because I am getting married soon and didnt want to have to wear foundation, overall I am happy with this product, it works like its supposed too.</li>
            <li>I had seen alot of other &amp;#34;Charcoal&amp;#34; products I wanted to try, but when I saw Diva Stuff, and all the great ingredients that were included, and the positive reviews, I decided to give it a try...</li>
            <li>I found charcoal to be quite amazing to what it can do, so I thought perhaps if I find a product that is a daily charcoal face wash</li>
            <li>Impurities will get pulled to the surface, then after a few days you will be happy.</li>
            <li>I did not find this product useful at all.</li>
            <li>I wanted to go a more organic natural route.</li>
            <li>He wasn&#x27;t thrilled about the name of product, but the stuff actually is helping his skin.</li>
            <li>Stuff Sea Salt Face Wash&amp;#34; and after only 3 days my acne is clearing up nicely</li>
            <li>This product has helped my skin clear up more than anything.</li>
            <li>I always have success with products that have tea trea oil in them, and this one is no exception.  </li>
            <li>to no avail, so what would the harm be in trying something a bit more natural?</li>
            <li>I have many older sisters who went through acne when they were teens, but as they got older their acne cleared up.</li>
            <li>The smell of the product is refreshing, but this product splashes if you are not careful.</li>
            <li>This will not dry your skin out like most products would either.</li>
            <li>I have the occasional, hormone-related monthly acne outburst, and when good old Aunt Flow strikes again, I reach for this face wash.  </li>
            <li>This wash makes a lather that feels thick and smooth when applying, has no unpleasant scent, and easily rinses clean!</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend it from my own personal arsenal.</li>
            <li>I HAVE NEVER HAD SO MUCH ACNE IN MY LIFE!</li>
            <li>&#x27;s to the first time.</li>
            <li>I was amazed to see that this works so much better than any brand name facial cleanser you can buy in the stores.</li>
            <li>I will be come back for more.</li>
            <li>With this stuff,I just had regular breakouts and more of them.</li>
            <li>After the first use I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>Thanks diva stuff!</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>Thanks A lot!</li>
            <li>If you have a skin type similar to mine you might want to start there :-)</li>
            <li>I thought I had rosacea for the longest time until i stopped using Clean n Clear, Neutrogena, etc.</li>
            <li>My face feels so clean &amp; soft after using.</li>
            <li>I started looking for natural ways to clean my skin</li>
            <li>My skin has felt soft and clean after each use.</li>
            <li>I like the way my skin felt soft and pores clean.</li>
            <li>Very gentle for the skin and works very well...</li>
            <li>My skin is super sensitive &amp; I will break out over nothing.</li>
            <li>I still get acne occasionally but they seem to go away very quickly.</li>
            <li>Will certainly buy again</li>
            <li>Within the first time using it (along with the charcoal and bamboo extract scrubbies) my acne began to clear up!!</li>
            <li>, cheeks had 3 deep zits, chin huge O zit that had burst.&lt;br /&gt;Day</li>
            <li>This product does not foam very well and does not seem like it&#x27;s even getting rid of any dirt on my face.</li>
            <li>I used every product to include proactive and they didn&#x27;t really help.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>and you can really feel it working</li>
            <li>Makes your face feel clean and not dry.</li>
            <li>This works and is gentle, too.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is doing much in terms of my acne.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased this if I saw that it contained SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate), because I know that is an ingredient that doesn&#x27;t work well for me and really dries my skin out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Kym is a genius  when it come to all things anti-acne and really, this is a product sent from heaven.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very tricky regimen.</li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>I have never had such success with ANY product!</li>
            <li>was using proactive before with limited results and wanted to try something more natural.</li>
            <li>is my first time using Diva stuff and Natural face wash</li>
            <li>So far this product is working for my acne and controlling my oil very well!</li>
            <li>Service was impeccable, but alas the cleanser was too drying.</li>
            <li>I had minimal breakouts but would break out about once a month, after using this I have full blown acne!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used more than half the bottle and haven&#x27;t seen a change in appearance even after a month of use.</li>
            <li>I like this facewash, but it really doesn&#x27;t do much for my ocassional adult acne.  </li>
            <li>, no new pimples have showed up which is a huge surprise.  </li>
            <li>sometimes looks greasy) and a light non colored loose powder.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>My skin is a tough one, so I didn&#x27;t have miracle results by any means when it came to my cystic acne, but it smells good and cleanses well.</li>
            <li>Really helps balance my skin and helps it stay clear.</li>
            <li>The damaged skin looks smoother and to be healing faster then normally.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin as badly as normal acne treatments, I have combination skin and mild acne</li>
            <li>I usually do not write reviews so here</li>
            <li>Areas of eczema have completely gone away as well!</li>
            <li>Whether you are a teenager or have adult acne, this works!.</li>
            <li>I was only able to use it for 2 days before it dried my face out so much I had to stop usage.</li>
            <li>Initially no results after 2 weeks of consistent use once a day.  </li>
            <li>I AM 26 years old, have been using this product about two weeks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 26 yrs old and have suffered from acne since I was 13.</li>
            <li>I am 27 years old and still suffering from acne.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also encroaching on 30 and have developed hormonal/cystic acne along my jaw line and neck.</li>
            <li>I am trying to completely get away from synthetics and chemicals.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural, though.</li>
            <li>I bought this product thinking that it was totally natural</li>
            <li>This may work for people with really oily skin, but I would not recommend it at all for people with normal or dry skin, even if you have problem skin.</li>
            <li>no black heads peeping out of the pores.&lt;br /&gt;Day</li>
            <li>Firstly you can&#x27;t really tell if the ingredients are what is in fact inside the bottle, it could be just Black soap melted and put in a bottle!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m stationed in Okinawa where the humidity is HIGH and causes my face to constantly breakout, the two years I have been here</li>
            <li>I ruined so many shirts and pillowcases in the past when I was using all of those prescription and over the counter acne products that contained that, but I am pleased to say that this and any other Diva stuff products do not contain such harsh ingredients.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t make things better,in the other hand, make it worse.i don&#x27;t use it any more, just waste money.</li>
            <li>I bought this in the summer, hoping it would clear up the cystic acne I only seem to get in the warmer months.</li>
            <li>I barely had any cystic bumps at all.</li>
            <li>and I recently moved away from where we had natural sulfur in our water</li>
            <li>It really does the trick in keeping my face balanced out, and not TOO DRY!!</li>
            <li>Also, for the price, I couldn&#x27;t get that large amount in any other &amp;#34;name brand,&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 41 with cystic acne due to PCOS and I&#x27;ve tried many acne products with very little results.  </li>
            <li>My acne ranges from small little white heads at the surface to deep cystic acne that hurt for weeks and sometimes feels like it has it own pulse.</li>
            <li>so for those who break out a few days after first trying this product, just wait it out.</li>
            <li>I am a first time buyer from this seller and recieved this product a few days ago.</li>
            <li>is purging some, however it is hardly noticeable and it clearing up quickly.</li>
            <li>SKIN TYPE &amp; PROBLEMS: I have sensitive, dry, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>and I see small improvments, my skin normally takes awhile to be affected by new products.</li>
            <li>6- whole face is pink and dry</li>
            <li>The price is a little too much for this product and the labeling on the bottle is ghetto.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have not been able to get rid off them.</li>
            <li> and it brought out some more acne</li>
            <li> those product were what was causing more acne and stress to my skin.</li>
            <li> I am glad I have found my solution.</li>
            <li> Make sure when you buy make up your use a non comedogenic product.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love the way my skin feels</li>
            <li> I have suffered with acne for 15+ years &amp; like many others, have tried everything under the sun.</li>
            <li> &amp; I love it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> and my skin tone is looking more even.  </li>
            <li> ; products are safe</li>
            <li> started to break out much more.</li>
            <li> Really detox your skin.. works great</li>
            <li> I also would love to see an SLS-free version.</li>
            <li> So glad I found diva stuff!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But I have already placed 2 more orders for diva stuff.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff-it works my face is clearer than it has been in a year.</li>
            <li> Mostly, I&#x27;m now dealing with acne scars.  </li>
            <li> I like tea tree oil and a lemon mix better.</li>
            <li> I received two samples in the mail (acne face mask and a scrubbie) and have loved it so much I&#x27;m buying those items as well!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is made right here in the U.S.A!!</li>
            <li> just start with one wash a day, and make sure you have a good, natural moisturizer to apply when you finish washing.</li>
            <li> This face wash is very gentle, yet effective at treating acne because it contains sulfur.</li>
            <li> An extremely effective and gentle cleanser!</li>
            <li> It certainly isn&#x27;t Diva Stuff&#x27;s fault that I didn&#x27;t read the labeling more closely, but it would have been nice if this ingredient was listed using its full name.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the free samples ladies!!</li>
            <li> I have a huge beef with amazon not requiring companies to list product ingredients, and this is a prime example.</li>
            <li> I coupled this product with Alpha Hydroxy Serum 14% and am using Eucerin cream at night for a moisturizer and Neutrogena Oil Free moisturizer with sunscreen during the day.</li>
            <li> 8- Make up glides on smooth, no bumps,</li>
            <li> But so far sooo good.</li>
            <li> The bottle is a very nice size, and you&#x27;ll be set for months  with this one, depending on how much you use and how much you suffer from acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it really helps keep the smell and wetness to a minimum!!!</li>
            <li> The smell is very powerful of sulfer, and it doesn&#x27;t lather up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for one month now and have significant clearing of my cystic acne</li>
            <li> It is wonderful to have found a product with such safe ingredients that actually does what it claims to do!</li>
            <li> within the first two days of use, I could see all the pimples raised on top of surface.</li>
            <li> Right now I am extremely impressed and will do an update in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Combined with one of Kym&#x27;s acne-preventing face creams (like the Hibiscus Lift-MY FAVORITE,) it really packs a punch towards pesky acne.  </li>
            <li> This cleanser is not bad after all.</li>
            <li> Great for clearing acne and other spots</li>
            <li> Great product would recommend and purchase again and other products.</li>
            <li> My face felt fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> This product helped with my fight against mild acne.  </li>
            <li> I am thrilled with this product - having combination skin that is quite dry in some places while still prone to whiteheads/breakouts makes it challenging to find something that has the right balance.  </li>
            <li> This detoxing wash is working well - it has brought whiteheads completely up to the surface so that they were super easy to remove!  </li>
            <li> It really forces the blackheads to the surface so you can get them easily.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed that the ingredients weren&#x27;t exactly like the website lists because I wanted something with a good bit of sulfur in it for my acne but on the bottle the last ingredient is sulfur, but it works absolutely wonderful, my skin is bright and clear, my acne scars are almost gone which is great because I am getting married soon and didnt want to have to wear foundation, overall I am happy with this product, it works like its supposed too.</li>
            <li> I had seen alot of other &amp;#34;Charcoal&amp;#34; products I wanted to try, but when I saw Diva Stuff, and all the great ingredients that were included, and the positive reviews, I decided to give it a try...</li>
            <li> I found charcoal to be quite amazing to what it can do, so I thought perhaps if I find a product that is a daily charcoal face wash</li>
            <li> Impurities will get pulled to the surface, then after a few days you will be happy.</li>
            <li> I did not find this product useful at all.</li>
            <li> I wanted to go a more organic natural route.</li>
            <li> He wasn&#x27;t thrilled about the name of product, but the stuff actually is helping his skin.</li>
            <li> Stuff Sea Salt Face Wash&amp;#34; and after only 3 days my acne is clearing up nicely</li>
            <li> This product has helped my skin clear up more than anything.</li>
            <li> I always have success with products that have tea trea oil in them, and this one is no exception.  </li>
            <li> to no avail, so what would the harm be in trying something a bit more natural?</li>
            <li> I have many older sisters who went through acne when they were teens, but as they got older their acne cleared up.</li>
            <li> The smell of the product is refreshing, but this product splashes if you are not careful.</li>
            <li> This will not dry your skin out like most products would either.</li>
            <li> I have the occasional, hormone-related monthly acne outburst, and when good old Aunt Flow strikes again, I reach for this face wash.  </li>
            <li> This wash makes a lather that feels thick and smooth when applying, has no unpleasant scent, and easily rinses clean!</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend it from my own personal arsenal.</li>
            <li> I HAVE NEVER HAD SO MUCH ACNE IN MY LIFE!</li>
            <li> &#x27;s to the first time.</li>
            <li> I was amazed to see that this works so much better than any brand name facial cleanser you can buy in the stores.</li>
            <li> I will be come back for more.</li>
            <li> With this stuff,I just had regular breakouts and more of them.</li>
            <li> After the first use I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> Thanks diva stuff!</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> Thanks A lot!</li>
            <li> If you have a skin type similar to mine you might want to start there :-)</li>
            <li> I thought I had rosacea for the longest time until i stopped using Clean n Clear, Neutrogena, etc.</li>
            <li> My face feels so clean &amp; soft after using.</li>
            <li> I started looking for natural ways to clean my skin</li>
            <li> My skin has felt soft and clean after each use.</li>
            <li> I like the way my skin felt soft and pores clean.</li>
            <li> Very gentle for the skin and works very well...</li>
            <li> My skin is super sensitive &amp; I will break out over nothing.</li>
            <li> I still get acne occasionally but they seem to go away very quickly.</li>
            <li> Will certainly buy again</li>
            <li> Within the first time using it (along with the charcoal and bamboo extract scrubbies) my acne began to clear up!!</li>
            <li> , cheeks had 3 deep zits, chin huge O zit that had burst.&lt;br /&gt;Day</li>
            <li> This product does not foam very well and does not seem like it&#x27;s even getting rid of any dirt on my face.</li>
            <li> I used every product to include proactive and they didn&#x27;t really help.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> and you can really feel it working</li>
            <li> Makes your face feel clean and not dry.</li>
            <li> This works and is gentle, too.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is doing much in terms of my acne.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased this if I saw that it contained SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate), because I know that is an ingredient that doesn&#x27;t work well for me and really dries my skin out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Kym is a genius  when it come to all things anti-acne and really, this is a product sent from heaven.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very tricky regimen.</li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> I have never had such success with ANY product!</li>
            <li> was using proactive before with limited results and wanted to try something more natural.</li>
            <li> is my first time using Diva stuff and Natural face wash</li>
            <li> So far this product is working for my acne and controlling my oil very well!</li>
            <li> Service was impeccable, but alas the cleanser was too drying.</li>
            <li> I had minimal breakouts but would break out about once a month, after using this I have full blown acne!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used more than half the bottle and haven&#x27;t seen a change in appearance even after a month of use.</li>
            <li> I like this facewash, but it really doesn&#x27;t do much for my ocassional adult acne.  </li>
            <li> , no new pimples have showed up which is a huge surprise.  </li>
            <li> sometimes looks greasy) and a light non colored loose powder.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My skin is a tough one, so I didn&#x27;t have miracle results by any means when it came to my cystic acne, but it smells good and cleanses well.</li>
            <li> Really helps balance my skin and helps it stay clear.</li>
            <li> The damaged skin looks smoother and to be healing faster then normally.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin as badly as normal acne treatments, I have combination skin and mild acne</li>
            <li> I usually do not write reviews so here</li>
            <li> Areas of eczema have completely gone away as well!</li>
            <li> Whether you are a teenager or have adult acne, this works!.</li>
            <li> I was only able to use it for 2 days before it dried my face out so much I had to stop usage.</li>
            <li> Initially no results after 2 weeks of consistent use once a day.  </li>
            <li> I AM 26 years old, have been using this product about two weeks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 26 yrs old and have suffered from acne since I was 13.</li>
            <li> I am 27 years old and still suffering from acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also encroaching on 30 and have developed hormonal/cystic acne along my jaw line and neck.</li>
            <li> I am trying to completely get away from synthetics and chemicals.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural, though.</li>
            <li> I bought this product thinking that it was totally natural</li>
            <li> This may work for people with really oily skin, but I would not recommend it at all for people with normal or dry skin, even if you have problem skin.</li>
            <li> no black heads peeping out of the pores.&lt;br /&gt;Day</li>
            <li> Firstly you can&#x27;t really tell if the ingredients are what is in fact inside the bottle, it could be just Black soap melted and put in a bottle!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m stationed in Okinawa where the humidity is HIGH and causes my face to constantly breakout, the two years I have been here</li>
            <li> I ruined so many shirts and pillowcases in the past when I was using all of those prescription and over the counter acne products that contained that, but I am pleased to say that this and any other Diva stuff products do not contain such harsh ingredients.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t make things better,in the other hand, make it worse.i don&#x27;t use it any more, just waste money.</li>
            <li> I bought this in the summer, hoping it would clear up the cystic acne I only seem to get in the warmer months.</li>
            <li> I barely had any cystic bumps at all.</li>
            <li> and I recently moved away from where we had natural sulfur in our water</li>
            <li> It really does the trick in keeping my face balanced out, and not TOO DRY!!</li>
            <li> Also, for the price, I couldn&#x27;t get that large amount in any other &amp;#34;name brand,&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 41 with cystic acne due to PCOS and I&#x27;ve tried many acne products with very little results.  </li>
            <li> My acne ranges from small little white heads at the surface to deep cystic acne that hurt for weeks and sometimes feels like it has it own pulse.</li>
            <li> so for those who break out a few days after first trying this product, just wait it out.</li>
            <li> I am a first time buyer from this seller and recieved this product a few days ago.</li>
            <li> is purging some, however it is hardly noticeable and it clearing up quickly.</li>
            <li> SKIN TYPE &amp; PROBLEMS: I have sensitive, dry, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> and I see small improvments, my skin normally takes awhile to be affected by new products.</li>
            <li> 6- whole face is pink and dry</li>
            <li> The price is a little too much for this product and the labeling on the bottle is ghetto.</li>
            <li> , inflammation has gone way done, and the redness I normally experience is significantly less.  </li>
            <li> It seemed to control cystic boils and large breakouts, but had lots of small bumps.</li>
            <li> I still have the same minor breakouts and hormonal acne from when I started.</li>
            <li> dry skin, chin red and dry.&lt;br /&gt;Day</li>
            <li> My skin is responding well to this product, the only downside is that it is making my face extremely dry around some areas.</li>
            <li> most acne products out there are filled with ingredients that make my skin do horrible things.  </li>
            <li> , cheeks black heads coming out and deep zits smoother, chin red and still a big bump</li>
            <li> the consistency is soft and liquid and a small pump is enough.</li>
            <li> i like the natural and short ingredient list as well as the fact that it&#x27;s a small company.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time too</li>
            <li> Im thirty four years old with trouble skin, oily and acne prone.</li>
            <li> Skin dry, chin dry</li>
            <li> Sometimes my skin gets dry</li>
            <li> If I keep my acne/oily way too under control, then my face gets way too dry, and the dryness/eczema starts to show..</li>
            <li> If you tend to get dry skin, or drier areas of skin on your face, you can still use this product...</li>
            <li> I have some dark spots from old acne, but a cc cream is helping and covers up the dark spots</li>
            <li> Because switching back to my old pill wasn&#x27;t an option due to excessive hair loss, I had to find a way to deal with cystic acne.  </li>
            <li> Used Neem and Turmeric again with limited results.</li>
            <li> If I ever had a pimple, all I had to do was use this product as a mask for half an hour and the pimple would disappear by the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 1- T-zone had black heads and white heads</li>
            <li> Black heads are almost gone, zits are gone, some back heads are coming to the surface.&lt;br /&gt;Day</li>
            <li> I try to support small businesses, but they should also bear in mind that they are  competing for the same market dollars as big businesses.</li>
            <li> I also saw a reduction in black heads upon initial use and some skin brightening effect.</li>
            <li> It did not really help with my acne whatsoever.</li>
            <li> but the harsh product have left your skin peeling and flaking?  </li>
            <li> I do feel that this soap does help with some types of acne, minus my cystic/hormonal acne around the jawline</li>
            <li> 4- T- zone some black heads/skin dry,</li>
            <li> cheeks black heads/skin dry, chin dry.&lt;br /&gt;Day</li>
            <li> but when I do get a breakout it usually takes about a week for it to clear; using salicylic acid or harsh chemicals to treat it.</li>
            <li> I have blackhead, white heads, and cystic acne, after just a few days all of that including my blackheads are almost all gone!</li>
            <li> However the oiliness of my face is almost gone, now that could be due to the fact that summer is gone so who knows.</li>
            <li> It never mentioned SLS until I received the bottle, and there it was, SLS, among the other ingredients this company cared to list.</li>
            <li> Lots of other products out there that also work well but cost less...</li>
            <li> Not useful at all.</li>
            <li> T-zone a little black heads/ skin dry, cheeks a little black heads/</li>
            <li> I am never using any other face wash again!</li>
            <li> Poor little old me</li>
            <li> Other than a few &amp;#34;purge&amp;#34</li>
            <li> 3- T-zone black heads everywhere</li>
            <li> It has been cleaning my skin from black heads and break ups.</li>
            <li> over $8 price increase in less than a year - no change to the product whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> (oddly, lymphatic draining/movement/boosting techniques  </li>
            <li> My existing acne is less noticeable.</li>
            <li> As an added bonus, scars from previous breakouts have even begun to fade....</li>
            <li> this stuff reminds me just little of caviar  </li>
            <li> It is, however, a little pricey and tends to be drying, so I eventually  stopped using it every day.</li>
            <li> Honestly it was a bit shocking to have face wash being black..</li>
            <li> It only made my acne worse.</li>
            <li> even worse the next day.</li>
            <li> thought it would help since my biore charcoal wash was started to give me trouble.</li>
            <li> While it is purging this junk out, it is not making my skin feel dried out</li>
            <li> not great enough to justify  $24 price tag....</li>
            <li> Cap of the bottle was broken when I received it, so I have to actually pull out the lid and scoop it out with my fingers.</li>
            <li> This product really dried out my face.</li>
            <li> This stuff will make you waste your money.</li>
            <li> I get a few zits every month</li>
            <li> ; break outs in the first few days, my skin stopped producing painful cysts.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t expect such black looking thing to be tough on acne!</li>
            <li> I suspect they are quite aware that SLS is earning a bad reputation as of late, so it wasn&#x27;t disclosed until the product is in hand.</li>
            <li> I went from having four or fives painful pimples a month to just one for the whole</li>
            <li> This stuff has been giving my skin a change to heal from past acne.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t &amp;#34;kill&amp;#34; your skin --- you know, how usually the blemishes are still there</li>
            <li> Usually &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Within just a few uses I can see a difference in my skin!</li>
            <li> It was also very messy.</li>
            <li> Looks like water, hard to put on, too liquidy.</li>
            <li> I also have a hard time finding deodorants that work</li>
            <li> I bought this product after I switched to a different birth control pill, which turned my acne-free skin into a painful, cystic acne mess along my jawline.  </li>
            <li> and it helps zap those suckers in record time.  </li>
            <li> in they&#x27;re ingredient list online, just rude and misleading.</li>
            <li> This product is not good at all.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cause drying or flaking and there are 0 hard chemicals!</li>
            <li> have such stubborn skin :(</li>
            <li> skin drying up like crazy, cheeks black heads everywhere</li>
            <li> Made my skin worse.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re hiding it behind an acronym</li>
            <li> Within two weeks of beginning to use this product (morning and night), I&#x27;ve seen a dramatic decrease in cystic acne.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if this will work wonders for someone with bad acne</li>
            <li> It was terrible breakouts from my skin not being cleaned properly, and being clogged by the ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have always had complicated skin.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed with this product.</li>

            <li> Very inconvenient.</li>
            <li> and my face looks HORRIBLE!  </li>
            <li> Awful.</li>
            <li> I given up hope on salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide because they just irritated my skin and would make it worst by causing acne to show up on place around the spot I was trying to treat.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It worked okay. My skin is a tough one, so I didn&#x27;t have miracle results by any means when it came to my cystic acne, but it smells good and cleanses well.</li>
            <li> I AM 26 years old, have been using this product about two weeks and my face looks HORRIBLE!  I HAVE NEVER HAD SO MUCH ACNE IN MY LIFE! I had minimal breakouts but would break out about once a month, after using this I have full blown acne! It&#x27;s everywhere, my cheeks , chin ,for head , nose..... iv never even had acne any where but my chin now it&#x27;s everywhere.  Now I am looking for something to fix my face!&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and skin!</li>
            <li> Really helps balance my skin and helps it stay clear.</li>
            <li> I will not buy this product ever again! It only made my acne worse. It caused my face to break out more. The smell is very powerful of sulfer, and it doesn&#x27;t lather up. It was also very messy. Not the best product for acne.</li>
            <li> smells a bit strong but still a great product and I love the diva stuff products!</li>
            <li> I usually do not write reviews so here&#x27;s to the first time. I did not find this product useful at all. It did not really help with my acne whatsoever. The price is a little too much for this product and the labeling on the bottle is ghetto. Smells great though.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin as badly as normal acne treatments, I have combination skin and mild acne so I&#x27;m not sure if this will work wonders for someone with bad acne but i liked the results that I got with the product.</li>
            <li> Made my skin worse. I&#x27;m used to my skin going through a purging period when switching products, but this was not a purge. It was terrible breakouts from my skin not being cleaned properly, and being clogged by the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using it and my skin cleared up immediately.</li>
            <li> Smells ok, but works great!</li>
            <li> Great for clearing acne and other spots</li>
            <li> I bought this in the summer, hoping it would clear up the cystic acne I only seem to get in the warmer months. I was amazed to see that this works so much better than any brand name facial cleanser you can buy in the stores. I barely had any cystic bumps at all. I went from having four or fives painful pimples a month to just one for the whole summer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so impressed I just kept using this even in the winter. If I ever had a pimple, all I had to do was use this product as a mask for half an hour and the pimple would disappear by the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason this does not get five stars is that this does not help with blackheads whatsoever. I have not been able to get rid off them.</li>
            <li> Awful. Feels greasy and flared up my acne even worse the next day.</li>
            <li> Stinky and slime but seemed to help</li>
            <li> This face wash is very gentle, yet effective at treating acne because it contains sulfur. I prefer sulfur instead of benzoyl peroxide because that can actually damage skin after prolonged use and it can stain clothing. I ruined so many shirts and pillowcases in the past when I was using all of those prescription and over the counter acne products that contained that, but I am pleased to say that this and any other Diva stuff products do not contain such harsh ingredients. Hooray! This will not dry your skin out like most products would either.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!!! It keeps my face oil free!!</li>
            <li> Great smell and feel but haven&#x27;t noticed a reduction in break outs yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 41 with cystic acne due to PCOS and I&#x27;ve tried many acne products with very little results.  I had heard about a more expensive product that contains sulfur and decided to do a search on Amazon to see if there was a cheaper one.  I came across this one and am so glad I did!  I&#x27;ve been using this product for one month now and have significant clearing of my cystic acne, inflammation has gone way done, and the redness I normally experience is significantly less.  I&#x27;m looking forward to what my skin will look like after three months.  I coupled this product with Alpha Hydroxy Serum 14% and am using Eucerin cream at night for a moisturizer and Neutrogena Oil Free moisturizer with sunscreen during the day.</li>
            <li> This smells great and you will feel it working. the consistency is soft and liquid and a small pump is enough. You will see your pore clearing around your nose and that&#x27;s awesome (it&#x27;s the charcoal). Also, this has no beads and it feels like silk on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first time using Diva stuff and Natural face wash so I will experience a purging, which is when an acne product will bring out all your impurities to the surface before it can start treating it. so for those who break out a few days after first trying this product, just wait it out. It&#x27;s my 3rd day using this and it brought out some more acne but they are now drying out.</li>
            <li> Not useful at all. I was suffering from acne when I purchased this product and from all the great reviews thought it would help since my biore charcoal wash was started to give me trouble. This product does not foam very well and does not seem like it&#x27;s even getting rid of any dirt on my face. I&#x27;ve used more than half the bottle and haven&#x27;t seen a change in appearance even after a month of use.</li>
            <li> Great product would recommend and purchase again and other products.</li>
            <li> I love it! I&#x27;m stationed in Okinawa where the humidity is HIGH and causes my face to constantly breakout, the two years I have been here I used every product to include proactive and they didn&#x27;t really help. I will continue to use this along w their acne cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 26 yrs old and have suffered from acne since I was 13. My acne ranges from small little white heads at the surface to deep cystic acne that hurt for weeks and sometimes feels like it has it own pulse. I have many older sisters who went through acne when they were teens, but as they got older their acne cleared up. Poor little old me I am still suffering from embarrassment. I&#x27;ve tried antibiotics prescribed by doctors, I&#x27;ve tried all the face products at the drug store claiming to be a miracle worker, and I tried not wearing makeup thinking it was the cause of my outbreaks. I given up hope on salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide because they just irritated my skin and would make it worst by causing acne to show up on place around the spot I was trying to treat. I thought I had rosacea for the longest time until i stopped using Clean n Clear, Neutrogena, etc. those product were what was causing more acne and stress to my skin. I wanted to go a more organic natural route. I found charcoal to be quite amazing to what it can do, so I thought perhaps if I find a product that is a daily charcoal face wash I might find my solution. So, here is what happened (I wish I could show pictures.)&lt;br /&gt;Day 1- T-zone had black heads and white heads, cheeks had 3 deep zits, chin huge O zit that had burst.&lt;br /&gt;Day 2- T-zone white heads everywhere, cheeks black heads coming out and deep zits smoother, chin red and still a big bump&lt;br /&gt;Day 3- T-zone black heads everywhere skin drying up like crazy, cheeks black heads everywhere dry skin, chin red and dry.&lt;br /&gt;Day 4- T- zone some black heads/skin dry, cheeks black heads/skin dry, chin dry.&lt;br /&gt;Day 5- T-zone a little black heads/ skin dry, cheeks a little black heads/Skin dry, chin dry&lt;br /&gt;Day 6- whole face is pink and dry&lt;br /&gt;Day 7- starting using a non non comedogenic cetaphil moisturizer along with 2x a day Charcoal face wash. Black heads are almost gone, zits are gone, some back heads are coming to the surface.&lt;br /&gt;Day 8- Make up glides on smooth, no bumps, no black heads peeping out of the pores.&lt;br /&gt;Day 9- Everyone is noticing how flawless my face is. I have some dark spots from old acne, but a cc cream is helping and covers up the dark spots well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before the skin can heal the purge will happen. Impurities will get pulled to the surface, then after a few days you will be happy. I am glad I have found my solution. Drink lots of water, use  Charcoal face wash 2x a day, find a good toner (Neutrogena toner) , use non comedogenic Cetaphil moisturizer (it won&#x27;t clog pores). Make sure when you buy make up your use a non comedogenic product. I use  Almay CC cream (it has a shine to it for a glow effect- sometimes looks greasy) and a light non colored loose powder.</li>
            <li> Very gentle for the skin and works very well...</li>
            <li> I love it. It has been cleaning my skin from black heads and break ups. My skin feels really nice after I have washed my face with this. Thanks.I will be come back for more.</li>
            <li> This stuff  is in my cart now I can&#x27;t wait I got a sample with an order and this stuff reminds me just little of caviar  and you can really feel it working</li>
            <li> I am a first time buyer from this seller and recieved this product a few days ago. I have been using this twice a day and already my exsiting acne is drying and going away, no new pimples have showed up which is a huge surprise.  Right now I am extremely impressed and will do an update in a few weeks. I am 25 and have dealt with acne for over ten years I have blackhead, white heads, and cystic acne, after just a few days all of that including my blackheads are almost all gone!</li>
            <li> Great face wash! Love the way my skin feels and I have noticed fewer blackheads.</li>
            <li> Love this product, great customer service</li>
            <li> I have suffered with acne for 15+ years &amp; like many others, have tried everything under the sun. Well I&#x27;ve finally found my &amp;#34;wonder&amp;#34; product here. My skin is super sensitive &amp; I will break out over nothing. Not with this. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month now &amp; I love it. My face feels so clean &amp; soft after using. Areas of eczema have completely gone away as well! Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Makes your face feel clean and not dry. Lasts a long time too bc you don&#x27;t need a lot!</li>
            <li> My search is over for the best cleanser. I tried another Charcoal cleanser before and really liked it but can&#x27;t find it anymore. Once I realized Charcoal is the best thing for my acne prone skin, I searched for a new cleanser. I found this and I have been using it for weeks. I&#x27;ve gone longer than I ever have before without getting a pimple. My skin is clearing. This stuff has been giving my skin a change to heal from past acne. Will certainly buy again but I won&#x27;t have to for a while because there is a lot of product in one bottle. Love it.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with this product - having combination skin that is quite dry in some places while still prone to whiteheads/breakouts makes it challenging to find something that has the right balance.  This detoxing wash is working well - it has brought whiteheads completely up to the surface so that they were super easy to remove!  While it is purging this junk out, it is not making my skin feel dried out and my skin tone is looking more even.  This wash makes a lather that feels thick and smooth when applying, has no unpleasant scent, and easily rinses clean!</li>
            <li> I own a skincare spa. Whether you are a teenager or have adult acne, this works!. I sell it at my spa.  It is the best product out there for SAFELY cleansing acne-prone skin.  It won&#x27;t &amp;#34;kill&amp;#34; your skin --- you know, how usually the blemishes are still there but the harsh product have left your skin peeling and flaking?  This works and is gentle, too.  Usually &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products are safe but dang it they just don&#x27;t work.  It is wonderful to have found a product with such safe ingredients that actually does what it claims to do!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t make things better,in the other hand, make it worse.i don&#x27;t use it any more, just waste money.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for four days now and already see a difference in my skins texture! So far this product is working for my acne and controlling my oil very well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an actual customer, not a robot or paid reviewer. Firstly you can&#x27;t really tell if the ingredients are what is in fact inside the bottle, it could be just Black soap melted and put in a bottle! But so far sooo good. My skin is responding well to this product, the only downside is that it is making my face extremely dry around some areas. Maybe I should not use this daily and maybe every 3 days or so. However the oiliness of my face is almost gone, now that could be due to the fact that summer is gone so who knows. The smell of the product is refreshing, but this product splashes if you are not careful. I like it...for now</li>
            <li> I believe it had an opposite effect. started to break out much more. was using proactive before with limited results and wanted to try something more natural. Used Neem and Turmeric again with limited results. It seemed to control cystic boils and large breakouts, but had lots of small bumps. With this stuff,I just had regular breakouts and more of them. Had to stop using it. I am sorry we won&#x27;t be buying more.</li>
            <li> Eh,this product worked well..not great enough to justify  $24 price tag....over $8 price increase in less than a year - no change to the product whatsoever.  Lots of other products out there that also work well but cost less...I try to support small businesses, but they should also bear in mind that they are  competing for the same market dollars as big businesses.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my teenage son. He wasn&#x27;t thrilled about the name of product, but the stuff actually is helping his skin. It hasn&#x27;t irritated it either.</li>
            <li> Honestly it was a bit shocking to have face wash being black.. but I absolutely love this product!  Best face wash I have ever used! I can&#x27;t go back to anything else!</li>
            <li> I am 27 years old and still suffering from acne. I have tried proactiv, over the counter wash and creams, and prescribed medication with no relief. I started looking for natural ways to clean my skin and I came across Diva Stuff face wash and immediately purchased it. After the first use I noticed a difference. My face felt fresh and clean. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and have noticed my face is purging some, however it is hardly noticeable and it clearing up quickly. I received two samples in the mail (acne face mask and a scrubbie) and have loved it so much I&#x27;m buying those items as well! I even turned my sister on to the products (her blackheads have almost disappeared). Thanks diva stuff! I will be recommending you to everyone now!</li>
            <li> Really detox your skin.. works great</li>
            <li> I do feel that this soap does help with some types of acne, minus my cystic/hormonal acne around the jawline (oddly, lymphatic draining/movement/boosting techniques  helped without my meaning for it to lol).  It works well with face brushes. I also saw a reduction in black heads upon initial use and some skin brightening effect. It is, however, a little pricey and tends to be drying, so I eventually  stopped using it every day. I also would love to see an SLS-free version.</li>
            <li> An extremely effective and gentle cleanser! Didn&#x27;t expect such black looking thing to be tough on acne! It really works! Seller also gives sample.. Thanks A lot!</li>
            <li> So glad I found diva stuff!!&lt;br /&gt;I have such stubborn skin :( and I recently moved away from where we had natural sulfur in our water, I&#x27;ve been using this soap for almost 2 weeks now and I see small improvments, my skin normally takes awhile to be affected by new products. But I have already placed 2 more orders for diva stuff. Thanks for the free samples ladies!! Just finding more and more things I love! Ps the balm acing cream is great too!!</li>
            <li> Service was impeccable, but alas the cleanser was too drying.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff-it works my face is clearer than it has been in a year.</li>
            <li> I have found my holy grail!!! I LOVE this face wash! Within just a few uses I can see a difference in my skin! My existing acne is less noticeable. The damaged skin looks smoother and to be healing faster then normally. My face seems smother and more hydrated! I love love love this face wash!!</li>
            <li> Really great product; I&#x27;m impressed. Cleans pores deeply without drying skin. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Cap of the bottle was broken when I received it, so I have to actually pull out the lid and scoop it out with my fingers. Very inconvenient. I don&#x27;t think it is doing much in terms of my acne. Disappointed with this product. This product is not good at all. Looks like water, hard to put on, too liquidy. it slides off of my face. would not repurchase.</li>
            <li> SKIN TYPE &amp; PROBLEMS: I have sensitive, dry, acne-prone skin. I&#x27;m also encroaching on 30 and have developed hormonal/cystic acne along my jaw line and neck. YAY! I&#x27;ve never had severe acne but when I do get a breakout it usually takes about a week for it to clear; using salicylic acid or harsh chemicals to treat it. I am trying to completely get away from synthetics and chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 30 days of use (washing morning and night)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product smells great and foams nicely. It washes off well leaving no residue. My skin has felt soft and clean after each use. It doesn&#x27;t cause drying or flaking and there are 0 hard chemicals! With that said, it has not treated or prevented my acne. I still have the same minor breakouts and hormonal acne from when I started. So... as an acne fighter I have voted it off the list. But it does work well just to cleanse the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I purchased the &amp;#34;Diva Stuff Sea Salt Face Wash&amp;#34; and after only 3 days my acne is clearing up nicely (T zone, U zone, and neck). I still need an exfoliator but for daily cleansing this is now my go to! If you have a skin type similar to mine you might want to start there :-)</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed that the ingredients weren&#x27;t exactly like the website lists because I wanted something with a good bit of sulfur in it for my acne but on the bottle the last ingredient is sulfur, but it works absolutely wonderful, my skin is bright and clear, my acne scars are almost gone which is great because I am getting married soon and didnt want to have to wear foundation, overall I am happy with this product, it works like its supposed too.</li>
            <li> It really forces the blackheads to the surface so you can get them easily. I also have a hard time finding deodorants that work so I started using the soap on my armpits and it really helps keep the smell and wetness to a minimum!!! Added bonus!!!</li>
            <li> This product really dried out my face. I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased this if I saw that it contained SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate), because I know that is an ingredient that doesn&#x27;t work well for me and really dries my skin out. This ingredient is listed on the bottle as SLS, which is why I didn&#x27;t notice when I purchased it. It certainly isn&#x27;t Diva Stuff&#x27;s fault that I didn&#x27;t read the labeling more closely, but it would have been nice if this ingredient was listed using its full name. This may work for people with really oily skin, but I would not recommend it at all for people with normal or dry skin, even if you have problem skin. I was only able to use it for 2 days before it dried my face out so much I had to stop usage. The company did send a couple samples with my order, which is always nice!</li>
            <li> I have tried everything over the years. EVERYTHING! This product has helped my skin clear up more than anything. I still get acne occasionally but they seem to go away very quickly. Sometimes my skin gets dry but I use almond oil for that.</li>
            <li> Very effective! I love this product!</li>
            <li> I like this cleanser, it delivered what it said. within the first two days of use, I could see all the pimples raised on top of surface. I like the way my skin felt soft and pores clean. Im thirty four years old with trouble skin, oily and acne prone. This cleanser is not bad after all.</li>
            <li> This stuff will make you waste your money. It doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I had bought every acne face  cleanser for my son that did not work. Then I bought this and it cleared his acne up immediately. Works great!</li>
            <li> This helps my skin &amp; nothing helps my skin. Only issue is that if you go to the gym later in the day, you tend to smell like sulfur.&lt;br /&gt;Solution: follow it up with the watermelon scrubbies</li>
            <li> I have the occasional, hormone-related monthly acne outburst, and when good old Aunt Flow strikes again, I reach for this face wash.  Combined with one of Kym&#x27;s acne-preventing face creams (like the Hibiscus Lift-MY FAVORITE,) it really packs a punch towards pesky acne.  I get a few zits every month and it helps zap those suckers in record time.  I always have success with products that have tea trea oil in them, and this one is no exception.  The bottle is a very nice size, and you&#x27;ll be set for months  with this one, depending on how much you use and how much you suffer from acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kym is a genius  when it come to all things anti-acne and really, this is a product sent from heaven.  I HIGHLY recommend it from my own personal arsenal.</li>
            <li> I am never using any other face wash again! Just one use and I noticed a difference!</li>
            <li> This makes sense. Why use anything else!</li>
            <li> i have only been using for about a week or so, but it seems to work well. i like the natural and short ingredient list as well as the fact that it&#x27;s a small company. they sent me some nice samples as well. great value!</li>
            <li> I use Amazon CONSTANTLY and have never been tempted to write a review.....until now. I tried this product on a whim....figuring that I had already tried all chemicals known to man to treat my hormonal acne...both oral and topical medications...to no avail, so what would the harm be in trying something a bit more natural? I am so glad that I did! Within the first time using it (along with the charcoal and bamboo extract scrubbies) my acne began to clear up!! Within four days it has all but disappeared! As an added bonus, scars from previous breakouts have even begun to fade....I have never had such success with ANY product! I truly hope it lasts!</li>
            <li> I like this facewash, but it really doesn&#x27;t do much for my ocassional adult acne.  I do like that it&#x27;s natural, though.</li>
            <li> Initially no results after 2 weeks of consistent use once a day.  This product helped with my fight against mild acne.  I recommend a moisturizer because there is drying.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this acne wash!  I had seen alot of other &amp;#34;Charcoal&amp;#34; products I wanted to try, but when I saw Diva Stuff, and all the great ingredients that were included, and the positive reviews, I decided to give it a try...Also, for the price, I couldn&#x27;t get that large amount in any other &amp;#34;name brand,&amp;#34; so I placed my order..I have always had complicated skin. I have a combination of dry/oily skin with chronic acne/eczema that I always have to keep under control..It is constantly like keeping a &amp;#34;balance scale&amp;#34;  even..If I keep my acne/oily way too under control, then my face gets way too dry, and the dryness/eczema starts to show.. It&#x27;s a very tricky regimen. I have found myself having to have two cleansers constantly. This  is my acne/oily one that I reach for when I see my face starting to break out...It really does the trick in keeping my face balanced out, and not TOO DRY!! I love the fact that it is made right here in the U.S.A!! Any &amp;#34;mom &amp; pop business&amp;#34;  is #1 in my book, and I&#x27;ll go out of my way to keep them in going!! If we had more of these family businesses, this country would be flourishing more and more!  Way to go DIVA STUFF!  Keep making quality skin care items..</li>
            <li> I bought this product after I switched to a different birth control pill, which turned my acne-free skin into a painful, cystic acne mess along my jawline.  Because switching back to my old pill wasn&#x27;t an option due to excessive hair loss, I had to find a way to deal with cystic acne.  I&#x27;m 35 and have hypersensitive, irritable, combination skin...most acne products out there are filled with ingredients that make my skin do horrible things.  Within two weeks of beginning to use this product (morning and night), I&#x27;ve seen a dramatic decrease in cystic acne.  Other than a few &amp;#34;purge&amp;#34; break outs in the first few days, my skin stopped producing painful cysts.  Mostly, I&#x27;m now dealing with acne scars.  Additionally, 85% percent of the redness from rosacea has gone away.  This worked well for my skin...and I&#x27;d recommend giving it a try to see if it works for you.  If you tend to get dry skin, or drier areas of skin on your face, you can still use this product...just start with one wash a day, and make sure you have a good, natural moisturizer to apply when you finish washing.</li>
            <li> I have a huge beef with amazon not requiring companies to list product ingredients, and this is a prime example. I NEVER would have ordered this stuff if I had known it contains SLS, the abbreviation for Sodium Laurel Sulfate. It never mentioned SLS until I received the bottle, and there it was, SLS, among the other ingredients this company cared to list. I suspect they are quite aware that SLS is earning a bad reputation as of late, so it wasn&#x27;t disclosed until the product is in hand. Disappointed. I suppose if I enlarged the picture, I would have seen the SLS. Caveat Emptor.</li>
            <li> SLS? Really? I bought this product thinking that it was totally natural but the surfactant is Sodium Lauryl Sulfate and they&#x27;re hiding it behind an acronym and they don&#x27;t include THAT in they&#x27;re ingredient list online, just rude and misleading.</li>
            <li> Not impressed. I like tea tree oil and a lemon mix better.</li>
