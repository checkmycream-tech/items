            <li>This is a very good product!</li>
            <li>but I think they are perfect.  </li>
            <li>These things are wonderful!  </li>
            <li>These work perfectly for my hair.</li>
            <li>My search for the perfect clips is over.</li>
            <li>These work great</li>
            <li>They are strong and perfect for what I needed.</li>
            <li>Wish they also came in bright, rainbow colors.  </li>
            <li>I placed the order thinking they would be a good size for my hair</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>I love these hair clips!</li>
            <li>I will buy them again when these get lost. :)</li>
            <li>These clips are okay...</li>
            <li>I just want to put the top layer of my hair in them to keep it out of my face.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>They are also my cat&#x27;s favorite thing to bat off the counter:P</li>
            <li>The great thing about these clips is that they really grip onto your hair.</li>
            <li>Love these.  </li>
            <li>the clip it self is great, it hold curly or straight hair for hours.</li>
            <li>The more circular clips tend to dig in my scalp.</li>
            <li>These clips do stay in place and seem to be strong and durable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Third, these are quite strong.</li>
            <li>These do a great job keeping my hair back.  </li>
            <li>Cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I originally bought these thinking</li>
            <li>I rarely break these octopus clips.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my hair (thin).</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking to pull only some of your hair back, this is a great purchase.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re bigger than I expected, which is good!</li>
            <li>Just what I was looking for, thanks!</li>
            <li>I also love the flat bottoms</li>
            <li>Lately, many stores local to me haven&#x27;t been stocking this particular type anymore</li>
            <li>Based on other reviews, I thought they would be able to hold all of my hair, but these are more for pulling the side in toward the back...</li>
            <li>These lie flat on your head so that they do not dig into your scalp and hold a lot of hair easily.</li>
            <li>The clips work well and are comfortable but they aren&#x27;t &#x27;tiny&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>I will use them, but not as much as I was hoping.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>The  item description is very misleading.&lt;br /&gt;After spending $3.99 on</li>
            <li>My hair is so thin and fair</li>
            <li>I was hoping this is strong enough to hold my Asian this hair...</li>
            <li>, I thought it was going to fit my needs, so I stopped shopping around for other options.</li>
            <li>I live in Asia so returning</li>
            <li>I have thin shoulder length hair that slips right through most clips.  </li>
            <li>They actually hold my hair better than any other clips I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>I went to Walmart and found the exact same clips for $4.</li>
            <li>ideal for half up half down hair</li>
            <li>I am willing to deal with this minor inconvenience, because I can put them in place in the morning, and they stay put &#x27;till evening.</li>
            <li>Other cheap clips of similar size often require at LEAST two, if not 3-4 for the same hold.&lt;br /&gt;Second, these are very comfortable.</li>
            <li>I love how they lay flat against your head so no more headaches from pulling my hair back.</li>
            <li>However with my fine hair they manage to hold up all of it in the back despite their relatively small size ( about a square inch )</li>
            <li>No slipping.</li>
            <li>Worth spending a little extra for.</li>
            <li>so they hold my hair and don&#x27;t stick out to much or slide down.  </li>
            <li>Just the right small size to pin back bangs while doing make-up or curling sections.</li>
            <li>Very flimsy, not worth it!</li>

            <li> Very flimsy, not worth it!</li>
            <li> I am pretty hard on them as I often end up sleeping with a clip in my hair or tossing them at the bottom on my bag.</li>
            <li> they are flat on the bottom</li>
            <li> The plastic &amp;#34;prongs&amp;#34; lay flat against your scalp.</li>
            <li> They must have changed the product, because they are actually about 1 inch in each direction--much smaller than I expected.  </li>
            <li> A clip isn&#x27;t big enough to hold all of your hair, but it will be enough to pull half of your hair back.</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick, soft, straight hair, and these are the only clips that will actually hold it in place without loosening up, but for some reason, they always get a few hairs tangled around the end prongs.  </li>
            <li> Other clips of similar size break constantly on me.</li>
            <li> A bit expensive for what it turned out to be: flimsy and cheap.</li>
            <li> They were much bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li> These clips are much smaller than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I use these as napkin holders for my mom when she eats (she&#x27;s nearly 90), not as hair clips, but with that in mind, these are rugged and don&#x27;t break like the cheaper ones.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;To make matters worse, They are not even worth returning, since they are so inexpensive.</li>
            <li> These are strong enough to hold my thick hair into my customary bun, but small enough to go unnoticed.</li>
            <li> Bigger than expected!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will continue to purchase these as long as they make them!</li>
            <li> You can see from the photo that the grips are a bit longer than the other clips too, which doesn&#x27;t matter for what I use them for, but overall, A+ product.  </li>
            <li> but for my thin and annoyingly  silky straight and hair, they fit just right.</li>
            <li> I have thick, long hair (mid back or so)</li>
            <li> When I bought them other reviews were surprised by how small they are</li>
            <li> and I have such a hard time finding hair clips that actually stay.</li>
            <li> these are about 1 inch tall and 1 inch wide.</li>
            <li> that is quite heavy, especially when wet.</li>
            <li> it was not a feasible option due to shipping costs.  </li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s my fault for not reading other customers&#x27; reviews before I purchased these ( I was in a bit of a hurry.), but they are not what I thought they were.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve stopped buying any other clips.</li>
            <li> other clips inflict.&lt;br</li>
            <li> ...if you have thick hair, might not fit in properly for an half up half down hair do.  </li>
            <li> They grip really tight.  </li>
            <li> This clip can hold my very thick heavy bun whether its wet or dry with just 1 clip.</li>
            <li> These are small pins...</li>
            <li> If i go walking, I usually will use two.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if a difference in plastic/material is the cause of it</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve been told I have a thick mane), but this one are too small for me to use, just to get the hair off my face.</li>
            <li> not great.</li>
            <li> Sadly will have to return them</li>
            <li> Awful, doesn&#x27;t hold any hair.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a very good product!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for clips like these for some time. These lie flat on your head so that they do not dig into your scalp and hold a lot of hair easily. I will buy them again when these get lost. :)</li>
            <li> These clips are okay...not great. A bit expensive for what it turned out to be: flimsy and cheap. I live in Asia so returning it was not a feasible option due to shipping costs.  Definitely wouldn&#x27;t buy them again.</li>
            <li> Like em for teen daughter</li>
            <li> These clips do stay in place and seem to be strong and durable. However, there is no Memory Foam anywhere on them.</li>
            <li> Very flimsy, not worth it!</li>
            <li> The clips work well and are comfortable but they aren&#x27;t &#x27;tiny&#x27;.  They were much bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li> I bought these clips for myself to help hold my hair back. I went to multiple stores and could not find anything that would work.  These work great they are flat on the bottom so they hold my hair and don&#x27;t stick out to much or slide down.  When I bought them other reviews were surprised by how small they are but I think they are perfect.  I just want to put the top layer of my hair in them to keep it out of my face. I like that they are neutral colors and would buy them again.</li>
            <li> Bigger than expected!</li>
            <li> I read the questions about the size, which said it was 1.5 inches in all directions.  They must have changed the product, because they are actually about 1 inch in each direction--much smaller than I expected.  Would not have bought them if I knew.</li>
            <li> These clips are much smaller than I expected.  Based on other reviews, I thought they would be able to hold all of my hair, but these are more for pulling the side in toward the back...just enough to pull it out of my face.  I will use them, but not as much as I was hoping.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this is strong enough to hold my Asian this hair...</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for, thanks!</li>
            <li> Smaller clips than I thought, but okay. Thanks.</li>
            <li> much smaller than the description</li>
            <li> I also love the flat bottoms so they do not pinch scalp.  Just the right small size to pin back bangs while doing make-up or curling sections.</li>
            <li> They are strong and perfect for what I needed. They are also my cat&#x27;s favorite thing to bat off the counter:P</li>
            <li> A clip isn&#x27;t big enough to hold all of your hair, but it will be enough to pull half of your hair back. The great thing about these clips is that they really grip onto your hair. Once you get them on, they won&#x27;t slide off like the cheaper hair clips. If you&#x27;re looking to pull only some of your hair back, this is a great purchase.</li>
            <li> Awful, doesn&#x27;t hold any hair.</li>
            <li> I placed the order thinking they would be a good size for my hair (I&#x27;ve been told I have a thick mane), but this one are too small for me to use, just to get the hair off my face. Sadly will have to return them</li>
            <li> These do a great job keeping my hair back.  I use them for blow drying hair and when washing my face.  Wish they also came in bright, rainbow colors.  They&#x27;re bigger than I expected, which is good!</li>
            <li> These things are wonderful!  I love how they lay flat against your head so no more headaches from pulling my hair back. They actually hold my hair better than any other clips I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> I originally bought these thinking I could use them on the sides of my head but they are too big for that! However with my fine hair they manage to hold up all of it in the back despite their relatively small size ( about a square inch ) so I will definitely still use them!</li>
            <li> My hair is so thin and fair and I have such a hard time finding hair clips that actually stay. These work perfectly for my hair. I put my hair up in a bun all day with just two of these clips and I didn&#x27;t have to adjust them once. My search for the perfect clips is over.</li>
            <li> Does the job of keeping the hair out of your eyes or maybe keeping an updo in place without it being too noticable.  FYI: these are about 1 inch tall and 1 inch wide.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s my fault for not reading other customers&#x27; reviews before I purchased these ( I was in a bit of a hurry.), but they are not what I thought they were. The  item description is very misleading.&lt;br /&gt;After spending $3.99 on 2- day  rush shipping, I opened the package to discover that these are HAIR Clips, like for HUMAN hair!!!&lt;br /&gt;When I read the item description, I thought it was going to fit my needs, so I stopped shopping around for other options. This, along with the wait time for the items to be shipped, caused me to allow my tiny octopi to swim around, unclipped, for 3 days. Obviously, this is unacceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make matters worse, They are not even worth returning, since they are so inexpensive. However, I have no use for them, since I am bald from stem to stern.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made. No grip</li>
            <li> These are small pins...ideal for half up half down hair...if you have thick hair, might not fit in properly for an half up half down hair do.  but for my thin and annoyingly  silky straight and hair, they fit just right.</li>
            <li> Love these.  They grip really tight.  I have thin shoulder length hair that slips right through most clips.  These hold well.</li>
            <li> the clip it self is great, it hold curly or straight hair for hours. However, ITS OVER PRICED! I went to Walmart and found the exact same clips for $4. Unless you don&#x27;t mind paying a couple of extra dollars then all means buy this.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give them 5 stars is because they get stuck in my hair.  I have very long, thick, soft, straight hair, and these are the only clips that will actually hold it in place without loosening up, but for some reason, they always get a few hairs tangled around the end prongs.  I am willing to deal with this minor inconvenience, because I can put them in place in the morning, and they stay put &#x27;till evening.</li>
            <li> These are strong enough to hold my thick hair into my customary bun, but small enough to go unnoticed. I&#x27;ve stopped buying any other clips. These are the only ones for me.</li>
            <li> I love these hair clips! Lately, many stores local to me haven&#x27;t been stocking this particular type anymore and I&#x27;ve been wasting money buying inferior clips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes these stand apart from the crowd?&lt;br /&gt;First, these hold a lot of hair. I have thick, long hair (mid back or so) that is quite heavy, especially when wet. I often can&#x27;t stand to have hair in my face when driving, working, or doing my makeup in the morning. This clip can hold my very thick heavy bun whether its wet or dry with just 1 clip. If i go walking, I usually will use two. Other cheap clips of similar size often require at LEAST two, if not 3-4 for the same hold.&lt;br /&gt;Second, these are very comfortable. The plastic &amp;#34;prongs&amp;#34; lay flat against your scalp. The more circular clips tend to dig in my scalp. Even when I fall asleep with these octopus clips, I don&#x27;t experience the pain that other clips inflict.&lt;br /&gt;Third, these are quite strong. Other clips of similar size break constantly on me. I am pretty hard on them as I often end up sleeping with a clip in my hair or tossing them at the bottom on my bag. I rarely break these octopus clips. I tend to lose them before they get a chance to break. I&#x27;m not sure if a difference in plastic/material is the cause of it but I think the design has a lot to do with the longevity (specifically the thicker &amp;#34;prongs&amp;#34;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to purchase these as long as they make them!</li>
            <li> Holds hair in place. No slipping.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my hair (thin). I have trouble finding clips that will stay in my hair, but these work really well.</li>
            <li> I use these as napkin holders for my mom when she eats (she&#x27;s nearly 90), not as hair clips, but with that in mind, these are rugged and don&#x27;t break like the cheaper ones.  Good product.  You can see from the photo that the grips are a bit longer than the other clips too, which doesn&#x27;t matter for what I use them for, but overall, A+ product.  Worth spending a little extra for.</li>
