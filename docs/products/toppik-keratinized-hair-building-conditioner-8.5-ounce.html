            <li>Now I&#x27;m just upset about having to pay more than $5 for each product</li>
            <li>Works well, makes hair more manageable and fuller.</li>
            <li>Gives you more confidence with its use.</li>
            <li>My friend said it&#x27;s like magic.</li>
            <li>me volume and easy to comb out...</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>So when i tried the product i was so pleased because it really does wonder.</li>
            <li>It feels and looks much healthier and more resilient.</li>
            <li>more ounce in the new container.  </li>
            <li>It makes my fine hair soft and silky but also strong.</li>
            <li>This conditioner really offsets that drying while keeping my hair looking full and reducing the side effects of the minoxidil.</li>
            <li>My hair is snow white, and very fine</li>
            <li>The only good point I can see is it doesn&#x27;t strip the hair of its&#x27; natural oils.</li>
            <li>My hair definitely looks better since I began using it.</li>
            <li>I first heard about this on Dr. Oz show, they made some demonstration on how the product works, so thought of ordering the product in amazon.com.</li>

            <li>Would certainly recommend it to anyone that needs  products to add body to their hair.</li>
            <li>Toppik Conditioner is very comparible to Pantene and Salon Formulas.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use this in conjunction with the shampoo and my thinning menopausal hair looks and feels so much thicker.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference...</li>
            <li>I ordered 3 bottles recently to get the free shipping.  </li>
            <li>As getting older and hair thinning this is the product to buy.</li>
            <li>My hair was so silky and soft .</li>
            <li>It no longer gives my hair the volume and bounce that it did with the old</li>
            <li>I looked at the last bottle to compare the amount, lettering/ wording and everything almost exactly the same.  </li>
            <li>Kind of expensive, might want to look into their value sets on their website.</li>
            <li>It appeared to be more thin after I used then before used it.</li>
            <li>I would return the other 2 unused bottles, but its just too much hassle.</li>

            <li> I would return the other 2 unused bottles, but its just too much hassle.</li>
            <li> have very fine thin hair and hard to comb out and Toppik Conditioner</li>
            <li> Plus one thing I was worried about, was it leaving my hair dry</li>
            <li> At first, I thought I received the wrong items because it was in a different container.  </li>
            <li> So I decide to buy all that was left and try them for me as well since I have thin fragile hair.</li>
            <li> It left my hair unclean feeling with a dull, limp look.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and find that it conditions my hair without leaving a residue to weigh it down.  </li>
            <li> so I buy him the thinning fibers and while one day at Sally&#x27;s on a refill run the lady up front tells me that the shampoo and conditioner is on sell for no more than 5$.</li>
            <li> I have thinning hair and usually my scalp would be showing on where i part my hair.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of the shampoo and the conditioner was not very good either.  </li>
            <li> By previous comments it looks like I&#x27;m the only one who is disappointed with this product, but it worked dastardly for me.</li>
            <li> , I use it before minoxidil (which has a 90%+ alcohol base) which normally drys ones hair.</li>
            <li> If you have problem like mine you won&#x27;t be disappointed using it.</li>
            <li> Worst shampoo I&#x27;ve ever had the misfortune of using.</li>

            <li> Toppik Conditioner is very comparible to Pantene and Salon Formulas.&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine thin hair and hard to comb out and Toppik Conditioner&lt;br /&gt;gave me volume and easy to comb out... I Love it!</li>
            <li> This works well, I use it before minoxidil (which has a 90%+ alcohol base) which normally drys ones hair. This conditioner really offsets that drying while keeping my hair looking full and reducing the side effects of the minoxidil. This is the bees knees if you have thinning hair. Kind of expensive, might want to look into their value sets on their website.</li>
            <li> just conditioner, I noticed no difference in my thinning hair</li>
            <li> Not a fan of the shampoo and the conditioner was not very good either.  Will not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I love all of the Toppik products.  My hair is snow white, and very fine and these products do give my hair lots of body.  Would certainly recommend it to anyone that needs  products to add body to their hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s does a very good job of filling you head of hair out so it looks fuller. My hair definitely looks better since I began using it.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has thinning hair so I buy him the thinning fibers and while one day at Sally&#x27;s on a refill run the lady up front tells me that the shampoo and conditioner is on sell for no more than 5$. So I decide to buy all that was left and try them for me as well since I have thin fragile hair. I could not have been more pleased!! They smell delicious! Plus one thing I was worried about, was it leaving my hair dry but it didn&#x27;t ! My hair was so silky and soft . Now I&#x27;m just upset about having to pay more than $5 for each product lol . I definitely recommend .</li>
            <li> Works well, makes hair more manageable and fuller.</li>
            <li> this product is really great it does just what it said it will do. As getting older and hair thinning this is the product to buy.</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with the shampoo and my thinning menopausal hair looks and feels so much thicker. It looks healthier also! Has a nice scent too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a simple shampoo</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference...</li>
            <li> Great product for thinning hair.  Gives you more confidence with its use. Easy to use. Covers areas of scalp and looks like your hair is thicker.</li>
            <li> I first heard about this on Dr. Oz show, they made some demonstration on how the product works, so thought of ordering the product in amazon.com. I have thinning hair and usually my scalp would be showing on where i part my hair. So when i tried the product i was so pleased because it really does wonder. My friend said it&#x27;s like magic.

            <li> I like this product very much, it helped make my hair more manageable after shampooing with Toppik shampoo, great stuff!!</li>
            <li> Does nothing but make your hair look thinner.</li>
            <li> Worst shampoo I&#x27;ve ever had the misfortune of using. It left my hair unclean feeling with a dull, limp look. It appeared to be more thin after I used then before used it. The only good point I can see is it doesn&#x27;t strip the hair of its&#x27; natural oils. By previous comments it looks like I&#x27;m the only one who is disappointed with this product, but it worked dastardly for me.</li>
            <li> Spouse really likes it!</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 bottles recently to get the free shipping.  At first, I thought I received the wrong items because it was in a different container.  I looked at the last bottle to compare the amount, lettering/ wording and everything almost exactly the same.  I think there is actually .1 more ounce in the new container.  It&#x27;s a squeeze tube type container.  So, since the manufacturer said there was no change in the formula, I didn&#x27;t mind the change in packaging.  That is until I used it.  It no longer gives my hair the volume and bounce that it did with the old formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not be buying anymore.  I would return the other 2 unused bottles, but its just too much hassle.</li>
            <li> I discovered this conditioner at Sally&#x27;s and thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. It turned out that I found a great product..!! It makes my fine hair soft and silky but also strong. It feels and looks much healthier and more resilient. Great product...highly recommended.</li>
