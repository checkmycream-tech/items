            <li>I love them</li>

            <li>and I look and feel sooooo much better.</li>
            <li>and  they work worked better then ice packs.  </li>
            <li>glad i got them</li>
            <li>cute,</li>
            <li>Really makes the eyes feel good.</li>
            <li>Tried these a couple of times but the cucumber scent was really strong and it irritated my eyes.</li>
            <li>and I enjoy it.</li>
            <li>and I thought these would be more economical</li>
            <li>This item would have been more effective if the substance inside was more like a gel that couldn&#x27;t freeze solid.</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t available.</li>
            <li>No way they fit on the eye.</li>
            <li>These really come in handy when you are on the computer a lot.  </li>
            <li>Just relax and enjoy the cool, relaxing feeling.  </li>
            <li>No too impressed, they don&#x27;t put off as much moisture as a wet washcloth to sooth the eyes</li>
            <li>It was bought as a present and my daughter loved it.</li>
            <li>Stay cool for 10 min after applying to the eyes.</li>
            <li>it was fast and easy transaction.</li>
            <li>Great little for sinus headache too.</li>
            <li>I like that they smell like cucumbers, fit okay bit to big.</li>
            <li>but I actually think that&#x27;s a good thing as they cover the whole eye.</li>
            <li>tHE OTHER PRODUCTS WERE GOOD.</li>
            <li>I keep them in the fridge &amp; when I need a mid-weight cooling pad for my eyes, these are one of the first I reach for.</li>
            <li>I think they could be smaller to fit the eye area better and actually sit on your eyelids, but they are too bigg</li>
            <li>they seem small, but actually they are a very good size to cover your whole cheek.</li>
            <li>They made these unnecessarily large.</li>
            <li>These little things are amazing.</li>
            <li>The coolness is very soothing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always heard that cucumber slices really work wonders for puffy eyes.  </li>
            <li>These coolers are much easier to keep on hand for when you need them.  </li>
            <li>They have a very soothing aroma as well.  </li>
            <li>Incredibly fast delivery and reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I have really itchy eyes</li>
            <li>very reliable product.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>GEL EYE COOLERS WERE TOO BIG TO FIT UNDER MY SLEEP MASK.</li>
            <li>They cover my whole eye and a bit above/below/beside it.</li>
            <li>The two sets I got seemed like they could use a little more gel inside of them.</li>
            <li>I love these, they are bigger than I expected</li>
            <li>ok, but a little too big and smelly</li>
            <li>Ever watch one of those \\&quot;great\\&quot; classic movies and cry through the entire movie with the next day wondering why you put yourself through so much pain with swollen eyes!</li>
            <li>and I completely forgot about them.....</li>
            <li>There is not enough fluid inside each pad to produce any results, hence my first sentence.&lt;br /&gt;Rokon, AZ</li>
            <li>Very soothing after a long  day of using my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I bought these for breastfeeding relief and also found them to be perfect for cold relief for my baby boy after his first round of shots-he was extremely sore.</li>
            <li>do help with my dark circles and with my hot flashes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sensitive to smells so that actually bothered me.</li>
            <li>Prior to them bursting I actually used them 6 times before completely giving up on them.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Lay flat!!</li>
            <li> I would rather use wet towel to do the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;Plastic smell</li>
            <li> These are WAY bigger than I expected.  </li>
            <li> use both day and night - cooled and under my serious eye mask - so very soothing - relaxing for napping and night time sleep</li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t actually just sit on them, you have to press them down on to your eyelids.</li>
            <li> All was as I expected it</li>
            <li> These pads work about as expected.</li>
            <li> where I expected maybe 2.  </li>
            <li> I keep in the refrig for soothing relief from both allergies irritating my eyes or should I watch one of those classic movies</li>
            <li> Other people may not find that a problem.</li>
            <li> chilled in less than half an hour after putting them in the refrigerator.</li>
            <li> I keep these little Cucs in the fridge and lay them on my eyes in the morning (afternoon) while having my coffee.</li>
            <li> When I wake up if my eyes hurt or if they feel like they have sand in them, I just put these little things on for a few minutes</li>
            <li> A few minutes of TLC from these little babies</li>
            <li> They become hard as rocks, therefore, not conforming to the eye at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried them cold though.</li>
            <li> I am often out late meeting with clients and don&#x27;t get the beauty rest my tired eyes</li>
            <li> i got them to soothe tired eyes.  </li>
            <li> When I got my order, it was dirty.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t stay on my eyes, unless I hold them in place - which is stupid.</li>
            <li> I have terrible allergies...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love these gel eye coolers. and they smell so nice.</li>
            <li> They are just as wonderful as they look and I am so glad I discovered them; they can be used anywhere!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> They made these unnecessarily large. You have to physically hold them to keep them from falling off your face. If they reduce eye puffiness, you wouldn&#x27;t know it. They smell good, though.</li>
            <li> Niiiiice. This always just feels nice. I especially like to use these when I have a headache. The coolness is very soothing.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let those martinis haunt you the next day!  Place in fridge or freezer and they are effective cold compress for swollen eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always heard that cucumber slices really work wonders for puffy eyes.  However, how often do you have a cucumber around when your eyes happen to be puffy and in need of soothing?  These coolers are much easier to keep on hand for when you need them.  You don&#x27;t have to worry about spoiling or something adding your eye soothers to a salad!</li>
            <li> I like that they smell like cucumbers, fit okay bit to big. Lay flat!!</li>
            <li> Just some gel in plastic bags. I would rather use wet towel to do the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;Plastic smell, no cucumber smell. Made in China.</li>
            <li> Very soothing after a long  day of using my eyes.  They have a very soothing aroma as well.  Incredibly fast delivery and reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Simply put they don&#x27;t do a thing. There is not enough fluid inside each pad to produce any results, hence my first sentence.&lt;br /&gt;Rokon, AZ</li>
            <li> Great and quick service and I am a happy customer. All was as I expected it and I enjoy it.</li>
            <li> I ordered these..... I put them in my fridge and I completely forgot about them..... I&#x27;ve never even used them. ha! I&#x27;m sue they work great!  I&#x27;m gonna use them tonight.</li>
            <li> use both day and night - cooled and under my serious eye mask - so very soothing - relaxing for napping and night time sleep</li>
            <li> I like them just wish they stayed cooler longer and the moister makes my eyes water.&lt;br /&gt;They do help with my dark circles and with my hot flashes.</li>
            <li> These  looked great online and I thought these would be more economical then the disposable ones so I purchased them but they were SO big they kept falling off my clients face.</li>
            <li> I received these gel eye coolers in the middle of March &amp; one of them burst yesterday! I am not a family of this product because once you freeze them they are not pliable.  They become hard as rocks, therefore, not conforming to the eye at all. This item would have been more effective if the substance inside was more like a gel that couldn&#x27;t freeze solid. Prior to them bursting I actually used them 6 times before completely giving up on them.</li>
            <li> fits inside my sleep mask and when my eyes are overtired from reading or watching tv they a re just the thing.  i have gotten many restful nights using t his product.  would definitely buy again</li>
            <li> When I got my order, it was dirty. It looked like it fell in the mud then packaged anyway.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a replacement but it wasn&#x27;t available. So I just asked for a refund.</li>
            <li> I work 3rd shift and have a problem with my eyes hurting. These little things are amazing. When I wake up if my eyes hurt or if they feel like they have sand in them, I just put these little things on for a few minutes and I&#x27;m good to go. I&#x27;ve only tried them cold though. Maybe one day I&#x27;ll try them warm.</li>
            <li> they seem small, but actually they are a very good size to cover your whole cheek.</li>
            <li> They look great and freeze over nicely blus they smell great I love them</li>
            <li> I love these, they are bigger than I expected but I use them at night under a sleep mask so it&#x27;s not an issue. It says not to freeze but I still did and let them thaw out a bit before putting them on and I haven&#x27;t had any issues. My eyes feel refreshed when I wake up :)</li>
            <li> I am often out late meeting with clients and don&#x27;t get the beauty rest my tired eyes would like, plus I have terrible allergies... I keep these little Cucs in the fridge and lay them on my eyes in the morning (afternoon) while having my coffee. A few minutes of TLC from these little babies and I look and feel sooooo much better. Great little for sinus headache too.</li>
            <li> It was bought as a present and my daughter loved it.</li>
            <li> No human eyes are this big. No way they fit on the eye. If you want eye brow coolers, buy these.</li>
            <li> No too impressed, they don&#x27;t put off as much moisture as a wet washcloth to sooth the eyes</li>
            <li> Soothing relief for irritated eyes.  Ever watch one of those \\&quot;great\\&quot; classic movies and cry through the entire movie with the next day wondering why you put yourself through so much pain with swollen eyes! I keep in the refrig for soothing relief from both allergies irritating my eyes or should I watch one of those classic movies</li>
            <li> This is perfect and the price was in the range I was looking for.</li>
            <li> These pads work about as expected. I have really itchy eyes and they did help some with that. My biggest problem was with the &#x27;cucumber&#x27; smell. I&#x27;m sensitive to smells so that actually bothered me. Other people may not find that a problem. Also the plastic kind of sticks to you eye so when you remove the pad it pulls on your skin. It might help to moisturize your eyes a bit before using.</li>
            <li> Recently had eye surgery, purchased these to reduce swelling and  they work worked better then ice packs.  I m still using them as they are a great way to fall asleep and wake up refreshed.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like them.  When I put them in my eye mask they fell out at night when I slept.  they are still in my refrigerator.</li>
            <li> ok, but a little too big and smelly</li>
            <li> i got them to soothe tired eyes.  i was amazed at how well they rejuvenated the eys!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;very glad i got them</li>
            <li> I like it! very reliable product. I recommended</li>
            <li> cute, but that&#x27;s all... it&#x27;s not like the best thing in the world. it don&#x27;t have anything else to say</li>
            <li> I bought these for breastfeeding relief and also found them to be perfect for cold relief for my baby boy after his first round of shots-he was extremely sore.</li>
            <li> WAS HAVING PROBLEMS WITH SWELLING EYES EVERY MORNING.  SAW THESE AND TOUGHT I WOULD TRY THEM.  WHAT A RELIEF!&lt;br /&gt;THEY DON&#x27;T TAKE CARE OF ALL THE SWELLING BUT DOES HELP TO REDUCE IT.  FEELS GREAT AND IT EVEN HAS A PLEASANT SMELL.  IT&#x27;S VERY PLEASANT TO USE.  I RECOMMEND THEM IF YOU WANT A &amp;#34;FEEL GOOD&amp;#34; EXPERIENCE.</li>
            <li> Very effective on puffy eyes</li>
            <li> Tried these a couple of times but the cucumber scent was really strong and it irritated my eyes. Maybe they just were not for me and my skin. I would still buy from this seller it was fast and easy transaction.</li>
            <li> I like these, they work well. Very refreshing and calming. I think they could be smaller to fit the eye area better and actually sit on your eyelids, but they are too bigg so they don&#x27;t actually just sit on them, you have to press them down on to your eyelids.</li>
            <li> These really come in handy when you are on the computer a lot.  Really makes the eyes feel good. Thanks</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t stay on my eyes, unless I hold them in place - which is stupid.</li>
            <li> GEL EYE COOLERS WERE TOO BIG TO FIT UNDER MY SLEEP MASK. DEEP MEDITATION FOR HEALING WAS INAUDIBLE. tHE OTHER PRODUCTS WERE GOOD.</li>
            <li> I like these a lot when I need something for my migraines. I keep them in the fridge &amp; when I need a mid-weight cooling pad for my eyes, these are one of the first I reach for.</li>
            <li> These feel fantastic… wish the were unscented though</li>
            <li> A lot bigger than I thought, but I actually think that&#x27;s a good thing as they cover the whole eye. They cover my whole eye and a bit above/below/beside it. The two sets I got seemed like they could use a little more gel inside of them.</li>
            <li> Stay cool for 10 min after applying to the eyes. chilled in less than half an hour after putting them in the refrigerator.</li>
            <li> they work great if you can handle the coldness against your eyeballs.  good price too.  i would recommend to a friend</li>
            <li> Everyone should own a set of these.  Just relax and enjoy the cool, relaxing feeling.  Great gift idea and good price</li>
            <li> These work well, help decrease puffiness</li>
            <li> These are WAY bigger than I expected.  The diameter is about 3&amp;#34; where I expected maybe 2.  Bigger than I need for each eye, but still gets the job done.</li>
    </ol>
