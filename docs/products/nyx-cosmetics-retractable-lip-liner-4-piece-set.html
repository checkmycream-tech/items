            <li>Love Them.</li>
            <li>Great deal, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The tips break easily during application.</li>
            <li>Easy application.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the best part for me because you get to use all of the product without shaving half of it away like with pencil liners.</li>
            <li>Love the colors, they work really well and for 10 bucks their pretty good.</li>
            <li>The colors are BRIGHT and the lasting power is pretty good ...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually a huge fan of Nyx cosmetics.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of NYX Cosmetics.  </li>
            <li>Smooth application.  </li>
            <li>One of the colors is a bit lighter than I can use but all three others are fabulous.  </li>
            <li>The colors in the set are good natural tone colors.</li>
            <li>k you so much :)</li>
            <li>This is a nice, soft, creamy formula.  </li>
            <li>but I still feel like there&#x27;s a good variety of colors &amp; especially for the price</li>
            <li>they came super quick and it was a bargain considering that these lip pencils alone go for about $5 each,</li>
            <li>I use them to fill in my entire lip and it fades out to a nice lip stain</li>
            <li>but when i tried applying it, the pencil broke have do it super gently i guess</li>
            <li>Beautiful colors and last long.</li>
            <li>Also, the shipping was super fast.  </li>
            <li>Consistently good pigmentation from the eye shadows to the lip liners and always much cheaper than a lot of the other stuff out there (even department store brands).</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I got different colors and my favorite is nutmeg</li>
            <li>I love having multiple shades to choose from when I want to switch up my lipstick.  </li>
            <li>Any color liner is okay for the purpose of keeping the lipstick from running, as long as it is light enough to cover with the lipstick and these liners all are.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Will Buy Them Again Very Soon ♡</li>
            <li>that is because the rolled the pencil too high</li>
            <li>however the lightest one is kind of hard to see, the brownish and dark pink are absolutely beautiful as for the red!</li>
            <li>I used mine in conjunction with lip stain to last the whole night, and it worked!</li>
            <li>Love them they glide on perfectly no smearing an long lasting...super cute with lip gloss also bring alot of attention to my lips</li>
            <li>All four pencils appear to have more pink than I expected</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and I received it sooner than expected.</li>
            <li>Very creamy and longer lasting than I even expected.  </li>
            <li>They barely show up and all colors look same on</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually a huge fan of Nyx cosmetics. These liners suck. They barely show up and all colors look same on</li>
            <li> i recommend to everyone i love it</li>
            <li> Love the colors, they work really well and for 10 bucks their pretty good. But I recommend putting on lip balm or chapstick it helps to apply easier. But over all loved them.</li>
            <li> Just got my order &amp; im in love w all of them. Best of all got my order on time .They great colors . Thanks k you so much :)</li>
            <li> good variety of colors</li>
            <li> Love them they glide on perfectly no smearing an long lasting...super cute with lip gloss also bring alot of attention to my lips &#x3D;D Must Buy♡</li>
            <li> the colors are good but when i tried applying it, the pencil broke have do it super gently i guess</li>
            <li> Nice selection at a great price</li>
            <li> Loooooved the different shades provided. All of them work, stay put, and last a while. I used mine in conjunction with lip stain to last the whole night, and it worked!</li>
            <li> Nicely pigmented colors! Excellent price for a great deal. Love them!</li>
            <li> I only found about three of these wearable (one is too orangey for me personal).  This is a nice, soft, creamy formula.  Creamier and softer than most all lip pencils I have tried.  Won&#x27;t pull or tug lips; doesn&#x27;t wear quite as long as drier formulas.  The photo color representation is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good value, and I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Great deal on these lip liners.  They are quality liners and the colors a good.  They are from red to a neutral.. These are good to use on the outline of the lip and then put lipstick over everything.  The liners prevent the lipstick from running all over the place.  They really work and this package is a great price for all the liners.  Any color liner is okay for the purpose of keeping the lipstick from running, as long as it is light enough to cover with the lipstick and these liners all are.  Great deal, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product, good value for the money</li>
            <li> All this is missing is a nude and you would have every color you need,the peachy one has a shimmer though which I didn&#x27;t like but the colors are stunning.</li>
            <li> I really love these. I use them almost everyday. The citrus one is a little bit weird looking on the lips for me but I still feel like there&#x27;s a good variety of colors &amp; especially for the price</li>
            <li> These lip liners glide on and there is no wood to sharpen. That&#x27;s the best part for me because you get to use all of the product without shaving half of it away like with pencil liners. These work beautifully with the whole Nyx lip product line including the Butter Lip Glosses and the Matte Lipsticks</li>
            <li> The best liners by far.</li>
            <li> i love them they came super quick and it was a bargain considering that these lip pencils alone go for about $5 each, but instead you got 4 with $10</li>
            <li> These liners go perfect with the lip glosses I purchased from NYX.</li>
            <li> Colors were as expected.  Smooth application.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Loved them! Perfect fall colors.</li>
            <li> pencils are too soft and messy. The tips break easily during application.</li>
            <li> These lip pencils are great! Im a lisenced makeup artist / esthetician. I love that i dont need to carry a sharpener, and there is no chance of getting a splinter in your lip! Boy does that ever hurt. Lol great colors and great value for 4 pencils, will be ordering more!</li>
            <li> Great colors. Nice smooth texture.  Easy application.  Great base for lip gloss or lipstick.</li>
            <li> these are the best lip liners ever the colors are very pigmented and the stay on for a really good time. And this collection has the best colors. I also love that you don&#x27;t have to use a sharpener every time. You have to be careful though I&#x27;ve seen some people say that it broke and that is because the rolled the pencil too high you just need to roll it for the tip to show. For this price I would never hesitate to buy them again.</li>
            <li> Very nice! Beautiful colors and last long.</li>
            <li> One of the colors is a bit lighter than I can use but all three others are fabulous.  Very creamy and longer lasting than I even expected.  Very happy customer!</li>
            <li> Great value for the price I paid.  The colors are BRIGHT and the lasting power is pretty good ... I use them to fill in my entire lip and it fades out to a nice lip stain so you still have color.  Shipping was fast and I received it sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> Nice, but too glittery.</li>
            <li> Omg best lip liners ever!! LOVE EM</li>
            <li> I got different colors and my favorite is nutmeg which a brown color that I apply under my light nudes and gives a beautiful color</li>
            <li> dry and hard to apply.  You pay for what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Love Them. Will Buy Them Again Very Soon ♡</li>

Consistently good pigmentation from the eye shadows to the lip liners and always much cheaper than a lot of the other stuff out there (even department store brands).
