            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>Nice Product.  </li>
            <li>Makes scalp feel nice, still waiting for my hair to get thicker from supplements from Viviscal</li>
            <li>This stuff is wonderful, it gives your scalp a pouf feeling it opens up your whole head with amazing vigor, I use it all over my scalp  </li>
            <li>I have not been able to use it yet, I put fiber on my hair</li>
            <li>it works ok.</li>
            <li>We all love this hair cream.</li>
            <li>We all have strong, healthy looking hairs.</li>
            <li>The product is totally free of sticky stuffs.</li>
            <li>At first I tried rogain for women, but it provoked more hair loss</li>
            <li>Specially me and my daughters.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not losing as much hair as I was before, my hair has more volume and strength after using it for about two months.</li>
            <li>Works very well on the top of the scalp but does not seem to be helping at the crown.</li>
            <li>Anyway I highly recommend you to use this product as preciously as described.</li>
            <li>After two more weeks I can seek its of new hair.</li>
            <li>all natural product is full of nutrients needed for a healthy hair.</li>
            <li>I probably tend to use too much product because I want to make sure my whole scalp is covered, so I just use it in the evening, instead of twice a day.</li>
            <li>Even though we have different types of skin and hair this product is equally effective.</li>
            <li>This hair serum leaves my hair feeling smooth and soft after I apply it.</li>
            <li>And I definitely buying more of this stuff, because it works for me like nothing else.</li>
            <li>That works very well for me.</li>
            <li>I really like it and intend to keep using it.</li>
            <li>I am taking the Viviscal Supplements and also doing once a week laser treatments - the combination is really making my hair grow longer and thicker</li>
            <li>I really like the results.  </li>
            <li>I love the Viviscal oral vitamins but this serum burns a little on the scalp and leaves the roots of your hair looking oily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Actually I can’t use many skin related applications because of my extra sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>it makes the hair soft.</li>
            <li>But this all natural product do no harm at all.</li>

            <li> This product is amazing. I had a problem with hair loss related to stress and lost approximately 40% of my hair. At first I tried rogain for women, but it provoked more hair loss and I became desperate to try anything, something that would bring my hair back.

            <li> We all love this hair cream. Me, my husband, my two daughters and also my son, we all use this cream and we all are happy and satisfied with the outcome. Even though we have different types of skin and hair this product is equally effective. In the past we use to have different types of hair creams. Specially me and my daughters. But this product changed that eventually.&lt;br /&gt;Actually I can’t use many skin related applications because of my extra sensitive skin. But this all natural product do no harm at all. I didn’t even feel a scratch ever since I have begun to use this awesome product.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply too. I don’t even feel it over my hair throughout the day. The product is totally free of sticky stuffs. I hate hair creams with such effects. Such products leave greasy feeling. But with this product I have never felt it even after hours of work under the sun.&lt;br /&gt;This  all natural product is full of nutrients needed for a healthy hair. Our family is a living proof for that. We all have strong, healthy looking hairs. Anyway I highly recommend you to use this product as preciously as described. That way you shall have a optimum result.</li>
