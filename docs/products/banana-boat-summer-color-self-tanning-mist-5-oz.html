            <li>In the morning, I showered without scrubing my body &amp; put lotion on and the color was just perfect!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best sunless tanner out there.</li>
            <li>Great stuff!!!</li>
            <li>The best self tanner I have used.</li>
            <li>so well I ordered more!!!</li>
            <li>It works incredibly well.</li>
            <li>Being fair skinned, I have used just about every brand under $20 of self-tanner!  </li>
            <li>I loved this!  </li>
            <li>I have this beautiful even tan, with glowing skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so great.</li>
            <li>works great for what I needed.</li>
            <li>Goes on great and even.</li>
            <li>Tan is great.</li>
            <li>But it is a very nice shade.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like the rest of the self-tanners, which I can&#x27;t tolerate, it has a nice citrus scent!</li>
            <li>My skin is fair, not pasty, this product works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten a ton of compliments and my skin looks gorgeous.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>After about 3 hours, I had the perfect golden tan.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I found this!</li>
            <li>Love it and will keep using it!</li>
            <li>My favorite tanning spray!</li>
            <li>So glad I found it on Amazon, since I can&#x27;t find it at wal mart or walgreens anymore!</li>
            <li>Fortunately it was fairly easy to scrub off, and then I was very happy.  </li>
            <li>This tanner is amazing.</li>
            <li>Really nice, stepped finish.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t turn you Orange, gives you a nice bronze that matches your skin tone.</li>
            <li>This spray tanner is nice.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s not streaky because each layer is so light, which is good.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used many self tanners before but this one is BY FAR the best yet.  </li>
            <li>I got color after about 2-3 hours as it states, but I have more of an orange look than a tan.</li>
            <li>no streaks or blotches though, just more of an orange color.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and would recommend it to anybody.</li>
            <li>The only bonus is that the company were excellent at refunding me ASAP.  </li>
            <li>For a self tanner, i was really pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>i would recommend, for sure.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite of the self tanners I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I love the results.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many brands.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you spray it evenly and don&#x27;t hold it too close to your skin.</li>
            <li>Suggest lotion probable cover the skin better</li>
            <li>Smell is okay.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s better for your skin.  </li>
            <li>The lotion is way better.</li>
            <li>A nice color tone with no bad smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t smell like self-tanner.  </li>
            <li>This seemed easy because it is a spray.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and covers well.</li>
            <li>Strong Dha smell though and a bit sticky.</li>
            <li>This self tanner leaves a nice and even color with the first application.  </li>
            <li>Dries quick and the smell is ok.</li>
            <li>It can be applied fast and with ease, doesn&#x27;t streak, dries quickly, isn&#x27;t sticky, and the original smell is good.</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>I did light coats since I was worried about how it would look.</li>
            <li>but after a few coats, it is wonderful!</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m giving it four stars because it really has a nice color</li>
            <li>It smells good and it sprays clear</li>
            <li>It was a very nice, deep color.  </li>
            <li>Super easy to apply.</li>
            <li>and also such a nice glow to your skin as well!</li>
            <li>This specific kind is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>and before to get dress, pass a towel to clean any excess.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t look orange, nor yellow a perfect golden tan and looks very natural!  </li>
            <li>It gives a nice gradual and natural looking tan (no orange color!)</li>
            <li>so the next day my feet were bright orange.  </li>
            <li>Because it is so light, I rarely have any streaks.  </li>
            <li>Even better if you can use this product at night and let it really soak in as you sleep and shower away the smell in the morning.</li>
            <li>I am happy with this product and might buy it again, although I might try other brands, since I haven&#x27;t before.</li>
            <li>The mist goes on evenly and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick, adds 3min.</li>
            <li>Ok, so when i bought this i had high hopes for it.  </li>
            <li>So this was my first self-tanner product ever!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s much more natural looking.</li>
            <li>It is inexpensive, and worth the price.  </li>
            <li>Worth every cent.</li>
            <li>Hands turned orange even though I washed them right away, but I guess that comes with any self tanner...</li>
            <li>$6.75 witch is not expensive at all</li>
            <li>Smells like hot garbage,sprays like a faulty hose,and works like a chocolate fire guard.  </li>
            <li>everyone thinks it&#x27;s real!</li>
            <li>I do not recommend to use it more than twice in a week because if you look close, you could see some white cracks on your skin.  </li>
            <li>This product does, however, need a few coats to get good color</li>
            <li>This kind also seems to last a lot longer and hold up in water better than the other brands that I have tried.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great product because it isn&#x27;t heavy like some lotions and looks SO natural.</li>
            <li>Been using this for a long time and love it.</li>
            <li>You can also get your back without having to rub it in because the mist is so fine.  </li>
            <li>and I used this two days in a row and every noticed how much healthier and tanner</li>
            <li>I do get very tan, but we all know the damage it does.</li>
            <li>I use a wash cloth to really wash my hands.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s rubbed in, it will dry very quickly and look very even with no</li>
            <li>The smell is also better than a lot of the other tanners.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best way to get that deep dark, summer color all year long!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why this happened because the rest of me looked amazing.  </li>
            <li>But it is a little sticky when it dries, so there might be better out there.</li>
            <li>my arms are naturally tan because of the sun, and the fake tan actually matches my arm tan perfectly.</li>
            <li>I also apply sunscreen normally as this does not contain sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I live in Seattle</li>
            <li>make sure you spray the tops of your feet though a little or you get a line at your ankles!    </li>
            <li>But WOW.</li>
            <li>I bought this product about a week ago, I already have an natural orange undertone to my skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a natural redhead</li>
            <li>Banana Boat has always been my preference- giving me the most natural looking tan with the least amount of streaks.  </li>
            <li>After I applied the first coat, I stepped outta the shower and used my blow dryer to dry off..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s long lasting and very real!</li>
            <li>For $6 some stores can be $1-$2 more but at least you won&#x27;t have to pay for shipping and no waiting!</li>
            <li>I am going back to Jergen&#x27;s natural glow</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s only because I applied it three days in a row and barely noticed any color.</li>
            <li>Clean dry skin (usually after shower), and ALWAYS wash hands thoroughly when done.</li>

            <li> but that&#x27;s only because I applied it three days in a row and barely noticed any color.</li>
            <li> Clean dry skin (usually after shower), and ALWAYS wash hands thoroughly when done.</li>
            <li> Eventually, it does turn to the classic sunless tanner smell, but it&#x27;s not very strong at all and doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> so I showered, then I dried myself completely, and started to spray away.  </li>
            <li> Since I have been using tanners a long time, my suggestions are.</li>
            <li> I put on one coat and let it dry and then added another coat about 10 minutes after.</li>
            <li> After spraying it took quite a while to dry.  </li>
            <li> and since it sprays upside down you can get your back!</li>
            <li> There was absolutely no color change in my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve tried quite a few different ones.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the entire can with one to two layers everyday for four days.</li>
            <li> Longer than other spray brands I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> Compliments are endless.</li>
            <li> I applied 2 coats, from the neck down</li>
            <li> Less odor than some of the others &amp; I haven&#x27;t had problems with streaking, etc.  </li>
            <li> so it does not make a mess.</li>
            <li> so wait at least 20 minutes to dry  </li>
            <li> I had wasted about half the can on three applications.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little on the pricey side though.</li>
            <li> I get just a little sun, but use this 3x a week.</li>
            <li> so I was afraid I was going to be really orange.</li>
            <li> The color wasn&#x27;t bad- pretty typical quality there.  </li>
            <li> I am very pale, so I just wanted a little color.</li>

            <li> Used it as the directions explain...for this if you put two coats on it is suppose to last for 7 days...I got color after about 2-3 hours as it states, but I have more of an orange look than a tan. Dries quick and the smell is ok. Hands turned orange even though I washed them right away, but I guess that comes with any self tanner...no streaks or blotches though, just more of an orange color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a spray, so adjust for the process: towel your skin after washing, step in the shower and do a thorough job. Really nice, stepped finish. I have KP and my skin is agreeable. My skin is fair, not pasty, this product works. Recommend!</li>
            <li> This tanner is amazing. I bought it at target for $6 a bottle and was skeptical because i haven&#x27;t heard of it. But WOW. It&#x27;s so great. I put on one coat and let it dry and then added another coat about 10 minutes after. After about 3 hours, I had the perfect golden tan. If you&#x27;ve ever seen somebody with a mystic tan that&#x27;s what it looks like. Fantastic. It smells good and it sprays clear so it does not make a mess. I&#x27;ve gotten a ton of compliments and my skin looks gorgeous. I&#x27;m very pale and I usually get streaky. You don&#x27;t have to rub it in at all and since it sprays upside down you can get your back! I love this stuff and would recommend it to anybody. YAY!</li>
            <li> I bought this product about a week ago, I already have an natural orange undertone to my skin so I was afraid I was going to be really orange. It didn&#x27;t turn me orange, but it didn&#x27;t turn me tan either. I put thick coats on every day and I have seen nothing, no change, no tan...nothing.</li>
            <li> I went to target and found it for $6 with taxes it came out to $6.75 witch is not expensive at all but it&#x27;s $12 plus shipping and handling are you kidding me that&#x27;s a total ripp off! You can find it at any drug store and walmart,ulta,target etc... Anywhere!! For $6 some stores can be $1-$2 more but at least you won&#x27;t have to pay for shipping and no waiting!</li>
            <li> Despite following the directions to a t, i ended up with streaky, blotchy skin. What a rip off! I am going back to Jergen&#x27;s natural glow, it&#x27;s much more natural looking.</li>
            <li> Being fair skinned, I have used just about every brand under $20 of self-tanner!  Banana Boat has always been my preference- giving me the most natural looking tan with the least amount of streaks.  This specific kind is my favorite.  The mist goes on evenly and dries quickly.  Because it is so light, I rarely have any streaks.  You can also get your back without having to rub it in because the mist is so fine.  The smell is also better than a lot of the other tanners.  This kind also seems to last a lot longer and hold up in water better than the other brands that I have tried.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used many self tanners before but this one is BY FAR the best yet.  I&#x27;m very pale and I used this two days in a row and every noticed how much healthier and tanner I looked.  It works incredibly well. It gives a nice gradual and natural looking tan (no orange color!) and also such a nice glow to your skin as well! It&#x27;s easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t smell like self-tanner.  If it&#x27;s rubbed in, it will dry very quickly and look very even with no streaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product because it isn&#x27;t heavy like some lotions and looks SO natural. I will be using this the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> Awful product.  Smells like hot garbage,sprays like a faulty hose,and works like a chocolate fire guard.  The only bonus is that the company were excellent at refunding me ASAP.  So I&#x27;ll 100% use this seller again but not for this &#x27;awful&#x27; product.</li>
            <li> For a self tanner, i was really pleased with this product.  It is inexpensive, and worth the price.  It takes a couple of coats to reach a desired color but it isn&#x27;t streaky or orange.  make sure you spray the tops of your feet though a little or you get a line at your ankles!    i would recommend, for sure.</li>
            <li> I have never used a self tanner before because I was afraid of being orange or streaky. This seemed easy because it is a spray. I am very pale, so I just wanted a little color. I had to do four coats over two days to get any color at all. I did light coats since I was worried about how it would look. But it is a very nice shade. my arms are naturally tan because of the sun, and the fake tan actually matches my arm tan perfectly. And it&#x27;s not streaky because each layer is so light, which is good. I am happy with this product and might buy it again, although I might try other brands, since I haven&#x27;t before. And it was only $8 at Target. But it is a little sticky when it dries, so there might be better out there.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite of the self tanners I&#x27;ve tried.  Less odor than some of the others &amp; I haven&#x27;t had problems with streaking, etc.  It&#x27;s a little on the pricey side though.</li>
            <li> Worked so well I ordered more!!!</li>
            <li> So this was my first self-tanner product ever! I was debating between this one and the L&#x27;OREAL Sublime airbrush, but I chose this one. I have fair-skin, when I tan in the summer, I usually get red-brown, then the next day brown..so I showered, then I dried myself completely, and started to spray away.  I applied 2 coats, from the neck down &amp; I used a bronzer on my face, because it didn&#x27;t state that it won&#x27;t clog your pores, but with the L&#x27;OREAl, it states it won&#x27;t clog pores, so I didn&#x27;t want to take the chance.  After I applied the first coat, I stepped outta the shower and used my blow dryer to dry off..then I applied the 2 coat and just went to the bed.  In the morning, I showered without scrubing my body &amp; put lotion on and the color was just perfect! I don&#x27;t look orange, nor yellow a perfect golden tan and looks very natural!  It doesn&#x27;t smell like the rest of the self-tanners, which I can&#x27;t tolerate, it has a nice citrus scent!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I&#x27;ve had a lot of comments about my tan...everyone thinks it&#x27;s real! I don&#x27;t tan at all, so products like these save me from being pasty. It&#x27;s the best sunless tanner out there. It can be applied fast and with ease, doesn&#x27;t streak, dries quickly, isn&#x27;t sticky, and the original smell is good. Eventually, it does turn to the classic sunless tanner smell, but it&#x27;s not very strong at all and doesn&#x27;t last long. This product does, however, need a few coats to get good color but after a few coats, it is wonderful!</li>
            <li> I love the results.  It&#x27;s long lasting and very real! I&#x27;ve tried many brands.  I&#x27;ve even tried much more expensive brands.  This is by far the best way to get that deep dark, summer color all year long!  I&#x27;m so glad that I found this!</li>
            <li> I loved this!  It was a very nice, deep color.  Except for on my face.  I put it on at night, and when I woke up in the morning my face was orange!  I&#x27;m not sure why this happened because the rest of me looked amazing.  Fortunately it was fairly easy to scrub off, and then I was very happy.  So I&#x27;m giving it four stars because it really has a nice color, I just wouldn&#x27;t reccoment applying to your face.</li>
            <li> Ok, so when i bought this i had high hopes for it.  I brought it home and took a shower and exfloiated like you&#x27;re supposed to.  I sprayed it and waited a couple hours.  There was absolutely no color change in my skin tone.  I&#x27;m a natural redhead so i have the dreadful pasty white skin. I thought mabey if i sprayed it again i could see some color. Nope. I sprayed it a third time the next day and i still didn&#x27;t notice a change in color.  The smell gags you and it feels sticky on your skin.  The only color that i got was on the bottom of my feet. I didn&#x27;t even realize that i sprayed some on my bathroom floor and stepped on it so the next day my feet were bright orange.  Eww.   I had wasted about half the can on three applications.  I just threw it away because that&#x27;s where this product belongs. In the trash.</li>
            <li> works great for what I needed. A nice color tone with no bad smell.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!!! This spray tan looks just like my sun tan. Amazing...thought i would never find a product that didnt scream fake tan! No orange, no splotches, no staining. Super easy to apply. YouTube has a brief application demo. Love it and will keep using it!</li>
            <li> I had a bad experience and won&#x27;t be buying again.  In fact, I used it once and will be giving it away or tossing.  After spraying it took quite a while to dry.  Longer than other spray brands I&#x27;ve used.  The color wasn&#x27;t bad- pretty typical quality there.  What I had the hardest time with was the smell!!!! It was so bad and kept me and my husband up all night.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s only because I applied it three days in a row and barely noticed any color. The nozzle also keeps getting clogged and product squirts out rather than mists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applying on the face is tricky as the hand method it suggests left me feeling like something HAD to be missed, but if you spray it directly on your face BEWARE because it will leave a horrible taste on your lips ruining anything you eat the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again, I prefer the neutrgoena micro mist.</li>
            <li> Goes on great and even. Strong Dha smell though and a bit sticky. The color is subtle which would make it hard to screw up. Not the worst but not the best.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a long time and love it. I do get very tan, but we all know the damage it does. I get just a little sun, but use this 3x a week.I have this beautiful even tan, with glowing skin. Compliments are endless. People think I either lay in the sun all day or hit the tanning bed. Hehe I tell them if they ask. Since I have been using tanners a long time, my suggestions are. Clean dry skin (usually after shower), and ALWAYS wash hands thoroughly when done. I use a wash cloth to really wash my hands. It&#x27;s quick, adds 3min. to my routine, drys in a flash, and looks (well let the compliments answer that one.)</li>
            <li> My favorite tanning spray! Doesn&#x27;t turn you Orange, gives you a nice bronze that matches your skin tone. Love, love, love! So glad I found it on Amazon, since I can&#x27;t find it at wal mart or walgreens anymore!</li>
            <li> I bought some of this so my legs would match my arms. It works well. Just make sure you spray it evenly and don&#x27;t hold it too close to your skin. Hold about 12 inches or so from your body and you&#x27;re good to go. It&#x27;s easy to use and covers well. That tanning product smell is present with this spray, but it is faint and fades after a while. Even better if you can use this product at night and let it really soak in as you sleep and shower away the smell in the morning.</li>
            <li> Got the spray for my daughter, turned her skin orange, I wouldent waist my money..Suggest lotion probable cover the skin better</li>
            <li> The best self tanner I have used. I live in Seattle so I&#x27;ve tried quite a few different ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick is to rub it in. I don&#x27;t know how you could miss that. I&#x27;ve used the entire can with one to two layers everyday for four days. Smell is okay. Tan is great. Worth every cent.</li>
            <li> This spray tanner is nice.  It doesn&#x27;t take forever like the lotions to add some color.  I used this on my mother and it took about 10 minutes to apply.  It doesn&#x27;t rub off on clothes easier and it&#x27;s better for your skin.  I also apply sunscreen normally as this does not contain sunscreen.</li>
            <li> The lotion is way better.</li>
            <li> This self tanner leaves a nice and even color with the first application.  I do not recommend to use it more than twice in a week because if you look close, you could see some white cracks on your skin.  It could stain your clothes so wait at least 20 minutes to dry  and before to get dress, pass a towel to clean any excess.</li>
