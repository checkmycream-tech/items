            <li> Purchased these to replace a pair I bought about 9  years earlier. I was looking for a replacement pair for about 8 months. My old pair had gotten  too dull after almost 9 years. I looked at all the stores in my town that carried these kind of scissors and I couldn&#x27;t find these,I found them on Amazon and I was and am very pleased with them.They make cutting my Mother&#x27;s toenails a quick job.Don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase these great toenail scissors.

            <li> These toenail scissors have the bulk to actually cut through the toughest toenails. They are almost impossible to find in stores.
