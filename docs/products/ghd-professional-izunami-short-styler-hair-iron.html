            <li> a lot of products claim to be professional, but this one actually carries through, I&#x27;m a guy</li>
            <li> one day he used his Izunami flat iron to do my hair</li>
            <li> at my time line at bottom and FF to where I flat iron my hair</li>
            <li> maybe it wasent the flat iron</li>
            <li> It should not have been a problem for this iron to leave lasting smooth iron results, but sadly that was not the case.</li>
            <li> the other larger stylers can&#x27;t quite get to my roots like the short styler does</li>
            <li> so i ended up purchasin the 1\\&quot; flat iron by izunami!!!</li>
            <li> I have kept it too long for it to qualify as a return purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a Short Styler Hair Iron but for some reason the results of using this iron left my hair a frizzy mess.</li>
            <li> Hope it lasts a really long time!</li>
            <li> Even with that happeneing i wanted to order another hoping it was just a single defective iron.  </li>
            <li> its just like any other flat iron to me, maybe its</li>
            <li> My only complaint is it burned out after only two weeks use.</li>
            <li> The heat of this iron did not smooth out my hair well enough</li>
            <li> I wanted small  iron for short hair</li>
            <li> and this is the only flat iron (I&#x27;ve had several small one&#x27;s) that will allow me to get as close to my scalp as the one&#x27;s that go in the oven!!!!  </li>
            <li> Cons:  Haven&#x27;t found  any as of now, but will update after a few weeks again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> The iron just seems to not have a firm grip - does that make sense?</li>
            <li> and I didnt realize how small it was</li>
            <li> I do like the small plates on this so that you can get close to the edges.  </li>
            <li> I AM A PROFESSIONAL HAIRSTYLIST, AND I PURCHASED THIS ITEM TO USE IN MY EVERYDAY LINE OF WORK, AND IT WAS HORRIBLE.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I was loyal to my FHI Runaway which I paid almost $300 for and thought no other flat iron out there could surpass it. Then my friend, a 20 year veteran in the hair industry, came to Atlanta to judge a hair show and one day he used his Izunami flat iron to do my hair and I fell in love with the iron. Immediate heat up, sleek and smooth styling and no frizz/burn. I have since packed my FHI away, I purchased this iron and the blow dryer,which is equally outstanding, for [...] each at [...]</li>
            <li> You must check out my VIDEO HERE [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look at my time line at bottom and FF to where I flat iron my hair w/the IZUNAMI IRON.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its the best and I thank JANEL SEALY-SMITH for showing me how GREAT this irons works!</li>
            <li> I have the 1 inch as well as this one, but this would have to be my favorite! I am able to get really close to the edges when I am in between relaxers and need to get them bone straight! Heats up really fast and gets the job done. Definitely a must have for me!!</li>
            <li> I bought this styler to help straigthen my roots since i am growing my relaxer out...the other larger stylers can&#x27;t quite get to my roots like the short styler does and I LUV IT!!! i saw a stylist at the shop using a smaller iron to get the client&#x27;s roots and I was like i need to do that when i do my own hair. Then i saw this styler...i didn&#x27;t know how well it works but after seeing all the product reviews for this brand i was sold. I am very satifised with my purchase because the iron works very well!!! works much better than the CHI iron that I had so i ended up purchasin the 1\\&quot; flat iron by izunami!!!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this flat iron, because I had read so many good reviews for it but its just like any other flat iron to me, maybe its because I got the short styler and I didnt realize how small it was, maybe I should get the one inch....but it does heat up very fast and it is a on stroke hit! Im thinking it didnt work on me because I put heat protecter on my hair, which I never do...I didnt like the way it made my hair feel so maybe it wasent the flat iron, maybe it was the product I put on my hair....I will try it again after two weeks and update my review...</li>
            <li> Review after 1 use:  I have very wavy hair and I was looking for a .5 inch straightener. So when I saw this Izunami, I found it to be the perfect size. The other Izunami,the 1 inch one had great reviews so I went ahead and ordered this, I&#x27;m glad I did. It arrived 2 days ahead of the estimated date, and when I opened it, wow! I didn&#x27;t know I was gonna get a special edition one, It was in this brown leather case. The case it self was awesome, and very well made. I knew from the case, this was gonna be a quality straightener. I tried it and the good things I found out were that  1) The Cord is lengthy  2) Temperature can be adjusted.  3) Heats very fast, in &lt;30 secs and when ready the light blinks, making it easy to know when it is ready.  3) Easily maneuverable, the grip is good and the wired end of the straightener rotates making it easy to control.  4) The size overall is small and perfect for short hair,for guys, this is perfect.  Cons:  Haven&#x27;t found  any as of now, but will update after a few weeks again.</li>
            <li> I AM A PROFESSIONAL HAIRSTYLIST, AND I PURCHASED THIS ITEM TO USE IN MY EVERYDAY LINE OF WORK, AND IT WAS HORRIBLE. THE EQUIPMENT DOES GET HOT, DOESN&#x27;T CURL OR STRAIGHTEN THE HAIR, OR ANYTHING. BUT, TO TOP IT OFF, THEY DIDN&#x27;T EVEN WANT TO REFUND MY MONEY.</li>
            <li> None of the GHD hair straighteners sold on Amazon are valid for manufacturer warranty.  My one broke within warranty time period, GHD claimed GHD bought on Amazon invalid, and Amazon would not compensate me at all.  Might be worth it to pay a bit more on another site and have a valid warranty.</li>
            <li> FABULOSITY!  teh best iron i have ever owned for smoothing and staritening  and even curling short hair. My only complaint is it burned out after only two weeks use. Even with that happeneing i wanted to order another hoping it was just a single defective iron.  NOW THEY ARE NO LONGER AVAILABLE!!!!  BRING THEM  BACK ASAP!!!</li>
            <li> I love the Ghd Professional Izunami Short Styler Hair Iron. It holds the temperature great. Wonderful for short hair. A excellent product.</li>
            <li> Excellent flat iron for short hair. Love the different levels of heat and how quickly it gets hot. Hope it lasts a really long time!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product. It stopped working after 6 months.  I&#x27;m a professional Hairstylist, and I had high hopes for this flat iron to use on clients&#x27; hair.  I contacted the seller but they haven&#x27;t responded back.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Crappy product--crappy company.</li>
            <li> I purchased this flatiron for I have a short pixie cut and was in need of a skinny flatiron. I saw the great price of this iron and ordered it on a whim. To my wonderful surprise, this iron lived up to my expectation and more. It really does heat up in 30sec or less and it holds consistent heat. When my roots need to pressed, this is the iron that i go to. It get the hair straight and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel like it has been fried! Would definitively  recommend this iron to anyone of any ethnicity that has a short hair cut.</li>
            <li> Heats quickly, gets hair very straight.  I like using it between relaxers for the new growth.  It gets very hot so be aware.  Love it!</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t as hot as I expected  I wanted small  iron for short hair I am a professional stylist and I was looking for more for the price</li>
            <li> Upon receiving this item, I was very pleased. Great for short sassy hair styles. Does not get extremely hot, but hot enough to get the job done, will not burn your hair, does not give off a burning smell either. Great choice, great buy!</li>
            <li> a lot of products claim to be professional, but this one actually carries through, I&#x27;m a guy so I didn&#x27;t know anything about hair straighteners but this is definitely a quality product compared to the overpriced ones I&#x27;ve seen for sale at salons and stores</li>
            <li> I have really short hair and this is the only flat iron (I&#x27;ve had several small one&#x27;s) that will allow me to get as close to my scalp as the one&#x27;s that go in the oven!!!!  It gets hot amazingly fast and the results are wonderful!!!  You would think I just walked out of the salon:-).  Wait, I can&#x27;t forget the amazing price!!!  Glad I searched amazon before purchasing at a BSS.</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;ll be the first to admit, I&#x27;m not a master at the flat iron.  I do like the small plates on this so that you can get close to the edges.  The iron just seems to not have a firm grip - does that make sense? I probably just need to practice more.</li>
            <li> This is a Short Styler Hair Iron but for some reason the results of using this iron left my hair a frizzy mess. The heat of this iron did not smooth out my hair well enough and I have somewhat fine hair. It should not have been a problem for this iron to leave lasting smooth iron results, but sadly that was not the case. I would have returned it, except now I have kept it too long for it to qualify as a return purchase. Maybe you will have better luck reading this.</li>
