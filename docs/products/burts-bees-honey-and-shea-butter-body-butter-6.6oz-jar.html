            <li>the best)</li>
            <li>Good quality ingredients and still a very good moisturizer.</li>

            <li>a couple of years ago - it was great.</li>
            <li>This body butter is amazing!</li>
            <li>:o) shame too.</li>
            <li>My favorite thing about this lotion is the wonderful honey scent.</li>
            <li>And I can feel good about putting it on my skin b/c</li>
            <li>but I miss the Burt&#x27;s Bees products that built this companies good reputation.  </li>
            <li>I think the moisturizing quality is still good.  </li>
            <li>We loved the honey/shea butter formula.  </li>
            <li>I find it effective, pleasant and non-greasy.</li>
            <li>VERY satisfied.</li>
            <li>It smells just like honey right out of the tub, but the smell fades to a wonderful lightly-sweet scent.</li>
            <li>The good thing is that you can really smell the honey...which is about the best thing it has to offer.</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>It was so nice.</li>
            <li>Nice gesture</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell or feel nearly as nice.</li>
            <li>It smells like automotive garage hand cleaner (chemically), and is kind of...sticky.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, and will be purchasing more!</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t impart a nice sheen or glow like my favorite brands.  </li>
            <li>It will be our original beloved formula.</li>
            <li>I like the product, it smells pleasant on application and fades quickly.</li>
            <li>i do like the Radiance line, it does not have an overwhelming scent.</li>
            <li>I totally love it.  </li>
            <li>And I love the honey-milk smell.  </li>
            <li>People don&#x27;t realize how many toxic chemicals are in so many beauty products.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall rating: 3.</li>
            <li>I got this as a gift in a White Elephant Gift Exchange, and it is WONDERFUL.</li>
            <li>I love Bert&#x27;s Bees stuff.</li>
            <li>and I love the butter itself</li>
            <li>Whats not to love?</li>
            <li>I found Burt&#x27;s Bees Body Butter many years ago - I put it on after my morning shower and</li>
            <li>I love Burts and I love honey, whats not to love?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also tried their almond hand cream, love the smell</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s listed as a body lotion, but I use it on my hands and face mostly.</li>
            <li>If you can judge from the purchasing limits, most people do like it.</li>
            <li>I used to love this product.</li>
            <li>it might be okay, but this is just intolerably sticky for me.</li>
            <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees and this lotion helps support that admiration.</li>
            <li>The smell is gentle and pleasant (kind of like honey and oatmeal) and isn&#x27;t \\&quot;perfumy\\&quot; or strong at all.</li>
            <li>And best of all, it&#x27;s petroleum-free and full of more natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>It seemed like somebody tried to make their own and pass it off as the original.</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees Thoroughly Therapeutic Body Butter was a real winner of a product that I completely loved and enjoyed.  </li>
            <li>The original body butter had a beautiful, sweet and light honey-like fragrance and a very soft, creamy feel when applied that soaked in nicely and felt nourishing to the skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not thick like most body butters and doesn&#x27;t do a good job of moisturizing.</li>
            <li>So I was becoming a amazon addict until I bought this product.</li>
            <li>This body butter has been a God-send this winter for both my two-year-old and myself, keeping us moisturized and smelling sweet!</li>
            <li>I love Burts products (original Burts Bees wax....</li>
            <li>I continue to use it because it really does give you smooth skin which feels good.</li>
            <li>Smooth.</li>
            <li>These 2 products are completely different and in my opinion vary greatly in quality.  </li>
            <li>It seemed over filled.</li>
            <li>I also really enjoy the scent, which is why I had ordered two of them.</li>
            <li>When I put it on it Became watery; this is one of the characteristics I noticed in cheap lotions.</li>
            <li>I can always buy some more, right?</li>
            <li>Customers, if you are looking for the wonderful, older product, please be advised that you will not likely find it, though the picture advertised by Amazon appears to be the discontinued product.  </li>
            <li>After these three experiences, I think I&#x27;ll just stick with the original lip product.</li>
            <li>I got this from CVS, not Amazon, and I have the original product, not the newer diluted</li>
            <li>I have since learned that the original product, which smelled a bit  like honey/beeswax, has since been discontinued.</li>
            <li>I knew this wasn&#x27;t original.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice, though, that I really think it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I plan to get a case of it.&lt;br /&gt;The marketing gurus will have finally wised up and paid attention to Amazon reviews and its own reviews from its precious Burt&#x27;s Bee hive.</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees newer product smells like weakened, chocolate tea, if there is such a thing, and is not at all pleasant in fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Sunflower Seed Oil, Coconut Oil, Sweet Almond Oil, Shea Butter, and Cocoa Seed Butter.</li>
            <li>honey smell is overwhelming for me, an the texture is REALLY sticky.</li>
            <li>it glides on and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>The jars with the Totally Therapeutic label have an incredible smelling balmy body butter.  </li>
            <li>I am 8 and a half months pregnant, and this stuff is GREAT for pregnant bellies.</li>
            <li>I also dab a very (very!)</li>
            <li>It integrated very nicely with my skin and left it soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>, it is  a multi-functional item, but i really don&#x27;t like the strong smell of this butter.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I could find it so easily, as I didn&#x27;t find it in local stores.</li>
            <li>Not artificially purfumey.  </li>
            <li>It also leaves my skin feeling soft and healthy, and as an added bonus for me I smell like chocolate and honey.</li>
            <li>Good reasonably priced ethical natural after bath or after sun body moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It will smell like fresh buttery honey.  </li>
            <li>..., fresh honey with buttery undertones....</li>
            <li>I spelt it more consciously</li>
            <li>However, should Burt&#x27;s Bees decide to reinstate the original Thoroughly Therapeutic Honey &amp; Shea Body Butter, I will certainly continue to purchase it.  </li>
            <li>This body butter has all the right stuff that you&#x27;d expect in a body</li>
            <li>I have been using The Burt&#x27;s Bees Honey and Shea for years and this just wasn&#x27;t right.</li>
            <li>That they continue as of this day to display the image of the original (and vastly superior) product while actually selling/shipping a different product</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve used this product for years but couldn&#x27;t find it locally any more, Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s changed the formula and that is all  the local stores carry and the new formula isn&#x27;t that good.</li>
            <li>The rreformulated product is not as good as the previous formula.</li>
            <li>The smell is like strong bees wax, I like it, but I do like bees wax more than the average person, being a Ukrainian Egg maker.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use very much of it, which is good, as I think it&#x27;s a little pricey.</li>
            <li>This product very clearly pictures and represents itself on Amazon as the original Honey &amp; Shea Butter product (with \\&quot;Thoroughly Therapeutic\\&quot; on the label, and that product&#x27;s UPC in the description).</li>
            <li>However, the product has a pretty pungent smell and is thinner than the body butter we bought in-store.</li>
            <li>This product will make your skin so soft and smooth with no irritation.</li>
            <li>exactly what i was looking for</li>
            <li>The jars that have a copyright of 2011 on them don&#x27;t have the same label and are more whippy in texture.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like lotion that doesn&#x27;t absorb properly.</li>
            <li>It had no label around it only a sticker on top.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are selling out in quality to cut their costs while the consumers still pay the same, or more.</li>
            <li>Recommended for those who are looking for a good body moisturizer that&#x27;s not quite as heavy as some body butters.</li>
            <li>So I must say that the new formula is actually better than the old one.</li>
            <li>For my part I cannot say right now that I will ever purchase from this particular Amazon vendor again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Despite it not having the thick rich consistency that I look for in a body butter, Honey &amp; Shea Body Butter did have a nice creamy consistency.</li>
            <li>This is a product I have used in the past and LOVED.</li>
            <li>dog used to lick the body butter I used in the past, he&#x27;d lick my arms because it was so good.  </li>
            <li>It leaves me SUPER soft.  </li>
            <li>The texture is pleasant enough while rubbing in, but it doesn&#x27;t have any more staying power than regular lotion, unlike the previous version.  </li>
            <li>Great for dry, itchy skin that other products can&#x27;t touch.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing without being greasy.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>And now I have the whole family hooked.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Burt&#x27;s Bees--</li>
            <li>You really dropped the ball on this one.  </li>
            <li>Not too greasy and really luxurious.</li>
            <li>Really sticky, like you have sugar on your hands.</li>
            <li>The only place I can use this comfortably is on my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees really bungled, (bumbled) on this.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is really Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li>Smelled like honey, worked really well to protect the hands.</li>
            <li>I returned this and will be more careful when purchasing online.</li>
            <li>We wrote to Burt&#x27;s Bees and they wrote back saying, &#x27;oh, we changed the formula (we could tell already), and we hope you enjoy it.&#x27;  </li>
            <li>The new body butter (it has a picture of a honeycomb on the lid) has a natural odor like a clay mask mixed with honey, but after 10 minutes of it being on your skin, it has a very light honey scent that stays on your skin all day, even if you work out or perspire during the day.</li>
            <li>I will try other Burt bees butter to see if the scent is better.</li>
            <li>I have written to Burt&#x27;s Bees about this change hoping that they would consider going back to the original product.  </li>
            <li>I hope the manufacturer goes back to the original formula.</li>
            <li>It is no longer related to shea butter products (that familiar feel of Occitane, for example).</li>
            <li>I guess some other reviewers don&#x27;t like it, but I think it&#x27;s light and sweet and natural.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised Burt&#x27;s Bees Body Butter got such good reviews from other people, I purchased a tub tonight and was disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;First off</li>
            <li>I went to Walgreens and bought a tub there, noticed the new packaging but didn&#x27;t think much of it.</li>
            <li>i agree with a previous reviewer that the smell is overwhelming.   </li>
            <li>It has a whole different and heavier feel when applied and in my opinion is far less superior in quality.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find it particularly enticing and</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for my daughter who particularly loves it.  </li>
            <li>so I will most likely be using a different source to order from.</li>
            <li>and he said this is an older version of the product.</li>
            <li>The fragrance and texture are not nearly as dreamy as the original.  </li>
            <li>I immediately ran to Amazon and saw what looked the original product with the same old packaging.</li>
            <li>Anything you put on your skin gets absorbed by your body and eventually works its way into your blood stream and all your internal organs.  </li>
            <li>Likewise, I do prefer heavier body butters, and this body butter from Burt&#x27;s Bees seemed more like a heavy lotion or cr&amp;egrave;me, and not a body butter.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My flaky dry winter skin drinks it right up!  </li>
            <li>This product is super thick and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>It came in the same type of container with the right lid but no outer  label.</li>
            <li>but it also leaves your hands super oily for a really long time before it saturates the skin.</li>
            <li>I placed my order, but when it arrived I found a tub of the new stuff.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin (eczema)</li>
            <li>I usually like BBs, but unless you REALLY love honey, don&#x27;t get this product.  </li>
            <li>That is the only reason I paid the higher price to order from this vendor.  </li>
            <li>, you can no longer find the old product anywhere, as this is the \\&quot;new and</li>
            <li>In the meantime, I have returned the new product that I had requested for Christmas (thinking that I would be receiving the old version).  </li>
            <li>It is super-moisturizing but sinks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy.  </li>
            <li>It completely smooths out my sun damaged 47 year old hands!</li>
            <li>Sickeningly sweet, like your great-grandmothers perfume,only worse, &amp; not @ all like the original product.</li>
            <li>Just a plane clear container.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s all natural.  </li>
            <li>This body butter is definitely not as heavy and sticky as</li>
            <li>I went looking for the old Thoroughly Theraputic stuff and ended up with this.  </li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well.</li>
            <li>I have asked the seller for a refund, but if I don&#x27;t get one, I completely understand, because it is the product produced by Burt&#x27;s Bees</li>
            <li>Absorbs well and leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li>Which was complete bs.</li>
            <li>Smells like honeycomb only not so overwhelmingly sweet, and the fragrance mellows but lasts quite a long time.</li>
            <li>still have a little of the original product left untouched in the bottom of the jar that I absolutely cannot relinquish.  </li>
            <li>If you value your loyal customers, you will seriously consider bringing back this original product.  </li>
            <li>Product that arrived did not have the same label (\\&quot;Totally Therapeutic\\&quot; was not there at all) and is not the same consistency as the original I had from an in-store purchase.  </li>
            <li>The texture was more like thick lotion that comes out of a pump, not like the shea butters I&#x27;ve purchased in the past, and the smell was like cheap perfume.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this is illegal by the way</li>
            <li>The old body butter had a very sweet smell when you first applied it, but would get sticky and uncomfortable during the day.</li>
            <li>Recently, Burt&#x27;s Bees decided to discontinue this fine quality product and replace it with a newer product which is now entitled Burt&#x27;s Bees Honey &amp; Shea Body Butter (note the missing Thoroughly Therapeutic in its title).  </li>
            <li>tiny amount onto my palms and run them through my damp hair as I am getting out of the shower, as it makes my hair super soft but not weighed down or oily.</li>
            <li>Burt has packaged a \\&quot;new improved\\&quot; milky Play Dough concoction in its former efficacious honey shea butter containers.</li>
            <li>However, what they actually ship is the inferior \\&quot;new &amp;</li>
            <li>- I actually went to the Burt&#x27;s Bees website to see what their product reviews said, and this is their new formulation.  </li>
            <li>The new product  has a totally different texture, and the odor was vile.</li>
            <li>We have used Burt&#x27;s Bees body butter specifically, and other items occasionally, for many years; choosing them over all other brands.  </li>
            <li>I generally like body butter</li>
            <li>I believe in only using natural skin care products.  </li>
            <li>However, the name is the same (and everything else about the label as far as we can tell).</li>
            <li>When you finally see the following ingredients listed,&lt;br /&gt;Water, sunflower oil, vegetable glycerine, bees wax (this should smell like honey), steric acid, mango butter (really?), Shea butter (now this is what it advertises on the label),  glucose (sugar), aloe barbadensis leaf extract, honey (finally), rosemary leaf extract, tocapheral (vitamin E),</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t smell the same or work nearly as well as the Thoroughly Therapeutic does.</li>
            <li>There is no way I can use this and go out in public, it smells as if I&#x27;ve rolled in old almond oil (after it&#x27;s been cooked with).</li>
            <li>Not to mention that if you happen to like the newer product, it is readily available from other vendors on Amazon for $6.00 less.  </li>
            <li>However when purchasing this product I was at first, a little on the fence about it.</li>
            <li>I am really disappointed in Burt&#x27;s Bees for changing what was a great product into something unusable.</li>
            <li>my skin was still soft and moist after a long day at work.  </li>
            <li>certainly not what I&#x27;d normally seek out in a body butter</li>
            <li>I had looked long and hard to find Burt&#x27;s Bees Thoroughly Therapeutic Honey and Shea Body Butter as it is no longer available in stores.</li>
            <li>Also, a little goes a long way, so it is worth the money because it lasts a long time.</li>

            <li> This is one of the best body shea butters I&#x27;ve used.  </li>

            <li> the best)</li>
            <li> Good quality ingredients and still a very good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It truly made me feel happy and healthier to use it.  </li>
            <li> a couple of years ago - it was great.</li>
            <li> This body butter is amazing!</li>
            <li> :o) shame too.</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about this lotion is the wonderful honey scent.</li>
            <li> And I can feel good about putting it on my skin b/c</li>
            <li> but I miss the Burt&#x27;s Bees products that built this companies good reputation.  </li>
            <li> I think the moisturizing quality is still good.  </li>
            <li> We loved the honey/shea butter formula.  </li>
            <li> I find it effective, pleasant and non-greasy.</li>
            <li> VERY satisfied.</li>
            <li> It smells just like honey right out of the tub, but the smell fades to a wonderful lightly-sweet scent.</li>
            <li> The good thing is that you can really smell the honey...which is about the best thing it has to offer.</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> It was so nice.</li>
            <li> Nice gesture</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell or feel nearly as nice.</li>
            <li> It smells like automotive garage hand cleaner (chemically), and is kind of...sticky.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, and will be purchasing more!</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t impart a nice sheen or glow like my favorite brands.  </li>
            <li> It will be our original beloved formula.</li>
            <li> I like the product, it smells pleasant on application and fades quickly.</li>
            <li> i do like the Radiance line, it does not have an overwhelming scent.</li>
            <li> I totally love it.  </li>
            <li> And I love the honey-milk smell.  </li>
            <li> People don&#x27;t realize how many toxic chemicals are in so many beauty products.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall rating: 3.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift in a White Elephant Gift Exchange, and it is WONDERFUL.</li>
            <li> I love Bert&#x27;s Bees stuff.</li>
            <li> and I love the butter itself</li>
            <li> Whats not to love?</li>
            <li> I found Burt&#x27;s Bees Body Butter many years ago - I put it on after my morning shower and</li>
            <li> I love Burts and I love honey, whats not to love?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried their almond hand cream, love the smell</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s listed as a body lotion, but I use it on my hands and face mostly.</li>
            <li> If you can judge from the purchasing limits, most people do like it.</li>
            <li> I used to love this product.</li>
            <li> it might be okay, but this is just intolerably sticky for me.</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees and this lotion helps support that admiration.</li>
            <li> The smell is gentle and pleasant (kind of like honey and oatmeal) and isn&#x27;t \\&quot;perfumy\\&quot; or strong at all.</li>
            <li> And best of all, it&#x27;s petroleum-free and full of more natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> It seemed like somebody tried to make their own and pass it off as the original.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Thoroughly Therapeutic Body Butter was a real winner of a product that I completely loved and enjoyed.  </li>
            <li> The original body butter had a beautiful, sweet and light honey-like fragrance and a very soft, creamy feel when applied that soaked in nicely and felt nourishing to the skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not thick like most body butters and doesn&#x27;t do a good job of moisturizing.</li>
            <li> So I was becoming a amazon addict until I bought this product.</li>
            <li> This body butter has been a God-send this winter for both my two-year-old and myself, keeping us moisturized and smelling sweet!</li>
            <li> I love Burts products (original Burts Bees wax....</li>
            <li> I continue to use it because it really does give you smooth skin which feels good.</li>
            <li> Smooth.</li>
            <li> These 2 products are completely different and in my opinion vary greatly in quality.  </li>
            <li> It seemed over filled.</li>
            <li> I also really enjoy the scent, which is why I had ordered two of them.</li>
            <li> When I put it on it Became watery; this is one of the characteristics I noticed in cheap lotions.</li>
            <li> I can always buy some more, right?</li>
            <li> Customers, if you are looking for the wonderful, older product, please be advised that you will not likely find it, though the picture advertised by Amazon appears to be the discontinued product.  </li>
            <li> After these three experiences, I think I&#x27;ll just stick with the original lip product.</li>
            <li> I got this from CVS, not Amazon, and I have the original product, not the newer diluted</li>
            <li> I have since learned that the original product, which smelled a bit  like honey/beeswax, has since been discontinued.</li>
            <li> I knew this wasn&#x27;t original.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so nice, though, that I really think it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I plan to get a case of it.&lt;br /&gt;The marketing gurus will have finally wised up and paid attention to Amazon reviews and its own reviews from its precious Burt&#x27;s Bee hive.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees newer product smells like weakened, chocolate tea, if there is such a thing, and is not at all pleasant in fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Sunflower Seed Oil, Coconut Oil, Sweet Almond Oil, Shea Butter, and Cocoa Seed Butter.</li>
            <li> honey smell is overwhelming for me, an the texture is REALLY sticky.</li>
            <li> it glides on and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> The jars with the Totally Therapeutic label have an incredible smelling balmy body butter.  </li>
            <li> I am 8 and a half months pregnant, and this stuff is GREAT for pregnant bellies.</li>
            <li> I also dab a very (very!)</li>
            <li> It integrated very nicely with my skin and left it soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> , it is  a multi-functional item, but i really don&#x27;t like the strong smell of this butter.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I could find it so easily, as I didn&#x27;t find it in local stores.</li>
            <li> Not artificially purfumey.  </li>
            <li> It also leaves my skin feeling soft and healthy, and as an added bonus for me I smell like chocolate and honey.</li>
            <li> Good reasonably priced ethical natural after bath or after sun body moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It will smell like fresh buttery honey.  </li>
            <li> ..., fresh honey with buttery undertones....</li>
            <li> I spelt it more consciously</li>
            <li> However, should Burt&#x27;s Bees decide to reinstate the original Thoroughly Therapeutic Honey &amp; Shea Body Butter, I will certainly continue to purchase it.  </li>
            <li> This body butter has all the right stuff that you&#x27;d expect in a body</li>
            <li> I have been using The Burt&#x27;s Bees Honey and Shea for years and this just wasn&#x27;t right.</li>
            <li> That they continue as of this day to display the image of the original (and vastly superior) product while actually selling/shipping a different product</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used this product for years but couldn&#x27;t find it locally any more, Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s changed the formula and that is all  the local stores carry and the new formula isn&#x27;t that good.</li>
            <li> The rreformulated product is not as good as the previous formula.</li>
            <li> The smell is like strong bees wax, I like it, but I do like bees wax more than the average person, being a Ukrainian Egg maker.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use very much of it, which is good, as I think it&#x27;s a little pricey.</li>
            <li> This product very clearly pictures and represents itself on Amazon as the original Honey &amp; Shea Butter product (with \\&quot;Thoroughly Therapeutic\\&quot; on the label, and that product&#x27;s UPC in the description).</li>
            <li> However, the product has a pretty pungent smell and is thinner than the body butter we bought in-store.</li>
            <li> This product will make your skin so soft and smooth with no irritation.</li>
            <li> exactly what i was looking for</li>
            <li> The jars that have a copyright of 2011 on them don&#x27;t have the same label and are more whippy in texture.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like lotion that doesn&#x27;t absorb properly.</li>
            <li> It had no label around it only a sticker on top.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are selling out in quality to cut their costs while the consumers still pay the same, or more.</li>
            <li> Recommended for those who are looking for a good body moisturizer that&#x27;s not quite as heavy as some body butters.</li>
            <li> So I must say that the new formula is actually better than the old one.</li>
            <li> For my part I cannot say right now that I will ever purchase from this particular Amazon vendor again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite it not having the thick rich consistency that I look for in a body butter, Honey &amp; Shea Body Butter did have a nice creamy consistency.</li>
            <li> This is a product I have used in the past and LOVED.</li>
            <li> dog used to lick the body butter I used in the past, he&#x27;d lick my arms because it was so good.  </li>
            <li> It leaves me SUPER soft.  </li>
            <li> The texture is pleasant enough while rubbing in, but it doesn&#x27;t have any more staying power than regular lotion, unlike the previous version.  </li>
            <li> Great for dry, itchy skin that other products can&#x27;t touch.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing without being greasy.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> And now I have the whole family hooked.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Burt&#x27;s Bees--</li>
            <li> You really dropped the ball on this one.  </li>
            <li> Not too greasy and really luxurious.</li>
            <li> Really sticky, like you have sugar on your hands.</li>
            <li> The only place I can use this comfortably is on my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees really bungled, (bumbled) on this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is really Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li> Smelled like honey, worked really well to protect the hands.</li>
            <li> I returned this and will be more careful when purchasing online.</li>
            <li> We wrote to Burt&#x27;s Bees and they wrote back saying, &#x27;oh, we changed the formula (we could tell already), and we hope you enjoy it.&#x27;  </li>
            <li> The new body butter (it has a picture of a honeycomb on the lid) has a natural odor like a clay mask mixed with honey, but after 10 minutes of it being on your skin, it has a very light honey scent that stays on your skin all day, even if you work out or perspire during the day.</li>
            <li> I will try other Burt bees butter to see if the scent is better.</li>
            <li> I have written to Burt&#x27;s Bees about this change hoping that they would consider going back to the original product.  </li>
            <li> I hope the manufacturer goes back to the original formula.</li>
            <li> It is no longer related to shea butter products (that familiar feel of Occitane, for example).</li>
            <li> I guess some other reviewers don&#x27;t like it, but I think it&#x27;s light and sweet and natural.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised Burt&#x27;s Bees Body Butter got such good reviews from other people, I purchased a tub tonight and was disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;First off</li>
            <li> I went to Walgreens and bought a tub there, noticed the new packaging but didn&#x27;t think much of it.</li>
            <li> i agree with a previous reviewer that the smell is overwhelming.   </li>
            <li> It has a whole different and heavier feel when applied and in my opinion is far less superior in quality.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it particularly enticing and</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter who particularly loves it.  </li>
            <li> so I will most likely be using a different source to order from.</li>
            <li> and he said this is an older version of the product.</li>
            <li> The fragrance and texture are not nearly as dreamy as the original.  </li>
            <li> I immediately ran to Amazon and saw what looked the original product with the same old packaging.</li>
            <li> Anything you put on your skin gets absorbed by your body and eventually works its way into your blood stream and all your internal organs.  </li>
            <li> Likewise, I do prefer heavier body butters, and this body butter from Burt&#x27;s Bees seemed more like a heavy lotion or cr&amp;egrave;me, and not a body butter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My flaky dry winter skin drinks it right up!  </li>
            <li> This product is super thick and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> It came in the same type of container with the right lid but no outer  label.</li>
            <li> but it also leaves your hands super oily for a really long time before it saturates the skin.</li>
            <li> I placed my order, but when it arrived I found a tub of the new stuff.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin (eczema)</li>
            <li> I usually like BBs, but unless you REALLY love honey, don&#x27;t get this product.  </li>
            <li> That is the only reason I paid the higher price to order from this vendor.  </li>
            <li> , you can no longer find the old product anywhere, as this is the \\&quot;new and</li>
            <li> In the meantime, I have returned the new product that I had requested for Christmas (thinking that I would be receiving the old version).  </li>
            <li> It is super-moisturizing but sinks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy.  </li>
            <li> It completely smooths out my sun damaged 47 year old hands!</li>
            <li> Sickeningly sweet, like your great-grandmothers perfume,only worse, &amp; not @ all like the original product.</li>
            <li> Just a plane clear container.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s all natural.  </li>
            <li> This body butter is definitely not as heavy and sticky as</li>
            <li> I went looking for the old Thoroughly Theraputic stuff and ended up with this.  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well.</li>
            <li> I have asked the seller for a refund, but if I don&#x27;t get one, I completely understand, because it is the product produced by Burt&#x27;s Bees</li>
            <li> Absorbs well and leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li> Which was complete bs.</li>
            <li> Smells like honeycomb only not so overwhelmingly sweet, and the fragrance mellows but lasts quite a long time.</li>
            <li> still have a little of the original product left untouched in the bottom of the jar that I absolutely cannot relinquish.  </li>
            <li> If you value your loyal customers, you will seriously consider bringing back this original product.  </li>
            <li> Product that arrived did not have the same label (\\&quot;Totally Therapeutic\\&quot; was not there at all) and is not the same consistency as the original I had from an in-store purchase.  </li>
            <li> The texture was more like thick lotion that comes out of a pump, not like the shea butters I&#x27;ve purchased in the past, and the smell was like cheap perfume.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this is illegal by the way</li>
            <li> The old body butter had a very sweet smell when you first applied it, but would get sticky and uncomfortable during the day.</li>
            <li> Recently, Burt&#x27;s Bees decided to discontinue this fine quality product and replace it with a newer product which is now entitled Burt&#x27;s Bees Honey &amp; Shea Body Butter (note the missing Thoroughly Therapeutic in its title).  </li>
            <li> tiny amount onto my palms and run them through my damp hair as I am getting out of the shower, as it makes my hair super soft but not weighed down or oily.</li>
            <li> Burt has packaged a \\&quot;new improved\\&quot; milky Play Dough concoction in its former efficacious honey shea butter containers.</li>
            <li> However, what they actually ship is the inferior \\&quot;new &amp;</li>
            <li> - I actually went to the Burt&#x27;s Bees website to see what their product reviews said, and this is their new formulation.  </li>
            <li> The new product  has a totally different texture, and the odor was vile.</li>
            <li> We have used Burt&#x27;s Bees body butter specifically, and other items occasionally, for many years; choosing them over all other brands.  </li>
            <li> I generally like body butter</li>
            <li> I believe in only using natural skin care products.  </li>
            <li> However, the name is the same (and everything else about the label as far as we can tell).</li>
            <li> When you finally see the following ingredients listed,&lt;br /&gt;Water, sunflower oil, vegetable glycerine, bees wax (this should smell like honey), steric acid, mango butter (really?), Shea butter (now this is what it advertises on the label),  glucose (sugar), aloe barbadensis leaf extract, honey (finally), rosemary leaf extract, tocapheral (vitamin E),</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t smell the same or work nearly as well as the Thoroughly Therapeutic does.</li>
            <li> There is no way I can use this and go out in public, it smells as if I&#x27;ve rolled in old almond oil (after it&#x27;s been cooked with).</li>
            <li> Not to mention that if you happen to like the newer product, it is readily available from other vendors on Amazon for $6.00 less.  </li>
            <li> However when purchasing this product I was at first, a little on the fence about it.</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed in Burt&#x27;s Bees for changing what was a great product into something unusable.</li>
            <li> my skin was still soft and moist after a long day at work.  </li>
            <li> certainly not what I&#x27;d normally seek out in a body butter</li>
            <li> I had looked long and hard to find Burt&#x27;s Bees Thoroughly Therapeutic Honey and Shea Body Butter as it is no longer available in stores.</li>
            <li> Also, a little goes a long way, so it is worth the money because it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that this would be the original formula, but indeed it was!  </li>
            <li> When I got it home, the body butter I used to love was replaced with this new goop that smells bad</li>
            <li> I was shocked because I&#x27;m always very satisfied with burts products</li>
            <li> I do feel like this product relieves my skin of dryness, but the results aren&#x27;t long lasting.</li>
            <li> Most of the lotions I try have a chemically unpleasant (to me) scent that tends to give me a headache, so I generally prefer unscented products.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin, especially in the winter and this stuff nips it in the bud.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;how long is this going to take to soak in?\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This product was old and all dried up.</li>
            <li> so wonderful.losed your eyes and sniffed there is no scent but plain old castile soap.</li>
            <li> It works wonderfully on dry skin patches and one jar lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> Also I have dry skin and do not feel like it is \\&quot;thoroughly therapeutic\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I also use it on my feet and elbows, which are frequently dry and itchy, and this product works wonders.</li>
            <li> I have had dry skin all of my life.  </li>
            <li> suppose if you have really dry skin</li>
            <li> And although I am completely happy with half of my purchase, I was utterly disappointed with the other half that I am now stuck with.</li>
            <li> However it was missing its inner seal</li>
            <li> It takes a bit to work into the skin if you have globs and globs on, but if you use a sparing amount (as a little bit goes a long way here)</li>
            <li> w/ ingredients like parabens... &amp; other chemical compounds that you can&#x27;t pronounce.</li>
            <li> and the next day it&#x27;s usually gone.  </li>
            <li> The other one was Burt&#x27;s Bees Honey and Shea Body Butter.</li>
            <li> I cannot over-emphasize how bad it smells, and how strongly.  </li>
            <li> This stuff smells like chemicals, soap, and imitation fragrance.</li>
            <li> It is majorly serious cream, but it works majorly well.</li>
            <li> The only negative I can think of is that it doesn&#x27;t immediately soak in.</li>
            <li> is nothing less than bait &amp; switch.</li>
            <li> How could they mess this up?</li>
            <li> and so half of the butter was missing.  </li>
            <li> This newer formulation smells awful - mostly like honey, I think, but it made me gag!  </li>
            <li> The little bees with money waiting to buy the products that smell like what the label states it does.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and this is one of the few products that does not irritate.  </li>
            <li> But a few years ago Burt&#x27;s Bees was bought out and the formula has been changed.  </li>
            <li> It does eventually soak in, but it leaves your hands quite sticky for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t find in stores anymore, which is why I ordered, but arrived all dried out.</li>
            <li> , it is a little sticky but not overwhelmingly so.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m not sure how this can get away with calling it a body butter.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this in stores in the past, I didn&#x27;t realize there was a &amp;#34;new formula&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> If you really like to smell like honey then go for it--you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It was hard as plaster</li>
            <li> it sucks.</li>
            <li> This stuff leaves your skin feeling sticky for at least 20 minutes before it starts to wear off.</li>
            <li> people don&#x27;t like the scent (we&#x27;re all different) and if you&#x27;re afraid to try it because of that, try looking for it at drug stores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got the consistency of a thick lotion or</li>
            <li> I just finished a tub of this Honey and Shea Butter - it was thick, creamy, and smelled like coconuts.  </li>
            <li> Some may like the scent, as it is rather subtle, but it doesn&#x27;t appeal to me.</li>
            <li> I can detect just a faint bit of honey, but it seems to have somewhat of an earthy coconut scent, but not a sweet coconut scent that I prefer.</li>
            <li> Now it SUCKS!</li>
            <li> It stinks and btw.....if you have to have it, (even though you will stink) you can buy it at Walmart for nearly half this price.</li>
            <li> What in the world was the rationale behind this decision????</li>
            <li> And I am very disappointed in Amazon for keeping the old product picture and description</li>
            <li> It also started smelling bad after a few days.</li>
            <li> improved\\&quot; product that is thinner and smells of stale almonds.</li>
            <li> I was so sad, but I figured, what the heck-</li>
            <li> The draw back is the scent, awful!</li>
            <li> It smelled a bit weird to me</li>
            <li> Sorry, Burt&#x27;s Bees.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really weird.</li>
            <li> A bit expensive, but makes sense since this can&#x27;t be found in stores any longer.  </li>
            <li> This body butter has weird texture.</li>
            <li> Wrong!</li>
            <li> However, I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a bad product.</li>
            <li> Too, too bad.</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> Boy, was I was sadly disappointed.  </li>
            <li> :(.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed and will never buy, nor recommend this one here again.</li>
            <li> It smells disgusting, I went online to see if there were reports of rancid product</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is one of the best body shea butters I&#x27;ve used.  It leaves my body hydrated and has a wonderful honey scent.</li>
            <li> Totally my fault for not reading the reviews. Burt has packaged a \\&quot;new improved\\&quot; milky Play Dough concoction in its former efficacious honey shea butter containers. Sent this loser back faster than it takes the president to invent another czar.</li>
            <li> This body butter is amazing! It smells just like honey right out of the tub, but the smell fades to a wonderful lightly-sweet scent. It&#x27;s very moisturizing without being greasy. And best of all, it&#x27;s petroleum-free and full of more natural ingredients. This body butter has been a God-send this winter for both my two-year-old and myself, keeping us moisturized and smelling sweet!</li>
            <li> What is not to like about Burt Bees?</li>
            <li> I usually like BBs, but unless you REALLY love honey, don&#x27;t get this product.  The honey smell is overpowering and the butter itself is sticky/does not absorb well.  Whenever I wear it, someone inevitably tells me I smell like a beehive.  Also I have dry skin and do not feel like it is \\&quot;thoroughly therapeutic\\&quot;.  If you really like to smell like honey then go for it--you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I generally like body butter, it is  a multi-functional item, but i really don&#x27;t like the strong smell of this butter.  i would have prefer no added frangrance to this product. i agree with a previous reviewer that the smell is overwhelming.   I wish Bee would rework the receipt.   It moisturized well enough.  i do like the Radiance line, it does not have an overwhelming scent.</li>
            <li> Smooth. Makes your skin feel great! I&#x27;m a daily user. I take it to my manicure/pedicure appointments so that the nail technician can use it instead of their products w/ ingredients like parabens... &amp; other chemical compounds that you can&#x27;t pronounce. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This product very clearly pictures and represents itself on Amazon as the original Honey &amp; Shea Butter product (with \\&quot;Thoroughly Therapeutic\\&quot; on the label, and that product&#x27;s UPC in the description). That is the only reason I paid the higher price to order from this vendor.  However, what they actually ship is the inferior \\&quot;new &amp; improved\\&quot; product that is thinner and smells of stale almonds. Not to mention that if you happen to like the newer product, it is readily available from other vendors on Amazon for $6.00 less.  That they continue as of this day to display the image of the original (and vastly superior) product while actually selling/shipping a different product is nothing less than bait &amp; switch. For my part I cannot say right now that I will ever purchase from this particular Amazon vendor again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  I totally love it.  It is super-moisturizing but sinks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy.  My flaky dry winter skin drinks it right up!  It leaves me SUPER soft.  And I love the honey-milk smell.  I guess some other reviewers don&#x27;t like it, but I think it&#x27;s light and sweet and natural.  Not artificially purfumey.  And I can feel good about putting it on my skin b/c it&#x27;s all natural.  People don&#x27;t realize how many toxic chemicals are in so many beauty products.  Anything you put on your skin gets absorbed by your body and eventually works its way into your blood stream and all your internal organs.  I believe in only using natural skin care products.  If I can&#x27;t pronounce the ingredients, it&#x27;s not going on or in my body!  Burts bees delivers!</li>
            <li> This body butter has all the right stuff that you&#x27;d expect in a body butter-- Sunflower Seed Oil, Coconut Oil, Sweet Almond Oil, Shea Butter, and Cocoa Seed Butter. However, I&#x27;m not sure how this can get away with calling it a body butter. It&#x27;s got the consistency of a thick lotion or cr&amp;egrave;me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent also proved to be a bit of a surprise. I can detect just a faint bit of honey, but it seems to have somewhat of an earthy coconut scent, but not a sweet coconut scent that I prefer. I don&#x27;t find it particularly enticing and certainly not what I&#x27;d normally seek out in a body butter scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite it not having the thick rich consistency that I look for in a body butter, Honey &amp; Shea Body Butter did have a nice creamy consistency. It integrated very nicely with my skin and left it soft and smooth. This body butter is definitely not as heavy and sticky as some others out there, but at the same time its moisturizing capabilities are not quite up to par for a body butter. I do feel like this product relieves my skin of dryness, but the results aren&#x27;t long lasting. It also doesn&#x27;t impart a nice sheen or glow like my favorite brands.  However, I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a bad product. Some may like the scent, as it is rather subtle, but it doesn&#x27;t appeal to me. Likewise, I do prefer heavier body butters, and this body butter from Burt&#x27;s Bees seemed more like a heavy lotion or cr&amp;egrave;me, and not a body butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall rating: 3. Good quality ingredients and still a very good moisturizer. Recommended for those who are looking for a good body moisturizer that&#x27;s not quite as heavy as some body butters.</li>
            <li> The old body butter had a very sweet smell when you first applied it, but would get sticky and uncomfortable during the day. The new body butter (it has a picture of a honeycomb on the lid) has a natural odor like a clay mask mixed with honey, but after 10 minutes of it being on your skin, it has a very light honey scent that stays on your skin all day, even if you work out or perspire during the day. So I must say that the new formula is actually better than the old one.</li>
            <li> If I could give this zero stars, I would.  I went looking for the old Thoroughly Theraputic stuff and ended up with this.  It REEKS.  I cannot over-emphasize how bad it smells, and how strongly.  The texture is pleasant enough while rubbing in, but it doesn&#x27;t have any more staying power than regular lotion, unlike the previous version.  I only ran out recently, and am just now discovering that it was discontinued.  What in the world was the rationale behind this decision????</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift in a White Elephant Gift Exchange, and it is WONDERFUL. I am 8 and a half months pregnant, and this stuff is GREAT for pregnant bellies. I also use it on my feet and elbows, which are frequently dry and itchy, and this product works wonders. Also, a little goes a long way, so it is worth the money because it lasts a long time. The smell is gentle and pleasant (kind of like honey and oatmeal) and isn&#x27;t \\&quot;perfumy\\&quot; or strong at all. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I recently had to throw away my half-full tub of this body butter in an airport security line. I was so sad, but I figured, what the heck- I can always buy some more, right? Wrong! I went to Walgreens and bought a tub there, noticed the new packaging but didn&#x27;t think much of it. When I got it home, the body butter I used to love was replaced with this new goop that smells bad and, frankly, nothing like honey.  I immediately ran to Amazon and saw what looked the original product with the same old packaging. Huzzah! I placed my order, but when it arrived I found a tub of the new stuff. I will be returning it ASAP!  I am really disappointed in Burt&#x27;s Bees for changing what was a great product into something unusable. And I am very disappointed in Amazon for keeping the old product picture and description up- I would have never have bothered to order it if I knew what I was getting.</li>
            <li> We bought this product, knowing the packaging is different from the ones bought in stores. However, the name is the same (and everything else about the label as far as we can tell). However, the product has a pretty pungent smell and is thinner than the body butter we bought in-store. It also doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well. Very disappointed and will never buy, nor recommend this one here again. BEWARE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (04/24/2012): seems everybody is correct, you can no longer find the old product anywhere, as this is the \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; product aaaaand it sucks. :o) shame too. it was absolutely AWESOME before.</li>
            <li> This product will make your skin so soft and smooth with no irritation. The draw back is the scent, awful! I use it at home when I do not go out. I continue to use it because it really does give you smooth skin which feels good. I will try other Burt bees butter to see if the scent is better.</li>
            <li> I love Bert&#x27;s Bees stuff. However when purchasing this product I was at first, a little on the fence about it. It smelled a bit weird to me and I couldn&#x27;t quite figure out what it was, until it hit me. This stuff smells like chocolate, like a package of Swiss Rolls and honey. I find the smell quite intoxicating and I love the butter itself, it is a little sticky but not overwhelmingly so. It takes a bit to work into the skin if you have globs and globs on, but if you use a sparing amount (as a little bit goes a long way here) it glides on and absorbs quickly. It also leaves my skin feeling soft and healthy, and as an added bonus for me I smell like chocolate and honey. Whats not to love? I also dab a very (very!) tiny amount onto my palms and run them through my damp hair as I am getting out of the shower, as it makes my hair super soft but not weighed down or oily. I have really dry skin, especially in the winter and this stuff nips it in the bud. Great for dry, itchy skin that other products can&#x27;t touch. Love this stuff, and will be purchasing more!</li>
            <li> And now I have the whole family hooked. I have very sensitive skin (eczema) and this is one of the few products that does not irritate.  In fact it helps, a lot.  If the eczema begins to flare I apply it and the next day it&#x27;s usually gone.  Thank you Burt&#x27;s Bees!</li>
            <li> Good reasonably priced ethical natural after bath or after sun body moisturizer.  Love it!  Thanks, Burt&#x27;s Bees-- your products are the best !</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Thoroughly Therapeutic Body Butter was a real winner of a product that I completely loved and enjoyed.  I used it daily, recommended it to friends and family and purchased it regularly.  Recently, Burt&#x27;s Bees decided to discontinue this fine quality product and replace it with a newer product which is now entitled Burt&#x27;s Bees Honey &amp; Shea Body Butter (note the missing Thoroughly Therapeutic in its title).  These 2 products are completely different and in my opinion vary greatly in quality.  The original body butter had a beautiful, sweet and light honey-like fragrance and a very soft, creamy feel when applied that soaked in nicely and felt nourishing to the skin.  It truly made me feel happy and healthier to use it.  Burt&#x27;s Bees newer product smells like weakened, chocolate tea, if there is such a thing, and is not at all pleasant in fragrance.  It has a whole different and heavier feel when applied and in my opinion is far less superior in quality.  I have written to Burt&#x27;s Bees about this change hoping that they would consider going back to the original product.  In the meantime, I have returned the new product that I had requested for Christmas (thinking that I would be receiving the old version).  Boy, was I was sadly disappointed.  I will not be purchasing any of the newer product.  However, should Burt&#x27;s Bees decide to reinstate the original Thoroughly Therapeutic Honey &amp; Shea Body Butter, I will certainly continue to purchase it.  Customers, if you are looking for the wonderful, older product, please be advised that you will not likely find it, though the picture advertised by Amazon appears to be the discontinued product.  Sorry, Burt&#x27;s Bees.  You really dropped the ball on this one.  If you value your loyal customers, you will seriously consider bringing back this original product.  Please, bring it back!!!  Julie</li>
            <li> This product is super thick and goes on smooth. It&#x27;s great! Not too greasy and really luxurious. It&#x27;s definitely a plus that it&#x27;s Burts!</li>
            <li> I have had dry skin all of my life.  I found Burt&#x27;s Bees Body Butter many years ago - I put it on after my morning shower and my skin was still soft and moist after a long day at work.  But a few years ago Burt&#x27;s Bees was bought out and the formula has been changed.  Now I put it on in the morning and my skin is showing signs of dryness by noon.  I will no longer buy this product.</li>
            <li> I love Burts products (original Burts Bees wax....the best) so I got this dual pack with the honey and shea butter plus the honey hand cream. I thought to myself... I love Burts and I love honey, whats not to love? This stuff leaves your skin feeling sticky for at least 20 minutes before it starts to wear off. Really sticky, like you have sugar on your hands. It&#x27;s really weird. I&#x27;ve also tried their almond hand cream, love the smell but it also leaves your hands super oily for a really long time before it saturates the skin. After these three experiences, I think I&#x27;ll just stick with the original lip product.</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about this lotion is the wonderful honey scent. Smells like honeycomb only not so overwhelmingly sweet, and the fragrance mellows but lasts quite a long time. Most of the lotions I try have a chemically unpleasant (to me) scent that tends to give me a headache, so I generally prefer unscented products. This one is the exception. It&#x27;s listed as a body lotion, but I use it on my hands and face mostly. I find it effective, pleasant and non-greasy. You don&#x27;t need to use very much of it, which is good, as I think it&#x27;s a little pricey. It&#x27;s so nice, though, that I really think it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people don&#x27;t like the scent (we&#x27;re all different) and if you&#x27;re afraid to try it because of that, try looking for it at drug stores. They often have a sample jar so you can decide for yourself whether you like it before you buy. If you can judge from the purchasing limits, most people do like it. My mom wanted me to get four jars for her (gifts), but every website I went to would only allow you to buy three.</li>
            <li> I just finished a tub of this Honey and Shea Butter - it was thick, creamy, and smelled like coconuts.  This newer formulation smells awful - mostly like honey, I think, but it made me gag!  The texture is like Kindergarten white paste glue, and it doesn&#x27;t spread or absorb.  I have asked the seller for a refund, but if I don&#x27;t get one, I completely understand, because it is the product produced by Burt&#x27;s Bees - I actually went to the Burt&#x27;s Bees website to see what their product reviews said, and this is their new formulation.  YUCK!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I used to love this product. I recommended it and gave it as gifts. Now it SUCKS! It stinks and btw.....if you have to have it, (even though you will stink) you can buy it at Walmart for nearly half this price. If I could give it a zero star, I would.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter who particularly loves it.  I&#x27;m glad I could find it so easily, as I didn&#x27;t find it in local stores.</li>
            <li> exactly what i was looking for</li>
            <li> I got this from CVS, not Amazon, and I have the original product, not the newer diluted one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The honey smell is overwhelming for me, an the texture is REALLY sticky. It feels like putting actual honey on my skin. The only place I can use this comfortably is on my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose if you have really dry skin it might be okay, but this is just intolerably sticky for me.</li>
            <li> I like this body butter because I&#x27;ve been doing some work that tends to wreck my hands. It completely smooths out my sun damaged 47 year old hands! The smell is like strong bees wax, I like it, but I do like bees wax more than the average person, being a Ukrainian Egg maker. The only negative I can think of is that it doesn&#x27;t immediately soak in. You put in on and the thought comes to mind \\&quot;how long is this going to take to soak in?\\&quot;. It does eventually soak in, but it leaves your hands quite sticky for a few minutes. It is majorly serious cream, but it works majorly well.</li>
            <li> It appeared it may have been frozen then thawed out before it was delivered. It was hard as plaster and I could not get it out of the jar. It also started smelling bad after a few days. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I thought I was ordering the product in the photo. If you look closely, it says \\&quot;Thoroughly Therapeutic\\&quot; on the front of the jar. This is a product I have used in the past and LOVED. What I received in the mail was NOT the same product. It had \\&quot; Honey and Shea Butter\\&quot; on the front of the jar, but the \\&quot;Thoroughly Therapeutic\\&quot; moniker was gone. The new product  has a totally different texture, and the odor was vile. Sickeningly sweet, like your great-grandmothers perfume,only worse, &amp; not @ all like the original product. I have since learned that the original product, which smelled a bit  like honey/beeswax, has since been discontinued. :(. Too, too bad. It was so nice.</li>
            <li> When you finally see the following ingredients listed,&lt;br /&gt;Water, sunflower oil, vegetable glycerine, bees wax (this should smell like honey), steric acid, mango butter (really?), Shea butter (now this is what it advertises on the label),  glucose (sugar), aloe barbadensis leaf extract, honey (finally), rosemary leaf extract, tocapheral (vitamin E), xanithan gum,&lt;br /&gt;sucrose stearate,  sodium bonate, caramel powder, fragrance.  (Just remember to observe &#x27;NO Cocoa Butter&#x27;. This ruined the scent)&lt;br /&gt;  It will be our original beloved formula. It will smell like fresh buttery honey.  Buy it!  I plan to get a case of it.&lt;br /&gt;The marketing gurus will have finally wised up and paid attention to Amazon reviews and its own reviews from its precious Burt&#x27;s Bee hive. You know. The little bees with money waiting to buy the products that smell like what the label states it does.&lt;br /&gt;I still have a little of the original product left untouched in the bottom of the jar that I absolutely cannot relinquish.  I just opened it and inhaled deeply.  \\&quot;Ahhhhh..., fresh honey with buttery undertones.... just like the jar label states... so wonderful.losed your eyes and sniffed there is no scent but plain old castile soap. Nice gesture but I miss the Burt&#x27;s Bees products that built this companies good reputation.  From now on I will not take this companies word that the product smells like the words on the label,  I will sniff before I buy even if I have to break a seal to do it.  I feel duped.  Burt&#x27;s Bees really bungled, (bumbled) on this.</li>
            <li> A bit expensive, but makes sense since this can&#x27;t be found in stores any longer.  I was skeptical that this would be the original formula, but indeed it was!  VERY satisfied.</li>
            <li> Product that arrived did not have the same label (\\&quot;Totally Therapeutic\\&quot; was not there at all) and is not the same consistency as the original I had from an in-store purchase.  I hear that Burt&#x27;s Bees was bought out by Clorox and that some of the products are being reformulated.  The jars with the Totally Therapeutic label have an incredible smelling balmy body butter.  The jars that have a copyright of 2011 on them don&#x27;t have the same label and are more whippy in texture.  I think the moisturizing quality is still good.  The fragrance and texture are not nearly as dreamy as the original.  I hope the manufacturer goes back to the original formula.</li>
            <li> I like the product, it smells pleasant on application and fades quickly. Absorbs well and leaves skin soft. However it was missing its inner seal so I will most likely be using a different source to order from.</li>
            <li> The rreformulated product is not as good as the previous formula. It doesn&#x27;t smell or feel nearly as nice. I will not hey again unless they change it back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised Burt&#x27;s Bees Body Butter got such good reviews from other people, I purchased a tub tonight and was disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;First off, it looked like there was a big air bubble in the butter and so half of the butter was missing.  The texture was more like thick lotion that comes out of a pump, not like the shea butters I&#x27;ve purchased in the past, and the smell was like cheap perfume.&lt;br /&gt;My dog used to lick the body butter I used in the past, he&#x27;d lick my arms because it was so good.  This stuff smells like chemicals, soap, and imitation fragrance. YUK!&lt;br /&gt;I would like to return it, but since I used it I&#x27;m stuck with it.  I will never buy it again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is really Burt&#x27;s Bees. It came in the same type of container with the right lid but no outer  label. It seemed over filled. The product smelled different and does not spread the same on my skin. I have been using The Burt&#x27;s Bees Honey and Shea for years and this just wasn&#x27;t right. It seemed like somebody tried to make their own and pass it off as the original.</li>
            <li> I had looked long and hard to find Burt&#x27;s Bees Thoroughly Therapeutic Honey and Shea Body Butter as it is no longer available in stores. It works wonderfully on dry skin patches and one jar lasts a very long time. I also really enjoy the scent, which is why I had ordered two of them. Unfortunately, only one of the jars was what I had ordered. The other one was Burt&#x27;s Bees Honey and Shea Body Butter. This product doesn&#x27;t smell the same or work nearly as well as the Thoroughly Therapeutic does. And although I am completely happy with half of my purchase, I was utterly disappointed with the other half that I am now stuck with.</li>
            <li> This product was old and all dried up. What was supposed to be a creamy body butter was in fact like a rock in the jar. Also there were no Burts&#x27;s Bees stickers on the side of the jar. Just a plane clear container. Beware if you are thinking about this product and seller.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used this product for years but couldn&#x27;t find it locally any more, Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s changed the formula and that is all  the local stores carry and the new formula isn&#x27;t that good.</li>
            <li> This body butter has weird texture. It&#x27;s not thick like most body butters and doesn&#x27;t do a good job of moisturizing. It&#x27;s more like lotion that doesn&#x27;t absorb properly. The good thing is that you can really smell the honey...which is about the best thing it has to offer.</li>
            <li> I got a jar of this as a gift a couple of years ago - it was great. Smelled like honey, worked really well to protect the hands. THIS product, however, can&#x27;t possibly be the same stuff. It smells like automotive garage hand cleaner (chemically), and is kind of...sticky. It is no longer related to shea butter products (that familiar feel of Occitane, for example). Too bad. How could they mess this up? Did Burt&#x27;s Bees get sold, or something? I wish there was a &amp;#34;zero stars&amp;#34; option, I&#x27;d use it here.</li>
            <li> So I was becoming a amazon addict until I bought this product. When the item arrived a immediately tried it on. When I put it on it Became watery; this is one of the characteristics I noticed in cheap lotions. I was shocked because I&#x27;m always very satisfied with burts products so I took a close look at the packaging. It had no label around it only a sticker on top. I spelt it more consciously and it smelt like play doh with a combo of he burts bees smell. I knew this wasn&#x27;t original. I called to report it and spoke to a vendor and he said this is an older version of the product. Which was complete bs. For one thing all burts bees has there statement and purpose on the packaging not just a sticker saying burts bees. And the smell was so generic. I returned this and will be more careful when purchasing online. I&#x27;m pretty sure this is illegal by the way and I have. Shopped at amazon since</li>
            <li> I have purchased this in stores in the past, I didn&#x27;t realize there was a &amp;#34;new formula&amp;#34;. It smells disgusting, I went online to see if there were reports of rancid product but it appears that this is just how it smells now. There is no way I can use this and go out in public, it smells as if I&#x27;ve rolled in old almond oil (after it&#x27;s been cooked with).</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t find in stores anymore, which is why I ordered, but arrived all dried out. Boo.</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees and this lotion helps support that admiration. This body butter is a quality product for an affordable price.</li>
            <li> We have used Burt&#x27;s Bees body butter specifically, and other items occasionally, for many years; choosing them over all other brands.  We loved the honey/shea butter formula.  Over the last year, Burt&#x27;s Bees has changed their product formula and the quality has suffered, in our opinion.  It no longer has the same consistency or fragrence and no longer meets our needs.  We wrote to Burt&#x27;s Bees and they wrote back saying, &#x27;oh, we changed the formula (we could tell already), and we hope you enjoy it.&#x27;  We will no longer be buying any of Burt&#x27;s Bees products.&lt;br /&gt;They are selling out in quality to cut their costs while the consumers still pay the same, or more.</li>
            <li> The product and photo show the 6.6oz jar. The jar I just have received is the newer version with 5.5oz. How can someone sell things by tricking the customers is behond my understanding. Do not buy from them!!</li>
