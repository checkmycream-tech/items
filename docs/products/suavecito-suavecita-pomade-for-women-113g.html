            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>I am finally able to do my victory rolls and even maintain my hair sleek when I straighten it out.</li>
            <li>I have an undercut pixie with longer hair on top</li>
            <li>Love the smell too.</li>
            <li>, sure beats using hairspray.</li>
            <li>Smells great and the hold is really reliable once it dries</li>
            <li>Favorite Pomade.</li>
            <li>Give it a try, i will order more when i run out.</li>
            <li>and we both love the smell.</li>
            <li>but I wish there was more hold</li>
            <li>Love the help  </li>
            <li>It works ok, but is unusable for me.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I love this pomade.</li>
            <li>So glad this exists.</li>
            <li>, she was excited to see them have a pomade just for the ladies!</li>
            <li>Great pomade at a low price, and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Use sparingly for light control-- but can be built up easily for a more sculpted look.</li>
            <li>And the packaging is cool!</li>
            <li>Washes out easily with no build up.</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s water soluble it can be dampened and refreshed and it washes out easily.</li>
            <li>but I wish Suavecito made a strong hold for women...</li>
            <li>Suavecita is much more mild.</li>
            <li>Such a great product that I&#x27;m hoping will be available in a 32oz.</li>
            <li>Plus it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>And is super easy to wash out ...</li>
            <li>and i also really like that it washes out easy!</li>
            <li>just love this as much as the original Suavecito pomade.</li>
            <li>Not to mention the price is right!</li>
            <li>It has a nice soft smell to it that she loves.</li>
            <li>and she used it, loved the smell and texture as well as hold, and hasn&#x27;t gone back!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it for its easy use and easy removal</li>
            <li>I have very fine, naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>Exactly what it says it is!</li>
            <li>Last all day, and more! ðŸ˜€</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a great everyday pomade.</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>Not too powerful</li>
            <li>but I love it so far.  </li>
            <li>I ordered her one right away</li>
            <li>I do really like the smell (sort of like melon? or a sweet fruit)</li>
            <li>That aside both me (queer) and my cohuman (male) find this suavecito to have a nice hold and a decent sheen without looking greasy.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy it more than onve .</li>
            <li>and I only use this on top when I want a sleeker look.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more of this pomade in the future ...</li>
            <li>I use this 2 or 3 times a week with other products and i would buy more and recommend to a friend!</li>
            <li>I have frizzy hair and this product really helps to smooth those pesky hairs down so my victory rolls look a lot more polished now.  </li>
            <li>It smells fantastic and allows me to easily create victory rolls and other sculpted vintage styles.</li>
            <li>So decent product, but why not just go gender neutral and call this the \\&quot;fresh scent\\&quot; or something?</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t weight down hair or feel greasy afterwards and has nice smell</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, and I love that it is super easy to wash out.</li>
            <li>It really holds my hair well</li>
            <li>Overall fabulous product</li>
            <li>Product is great but arrived in a broken container</li>
            <li>but it washes out good other then that it can get kinda crusty and start to turn white through out the day.</li>
            <li>The scent is very light and slightly strawberry to my nose.</li>
            <li>Most product makes it look greasy, weighed down and causes it to &#x27;felt&#x27; into tangles.</li>
            <li>The ladies pomade here does an amazing job keeping curls from falling back to straight, keeping down flyaways, and keeping your hair in shape.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to all my pin up queens&lt;br /&gt;Plus, is smells</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It leaves a funny film on your hands so you definitely need to wash up after applying.</li>
            <li>I am completely head over heels for my suavecita pomade!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>old granddaughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>My wife always wanted to use suavecitos pomade for the texture and hold, but didn&#x27;t because she said it smelled to masculine</li>
            <li>Proceed with caution if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The male intended pomade smells like mega douche teen body spray and this smells like fresh showers and sunshine and daisies.</li>
            <li>Which is obviously too feminine for any male in their right mind to wear.</li>
            <li>This is a medium hold and worked best for the longer parts of my cut but was not strong enough to hold slick the shorter pieces down.</li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t smell it too long after I put it on.</li>
            <li>As a female with really short hair it was near impossible to find a product for my hair that worked as effectively as a mens pomade and didn&#x27;t smell like one either.</li>

            <li> As a female with really short hair it was near impossible to find a product for my hair that worked as effectively as a mens pomade and didn&#x27;t smell like one either.</li>
            <li> this stuff offers on my hair with out being super heavy or thick and sticky.  </li>
            <li> It may not dry out as hard as Suavecito or Layrite, which is a disadvantage in humid weather, but aside from that Suavecita holds really well.</li>
            <li> the only thing about pomades made for males is the smell is usually realllllly masculine.</li>
            <li> Held my hair all day long.</li>
            <li> I only need to use a teeny tiny dab to hold down stray hairs and help keep braids/ponytails/etc.  </li>
            <li> but it does take a while to dry.</li>
            <li> I recommend using on mostly dry hair.</li>
            <li> to wash out and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair!</li>
            <li> I personally didn&#x27;t like it because it arrived half empty</li>
            <li> Have only used this a few weeks</li>
            <li> I have partially curly hair which means lots of wispy bits and any one who victory rolls</li>
            <li> Note I little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> And a little goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> I am a stylist in a salon and have tried everything by every brand and definitely my favorite base for suicide rolls and victory rolls.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a little bit like a jello textured hair gel.</li>
            <li> Works well for my little flyaways.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have trouble with flyaways and my hair for work</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inexpensive but not cheap.</li>
            <li> Holds your hair in place without making it stiff ...</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get stiff or sticky.</li>
            <li> I also use it to tame my pesky baby hairs.</li>

            <li> I have frizzy hair and this product really helps to smooth those pesky hairs down so my victory rolls look a lot more polished now.  A friend of mine recommended this product to me and I am so happy I boutht it.  Note I little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF! And it&#x27;s smells AMAZING!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this I think I&#x27;m never going to stop using it, it smells amazing and it really hold my hair and gets rid of fly always and Friz its the best I will definitely buy it more than onve .</li>
            <li> Bought for my girlfriend since I religiously use this brand of pomade to keep my hair up. The ladies pomade here does an amazing job keeping curls from falling back to straight, keeping down flyaways, and keeping your hair in shape. Plus it smells fantastic. Washing it out only takes once. Well worth it.</li>
            <li> I am completely head over heels for my suavecita pomade!!&lt;br /&gt;It helps my crazy frizzy hair and tames it. I am finally able to do my victory rolls and even maintain my hair sleek when I straighten it out. And for the curly frizzy hair, that&#x27;s saying something. I highly recommend this to all my pin up queens&lt;br /&gt;Plus, is smells AWESOME!!!  ðŸ˜ŠðŸ‘‘ðŸ‘‘</li>
            <li> Wife loves it! Great pomade at a low price, and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> it works great and smells really good too</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product by my barber. She used it on me after she gave me a faded side part haircut. This stuff works great. Held my hair all day long. I didn&#x27;t realize what it was until after she used it and I asked her what it was. Im going to add this to my collection.</li>
            <li> It has a nice consistency. Doesn&#x27;t weight down hair or feel greasy afterwards and has nice smell</li>
            <li> I wear my hair up quite a bit. Either in a bun for work, or in &amp;#34;vintage&amp;#34; styles on the weekend. This stuff is AMAZING for both! I had been using J. Crew in the past, but it would sometimes &amp;#34;wear&amp;#34; off throughout the day depending on what was going on. This stuff goes on great and the scent is lovely. Not too powerful and I really don&#x27;t smell it too long after I put it on. I don&#x27;t know how to describe the scent. Fruity maybe? Either way, it&#x27;s a great buy and it comes in a container that&#x27;s bigger than J Crew&#x27;s brand that I used to get. It really holds my hair well and I don&#x27;t have trouble with flyaways and my hair for work looks great everytime, even with me being out in the heat and sweating.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! Makes styling and hold so easy!</li>
            <li> Have only used this a few weeks but I love it so far.  A little goes a long way, and I love that it is super easy to wash out. I have an undercut pixie with longer hair on top and I only use this on top when I want a sleeker look. Love the smell too.</li>
            <li> What a great product if you like suavecito you will love this. I ordered it just because I read the smell was amazing and that&#x27;s a fact. It smells like watermelons and happiness. Not the best shine but neither is the original, it&#x27;s a great everyday pomade. It&#x27;s inexpensive but not cheap.</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic and allows me to easily create victory rolls and other sculpted vintage styles. I also use it to tame my pesky baby hairs. Overall fabulous product, sure beats using hairspray.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing!!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this!</li>
            <li> My girl loves this stuff, great way to keep her hair on point!</li>
            <li> Takes a little bit of practicing to get used to using, but becomes a staple product almost immediately! Use sparingly for light control-- but can be built up easily for a more sculpted look. Fly always easily held, does not create a greasy look. Looking forward to purchasing this again when this tub runs out!</li>
            <li> Exactly what it says it is! Awesome product</li>
            <li> Holds your hair in place without making it stiff ... Works great for fly aways ... And is super easy to wash out ... I will be purchasing more of this pomade in the future ...</li>
            <li> Wonderful water based pomade that&#x27;s a little bit like a jello textured hair gel. Water based and pleasant scent, this product has been a lifesaver when it comes to creating vintage updos!&lt;br /&gt;Easy to wash out and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair! Love it!</li>
            <li> I already know it&#x27;s a good product but Amazon still hasn&#x27;t shipped my two day delivery order I placed three days ago.</li>
            <li> I use this when I am doing my 6 yr. old granddaughter&#x27;s hair.  It has a nice soft smell to it that she loves. I only need to use a teeny tiny dab to hold down stray hairs and help keep braids/ponytails/etc.  in place all through her day.  Doesn&#x27;t get stiff or sticky.</li>
            <li> Smells great and the hold is really reliable once it dries but it does take a while to dry. I recommend using on mostly dry hair.</li>
            <li> Such a great product that I&#x27;m hoping will be available in a 32oz. tub soon.  My wife cannot stand the smell of Suavecito, so my barber recommended Suavecita, which has a milder, watermelon-like scent.  Yeah I know, its &amp;#34;Ladies Hair Pomade&amp;#34; but for me it works just as good as Suavecito.  It may not dry out as hard as Suavecito or Layrite, which is a disadvantage in humid weather, but aside from that Suavecita holds really well.</li>
            <li> The best pomade pa&#x27; las mujeres. Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this it smells amazing hold my hair in place all day ordering another soon</li>
            <li> just love this as much as the original Suavecito pomade. It has nice scent and is washable very easy out of your hair which i like a lot</li>
            <li> Best hair product ever!</li>
            <li> My wife always wanted to use suavecitos pomade for the texture and hold, but didn&#x27;t because she said it smelled to masculine, she was excited to see them have a pomade just for the ladies! I ordered her one right away and she used it, loved the smell and texture as well as hold, and hasn&#x27;t gone back!</li>
            <li> Favorite Pomade. Last all day, and more! ðŸ˜€</li>
            <li> Great product. Works wonderfully for fly aways, and stattic problems. Can use as a style in product, or for a slicked back look. Washes out easily with no build up.</li>
            <li> I have a pixie cut and this is the only pomade i could find for women- the only thing about pomades made for males is the smell is usually realllllly masculine. This is a medium hold and worked best for the longer parts of my cut but was not strong enough to hold slick the shorter pieces down. I do really like the smell (sort of like melon? or a sweet fruit) and i also really like that it washes out easy! I use this 2 or 3 times a week with other products and i would buy more and recommend to a friend! It&#x27;s not this pomades fault that the baby hairs i have are un-tameable lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a girl with a pixie- this could be the product for you. Give it a try, i will order more when i run out. And the packaging is cool!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my gf and she loves it. She wishes she would&#x27;ve tried it earlier and we both love the smell.</li>
            <li> Product is great but arrived in a broken container</li>
            <li> Smells and works amazingly. I am a stylist in a salon and have tried everything by every brand and definitely my favorite base for suicide rolls and victory rolls.</li>
            <li> Imma just go ahead and call the suavecito company out for sexist bulls***. The male intended pomade smells like mega douche teen body spray and this smells like fresh showers and sunshine and daisies. Which is obviously too feminine for any male in their right mind to wear. That aside both me (queer) and my cohuman (male) find this suavecito to have a nice hold and a decent sheen without looking greasy. Plus it smells nice. So decent product, but why not just go gender neutral and call this the \\&quot;fresh scent\\&quot; or something? I prefer layrites advertising campaign (and they smell like wonderful vanilla Whatnots).</li>
            <li> Works well for my little flyaways. Smells AMAZING. It leaves a funny film on your hands so you definitely need to wash up after applying. And a little goes a LONG way. I use about a pea size amount when styling my hair (I have a lot of hair) and it&#x27;s plenty. Will definitely be purchasing again in 20 years when I finally run out!</li>
            <li> It smells like strawberries it dosn&#x27;t hold up well and it&#x27;s kinda hard to work with it has a hard gel/wax consistency but it washes out good other then that it can get kinda crusty and start to turn white through out the day. I personally didn&#x27;t like it because it arrived half empty the one they send me.</li>
            <li> I remember seeing this brand at Viva and figured I&#x27;d give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;I like the smell of it but I wish there was more hold and shine.&lt;br /&gt;The product specifies a medium hold but I wish Suavecito made a strong hold for women... Just my 2 cents!</li>
            <li> Love the help  this stuff offers on my hair with out being super heavy or thick and sticky.  I have partially curly hair which means lots of wispy bits and any one who victory rolls knows wispy bits are not your friend. Highly recommend it for its easy use and easy removal</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the product caused my scalp to break out in an itchy rash, which has since spread. It works ok, but is unusable for me. Proceed with caution if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. As a female with really short hair it was near impossible to find a product for my hair that worked as effectively as a mens pomade and didn&#x27;t smell like one either. This pomade is fantastic, works very well, and smells wonderful. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Good hold, smells yummy and washes out with ease.</li>
            <li> This stuff is freaking awesome. Best hair product purchase I&#x27;ve ever made! I have very fine, naturally curly hair. Most product makes it look greasy, weighed down and causes it to &#x27;felt&#x27; into tangles. I use this for vintage style curls, for smoothing hair pulled back into pony tails and braids and for keeping my curls defined. The scent is very light and slightly strawberry to my nose. Because it&#x27;s water soluble it can be dampened and refreshed and it washes out easily.</li>
            <li> I love this pomade. It smells great and works just as well as Suavecito. Holds my fauxhawk in place even in the desert winds. So glad this exists. I really liked the hold of regular Suavecito, but the scent of it triggered my migraines like crazy. Suavecita is much more mild. Not to mention the price is right! I went from using TIGI bedhead to this. Highly recommend it.</li>
