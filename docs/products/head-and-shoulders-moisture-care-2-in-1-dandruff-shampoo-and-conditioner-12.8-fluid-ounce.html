            <li>I received Head and Shoulders Moisture Care 2-in-1 to try and give my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>I also liked the coconuts pictured as it reminded me of moisture and the tropics.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve told my friends on our swim team about the products and gave them coupons after talking to them about their own daughters&#x27; hair and scalp issues.  </li>
            <li>I really liked the creamy formula of the 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair nice and moist.</li>

            <li>The product came out of the bottle fairly easily, which is good.</li>
            <li>If you have stubborn hair that tangles very easily I would say to try this product out before giving up on 2 in 1 products.</li>

            <li>My curls are still healthy and bouncy and I have noticeable growth.</li>

            <li>Enjoyed this product this morning.</li>
            <li>I received this and 2 more products from bzzagent.com.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this Moisture Care &amp;#34;2-in-1&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;CoWash&amp;#34; line, but they did more for my hair than my scalp.</li>
            <li>A 2-in-1 is not at the top of my list when I go shopping for hair products</li>
            <li>I got this product for free in exchange for an honest review.</li>

            <li>I really this new Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture care line, very happy</li>

            <li>It leaves my hair hydrated and clean.</li>
            <li>More importantly, I have had no burning or intense itching.</li>
            <li>So glad I got to try it for free part of a promotion , Thanks Head &amp; Shoulders.</li>
            <li>The 2 in 1 Moisture Care was great in getting rid of any dandruff and dry scalp.</li>
            <li>The strengthening treatment makes your scalp feel so clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>new hair care products that I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll find more useful than I ever could.</li>
            <li>I received a full size bottle of this product from Head &amp;amp; Shoulders via BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>Using just any old shampoo, like most people, is not a luxury I&#x27;m afforded, because my scalp is easily irritated by even the mildest of soaps.</li>
            <li>Has a nice clean scent, and left my hair squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>I actually used the entire system and was extremely impressed.</li>
            <li>I have super curly hair so seeing that it&#x27;s for textured hair was a bonus.</li>
            <li>I suffer from mild psoriasis of the scalp.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m planning on buying more of this product line for sure because it&#x27;s the only 2 in 1 that has worked for me.</li>
            <li>It is mildly scented which is a plus for me.</li>
            <li>I think that as a shampoo/conditioner combination I would expect and hope that it would be able to clean my hair properly, remove any dirt build up and easily wash away.</li>
            <li>Love the new Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care products.  </li>
            <li>and I was invited to join this campaign, and really, who can say no to free stuff?</li>
            <li>It smells so good not too perfumed just a lasting soft, light scent.  </li>
            <li>and I was really surprised how smooth and moisturizing it was!</li>
            <li>I received my Head &amp; Shoulders kit in the mail right around the time it started getting hot here.  </li>
            <li>It is perfect to use after a few days of working out in between the times where I wash, deep conditioner, etc.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair very soft &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li>My hair gets very dry in the summer and this did an amazing job for me.</li>
            <li>I tried it a second time to give it fair shake and the results were a little better</li>
            <li>What I do like about this product though is that it smelled really good,(not too strong or perfumy) and seemed to make my hair really soft!</li>
            <li>The first time I used the Moisture Care 2-in-1 shampoo, my scalp noticed immediately.</li>
            <li>We have been using Head and Shoulders products pretty exclusively for my husband for years.  </li>
            <li>I intend to keep using the product and supporting the brand.</li>
            <li>I thought for sure you couldn&#x27;t possibly need a conditioner after washing  with this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I expect that they will work just as well as the 2-in1, which might I add has a very soothing feel to the scalp!</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this, as it is a trusted brand, and grows more all the time.</li>
            <li>but this works pretty well.</li>
            <li>And as it turned out, I was right to not expect much from the products I received.  </li>
            <li>My hair felt soft and smooth and very manageable after the first use.</li>
            <li>I wet my hair with warm hot water as I normally do then applied the 2-in-1 product in my hand and rubbed it in to my hair.</li>
            <li>As someone with natural kinky hair, i am constantly on a quest to find a good shampoo that can cleanse my hair without stripping it of it&#x27;s natural moisture.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that I was not let down.</li>
            <li>I had my doubts about this shampoo because most companies always say something meanwhile the product does not live up to the hype.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for new products that actually help my hair and I feel I found it :)</li>
            <li>This product has left my scalp and hair feeling moisturized and silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Thanks to bzzagent</li>
            <li>Thanks to Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care 2-in-1</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to use much of the product, as it spreads nicely.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The fragrance was very pleasing too.</li>
            <li>The Head and Shoulders  2 in 1 works really well for detangling.  </li>
            <li>Unlike the Co-Wash, i really didn&#x27;t care for the 2-in-1 shampoo.  </li>
            <li>(BUZZAGENT)&lt;br /&gt;After one use I found that it makes my hair really rejuvenated.</li>
            <li>The 2 and 1 was much like a clarifying shampoo which also meant that it was drying for me.</li>
            <li>The Moisture Care &amp;#34;scalp soother&amp;#34; (spray) burns more if you use it after shampooing, because your scalp&#x27;s wet</li>
            <li>I really did see an improvement with dandruff.</li>
            <li>They were all very eager to try the products and see the reults for themselves.</li>
            <li>this 2 in 1 dandruff shampoo gentle to my hair while meeting my hair need.</li>
            <li>I recently received a free sample of this</li>
            <li>I really liked the shampoo, was moisturizing without being heavy and it rinsed well, almost like a clarifying shampoo.</li>
            <li>Of course my first action was to take a look at some of the ingredients.  </li>
            <li>This particular shampoo/conditioner may be good for someone who washes their hair everyday and doesn&#x27;t have much dirt or oils in their hair from constant washing.</li>
            <li>I was actually able to detangle slightly with the shampoo in my hair.</li>
            <li>So two days later, I washed my hair the same as before, and prayed to god that I&#x27;d have at the most, one itch-less day; boy was I mistaken.</li>
            <li>It has the same lovely smell as the co-wash, but the opposite effect.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m glad they finally came out with a line of products for my specific type of hair.</li>
            <li>The Shampoo has this creamy consistency, and for my really highly textured hair, it worked out well.</li>
            <li>As anyone can imagine, it&#x27;s been hell to live with, and often interferes with my day-to-day life.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent a lot more money on products that have similar claims, but this does the job!</li>
            <li>This product does clean my hair extremely well from the shampoo part.</li>
            <li>I have used Head and Shoulders in the past to control flaking and itching of my scalp, so I was very familiar with the brand.</li>
            <li>I received a product sample, coupon, collateral or other special premium from BzzAgent or the brand.</li>
            <li>Packaging I like the packaging  as I could clearly see the product was meant for textured hair from the design on the bottle.  </li>
            <li>but I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>So if your scalp isn&#x27;t as sensitive and problematic as mine, I have no doubt that this product will probably work like a charm for you.</li>
            <li>I have natural kinky coily hair that needs moisture and this shampoo didn&#x27;t give my have that.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that a 2-in-1 shampoo could leave my hair so moisturized.</li>
            <li>However, as an adult I do not like my hair being greasy nor does it work.</li>
            <li>This product is very beneficial if you suffer from dandruff or wear your hair in braids and weaves and go several days in between washing.</li>
            <li>its torture on me and my hair and this really brought it back to life.</li>
            <li>I tried the Moisture Care 2 in 1 and was pleasantly surprised by the mellow Coconut Smell.</li>
            <li>It made my hair soft, and shiny.</li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>I have been transitioning my hair from been relaxed to natural for two years now.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used this product I was very disappointed--it left my hair feeling dry.  </li>
            <li>Where I LIVE ITS REALLY HOT and at work there is not really any ac</li>
            <li>It lathered well with a small amount and rinsed out easily.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend though for controlling flakes and especially itching.</li>
            <li>The  product felt very good, very thick, but not so thick it couldn&#x27;t get out the bottle.</li>
            <li>(btw, my hair gets really dry if its washed too much, so I wash my hair once a week. )</li>
            <li>My hair seems to always be dry and this really helped improve my hair.</li>
            <li>My scalp felt clean with no more  itching .</li>
            <li>Now in all fairness, I have only used sulfate free shampoos on my hair over the past couple of years</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t smell medicated like that other products similar that I have tried and unlike other 2 in 1 products I was able to actually brush my hair while the product was in it.</li>
            <li>Consider me pleasantly surprised that not only had</li>
            <li>I have a big dandruff problem and I use normal head &amp; shoulders shampoo and conditioner regularly.</li>
            <li>Overall, this line of products has been helpful and the new Moisture Care 2-in-1 is the same.  </li>
            <li>That never happens because it normally makes my hair too dry to the point</li>
            <li>Other than that, the bottle was pretty standard.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the subtle coconut scent.</li>
            <li>I was a bit nervous when I first saw that this was a shampoo/conditioner combo because usually they can be quite drying on my curly hair, but I was surprised to find that this was in fact not drying in any way.</li>
            <li>The only thing it left behind is a great scent that was not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Foolishly, in my desperation to make it stop, I reached for the Scalp Soother, which initially worked it&#x27;s magic, only to leave the itch even worse than ever before when it&#x27;s soothing effects wore off about 15 minutes later.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone who wants less flakes and irritation.</li>
            <li>The main ingredients include almond oil, coconut essence and zinc pyrthione (which is the active ingredient that fights dandruff).</li>
            <li>After just washing my hair with the shampoo, I was surprised to see how soft and less tangled my hair got.</li>
            <li>My hair did not feel dry or weighed down after the first use.</li>
            <li>It was a little intense, almost like I dumped a bottle of peppermint oil on my scalp...</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Impressions: While I loved the 2 in 1 shampoo, I think Head and Shoulders need to work on moisture retention.</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> I am totally in love with the scent and the benefits of this product!</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I had the opportunity for my family to try this product from Bzz Agent!</li>
            <li> I cannot begin to explain how much I love the smell of these products!</li>
            <li> and I must say, I love it!</li>
            <li> This is fantastic!!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptic on whether a 2 in 1 would work on my hair but it worked wonderful!  </li>
            <li> I received Head and Shoulders Moisture Care 2-in-1 to try and give my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I also liked the coconuts pictured as it reminded me of moisture and the tropics.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve told my friends on our swim team about the products and gave them coupons after talking to them about their own daughters&#x27; hair and scalp issues.  </li>
            <li> I really liked the creamy formula of the 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair nice and moist.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free to try out, but all opinions expressed are my own!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product and would recommend to anyone with any hair type :)</li>
            <li> The product came out of the bottle fairly easily, which is good.</li>
            <li> If you have stubborn hair that tangles very easily I would say to try this product out before giving up on 2 in 1 products.</li>
            <li> 2-in-1 Dandruff Shampoo Plus Conditioner my hair is looking very nice, feeling Clean and Healthy and</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the best products I have ever used my sons hair has never looked better..</li>
            <li> I received this through bzzagent for free, and I really enjoyed the product!</li>
            <li> I received a free one in a promotional kit and love it!</li>

            <li> I received this product as a free trial for an honest and unbiased reviewâ€¦With Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care</li>
            <li> Just after the first shampoo and condition (nice lather!)</li>
            <li> My hair felt silky and smooth!</li>
            <li> Also I&#x27;m not too sure what the difference is between this and</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY love the 2 in 1 Moisture care and the Co-wash.</li>
            <li> My curls are still healthy and bouncy and I have noticeable growth.</li>
            <li> Maybe it works better on textured hair that has been processed.</li>
            <li> Enjoyed this product this morning.</li>
            <li> I received this and 2 more products from bzzagent.com.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this Moisture Care &amp;#34;2-in-1&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;CoWash&amp;#34; line, but they did more for my hair than my scalp.</li>
            <li> A 2-in-1 is not at the top of my list when I go shopping for hair products</li>
            <li> I got this product for free in exchange for an honest review.</li>

            <li> It leaves my hair hydrated and clean.</li>

            <li> So glad I got to try it for free part of a promotion , Thanks Head &amp; Shoulders.</li>
            <li> The 2 in 1 Moisture Care was great in getting rid of any dandruff and dry scalp.</li>
            <li> The strengthening treatment makes your scalp feel so clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> new hair care products that I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll find more useful than I ever could.</li>
            <li> I received a full size bottle of this product from Head &amp;amp; Shoulders via BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> Using just any old shampoo, like most people, is not a luxury I&#x27;m afforded, because my scalp is easily irritated by even the mildest of soaps.</li>
            <li> Has a nice clean scent, and left my hair squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> I actually used the entire system and was extremely impressed.</li>
            <li> I have super curly hair so seeing that it&#x27;s for textured hair was a bonus.</li>
            <li> I suffer from mild psoriasis of the scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m planning on buying more of this product line for sure because it&#x27;s the only 2 in 1 that has worked for me.</li>
            <li> It is mildly scented which is a plus for me.</li>
            <li> I think that as a shampoo/conditioner combination I would expect and hope that it would be able to clean my hair properly, remove any dirt build up and easily wash away.</li>
            <li> Love the new Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care products.  </li>
            <li> and I was invited to join this campaign, and really, who can say no to free stuff?</li>
            <li> It smells so good not too perfumed just a lasting soft, light scent.  </li>
            <li> and I was really surprised how smooth and moisturizing it was!</li>
            <li> I received my Head &amp; Shoulders kit in the mail right around the time it started getting hot here.  </li>
            <li> It is perfect to use after a few days of working out in between the times where I wash, deep conditioner, etc.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair very soft &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li> My hair gets very dry in the summer and this did an amazing job for me.</li>
            <li> I tried it a second time to give it fair shake and the results were a little better</li>
            <li> What I do like about this product though is that it smelled really good,(not too strong or perfumy) and seemed to make my hair really soft!</li>
            <li> The first time I used the Moisture Care 2-in-1 shampoo, my scalp noticed immediately.</li>
            <li> We have been using Head and Shoulders products pretty exclusively for my husband for years.  </li>
            <li> I intend to keep using the product and supporting the brand.</li>
            <li> I thought for sure you couldn&#x27;t possibly need a conditioner after washing  with this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I expect that they will work just as well as the 2-in1, which might I add has a very soothing feel to the scalp!</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this, as it is a trusted brand, and grows more all the time.</li>
            <li> but this works pretty well.</li>
            <li> And as it turned out, I was right to not expect much from the products I received.  </li>
            <li> My hair felt soft and smooth and very manageable after the first use.</li>
            <li> I wet my hair with warm hot water as I normally do then applied the 2-in-1 product in my hand and rubbed it in to my hair.</li>
            <li> As someone with natural kinky hair, i am constantly on a quest to find a good shampoo that can cleanse my hair without stripping it of it&#x27;s natural moisture.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that I was not let down.</li>
            <li> I had my doubts about this shampoo because most companies always say something meanwhile the product does not live up to the hype.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for new products that actually help my hair and I feel I found it :)</li>
            <li> This product has left my scalp and hair feeling moisturized and silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Thanks to bzzagent</li>
            <li> Thanks to Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care 2-in-1</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to use much of the product, as it spreads nicely.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The fragrance was very pleasing too.</li>
            <li> The Head and Shoulders  2 in 1 works really well for detangling.  </li>
            <li> Unlike the Co-Wash, i really didn&#x27;t care for the 2-in-1 shampoo.  </li>
            <li> (BUZZAGENT)&lt;br /&gt;After one use I found that it makes my hair really rejuvenated.</li>
            <li> The 2 and 1 was much like a clarifying shampoo which also meant that it was drying for me.</li>
            <li> The Moisture Care &amp;#34;scalp soother&amp;#34; (spray) burns more if you use it after shampooing, because your scalp&#x27;s wet</li>
            <li> I really did see an improvement with dandruff.</li>
            <li> They were all very eager to try the products and see the reults for themselves.</li>
            <li> this 2 in 1 dandruff shampoo gentle to my hair while meeting my hair need.</li>
            <li> I recently received a free sample of this</li>
            <li> I really liked the shampoo, was moisturizing without being heavy and it rinsed well, almost like a clarifying shampoo.</li>
            <li> Of course my first action was to take a look at some of the ingredients.  </li>
            <li> This particular shampoo/conditioner may be good for someone who washes their hair everyday and doesn&#x27;t have much dirt or oils in their hair from constant washing.</li>
            <li> I was actually able to detangle slightly with the shampoo in my hair.</li>
            <li> So two days later, I washed my hair the same as before, and prayed to god that I&#x27;d have at the most, one itch-less day; boy was I mistaken.</li>
            <li> It has the same lovely smell as the co-wash, but the opposite effect.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m glad they finally came out with a line of products for my specific type of hair.</li>
            <li> The Shampoo has this creamy consistency, and for my really highly textured hair, it worked out well.</li>
            <li> As anyone can imagine, it&#x27;s been hell to live with, and often interferes with my day-to-day life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a lot more money on products that have similar claims, but this does the job!</li>
            <li> This product does clean my hair extremely well from the shampoo part.</li>
            <li> I have used Head and Shoulders in the past to control flaking and itching of my scalp, so I was very familiar with the brand.</li>
            <li> I received a product sample, coupon, collateral or other special premium from BzzAgent or the brand.</li>
            <li> Packaging I like the packaging  as I could clearly see the product was meant for textured hair from the design on the bottle.  </li>
            <li> but I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> So if your scalp isn&#x27;t as sensitive and problematic as mine, I have no doubt that this product will probably work like a charm for you.</li>
            <li> I have natural kinky coily hair that needs moisture and this shampoo didn&#x27;t give my have that.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that a 2-in-1 shampoo could leave my hair so moisturized.</li>
            <li> However, as an adult I do not like my hair being greasy nor does it work.</li>
            <li> This product is very beneficial if you suffer from dandruff or wear your hair in braids and weaves and go several days in between washing.</li>
            <li> its torture on me and my hair and this really brought it back to life.</li>
            <li> I tried the Moisture Care 2 in 1 and was pleasantly surprised by the mellow Coconut Smell.</li>
            <li> It made my hair soft, and shiny.</li>
            <li> and I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> I have been transitioning my hair from been relaxed to natural for two years now.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used this product I was very disappointed--it left my hair feeling dry.  </li>
            <li> Where I LIVE ITS REALLY HOT and at work there is not really any ac</li>
            <li> It lathered well with a small amount and rinsed out easily.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend though for controlling flakes and especially itching.</li>
            <li> The  product felt very good, very thick, but not so thick it couldn&#x27;t get out the bottle.</li>
            <li> (btw, my hair gets really dry if its washed too much, so I wash my hair once a week. )</li>
            <li> My hair seems to always be dry and this really helped improve my hair.</li>
            <li> My scalp felt clean with no more  itching .</li>
            <li> Now in all fairness, I have only used sulfate free shampoos on my hair over the past couple of years</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t smell medicated like that other products similar that I have tried and unlike other 2 in 1 products I was able to actually brush my hair while the product was in it.</li>
            <li> Consider me pleasantly surprised that not only had</li>
            <li> I have a big dandruff problem and I use normal head &amp; shoulders shampoo and conditioner regularly.</li>
            <li> Overall, this line of products has been helpful and the new Moisture Care 2-in-1 is the same.  </li>
            <li> That never happens because it normally makes my hair too dry to the point</li>
            <li> Other than that, the bottle was pretty standard.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the subtle coconut scent.</li>
            <li> I was a bit nervous when I first saw that this was a shampoo/conditioner combo because usually they can be quite drying on my curly hair, but I was surprised to find that this was in fact not drying in any way.</li>
            <li> The only thing it left behind is a great scent that was not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Foolishly, in my desperation to make it stop, I reached for the Scalp Soother, which initially worked it&#x27;s magic, only to leave the itch even worse than ever before when it&#x27;s soothing effects wore off about 15 minutes later.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone who wants less flakes and irritation.</li>
            <li> The main ingredients include almond oil, coconut essence and zinc pyrthione (which is the active ingredient that fights dandruff).</li>
            <li> After just washing my hair with the shampoo, I was surprised to see how soft and less tangled my hair got.</li>
            <li> My hair did not feel dry or weighed down after the first use.</li>
            <li> It was a little intense, almost like I dumped a bottle of peppermint oil on my scalp...</li>
            <li> I figured that if the products from this new line were just as disappointing as their predecessors, I could always just give them to my mom or sister, who just like me, can never say no to free things, especially when it&#x27;s hair-care or beauty involved.</li>
            <li> The Head and Shoulders 2 in 1  appeared to  be very creamy, I mean seriously creamy and rich.</li>
            <li> This left my hair feeling soft yet not weighed down.  </li>
            <li> But on the plus side I found that I scratch my head far less than with the regular shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to vouch for long term effectiveness.</li>
            <li> So, I use it on a dry scalp and each night before my next shampoo shampoo.</li>
            <li> At first I was a bit skeptical because normally these type of shampoo/conditioner combos tend to strip my hair</li>
            <li> Textured hair is naturally dry and needs a product that can impart long lasting moisture.</li>
            <li> This product is not heavy nor does it weigh down your hair, I had no flakes or dry patches</li>
            <li> Definitely a product we would recommend to someone else struggling with dry, itchy scalp and one we would use again in our home!</li>
            <li> However, instead leaving my hair feeling moisturized, it left my hair feeling very dry and stripped.</li>
            <li> But since the itch was minimal and and not as bad as I&#x27;d experienced in the past, I decided to give it another try (after all, a product should be used on multiple occasions to see any results).</li>
            <li> I did&#x27;t use any other products with the 2 in 1 initially, because it seemed it would hold up well as a stand alone product.</li>
            <li> As a woman of AfroCaribbean decent, sometimes it&#x27;s hard to find products for my hair type.</li>
            <li> my hair gets really dry.</li>
            <li> Growing up, my mother always said if your scalp is dry and flaky then you need to put grease on your hair.</li>
            <li> my dry scalp issues have been solved.</li>
            <li> Which means I suffer from scalp irritation, intense burning and a ridiculous need to scratch, which then produces flakes and then comes the scalp sores.</li>
            <li> I took points off this product because after allowing my hair to dry, it didn&#x27;t retain the moisture.</li>
            <li> My mother has issues with dry scalp</li>
            <li> The lower half of my hair has blonde ends that were bleached over a year ago.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry scalp and have been looking for something to help combat it and take care of my flakes.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, course, curly hair</li>
            <li> I had tried other products from this company before but all they did was dry my hair out</li>
            <li> 2-in-1, I fully expected it to cleanse and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The heat coupled with her being in the pool for swim team four days a week has really wreaked havoc on her poor scalp.  </li>
            <li> After 5 days of 1 wash with this shampoo, I had absolutely no dandruff on my scalp.</li>
            <li> I have  thick African American hair</li>
            <li> Usually a 2-in-1 shampoo doesn&#x27;t provide enough moisture; however Head and Shoulders Moisture Care did!</li>
            <li> Usually I have and issue with keep my hair moist, especially in the heat.  </li>
            <li> I have never  really equated Head and Shoulders with moisture, much less, having anything to offer for textured hair.</li>
            <li> I cannot wait to give the other products I received a try as well!</li>
            <li> with this I had much less still have some though.</li>
            <li> His hair is long and thick and he struggles with dandruff when we don&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li> my only small complaint is the shape of the bottle...</li>
            <li> Normally 2 in 1 products dry my hair out really bad but with head &amp; shoulders 2 in 1</li>
            <li> I usually have less dandruff than with out the shampoo and conditioner but</li>
            <li> I was excited to try because I have a small (albeit annoying) patch or psoriasis on my temple.</li>
            <li> There are limited brands I stand behind</li>
            <li> That said, my pre-existing scalp condition probably has more to do with my awful experience with the Head &amp; Shoulder products than the products themselves.</li>
            <li> I have been prescribed numerous expensive types of medicated oils, sprays, rubs and shampoos that never resolved the issue...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I love this product! It makes my hair very soft &amp; smooth. Works well with think and kinky textured hair!</li>
            <li> I received the Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care 2-in1 for free through BzzAgent to try and review. My hair did not feel dry or weighed down after the first use. It lathered well with a small amount and rinsed out easily. The new coconut scent is a great improvement over the medicine like scent of original Head &amp; Shoulders Shampoo. The scent isn&#x27;t overpowering but did last throughout the day. I look forward to the results from continued use.</li>
            <li> I received this product as a promotion from BzzAgent and was super excited to try it! I can honestly say that I was not let down. I was actually pleasantly surpised at how well this product works on my wavy course hair. This shampoo has 7 awesome benefits and I agree with ever one of them. Head and Shoulders 2 in 1 Moisture Care removes flakes, calms itching, relieves irritation, reduces redness, has a really great scent, fights dryness and leave your hair feeling moisturized and beautiful! I was very skeptic on whether a 2 in 1 would work on my hair but it worked wonderful!  I am totally in love with the scent and the benefits of this product! I have used this product about 5 times now and it has totally blown my expectations out of the water! This product has left my scalp and hair feeling moisturized and silky smooth. Look mom.... no flakes :)</li>
            <li> I received the Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care 2-in-1 Shampoo and Conditioner for free as a part of a BzzAgent campaign.  This product was great on my daughter&#x27;s and I 4C natural hair.  At first I was a bit skeptical because normally these type of shampoo/conditioner combos tend to strip my hair but I was pleasantly surprised.  The product lathered great and also left my hair feeling  moisturized! For those concerned with the ingredients, the product isn&#x27;t natural but it still did a great job.</li>
            <li> I received the Head &amp; Shoulder Moisture Care 2-in-1 as part of a promotion through BzzAgent.  My BzzKit included this product as well as two others from the Moisture Care Collection free of charge.  The first time I used this product I was very disappointed--it left my hair feeling dry.  I tried it a second time to give it fair shake and the results were a little better but not enough for me to spend my money on this product.  Now in all fairness, I have only used sulfate free shampoos on my hair over the past couple of years AND I have color-treated hair.  The lower half of my hair has blonde ends that were bleached over a year ago.  This may be a great product but I&#x27;m assuming that it does not do well with color treated hair.  I can say that there was no scalp itch after using this product.</li>
            <li> I should first probably start out by saying that I&#x27;ve used Head &amp; Shoulders products before in the past, and the results were never in my favor. The last time I used one of their shampoos is when I promised myself that I&#x27;d never do so again. But then I joined Bzzagent and I was invited to join this campaign, and really, who can say no to free stuff? I figured that if the products from this new line were just as disappointing as their predecessors, I could always just give them to my mom or sister, who just like me, can never say no to free things, especially when it&#x27;s hair-care or beauty involved. And as it turned out, I was right to not expect much from the products I received.  About 7 years ago, I was diagnosed with scalp psoriasis, a common skin disorder that causes itchy white flaky patches to appear at random intervals on my scalp. As anyone can imagine, it&#x27;s been hell to live with, and often interferes with my day-to-day life. One of the biggest burdens I carry related to the disorder, besides the constant itching and discomfort, is my on-going efforts to treat it. Using just any old shampoo, like most people, is not a luxury I&#x27;m afforded, because my scalp is easily irritated by even the mildest of soaps. However, since Head &amp; Shoulders has long been marketed as helping to alleviate the nuisance that is an itchy, flaky scalp, I figured that I&#x27;d give the Moisture Care shampoo a try, hoping that though H&amp;S has failed me in the past, this would be the exception/savior I&#x27;d been waiting for.  The first time I used the Moisture Care 2-in-1 shampoo, my scalp noticed immediately. But since the itch was minimal and and not as bad as I&#x27;d experienced in the past, I decided to give it another try (after all, a product should be used on multiple occasions to see any results). So two days later, I washed my hair the same as before, and prayed to god that I&#x27;d have at the most, one itch-less day; boy was I mistaken. No sooner than I&#x27;d stepped out of the shower and began toweling my hair off did a sensation not unfamiliar to a hundred ants biting my scalp begin to manifest on my entire head. From that moment, until almost the end of the next day, not 10 minutes went by where the need to aggressively scratch my scalp did not overtake me. Foolishly, in my desperation to make it stop, I reached for the Scalp Soother, which initially worked it&#x27;s magic, only to leave the itch even worse than ever before when it&#x27;s soothing effects wore off about 15 minutes later.  Needless to say, my sister has now been gifted with not 1, but 3, new hair care products that I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll find more useful than I ever could. That said, my pre-existing scalp condition probably has more to do with my awful experience with the Head &amp; Shoulder products than the products themselves. So if your scalp isn&#x27;t as sensitive and problematic as mine, I have no doubt that this product will probably work like a charm for you.</li>
            <li> I received the product free to try from Bzz Agent. I have natural kinky coily hair that needs moisture and this shampoo didn&#x27;t give my have that. This product does clean my hair extremely well from the shampoo part. But the 2 part which is the conditioner, my hair didn&#x27;t feel conditioned.</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the best products I have ever used my sons hair has never looked better.. Thanks to bzzagent I was able to try it for free and I have since bought bulk. #headandshoulders #texturedhair #bzzagent</li>
            <li> I received Head and Shoulders Moisture Care 2-in-1 to try and give my honest opinion. I was pleasantly surprised that a 2-in-1 shampoo could leave my hair so moisturized. I have a chemical straightener in my hair and I also use heat daily on it, so my hair gets really dry. Usually a 2-in-1 shampoo doesn&#x27;t provide enough moisture; however Head and Shoulders Moisture Care did! On top of that, it got rid of any dandruff. This is a product that I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I am a BzzAgent, so I got it for free. I loved it! I have very dry scalp and have been looking for something to help combat it and take care of my flakes. Growing up, my mother always said if your scalp is dry and flaky then you need to put grease on your hair. However, as an adult I do not like my hair being greasy nor does it work. I just ended up with greasy, flakey, itchy scalp. Thanks to Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care 2-in-1 my dry scalp issues have been solved. I actually used the entire system and was extremely impressed. After only one use, it took care of my flakes and soothed my itchy sore scalp. The only thing it left behind is a great scent that was not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> We have been using Head and Shoulders products pretty exclusively for my husband for years.  His hair is long and thick and he struggles with dandruff when we don&#x27;t use it.  Overall, this line of products has been helpful and the new Moisture Care 2-in-1 is the same.  It did the job of managing my husband dandruff, kept his hair from being too dry, and smells great!  Definitely a product we would recommend to someone else struggling with dry, itchy scalp and one we would use again in our home! I am so glad that I had the opportunity for my family to try this product from Bzz Agent!</li>
            <li> I received this product as a free trial for an honest and unbiased reviewâ€¦With Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care 2-in-1 Dandruff Shampoo Plus Conditioner my hair is looking very nice, feeling Clean and Healthy and well Moisturized. I really enjoy the subtle coconut scent. It smells so good not too perfumed just a lasting soft, light scent.  Just after the first shampoo and condition (nice lather!) my hair was left feeling clean, moisturized and healthy and smelling wonderful. This product is not heavy nor does it weigh down your hair, I had no flakes or dry patches and I have a  great shine . My hair felt silky and smooth! and my husband is loving it too!</li>
            <li> I received this product from Bzz Agent. I was excited to try because I have a small (albeit annoying) patch or psoriasis on my temple. Once a month or so I use coal tar shampoo to keep the patch from flaring up. I was excited to try this because it&#x27;s moisturizing unlike coal tar and it doesn&#x27;t have that medicinal smell. I have super curly hair so seeing that it&#x27;s for textured hair was a bonus. I really liked the shampoo, was moisturizing without being heavy and it rinsed well, almost like a clarifying shampoo. I would actually replace the coal tar with this. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to vouch for long term effectiveness. Also I&#x27;m not too sure what the difference is between this and the co-wash is.</li>
            <li> I was excited to join the Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Collection for 2 reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I have naturally thick, curly hair. My hair requires lots of moisture and care; which means I can&#x27;t use any type of hair care products. There are limited brands I stand behind and I am very critical with products and brands that &amp;#34;claim&amp;#34; to work for all hair types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I suffer from mild psoriasis of the scalp. Which means I suffer from scalp irritation, intense burning and a ridiculous need to scratch, which then produces flakes and then comes the scalp sores. I have been prescribed numerous expensive types of medicated oils, sprays, rubs and shampoos that never resolved the issue...only masked them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My review:&lt;br /&gt;I ABSOLUTELY love the 2 in 1 Moisture care and the Co-wash. I use it at least 2-3 times a week. It leaves my hair hydrated and clean. I haven&#x27;t seen a flake since I started using the product. More importantly, I have had no burning or intense itching. My curls are still healthy and bouncy and I have noticeable growth. I don&#x27;t need to use much of the product, as it spreads nicely.&lt;br /&gt;I tried the scalp soother twice, but have not needed to use it after the 3rd use of the 2 in 1. It was a little intense, almost like I dumped a bottle of peppermint oil on my scalp...it would have been useful before I tried the wash and co wash :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit skeptical, but now I am a believer in Head &amp; Shoulders! I intend to keep using the product and supporting the brand. I can&#x27;t explain how happy I am that I found a product that addresses all issues!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product and my hair loves it.  No more flakes, the product smells wonderful  and I would definitely recommend. So glad I got to try it for free part of a promotion , Thanks Head &amp; Shoulders.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this Bzz Campaign for Head and Shoulders Moisture care line. This  review is for Head and Shoulders Moisture Care 2 in 1. I got mine free from head and Shoulders courtesy of Bzz Agent. I have  thick African American hair that&#x27;s very hard to detangle on wash day and manage. I have never  really equated Head and Shoulders with moisture, much less, having anything to offer for textured hair. I have used Head and Shoulders in the past to control flaking and itching of my scalp, so I was very familiar with the brand. Packaging I like the packaging  as I could clearly see the product was meant for textured hair from the design on the bottle.  I also liked the coconuts pictured as it reminded me of moisture and the tropics. Other than that, the bottle was pretty standard. The product came out of the bottle fairly easily, which is good. Consistency  and feel: The Head and Shoulders 2 in 1  appeared to  be very creamy, I mean seriously creamy and rich. I thought for sure you couldn&#x27;t possibly need a conditioner after washing  with this shampoo.  The shampoo looked , and felt like it contained a lot of essential oils. The  product felt very good, very thick, but not so thick it couldn&#x27;t get out the bottle. It looked and felt like it would provide great slip to your hair to provide manageability.  The fragrance was very pleasing too. Performance I used the Head And Shoulders 2 in 1 Shampoo after wearing  my hair in braids for about three weeks. So at this point, my scalp is flaking and itching like crazy. While shampooing my hair, the shampoo produced lots of suds, which I loved. I usually dread washing my hair after braiding because it usually tangles horribly during the shampoo process. The Head and Shoulders  2 in 1 works really well for detangling.  My hair was easy to detangle, with the product still in and my comb easily went through my hair after rinsing as well. My scalp felt clean with no more  itching . I took points off this product because after allowing my hair to dry, it didn&#x27;t retain the moisture. I had to use a leave in conditioner to balance my hair and infuse moisture. I did&#x27;t use any other products with the 2 in 1 initially, because it seemed it would hold up well as a stand alone product. If my hair had retained moisture the Head and Shoulder 2 in 1 would have simplified my wash day routine. Impressions: While I loved the 2 in 1 shampoo, I think Head and Shoulders need to work on moisture retention. Textured hair is naturally dry and needs a product that can impart long lasting moisture. Maybe it works better on textured hair that has been processed. My hair is in a virgin state. I highly recommend though for controlling flakes and especially itching. This product is very beneficial if you suffer from dandruff or wear your hair in braids and weaves and go several days in between washing. I would purchase this product, but I would definitely follow with a conditioner, even though that would seemingly defeat the purpose of this product. All in all I still recommend even though I would use with additional moisturizing agents.</li>
            <li> Revived the product free from head &amp; shoulders. I have a big dandruff problem and I use normal head &amp; shoulders shampoo and conditioner regularly. I usually have less dandruff than with out the shampoo and conditioner but with this I had much less still have some though. But on the plus side I found that I scratch my head far less than with the regular shampoo and conditioner. I recommend this to anyone who wants less flakes and irritation.</li>
            <li> I received a full size bottle of this product from Head &amp;amp; Shoulders via BzzAgent. Unlike the Co-Wash, i really didn&#x27;t care for the 2-in-1 shampoo.  It has the same lovely smell as the co-wash, but the opposite effect. Being that it&#x27;s 2-in-1, I fully expected it to cleanse and moisturizer. However, instead leaving my hair feeling moisturized, it left my hair feeling very dry and stripped. As someone with natural kinky hair, i am constantly on a quest to find a good shampoo that can cleanse my hair without stripping it of it&#x27;s natural moisture. Unfortunately, this wasn&#x27;t it. In the future i probably won&#x27;t be purchasing this again, but i will be purchasing the co-wash.</li>
            <li> I GOT TO TRY THIS PRODUCT (BUZZAGENT)&lt;br /&gt;After one use I found that it makes my hair really rejuvenated. Where I LIVE ITS REALLY HOT and at work there is not really any ac its torture on me and my hair and this really brought it back to life. I have been looking for new products that actually help my hair and I feel I found it :)</li>
            <li> Enjoyed this product this morning. Doesn&#x27;t smell like medicine. Has a nice clean scent, and left my hair squeaky clean. I received this and 2 more products from bzzagent.com.</li>
            <li> Received this item from #bzzagent free to test. I tried the Moisture Care 2 in 1 and was pleasantly surprised by the mellow Coconut Smell. The 2 in 1 Moisture Care was great in getting rid of any dandruff and dry scalp. The 2 and 1 was much like a clarifying shampoo which also meant that it was drying for me. This is perfect when I will wash my hair to be straighten. I will however say that I would not use this product alone as I needed a separate conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this Moisture Care &amp;#34;2-in-1&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;CoWash&amp;#34; line, but they did more for my hair than my scalp. I #GotItFree and received no compensation for my opinion.  The Moisture Care &amp;#34;scalp soother&amp;#34; (spray) burns more if you use it after shampooing, because your scalp&#x27;s wet and you just massaged it. So, I use it on a dry scalp and each night before my next shampoo shampoo. I shampooed and conditioned twice a week and sprayed my scalp about every 48 hours.</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: I received this product for free to try out, but all opinions expressed are my own! I cannot begin to explain how much I love the smell of these products! I tried the Moisture Care 2-in1 and I must say, I love it! I really did see an improvement with dandruff. I was a bit nervous when I first saw that this was a shampoo/conditioner combo because usually they can be quite drying on my curly hair, but I was surprised to find that this was in fact not drying in any way. My husband and daughter also have a bit of dandruff so I will definitely be steering them in the direction of these. I cannot wait to give the other products I received a try as well! I expect that they will work just as well as the 2-in1, which might I add has a very soothing feel to the scalp!</li>
            <li> I received this through bzzagent for free, and I really enjoyed the product! It made my hair soft, and shiny. And manageable too. I definitely recommend this, as it is a trusted brand, and grows more all the time. Good job, head and shoulders!</li>
            <li> The system includes a moisturizing shampoo, a co-wash (conditioner wash), 2 in 1 shampoo + conditioner, and a scalp soother.  Of course my first action was to take a look at some of the ingredients.  The main ingredients include almond oil, coconut essence and zinc pyrthione (which is the active ingredient that fights dandruff). The Shampoo has this creamy consistency, and for my really highly textured hair, it worked out well. I was actually able to detangle slightly with the shampoo in my hair. I received a product sample, coupon, collateral or other special premium from BzzAgent or the brand.</li>
            <li> I think that as a shampoo/conditioner combination I would expect and hope that it would be able to clean my hair properly, remove any dirt build up and easily wash away. But this is not what happened.I wet my hair with warm hot water as I normally do then applied the 2-in-1 product in my hand and rubbed it in to my hair. I tried this method twice thinking that it would eventually foam up. But it didn&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day so I prefer to have something that actually removes dirt that has built up over time. This particular shampoo/conditioner may be good for someone who washes their hair everyday and doesn&#x27;t have much dirt or oils in their hair from constant washing. What I do like about this product though is that it smelled really good,(not too strong or perfumy) and seemed to make my hair really soft!</li>
            <li> This 2-in-1 was sent to me for free in order to review. A 2-in-1 is not at the top of my list when I go shopping for hair products but this works pretty well. It is perfect to use after a few days of working out in between the times where I wash, deep conditioner, etc. I really this new Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture care line, very happy I have had the opportunity to test these products out !</li>
            <li> I got this product for free in exchange for an honest review. Normally 2 in 1 products dry my hair out really bad but with head &amp; shoulders 2 in 1 that wasn&#x27;t the case. I had tried other products from this company before but all they did was dry my hair out so I&#x27;m glad they finally came out with a line of products for my specific type of hair. It didn&#x27;t smell medicated like that other products similar that I have tried and unlike other 2 in 1 products I was able to actually brush my hair while the product was in it. That never happens because it normally makes my hair too dry to the point when I attempt to brush it, it sounds like an apple crunching which to me is unpleasant. I&#x27;m planning on buying more of this product line for sure because it&#x27;s the only 2 in 1 that has worked for me. If you have stubborn hair that tangles very easily I would say to try this product out before giving up on 2 in 1 products.</li>
            <li> Love the new Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care products.  I have very dry, course, curly hair and I was really surprised how smooth and moisturizing it was! I received a free one in a promotional kit and love it!</li>
            <li> I received all three Head&amp;Shoulders Moisture Care products in a Bzz kit.  I am a Bzz agent and am participating in a campaign.  That said, my oldest daughter has had challenges with eczema on her scalp since she was a toddler.  At 12, the flaky scalp and itchies can obviously be a source of embarrassment for her.  I received my Head &amp; Shoulders kit in the mail right around the time it started getting hot here.  The heat coupled with her being in the pool for swim team four days a week has really wreaked havoc on her poor scalp.  As soon as the products arrived, my daughter and I were on the web looking at how they worked.  All I can say, is the transformation is MIRACULOUS!  She has been using the shampoo three times weekly, co-wash in between shampoos and scalp treatment at night.  We&#x27;ve had ZERO and I mean ZERO flakes and no itchiness whatsoever!  Thanks for great products we will be continuing to use from here on out, I&#x27;ve even added them to my replenishment service with Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve told my friends on our swim team about the products and gave them coupons after talking to them about their own daughters&#x27; hair and scalp issues.  They were all very eager to try the products and see the reults for themselves.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo for the price.  Smells great and has my hair looking and feeling healthier.</li>
            <li> I am a bzzagent and received this as a product to review. As a woman of AfroCaribbean decent, sometimes it&#x27;s hard to find products for my hair type. This is fantastic!! I&#x27;ve spent a lot more money on products that have similar claims, but this does the job! It&#x27;s also great that this is a 2-in-1: cleans and conditions. Two thumbs all the way up!</li>
            <li> I had my doubts about this shampoo because most companies always say something meanwhile the product does not live up to the hype. Consider me pleasantly surprised that not only had the Head and Shoulder Moisture care lived up to the information provided but my hair felt great. I honestly should not have been surprised since Head and Shoulders has always been the leader in the shampoo market for getting rid of flakes and having a healthy scalp</li>
            <li> Although my hair is originally textured, I perm it like 2 or 3 times a year I found this this 2 in 1 dandruff shampoo gentle to my hair while meeting my hair need. I got to try this shampoo free as part of a promotion from the brand and I am pleased with the result. Not only does it leave my scalp shinny, it locks in moisture in the hair too. This shampoo is formulated with vitamin E-rich almond oil and coconut essence which are essential ingredients needed for a deeply hydrated, flake-free* hair and scalp. The shampoo + conditioner (which saves water ) fights dry scalp and calms itchy scalp leaves hair looking beautiful. It is mildly scented which is a plus for me.</li>
            <li> I loved this product!  I recently received a free sample of this and I was pleasantly surprised.  I have chemically relaxed hair and I felt this shampoo and conditioner (along with the scalp soother) works just as well as my salon products.  You must try it - you will not be disappointed.  This left my hair feeling soft yet not weighed down.  And they smell great!</li>
            <li> received my head and shoulders shampoo, conditioner, and strengthening product from head and shoulders. This stuff smells great! I could still smell it the entire next day. My hair felt soft and smooth and very manageable after the first use. My scalp felt amazing! No itchy scalp and no flakes! My hair gets very dry in the summer and this did an amazing job for me. The strengthening treatment makes your scalp feel so clean and refreshed. I am extremely happy with the product..my only small complaint is the shape of the bottle...it tends to fall over a lot but this would not keep me from purchasing in the future. Great job Head and shoulders! I love it!!</li>
            <li> When I got this Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care 2-in 1 Shampoo/Conditioner, I was very skeptical about it working on my extremely kinky and unruly hair. After just washing my hair with the shampoo, I was surprised to see how soft and less tangled my hair got. After 5 days of 1 wash with this shampoo, I had absolutely no dandruff on my scalp. (btw, my hair gets really dry if its washed too much, so I wash my hair once a week. ) I am very pleased with this product and would recommend to anyone with any hair type :)</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product!!</li>
            <li> I got a chance to try the  new Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Collection for free form Head &amp; Shoulders and I loved it.  I really liked the creamy formula of the 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioner. My hair seems to always be dry and this really helped improve my hair.</li>
            <li> I have naturally thick and wavy hair.  I have been transitioning my hair from been relaxed to natural for two years now.  I have a collection of shampoo.  Usually I have and issue with keep my hair moist, especially in the heat.  After receiving this as a promotion from Head and Shoulders for being a BzzAgent.  I did not know what to expect. I love every bit of it. I have been using this for the past two months.  It keeps my hair nice and moist. I am all about convince.  I love the fact that it is a two in one so I can shorting my time of washing my hair.  My mother has issues with dry scalp and I use it in her hair and now she has relief.  Thank you Head and Shoulders and Bzz Agent.  I finally have a product I can continue to use with ease.</li>
