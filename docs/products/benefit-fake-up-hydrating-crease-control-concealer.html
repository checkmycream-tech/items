            <li>Good concealer</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t cover as good as I like</li>
            <li>Too greasy and the concealer doesn&#x27;t provide good coverage</li>
            <li>good color match</li>
            <li>I tend to break out with many cosmetics but this has been wonderful and goes on easily.</li>
            <li>Works beautifully and you don&#x27;t have to use much of it to see a beautiful difference</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>This is amazing and doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li>absolutely amazing product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind of on the fence for this one.</li>
            <li>but it does go on nice.</li>
            <li>The moisturizing is nice too.</li>
            <li>I love this concealer because it&#x27;s creamy, blends in perfectly, and gives me just the right amount of coverage.</li>
            <li>Amazing love this product</li>
            <li>I use this product for a couple of years now and still love the coverage and that it also has skin care all in one.</li>
            <li>Really love this product.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>and I love how moisturizing it is.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>JUST MAKE SURE YOU MATCH THE SKIN TONE OF YOUR FACE...</li>
            <li>I AM SURE</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this for under eye circles.</li>
            <li>buy it with confidence that you will love it.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t found anything better.</li>
            <li>so I still add concealer on top of the product.</li>
            <li>A really lovely product.</li>
            <li>Even if I apply it more than three times, it still doesn&#x27;t do the job</li>
            <li>Looks great and very natural.</li>
            <li>IF YOU TAN EASILY</li>
            <li>I received my first one as a gift and have gone on to buy another one because I liked it so</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easier to opt for medium over light if you&#x27;re unsure.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products &amp; this one is by far the best concealer for dark circles under your eyes.</li>
            <li>I think is much better and worth the money, this was kind of pricey for what it can actually do.</li>
            <li>Usually I pay around $23 , so it was a very good deal</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, and really covers nicely and naturally.</li>
            <li>THIS CONCEALER IS REALLY GREAT FOR SUMMER WHEN YOU NEED LESS MAKE UP</li>
            <li>Its creamy and easily apply but have to use more for the coverage prepare to spend more $ because the amount it comes in in compare to the price, not worthy.</li>
            <li>Plus, I love that it is full of good ingredients for the delicate eye area.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t crease and you can moisturize as you apply it, since it has moisture built right in.</li>
            <li>I definitely am glad I tried this new product, and will be back for more, though this stick is a good size and should last a long time! :)</li>
            <li>First using this product</li>
            <li>does a good job not sure its worth 20.00 ..</li>
            <li>It really does work!</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product because most other concealers are too drying for my taste.  </li>
            <li>If you have dry areas under or around your eyes maybe it would work better.</li>
            <li>my eyes tend to be extremely dry and this works like magic.</li>
            <li>the concealer just makes it dry and more noticeable</li>
            <li>recommend it very highly.</li>
            <li>The moisturizing balm works very well.</li>
            <li>I will keep purchasing this from an amazon until the price goes too high!</li>
            <li>Blends very well.</li>
            <li>It is very oily and make up cakes  under my eyes.</li>
            <li>Very greasy.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and stays on fairly long if you put some powder over it.</li>
            <li>A favorite concealer of mine, allows for less cake-y concealer over zits.</li>
            <li>The product is mainly to be used for under the eyes</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Perfect for my dry skin and the delicate skin under the eyes!!</li>
            <li>i&#x27;d say skip out and find something a little more pigmented that will actually brighten up your pretty eyes and not make you look like a very oily and sweaty eyed person.</li>
            <li>and I have light dark circles.  </li>
            <li>It was a little too greasy for me to use as under eye concealer as recommended but as a regular concealer I love it.</li>
            <li>but i like putting it on top of other concealer when it becomes too dry.  </li>
            <li>I have dark circles and this is the first concealer I have found that really works.</li>
            <li>an Asian it really fits me</li>
            <li>Have had dark circles my whole life and this product really covers and smooths the darkness over.</li>
            <li>Easy to carry and just takes a little, to cover a long way.</li>
            <li>I HAVE HAD TO HAVE 2 FOUNDATION TYPES SINCE I WAS OLD ENOUGH TO WEAR MAKE UP.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, too, so the price is not bad.</li>
            <li>It does not dry out your skin...</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing, but it doesn&#x27;t conceal the dark circles I have around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I have thin skin under my eyes and while it doesn&#x27;t completely eradicate the veins it definitely makes them less prominent -</li>

            <li> Doesn&#x27;t come on dry.  </li>
            <li> much.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for under-eye concealment if you have dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes when I have a pimple or a dry patch</li>
            <li> but the coverage was not what I expected - BOING from Benefit</li>
            <li> The hydrating ring is perfect​ for helping under my eyes as well as covering the dark circles.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference in dark shadows under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dark circles under my eyes..</li>
            <li> It creases a little under eyes if it isn&#x27;t blended well -</li>
            <li> (i know why, that was a rhetorical question because it makes little sense to my why you&#x27;d wrap the concealer in a clearish chapstick like product for hydration?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;little</li>
            <li> Mine was a little melted when I got it, but still usable.</li>
            <li> I am not very pleased with this concealer.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love fake up!!!</li>
            <li> Provides very little coverage.</li>
            <li> This one works without the usual accumulation in skin creases.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I will buy this again</li>
            <li> The cover is not great</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t hate it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is amazing and doesn&#x27;t break me out. I tend to break out with many cosmetics but this has been wonderful and goes on easily. Coverage is very good - I have thin skin under my eyes and while it doesn&#x27;t completely eradicate the veins it definitely makes them less prominent - and it doesn&#x27;t look dry or caked on.</li>
            <li> I use this product for a couple of years now and still love the coverage and that it also has skin care all in one. Usually I pay around $23 , so it was a very good deal</li>
            <li> Really love this product.</li>
            <li> Great quality concealer.</li>
            <li> Best concealer ever!  no lines, no irritation and perfect match..  Love it.</li>
            <li> Benefit does it again. Works beautifully and you don&#x27;t have to use much of it to see a beautiful difference</li>
            <li> This is the best concealer.  Doesn&#x27;t come on dry.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Great product and great price.  I received my first one as a gift and have gone on to buy another one because I liked it so much.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for under-eye concealment if you have dry skin.  The moisturizing balm works very well.</li>
            <li> I think this is great I love it I will keep purchasing this from an amazon until the price goes too high!</li>
            <li> really good stuff，as an Asian it really fits me will</li>
            <li> Excellent product, great consistency. The built-in cream surrounding the color concealer makes a big difference in applying the product. I&#x27;ve used it for 2-3 years and I always come back.</li>
            <li> This one works without the usual accumulation in skin creases.  Best ever.</li>
            <li> It covers well but I feel it&#x27;s a bit greasy under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Amazing! A must have for the make up bag. Good concealer and I love how moisturizing it is. Looks great and very natural.</li>
            <li> The hydrating ring is perfect​ for helping under my eyes as well as covering the dark circles. I have been using this for years!</li>
            <li> I have dark circles and this is the first concealer I have found that really works. It does not dry out your skin...it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay but the coverage was not what I expected - BOING from Benefit I think is much better and worth the money, this was kind of pricey for what it can actually do. It works but it doesn&#x27;t work as well as you might expect for the price...</li>
            <li> Amazing love this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of on the fence for this one. I like it but it doesn&#x27;t cover as good as I like and I notice my eyes water all day like it melts in my eyes. Not sure if I will buy this again but I don&#x27;t hate it. It&#x27;s not the best cover but it does go on nice. I might just look for something else though.</li>
            <li> If I could only use 1 makeup item - it would be this. Mazing! You can use it under makeup, over make up, reapply throughout the day. Doesn&#x27;t crease. Blends very well.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful under eye circle product. Primer inside it.  Great value on here!</li>
            <li> Do not like at all. Ii bought because of magazine recommendation.  It is very oily and make up cakes  under my eyes. I don&#x27;t see any difference in dark shadows under my eyes. I would not purchase a again. If you have dry areas under or around your eyes maybe it would work better. Maybe?</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this product. Too greasy and the concealer doesn&#x27;t provide good coverage</li>
            <li> JUST MAKE SURE YOU MATCH THE SKIN TONE OF YOUR FACE...MINE MATCHED WHEN I GOT IT, BUT DOES NOT MATCH WHEN I GET TAN IN THE SUMMER.  I AM SURE IT WILL AGAIN WHEN MY TAN FADES COME FALL...OF COURSE IF YOU TAN EASILY YOU HAVE SUMMER AND WINTER FOUNDATIONS.  I HAVE HAD TO HAVE 2 FOUNDATION TYPES SINCE I WAS OLD ENOUGH TO WEAR MAKE UP. THIS CONCEALER IS REALLY GREAT FOR SUMMER WHEN YOU NEED LESS MAKE UP AND ONLY WANT TO BLEND IN ANY FLAWS IN YOUR COMPLEXION...SO THE DARKER COLOR FOR SUMMER CAN BE USED ALONE.</li>
            <li> Great as a coverup and concealer. It doesn&#x27;t crease and you can moisturize as you apply it, since it has moisture built right in. Easy to carry and just takes a little, to cover a long way. Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this for under eye circles.</li>
            <li> absolutely amazing product. recommend it very highly. ordered another so that if i wouldn&#x27;t be w/o it. buy it with confidence that you will love it.</li>
            <li> Great addition to all makeup kits.  It&#x27;s a must</li>
            <li> Works on my eyes great. Cover all my imperfections. Have like a moisturizer lov it..  First using this product and I lov it.</li>
            <li> Its creamy and easily apply but have to use more for the coverage prepare to spend more $ because the amount it comes in in compare to the price, not worthy.</li>
            <li> Love the product. Have had dark circles my whole life and this product really covers and smooths the darkness over. The moisturizing is nice too. Gives it a youthful look.  Love it. Haven&#x27;t found anything better.</li>
            <li> For my daughter... She loves it and it works the best for her!</li>
            <li> A favorite concealer of mine, allows for less cake-y concealer over zits. It creases a little under eyes if it isn&#x27;t blended well - but otherwise it&#x27;s one of the best I&#x27;ve ever had when it comes to concealer. It&#x27;s easier to opt for medium over light if you&#x27;re unsure.</li>
            <li> I have been waiting for this to come out!! It&#x27;s Perfect for my dry skin and the delicate skin under the eyes!!</li>
            <li> This is really a great concealer. It goes on smoothly, and really covers nicely and naturally. Plus, I love that it is full of good ingredients for the delicate eye area. I definitely am glad I tried this new product, and will be back for more, though this stick is a good size and should last a long time! :)</li>
            <li> Always a good product!</li>
            <li> Awesome under eye concealer!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! my eyes tend to be extremely dry and this works like magic. The cover is not great so I still add concealer on top of the product.</li>
            <li> eh. why is there like a lipbalm surrounding the product? (i know why, that was a rhetorical question because it makes little sense to my why you&#x27;d wrap the concealer in a clearish chapstick like product for hydration?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;little to no coverage. kinda greasy. i&#x27;d say skip out and find something a little more pigmented that will actually brighten up your pretty eyes and not make you look like a very oily and sweaty eyed person.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t stay all day, is very oily and messy, just didn&#x27;t cover the way i wanted it to.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dark circles under my eyes..does a good job not sure its worth 20.00 ..good color match</li>
            <li> It really does work! I have tried so many products &amp; this one is by far the best concealer for dark circles under your eyes. A little goes a long way, too, so the price is not bad. If you are ordering this during warm months, watch for it in your mailbox! Mine was a little melted when I got it, but still usable.</li>
            <li> I love this concealer because it&#x27;s creamy, blends in perfectly, and gives me just the right amount of coverage. A really lovely product. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Great makeup tool to keep in your purse for when you have the haggard look.  Goes on smooth and stays on fairly long if you put some powder over it.</li>
            <li> Best concealer on the market blends well</li>
            <li> The best product for under eye circles!!! I absolutely love fake up!!!</li>
            <li> Provides very little coverage. Very greasy.</li>
            <li> I am not very pleased with this concealer.  It is very moisturizing, but it doesn&#x27;t conceal the dark circles I have around my eyes.  Even if I apply it more than three times, it still doesn&#x27;t do the job and I have light dark circles.  I am not a fan of this product.  I would not recommend buying this product.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product because most other concealers are too drying for my taste.  The product is mainly to be used for under the eyes but i like putting it on top of other concealer when it becomes too dry.  Sometimes when I have a pimple or a dry patch the concealer just makes it dry and more noticeable but this product is great because it gives coverage and hydration.  It was a little too greasy for me to use as under eye concealer as recommended but as a regular concealer I love it.</li>
