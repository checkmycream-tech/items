            <li>This awesome product.</li>
            <li>A wonderful gift.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!!</li>
            <li>Very good product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so incredibly thankful.</li>
            <li>My wife loved it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a truly beautiful thing.</li>
            <li>Great quality</li>
            <li>I love using it...and it makes your skin feel wonderful.</li>
            <li>good to buy for yourself or someone else.</li>
            <li>so* good and is so relaxing.</li>
            <li>This smells so good.</li>
            <li>Well, upon recommendation of a good friend, I gave this a try</li>
            <li>You need to mix it up really good before you scoop out a good handful of the sugar and the oil and then use circular motions to rub it into and exfoliate the skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s because of the incredible scent and aroma which will leave you feeling like you&#x27;re in a fine spa.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, great for feeling relaxed in shower.</li>
            <li>Love it tho!</li>
            <li>Love it makes me feel invigorated !</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and makes you feel like a baby&#x27;s bottom</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>smells amazing so realizing I feel like I am in a Vegas Spa when I use this.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love it!  </li>
            <li>and I love the lingering smell of spearmint and eucalyptus.</li>
            <li>&#x27;Scrubbies&#x27; are the size of sea salt but feel fantastic!</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love, love this aromatherapy sugar...</li>
            <li>I just love this body scrub.</li>
            <li>and I am so glad</li>
            <li>/&gt;But the reason I recommend this the most?</li>
            <li>I steam up my shower and as soon as I open the jar, I get that wonderful relaxing spa sensation.</li>
            <li>I love using this in the shower, and I use the lotion afterward too.</li>
            <li>Short of that, it&#x27;s a wonderful fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Stress relief is most definitely an accurate label for this.</li>
            <li>It is strong, and if you don&#x27;t do well with mint products, like peppermint or spearmint, this might &#x27;burn&#x27; your skin, but I&#x27;m a fair skinned red-head, and I have sensitive skin, and this hasn&#x27;t ever bothered me.</li>
            <li>Very soothing when added to your warm bath water..</li>
            <li>However Amazon sells it for $24 which is over-price even with no tax and free shipping.</li>
            <li>Plus if you can score coupon codes on-line or print (which they have quite often) has free shipping and free gift too.</li>
            <li>Great for winter, helps with dry winter skin.  </li>
            <li>It works great on elbows and knees and rough patches of skin.</li>
            <li>I had never used a sugar scrub before although I had heard such good things about them.</li>
            <li>This one in particular smells fantastic and is so calming and soothing!</li>
            <li>(I highly recommend Slip Doctors non-slip spray, see my review for more information.)</li>
            <li>Not only does this sugar scrub feel insanely wonderful on your body, but it&#x27;s also fantastic for your mental health.</li>
            <li>Do no use this in the shower or bath tub, unless you clean it up first.  </li>
            <li>It is so calming and fresh smelling.</li>
            <li>Invigorating and wakes you right up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You just scoop out a bit of the crystals (soaked in the oil) on your fingers and start rubbing them into your skin and see it exfoliate and plump the skin right up.</li>
            <li>love sugar scrubs, more than salt scrubs, because they don&#x27;t feel as harsh.</li>
            <li>Leaves shower floor VERY slippery!</li>
            <li>but I find I only need to use it once or twice a week at most.</li>
            <li>This product is great especially for dry climates or sandal season!  </li>
            <li>This sugar scrub has made showers a positive experience for me</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin super soft.</li>
            <li>It makes me think of a man fresh from the shower, like Irish Spring soap with a kick... the way it feels on my skin is slightly tingly and exhilarating, but with a scent that calms and soothes frazzled nerves.</li>
            <li>Very relaxing and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I had never used a sugar scrub before and now that I have, my life is absolutely changed.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>The oils and sugar work really well together.  </li>
            <li>You would want, of course, to keep it away from intimate body parts, because the likelihood of burning would exist.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these aromatherapy body scrubs!</li>
            <li>Product is exactly what is says it is and was worth the money -- I would definitely purchase from the vendor again!</li>
            <li>product itself feels really oily, so you want to be super careful in the shower.</li>
            <li>so I won&#x27;t slip but the oil residue seems to wash down easily.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin soft</li>
            <li>the eucalyptus spearmint is energizing and the oil makes your skin really soft.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cheaper to get it directly from the source.</li>
            <li>I do not use every day, but skin is soft after each use.</li>
            <li>I use it on a thin 2-in-1 loofa body buff (since the sugar/oil get lost in a typical shower puff), and my skin is soft and amazing.</li>
            <li>It is is soft scrub and yet leave behind a smooth finish on your skin.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long because every shower is like a spa treatment (including the relaxing scent left behind) and it takes a lot to cover the body.</li>
            <li> This body scrub turns your shower into a little piece of Heaven.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t imagine how other delicate places might feel.</li>
            <li> it will be slick.</li>
            <li> It leaves a thin, thin sheen of oil on your skin, so you can smell it and feel it for hours after a bath or shower.</li>
            <li> As somebody who suffers form anxiety, taking showers can be a bit difficult.</li>

            <li> Adore this body scrub. Very relaxing and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Leaves shower floor VERY slippery!</li>
            <li> I use this on my hands. It makes my skin soft and I love the lingering smell of spearmint and eucalyptus. good to buy for yourself or someone else.</li>
            <li> The scent is HEAVENLY! I use it on a thin 2-in-1 loofa body buff (since the sugar/oil get lost in a typical shower puff), and my skin is soft and amazing. The essential oils add aromatherapy for a luxurious touch. Be careful in the shower if you don&#x27;t already have a non-skid surface as it can get quite slippery. (I highly recommend Slip Doctors non-slip spray, see my review for more information.)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too oily for me.  Do no use this in the shower or bath tub, unless you clean it up first.  It is slippery!</li>
            <li> &#x27;Scrubbies&#x27; are the size of sea salt but feel fantastic! Doesn&#x27;t last long because every shower is like a spa treatment (including the relaxing scent left behind) and it takes a lot to cover the body. Love it tho!</li>
            <li> This body scrub turns your shower into a little piece of Heaven. I adore this stuff. I had never used a sugar scrub before and now that I have, my life is absolutely changed. Not only does this sugar scrub feel insanely wonderful on your body, but it&#x27;s also fantastic for your mental health. As somebody who suffers form anxiety, taking showers can be a bit difficult. Under the water, you tend to have a lot of time to think about a lot of things. This sugar scrub has made showers a positive experience for me and I&#x27;m so incredibly thankful. Stress relief is most definitely an accurate label for this. Once you start washing yourself, you can take a deep breath and the aroma will melt away your worries. It&#x27;s a truly beautiful thing.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Love it.</li>
            <li> Love, love this aromatherapy sugar...the eucalyptus spearmint is energizing and the oil makes your skin really soft. Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This awesome product. Shipped to me immediately.Very soothing when added to your warm bath water..Love it makes me feel invigorated !</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorites that I ask for at Christmas.  Love, love, love it!  Take caution getting out of tub.....it will be slick.</li>
            <li> This product is great especially for dry climates or sandal season!  It is is soft scrub and yet leave behind a smooth finish on your skin.  I do pay attention in the shower so I won&#x27;t slip but the oil residue seems to wash down easily.  I think the shower basin like it too!  I would give it 10 stars if possible!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!! Smells amazing and makes you feel like a baby&#x27;s bottom</li>
            <li> This sugar scrub smells *so* good and is so relaxing. It leaves my skin super soft. It leaves a thin, thin sheen of oil on your skin, so you can smell it and feel it for hours after a bath or shower.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. Invigorating and wakes you right up. However Amazon sells it for $24 which is over-price even with no tax and free shipping. Its only $16 at Bath and body work on-line and in store. Even with tax it&#x27;s cheaper to get it directly from the source. Plus if you can score coupon codes on-line or print (which they have quite often) has free shipping and free gift too.</li>
            <li> Product is exactly what is says it is and was worth the money -- I would definitely purchase from the vendor again!</li>
            <li> This smells so good. I love using it...and it makes your skin feel wonderful. I will definitely have to order this again.</li>

            <li> smells amazing so realizing I feel like I am in a Vegas Spa when I use this.  The oils and sugar work really well together.  Great quality</li>
            <li> I just love this body scrub. I had never used a sugar scrub before although I had heard such good things about them.

Instant gratification!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the reason I recommend this the most? It&#x27;s because of the incredible scent and aroma which will leave you feeling like you&#x27;re in a fine spa. I steam up my shower and as soon as I open the jar, I get that wonderful relaxing spa sensation. There&#x27;s just something about the combination of eucalyptus and spearmint - it&#x27;s the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s on the pricey side,  but I find I only need to use it once or twice a week at most. This one tub can last me months and months.</li>
            <li> A wonderful gift. My wife loved it!</li>

You would want, of course, to keep it away from intimate body parts, because the likelihood of burning would exist. I got some in my eyes once, and regretted that, so I can&#x27;t imagine how other delicate places might feel. Short of that, it&#x27;s a wonderful fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself feels really oily, so you want to be super careful in the shower.
