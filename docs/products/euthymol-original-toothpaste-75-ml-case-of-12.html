            <li>My theory is that if you enjoy the experience you&#x27;ll brush more often.</li>
            <li>An alkaline state is good for your mouth, as it is acidity which produces much tooth decay, but I don&#x27;t know about my comfort level with using lye</li>

            <li>Superior to American toothpastes and worth the price.</li>
            <li>Wikipedia&#x27;s article on sodium silicate will make your head spin with the number of industrial uses it has (including Magic Rocks and setting dyes requiring a high pH).  </li>

            <li>It is very minty which I like very much.</li>
            <li>The name is a twist on thymol, which is an extract from the herb thyme which offers this special cleansing.  </li>
            <li>--it is so strong, my mouth burns for about ten minutes after use.  </li>
            <li>It certainly has a bygone generation appeal to it.</li>

            <li>began using this product this week, and I will come back and update this after some more regular use.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy this product because of the fresh feeling that last a long time.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not seeing thymol or essential oils labelled clearly here, and I rather doubt sodium lauryl sulfate was in the original recipe.  </li>
            <li>A new experience</li>
            <li>It burns and is pretty gross tasting</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t notice that much difference, as compared to regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li>It is a creamy pink paste with a fresh wintergreen flavour (somewhat Pepto-ish but way tastier).</li>
            <li>This pink paste is strong (not offensively so) and tastes a lot like a pink Canada mint (which I adore).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>A small but important indulgence of mine.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the best toothpaste is hard to get.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to get out of the spearmint toothpaste rut, here&#x27;s your ticket.  This pink paste is strong (not offensively so) and tastes a lot like a pink Canada mint (which I adore).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began using this product this week, and I will come back and update this after some more regular use.  For now, I want to add that I was attracted to this toothpaste for its \\&quot;anticeptic qualities\\&quot;.  The name is a twist on thymol, which is an extract from the herb thyme which offers this special cleansing.  Indeed, the tube itself touts the product as \\&quot;a scientific dental preparation\\&quot; and claims it has \\&quot;a special blend of antiseptic ingredients and essential oils to help keep your teeth and gums clean and healthy.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which sounds great, but... the ingredients listed are : Dicalcium phosphate, aqua, sorbitol, glycerin, aroma, sodium lauryl sulfate, titanium dioxide, sodium silicate, carrageenan, cellulose gum, sodium saccherine, simethicone, CI45430, +/- sodium hydroxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m no chemist, but I&#x27;m not seeing thymol or essential oils labelled clearly here, and I rather doubt sodium lauryl sulfate was in the original recipe.  If a commenter would direct me, I&#x27;d be glad for the info about thymol or the oils in this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did look up dicalcium phosphate (an anti-tartar ingredient) and titanium dioxide (white powder found to produce genetic damage in mice, and also considered possibly carcinogenic to humans per the IARC).  Wikipedia&#x27;s article on sodium silicate will make your head spin with the number of industrial uses it has (including Magic Rocks and setting dyes requiring a high pH).  Carrageenan keeps the ingredients from separating.  Cellulose gum is a thickener.  Simethicone (which you may recall from gas and bloating aid ads) reduces gas in the tummy, but is also an anti-foaming agent.  No clue what CI45430 is.  Sodium hydroxide (also known as lye) is used most in the chemical and paper/pulp industries, and induces alkalinity.  An alkaline state is good for your mouth, as it is acidity which produces much tooth decay, but I don&#x27;t know about my comfort level with using lye regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll finish the tube and see if there&#x27;s anything outstanding about its performance, but if not, I will probably walk away from this toothpaste, being unable to see the anticeptic qualities, or the thymol, and being uneasy about the ingredients.</li>
            <li> If you like wintergreen, and my husband does, then this is the stuff for you.  It&#x27;s either grotesque or fantastic depending on where you stand on wintergreen.</li>
            <li> Love the product and the packaging! The toothpaste is a wake me up flavor with a nice foaminess. A small but important indulgence of mine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as spicy or strong as the reviews made it seem...I haven&#x27;t seen any real results yet, but I&#x27;m enjoying it. Delivery was quick and hassle-free.</li>
            <li> I first stumbled across this great toothpaste in a small chemist in County Slane Ireland. Because I cannot use floride toothpaste without running the risk of painful mouth ulcers I was instantly drawn to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not believe they could have changed the packaging in fifty some odd years. It certainly has a bygone generation appeal to it. The taste and colour are very similar to Pepto-Bismo for those of you in the states. This is not a bad thing in my opinion, as pepsin has been a popular flavoring agent since the dawn of chewing gum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothpaste is very effective, and with its strong antiseptic qualities can even replace your bottle of Listerine. Unfortunately this product cannot be obtained in the United States except through import shops, however we are very fortunate in that Amazon is home to several of those shops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot imagine a scenario in which I could obtain this toothpaste but would voluntarily choose something else.</li>
            <li> The best toothpaste I ever used, it tastes like pink valentine candy hearts, and keep your breath super fresh and it also whitens drastically! Toothpaste where have you been all my life *sob*</li>
            <li> One&#x27;s gotta love the strong and unique taste!  After all the boring taste they offer you in  the drug store, this is a relief!</li>
            <li> a must buy keeps my teeth very white.</li>
            <li> This tasty toothpaste arrived promptly.  I decided to order this because it was reviewed in a current magazine.  It has a strong pleasant minty taste.</li>
            <li> Fast service, great toothpaste</li>
            <li> Unique flavor and leaves teeth and gums feeling great.  Seems to be gentle on the teeth -- no sensitivity to cold or heat after brushing.  A little bit of toothpaste goes a long way -- lots of &amp;#34;lather&amp;#34;.  A new experience but would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This stuff tasted like a cross between Pepto Bismal/Mint/Molten Lava. But in the best possible way. The tube and box also look awesome on your shelf.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the best toothpaste is hard to get. There was a brief window where Amazon had a quantity at a good price. Bring it back.</li>
            <li> Very  Refreshing!  It&#x27;s like a toothpaste and mouthwash in one. My entire family enjoyed this toothpaste</li>
            <li> This is the most stylish toothpaste to have in your medicine cabinet. It has a simple but attractive art nouveau design on a metal tube. It is a creamy pink paste with a fresh wintergreen flavour (somewhat Pepto-ish but way tastier). I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Not fluoride, but I otherwise like it,,, it contains thymol, hence the name, which is an anti-microbial/fungal agent.  I like the taste of it but I&#x27;m not sure everyone will</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste it taste like candy and its pink! Expensive so I haven&#x27;t purchased more, if I could find it locally I would!</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste so much. It has such a unique taste and I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the tube and saw it was pink. I&#x27;ve also noticed improvement in the health of my gums since I&#x27;ve started using this. Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> My sister introduced me to this product, as she lives in London.  Arrived about one week faster than seller estimated. Pleasant surprise! Love this toothpaste. My teeth feel more polished when I use it.</li>
            <li> Superior to American toothpastes and worth the price. Its bright wintergreen taste is a great way to start the morning.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product because of the fresh feeling that last a long time. It is very minty which I like very much.</li>
            <li> Really nice flavored toothpaste.  My theory is that if you enjoy the experience you&#x27;ll brush more often. A win-win.</li>
            <li> The taste wasn&#x27;t bad &amp; so far I love the results. Don&#x27;t use too much of it because it burn your lips.</li>
            <li> I can see why it&#x27;s a cult favorite but I wouldn&#x27;t re-order it.  The taste isn&#x27;t awful but I have to use it sparingly--it is so strong, my mouth burns for about ten minutes after use.  I have never gotten used to the flavor in the 3 months I have used Euthymol.  The plus side of that is that because you have to use so little of the toothpaste that the tube will last you for-ev-var.  It lasts so long that you can expect to pass it down to your children as a family heirloom.</li>
            <li> The metal tube starts to open a bit on the sides, causing product to leak out during use. Didn&#x27;t notice that much difference, as compared to regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Great flavor &amp; color!</li>
            <li> It burns and is pretty gross tasting</li>
            <li> Four stars to start out....order placed on the 2nd of December and received from the UK by Royal Post here in the States on the 12th. That was great service. I read reviews previous to ordering that mentioned it was like Pepto-Bismol and it does in deed have a similar look but, flavor wise for those of us who have been around a while, the taste is just like that of Beeman&#x27;s Gum which I remember from back in the 60&#x27;s. I am an avid ice tea drinker so time will tell how it performs. Made In UK.</li>
