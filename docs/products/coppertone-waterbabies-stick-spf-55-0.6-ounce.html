            <li>Love this sunblock for my babies&#x27; face!</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use and provides great coverage on faces, scalps and ears.  </li>
            <li>I even use it on my own face when we&#x27;re out and about.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got a wiggly toddler and thought this would be good to use on her, but she&#x27;s still too squirmy to make sure I get her all covered.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and good.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, portable, and within TSA regulations!</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>A favorite stick to use for my kidos.</li>
            <li>sure you&#x27;ve got everything covered.</li>
            <li>One of my daughters likes holding the stick also, so that makes her more comfortable with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>easy to apply.</li>
            <li>So easy to use</li>
            <li>This little tube is the perfect size for on the go.  </li>
            <li>Putting on sunscreen on 2-3 year olds is a very much of a challenge, and on their faces, even more so.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to use it, which is very soon :)</li>
            <li>It glides on smoothly, but you have to really go over the area and maje</li>
            <li>I have a 9 year old with very sensitive face skin and this is the only product that he&#x27;s happy to use.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the protection of this product, but it&#x27;s a little greasy and not as easy to apply as I had imagined</li>
            <li>Nice to have and pretty convenient on the go, but I think I&#x27;ll stick to the lotion next time mostly because the Water Babies lotion feels lighter and less greasy on my face.</li>
            <li>It applies easy and doesn&#x27;t melt in the heat if the bag is left in the car.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use outside.</li>
            <li>really like this product and would really recommend it to anyone who needs to protect their baby&#x27;s skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different brands of pure/organic/made for sensitive skin, and they all cause him to break out in rashes.  </li>
            <li>Getting sunscreen on the face of a moving toddler or baby is never fun, but this makes it easy!</li>
            <li>Too many other choices out there to risk it for me.</li>
            <li>Make sure you buy a few to keep in all your bags.</li>
            <li>(and I live in Texas).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This stick really helps with this as your hands are not all gobbed up with lotion, trying to spread it on someone&#x27;s face, only for them to twist and turn and get it in their eyes.  </li>
            <li>My toddler has sensitive skin, he breaks out from just about every kids sunscreen out</li>
            <li>The price was also considerably lower on Amazon than in stores.  </li>
            <li>It can be hard to find these in our local stores and the price is comparable on Amazon, I&#x27;m glad to have found them here.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t use it for arms/legs/etc because it&#x27;s too small for larger areas and less cost effective, but lotions work well for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stick is very convenient for putting on little ones faces.  </li>

            <li> We only use it on our faces and ears, I think it&#x27;s much too small for the rest of the body, but in a pinch I think it could work.</li>
            <li> anticipated the tube not lasting very long, but it lasts quite a while with a toddler.</li>
            <li> I have tried other generic brands but keep going back to the Coppertone stick as it doesn&#x27;t cause irritation to the eyes and stays in place even in the water.</li>
            <li> so it takes a few extra strokes to cover the entire area</li>
            <li> Previously I would purchase other brands in which case they were greasy or left the white residue around the face but not with this coppertone.</li>
            <li> works as expected.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t run and get into the eyes like other sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Throw it in your purse and you&#x27;re never out without some sun protection for your little one.</li>
            <li> it would be due to its small size.</li>
            <li> I purchased this sunscreen for my son to use on vacation a few months ago.</li>
            <li> The tip is a little too small</li>
            <li> it somehow always makes it into at least one eye.</li>
            <li> Which thus makes it painful to apply more sunscreen, creating a vicious cycle... !  </li>

            <li> Easy to use and good.</li>
            <li> I have a 9 year old with very sensitive face skin and this is the only product that he&#x27;s happy to use.  I&#x27;ve tried many different brands of pure/organic/made for sensitive skin, and they all cause him to break out in rashes.  Which thus makes it painful to apply more sunscreen, creating a vicious cycle... !  Sunscreen is enough of a hassle without those type of problems.  I wish these sticks lasted a bit longer but they work well and provide good coverage.  We&#x27;re happy customers!  It can be hard to find these in our local stores and the price is comparable on Amazon, I&#x27;m glad to have found them here.</li>
            <li> Great. And a convenient size.</li>
            <li> gOOD !BUY IT AGAIN! VERY GOOD!</li>
            <li> I purchased this sunscreen for my son to use on vacation a few months ago. I now keep it in his diaper bag. It&#x27;s easy to use. I even use it on my own face when we&#x27;re out and about.</li>
            <li> Contains propylparaben which scientists think cause cancer. Too many other choices out there to risk it for me.</li>
            <li> sunscreen stick. works as expected. easy to apply. great for all ages.</li>
            <li> Love this product. So easy to use and my daughter doesn&#x27;t mind putting it on. They made this very easy on us moms! Throw it in your purse and you&#x27;re never out without some sun protection for your little one.</li>
            <li> Putting on sunscreen on 2-3 year olds is a very much of a challenge, and on their faces, even more so.  This stick really helps with this as your hands are not all gobbed up with lotion, trying to spread it on someone&#x27;s face, only for them to twist and turn and get it in their eyes.  We slide the stick across the areas of the face, then go back in with our fingers and rub it in and around. One of my daughters likes holding the stick also, so that makes her more comfortable with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We don&#x27;t use it for arms/legs/etc because it&#x27;s too small for larger areas and less cost effective, but lotions work well for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We really like this product and would really recommend it to anyone who needs to protect their baby&#x27;s skin.  We have this packed in our baby/toddler bag and use it on every trip to the park, zoo, beach or waterplay day at school.</li>
            <li> This little tube is the perfect size for on the go.  It applies easy and doesn&#x27;t melt in the heat if the bag is left in the car. (and I live in Texas).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I anticipated the tube not lasting very long, but it lasts quite a while with a toddler.</li>
            <li> Love this sunblock for my babies&#x27; face! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great price for great protection. This doesn&#x27;t run and get into the eyes like other sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use and provides great coverage on faces, scalps and ears.  It is simple to apply to wiggling kids on the go in the sun.  I have tried other generic brands but keep going back to the Coppertone stick as it doesn&#x27;t cause irritation to the eyes and stays in place even in the water.</li>
            <li> My toddler has sensitive skin, he breaks out from just about every kids sunscreen out there-- until I found this in the stick version. He has not had any skin issues since we&#x27;ve started using the stick version&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.s&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used their spray and cream version; broke out from both.</li>
            <li> A favorite stick to use for my kidos. Previously I would purchase other brands in which case they were greasy or left the white residue around the face but not with this coppertone. Can&#x27;t wait to use it, which is very soon :)</li>

            <li> It is easy to use outside.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a wiggly toddler and thought this would be good to use on her, but she&#x27;s still too squirmy to make sure I get her all covered.  I like to use this on her face especially and use the spray on the rest of her.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the protection of this product, but it&#x27;s a little greasy and not as easy to apply as I had imagined it would be due to its small size. It glides on smoothly, but you have to really go over the area and maje sure you&#x27;ve got everything covered.

            <li> If you have kids, then this is such a necessity! I can&#x27;t stand when I forget my Waterbabies stick, my kids freakout with regular sunscreen on their faces- it somehow always makes it into at least one eye. These sticks prevent that and shorten the process by an abundant amount of time! Make sure you buy a few to keep in all your bags.</li>
            <li> Great product! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> The tip is a little too small so it takes a few extra strokes to cover the entire area</li>
            <li> This sunscreen stick was perfect for tattoo coverage. Easy to apply, portable, and within TSA regulations!</li>
