    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It is summer now and I am at my darkest and this gives the perfect highlight, used sparingly and blended well.</li>
            <li>Dab on and blend with a kabuki brush and perfect LUMINOUS finish every time.</li>
            <li>Excellent color match for me.  </li>
            <li>that means it costs more than buying the DIOR concealer (that I already had, and lasted for ages !!! ) .</li>
            <li>great for adding a glow to your skin</li>
            <li>The primer is great for me,  but this concealer isn&#x27;t as great for me.</li>
            <li>it works great.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be happy if it just highlighted, but this product does neither.</li>
            <li>love it works great!!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m still figuring out how to do the smooth flawless finish</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s always good to read!!!!&lt;br /&gt;save</li>
            <li>and I went with the fair and do not regret it.</li>
            <li>so the fair shade is indeed, even paler which is neccesary to lighten my undereyes but</li>
            <li>Good product though</li>
            <li>makes the skin look fresh and bright and can be used on a range of skin complexions if blended properly…will buy it again!!</li>
            <li>I get the fair shade and use it under my eyes to brighten and it works amazingly.</li>
            <li>I have a very light complexion, and I use the Fair of this concealer.</li>
            <li>and I am SUPER happy with the price.</li>
            <li>Pretty good although I was hoping it would be a bit lighter than it is because my skin is quite fair.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very light brown</li>
            <li>It seems to cover okay</li>
            <li>and the quality of the DIOR C. is way better and nicer than this</li>
            <li>In her case, I put it under her eyes (she does have hollows even though in her 20s), and also under the brow and on top of the cheekbone.  </li>
            <li>Okay concealer but</li>
            <li>however it is more tacky than YSL</li>
            <li>I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>but as for me, I love it.</li>
            <li>I really love this concealer.</li>
            <li>I recommend it, but there might be something better out there...</li>
            <li>I have been using this product as a highlighter for many years now.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product based on great reviews but it did nothing for me as far as a hightligher goes.</li>
            <li>I also use this amazing stuff right under my eyebrows and right on top of my cheeks where the top of the cheekbone is.  </li>
            <li>This stuff however is the most amazing stuff I&#x27;ve ever tried for my under eye circles; it doesn&#x27;t so much \\&quot;cover\\&quot; them</li>
            <li>Its creamy, easily blendable, and after I set it with a powder, does not budge.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product in the fair color and the new lumi primer also.  </li>
            <li>Applies easily and smoothly.</li>
            <li>as replaces them with light, but the end result is they are not visible.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised how good this concealer works under my eyes (reminds me of the YSL one a lot in it&#x27;s radiance)</li>
            <li>Nothing special...</li>
            <li>really thought I&#x27;m saving money when I purchased this product !!</li>
            <li>Worth it.</li>
            <li>The shade of my skin is light to medium, but I really intentionally wanted to get fair as I wanted this as a highlighter and something that would distract from my dark circles and lighten up my face.  </li>
            <li>I just learned how to high light and contour (aka HAC see tutorial at [...])</li>
            <li>First time purchasing you might have to buy two colors till you get right match for your skin tone.</li>
            <li>This was the first time I tried it, I love it and use it daily and will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li>You have to twist it A LOT the first time you use it.</li>
            <li>But it is my current favorite.  </li>
            <li>First bought color light which was a little too light for me.</li>
            <li>Seller shipped fast.</li>
            <li>I really like the results though</li>
            <li>However, as much as I like this product, the applicator can be really hit or miss.  </li>
            <li>Pull the top off the end that you can&#x27;t see the product through, then twist the other end until concealer starts coming out of the brush.</li>
            <li>Good packaging but the product could be better, slides and cover bad.</li>
            <li>Half the price of my Trish Mcevoy concealer used for many years.</li>
            <li>I thought it would have a little more shimmer</li>
            <li>I have tried all sorts of expensive concealers but this light reflector looks better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and covers well on my dark undereye circles.</li>
            <li>and yes, it only works with certain people</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s like putting clear glue on my face.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need sticky clear product in my life.</li>
            <li>and I have to moisturize my eyes really well in order to GLIDE this on properly.</li>
            <li>makes it look natural.  </li>
            <li>, I was surprised as I don&#x27;t wear it daily !!</li>
            <li>Rather than try to fill in the whole under-eye area, I dab this stuff on in the deepest hollow of the eye and tap it on with my finger.</li>
            <li>I like it because it has a slightly sheer application that makes it good for everyday makeup, and the very light sparkle (trust me, I hate sparkle</li>
            <li>Overall though, I will continue to purchase this highlighter (and pretty frequently because it runs out after a few months).</li>
            <li>I have olive skin that doesn&#x27;t really wrinkle even though I\\&quot;m almost 50, but I&#x27;ve always dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I have been trying to figure out exactly how to use this thing for a few months and still can&#x27;t figure it out.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Nothing special...I thought it would have a little more shimmer but to me, it seems pretty matte or just looks like concealers I have used in the past.  It seems to cover okay but I will probably get something else next time.</li>
            <li> great for adding a glow to your skin</li>
            <li> Not best highlighter I&#x27;ve used, ysl is my fave, but can&#x27;t beat this price</li>
            <li> I ordered this product in the fair color and the new lumi primer also.  The primer is great for me,  but this concealer isn&#x27;t as great for me. I have lines under my eyes so I&#x27;m still figuring out how to do the smooth flawless finish and this concealer isn&#x27;t working for me. Maybe you but not me it settles into my lines :-\</li>
            <li> I purchased this concealer a month ago, and now it&#x27;s empty, I was surprised as I don&#x27;t wear it daily !! looked at the volume of it and here is the SHOCK!!!!!! THIS CONCEALER Volume IS ONLY 1.5 ml !!!!!!!!!!!!!! that means it costs more than buying the DIOR concealer (that I already had, and lasted for ages !!! ) . DIOR concealer&#x27;s volume is 10 ml !!!!!!! for $30 !!!!!!  and the quality of the DIOR C. is way better and nicer than this concealer.&lt;br /&gt;I really thought I&#x27;m saving money when I purchased this product !!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s always good to read!!!!&lt;br /&gt;save your money and AVOID this product!</li>
            <li> I have olive skin that doesn&#x27;t really wrinkle even though I\\&quot;m almost 50, but I&#x27;ve always dark circles under my eyes. The shade of my skin is light to medium, but I really intentionally wanted to get fair as I wanted this as a highlighter and something that would distract from my dark circles and lighten up my face.  Few things really seem to cover the dark circles.  This stuff however is the most amazing stuff I&#x27;ve ever tried for my under eye circles; it doesn&#x27;t so much \\&quot;cover\\&quot; them as replaces them with light, but the end result is they are not visible.  Rather than try to fill in the whole under-eye area, I dab this stuff on in the deepest hollow of the eye and tap it on with my finger. I don&#x27;t rub it in but allow it to soak in, and if necessary remove any excess.  I also use this amazing stuff right under my eyebrows and right on top of my cheeks where the top of the cheekbone is.  It lights up my face and makes it look luminous.  I think the trick to this product is that you don&#x27;t use it as a concealer and don&#x27;t apply it heavily.  I have tried all sorts of expensive concealers but this light reflector looks better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried. I also tried it on a friend who is much younger and does not have olive skin but rather caucasian pinkish skin. In her case, I put it under her eyes (she does have hollows even though in her 20s), and also under the brow and on top of the cheekbone.  It gave her a boost of luminosity, and lit up her face.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on great reviews but it did nothing for me as far as a hightligher goes.</li>
            <li> makes the skin look fresh and bright and can be used on a range of skin complexions if blended properly…will buy it again!!</li>
            <li> Okay concealer but not enough product for the price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use concealer everytime with makeup and this dryed out in about 1 week</li>
            <li> Seller shipped fast. I have normal/oily skin and this product is dry and adheres to my skin. It blends well.  This was the first time I tried it, I love it and use it daily and will continue to use this product. My skin is very light brown and I went with the fair and do not regret it. It is summer now and I am at my darkest and this gives the perfect highlight, used sparingly and blended well.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised how good this concealer works under my eyes (reminds me of the YSL one a lot in it&#x27;s radiance) however it is more tacky than YSL and I have to moisturize my eyes really well in order to GLIDE this on properly. I really like the results though and I am SUPER happy with the price.</li>
            <li> love it works great!!</li>
            <li> I just learned how to high light and contour (aka HAC see tutorial at [...]) and this is the concealer I use every day. I LOVE it. I have a very light complexion, and I use the Fair of this concealer. it works great.    To use (took me a second too). Pull the top off the end that you can&#x27;t see the product through, then twist the other end until concealer starts coming out of the brush. You have to twist it A LOT the first time you use it. Just keep twisting until you see it coming out the brush end. Dab on and blend with a kabuki brush and perfect LUMINOUS finish every time. I&#x27;ll never use another concealer!</li>
            <li> Good packaging but the product could be better, slides and cover bad.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for years and yes, it only works with certain people but as for me, I love it. I dont use it as a concealer though so maybe thats why. I get the fair shade and use it under my eyes to brighten and it works amazingly. Its creamy, easily blendable, and after I set it with a powder, does not budge. Im very pale so the fair shade is indeed, even paler which is neccesary to lighten my undereyes but if your going to be using that shade as a concelaer, its just going to make anywhere that you conceal lighter.</li>
            <li> I really love this concealer. It goes on smoothly and covers well on my dark undereye circles. I&#x27;ve been using it for over 4 years and don&#x27;t intend to change.</li>
            <li> I am testing yet, but I am x x x x x x x x x x x x x xx</li>
            <li> If I could give this zero stars I would. What a crock of sh*t. This is TERRIBLE. 1) There&#x27;s zero pigment. 2) you have to click it a million times to get any product out of it. 3) I&#x27;ve used it once, let it sit in my bag for a week (very well enclosed with the lid tightly on) and it&#x27;s already looking empty. It doesn&#x27;t cover anything and it&#x27;s like putting clear glue on my face. I don&#x27;t need sticky clear product in my life. It&#x27;s supposed to CONCEAL or even highlight- I&#x27;d be happy if it just highlighted, but this product does neither. I may as well be smearing $10 water on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Useless.&lt;br /&gt;Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> This is not a holy grail product for me.  But it is my current favorite.  Unable to indulge in high end cosmetics these days, I find this does the double duty of highlighting and concealing decently.  I carry it in my purse for touch ups to the melty foundation that is from the same collection.  I recommend it, but there might be something better out there...</li>
            <li> I have been trying to figure out exactly how to use this thing for a few months and still can&#x27;t figure it out.  Too confusing to me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product as a highlighter for many years now.  I like it because it has a slightly sheer application that makes it good for everyday makeup, and the very light sparkle (trust me, I hate sparkle and if it were not basically unnoticeable I would not use the product) makes it look natural.  However, as much as I like this product, the applicator can be really hit or miss.  Sometimes I get a tube that works great, but other times it can be a little difficult getting the product out.  Overall though, I will continue to purchase this highlighter (and pretty frequently because it runs out after a few months).</li>
            <li> Excellent color match for me.  Applies easily and smoothly. Half the price of my Trish Mcevoy concealer used for many years. Will now switch to this. First time purchasing you might have to buy two colors till you get right match for your skin tone. Worth it. That is what I did. First bought color light which was a little too light for me.</li>
            <li> Pretty good although I was hoping it would be a bit lighter than it is because my skin is quite fair.  Good product though and I will buy it again.</li>
