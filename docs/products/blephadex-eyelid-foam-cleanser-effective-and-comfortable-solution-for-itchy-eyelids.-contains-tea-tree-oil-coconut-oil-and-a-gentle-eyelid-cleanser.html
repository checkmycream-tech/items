            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>My eye doctor suggested using Johnson&#x27;s Baby Shampoo on my eyelids; however, I don&#x27;t want to put toxic products in my eyes - nor does it feel good.</li>
            <li>Not as effective as OcuSoft.</li>

            <li>This is wonderful for people with dry eye conditions.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>i bot a bottle of this foam with the wipes, the foam is sticky and smelly, does not rinse off easily.</li>
            <li>With regular use of this product my eyes feel great.  </li>
            <li>always use this to clean eye lids.</li>
            <li>I tried everything but this product was soothing and effective through natural means.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend....!!!</li>
            <li>Not anymore thanks to Blephadex!!</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend to anyone!!</li>
            <li>very affordable...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soothing too.</li>
            <li>You really need to buy this product.</li>
            <li>Cleaned very well with no irritation to eyes.</li>

            <li>a friend recommended the Blephadex products...what a lifesaver...very easy to use and after all the other products that I have tried that didn&#x27;t work....</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the wipes so much because they don&#x27;t go as far</li>
            <li>I have ocular rosacea and have used Occusoft which helps but it left the corners of my eyes sensitive so much so that if I had a tear hit those sensitive corners it would sting.  </li>
            <li>This cleanser is light, fluffy and conditioning with the coconut oil.</li>
            <li>The tea tree oil naturally kills my eyelid bacteria.</li>
            <li>I had a retinal tear a few years ago and that eye tends to get red and has more &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34; in the tear duct.  </li>
            <li>Therefore my eyes are always dry and itchy and I feel so much relief now.  </li>
            <li>first of, you get only ONE little bottle and not 3 as it shown on the picture, secondly you can not return this product for a refund if you don&#x27;t like it.</li>

            <li> first of, you get only ONE little bottle and not 3 as it shown on the picture, secondly you can not return this product for a refund if you don&#x27;t like it. It gives some sort of foam which do nothing except your skin around the eyes gets sticky so you need to rince it off with water otherwise it feels like a glue on your eyelashes and eyelids. it did not stop even for short time my eyelashes from itchiness&lt;br /&gt;so overall in my opinion - another useless product.</li>
            <li> The Blephadex foam cleanser is a fantastic product with fantastic results!! This is the only product I have used that truly helps my dry itchy lids.  Highly Recommend to anyone!!</li>
            <li> I have suffered from irritation to my eyelids for as long as I can remember...a friend recommended the Blephadex products...what a lifesaver...very easy to use and after all the other products that I have tried that didn&#x27;t work....very affordable...I highly recommend....!!!</li>
            <li> seems to work but time will tell</li>
            <li> Great stuff!!  Soothes the eyes and get rid of itch and irritation.  I had a retinal tear a few years ago and that eye tends to get red and has more &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34; in the tear duct.  This reduces the irritation, redness, and the &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34;.  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This cleanser does a GREAT job on my eyes!!! It&#x27;s very soothing too. I have suffered from dry eye and rosacea for years. Not anymore thanks to Blephadex!! Blephadex is a life saver and even helps remove my makeup too. I am an arson investigator and spend countless hours on fire scenes. I get soot and ashes in my eyes daily.  Therefore my eyes are always dry and itchy and I feel so much relief now.  You really need to buy this product. You will be so happy you did!!!</li>
            <li> Instead of receiving 3 bottles a pictured, I received 1 bottle, which in my opinion is false advertising.  I don&#x27;t like being deceived. The only reason I GAVE IT ONE STAR IS BECAUSE THAT IS THE LOWEST I COULD GIVE.</li>
            <li> I have ocular rosacea and have used Occusoft which helps but it left the corners of my eyes sensitive so much so that if I had a tear hit those sensitive corners it would sting.  So I switched to Blephadex and love it!!!!  I don&#x27;t use the wipes so much because they don&#x27;t go as far but this stuff does the job!  It keeps my blepharitis under control as well as any itching.  I also have facial rosacea and I also use it on my entire face with a cotton ball like you would use a toner it has dramatically helped my symptoms!</li>
            <li> always use this to clean eye lids.</li>
            <li> Cleaned very well with no irritation to eyes.</li>
            <li> Glad to have found this product. Does a great job alleviating irritation and itch from allergies. Easy to apply. Solid value too.</li>
            <li> Very convienent in the shower.</li>
            <li> Very small bottle. Stings eyes a little. Not as effective as OcuSoft.</li>
            <li> I tried everything but this product was soothing and effective through natural means. My eye doctor suggested using Johnson&#x27;s Baby Shampoo on my eyelids; however, I don&#x27;t want to put toxic products in my eyes - nor does it feel good. This cleanser is light, fluffy and conditioning with the coconut oil. The tea tree oil naturally kills my eyelid bacteria.</li>
            <li> i bot a bottle of this foam with the wipes, the foam is sticky and smelly, does not rinse off easily. i actually had to use other soap to wash this cleanser off my face. another useless product.</li>
            <li> This IS false advertising there are no 3 bottles of this product as is on the picture very deceiving, there is 30ml &#x3D; 1.014 fl oz of the liquid in one tiny bottle not enough for daily use for 30 days, I call this consumer robbery and Amazon should not be sponsoring stuff like this, very bad deal DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT IS ROBBERY AND YOU CANNOT RETURN IT.</li>
            <li> This cleanser really does a great job on my eyes.  It is very soothing and also is moisturizing.  I&#x27;ll get more when needed.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful for people with dry eye conditions.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I have itchy/watery eyes from allergies and get constant bumps on my lash line.  With regular use of this product my eyes feel great.  It takes just a minute in the morning to use and is painless.  Customer for life!</li>
