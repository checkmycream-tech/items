            <li> I love all of these products I have not yet been disappointed and anything that has her name on it</li>
            <li> I would not get this product, such a waste!</li>
            <li> But be warned, it only lasts for like half a week!!</li>
            <li> This is not worth it...</li>
            <li> Never heard anything negative back.</li>
            <li> they are both slight name brand</li>
            <li> It washes right off and sweats off too :(</li>
            <li> I hate to be the discouraging review that makes this product no longer appealing, but unfortunately it was not all that I had hoped.</li>
            <li> either way she is orange and angry and it&#x27;s not pleasant.  </li>
            <li> For starters, I was sent the wrong product...</li>
            <li> Then it scrapes, peels, and fades off in a fashion that makes me look ill or jaundice.</li>
            <li> sorry Snooki!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just Horrible!!</li>

            <li> It washes right off and sweats off too :(</li>
            <li> tad orange but I liked it.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say its the best self tanner ive ever purchased. It actually makes you look tan and not orange. It smells great and drys pretty quick, just make sure you rub it it evenly .</li>
            <li> Gives great color no streaking one of the best out there.  Highly recommend to anyone and has a nice scent</li>
            <li> It will def turn you orange like a little Snooki sheep, but it&#x27;s a streaky orange, does not go on even and just isn&#x27;t a great product.  My daughter now looks like a Snooki zebra... or maybe a leopard... either way she is orange and angry and it&#x27;s not pleasant.  Thanks for nothing Snooki.</li>
            <li> Love it....the best self tanner I have ever used</li>
            <li> I love all of these products I have not yet been disappointed and anything that has her name on it I really do recommend trying for products including her fragrances</li>
            <li> Smells good and tans within minutes. 24 hrs after putting it on wash it off and the color is more natural which is the final result . Love it!</li>
            <li> I hate to be the discouraging review that makes this product no longer appealing, but unfortunately it was not all that I had hoped. For starters, I was sent the wrong product... the spray version, instead of the lotion, which was upsetting. I decided to try it anyway. The color is wonderful, not orange or red, a just-right tan. But be warned, it only lasts for like half a week!! Then it scrapes, peels, and fades off in a fashion that makes me look ill or jaundice. Overall, this product is good if you need a good color NOW and aren&#x27;t worried about the later. Other than the great color, pleasant smell, and instant results, i found it to be frustrating. Maybe the lotion is different though...</li>
            <li> I would definitely not recommend buying this product. After my first use I loved it but I then started noticing that it would simply wash off in the shower. It also made me orange and blotchy.</li>
            <li> Got my daughter as a stocking stuffer she loved it!  I even tried the product and it is something that I would also use!</li>
            <li> left me orange and streaky...oh and very sticky. threw it out.  there is much better stuff at walmart.  the leg one by snookie i liked.</li>
            <li> I love the smell. Works great. Just wash your hands asap.</li>
            <li> Just Horrible!! No color at all!  The Jwoww instant spray is much better than this. I would not get this product, such a waste! It also doesn&#x27;t smell great.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous Self Tanners, working at the Tan Salon..and I don&#x27;t have a tan at the moment, fair skin...I was so excited to use this, bc the tanning lotion &amp; perfume by Snooki are Amazing!!!  However, this self tanner..STAY AWAY..sorry Snooki!&lt;br /&gt;It shimmers, smells so pretty..goes on nice &amp; smooth..feels like ur pampering ur body....Looks so soft &amp; shimmery after applied...Hour later...Orange Hands(after scrubbing, washing properly after applying)..Orange Palms, Orange Streaks all over..and I know how to use Self Tanners very well, and prefer lotion over self tan sprays!  This is not worth it...Stick to FX Sunless Tanner Products or LA Tan Self Tanner...they have NEVER turned me orange..they are both slight name brand ..run about 20-25dollars..but SO very worth it for an airspray tan look!! Stay Away From This Product Girls/Ladies! Please!</li>
            <li> Worked like it said and I loved the smell!!! I totally recommended it to my sister in law and she loves it too!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my granddaughters, friend&#x27;s  birthday. She said this is what she wanted.  It came in mail fairly quickly, but all I ever heard was she was happy she got it.  I assume it was good.  Never heard anything negative back.</li>
            <li> Love it but the spray kind is better</li>
