            <li>Excellent.</li>
            <li>is the best man shaver I use it in the shower and bath tube.</li>
            <li>Great product....</li>
            <li>Great love</li>
            <li>I have used it twice and battery holds up nicely.  </li>
            <li>love the silver look and grippy material on the side.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I can get it replaced</li>
            <li>pretty good product.</li>
            <li>The only good thing I have to say about it</li>
            <li>But if you are doing a touch up its not bad.</li>
            <li>Love this new body trimmer by mangroomer.  </li>
            <li>BE AWARE!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s shaving - you don&#x27;t want it too powerful.</li>
            <li>Impressive battery life however compared to other mens shavers or electric grooming products this one falls short.</li>
            <li>They very much copied the design (looks) of the model BG2040, but that&#x27;s where the similarity ends.</li>
            <li>Worked exactly as I had hoped...highly recommend</li>
            <li>I handled all areas exactly the way and to the length I needed it.</li>
            <li>The first day I got this and used the groomer, it pulls the hairs.  </li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;power burst&amp;#34; function is a joke, the normal setting is about as powerful as as a dollar store flashlight so the power burst mode is necessary to accomplish anything more than one hair at a time.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because of positive reviews about manscaping.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend to anyone looking for a high quality body shaver!</li>
            <li>the shaving head is very cheaply made and looks like it would fall apart at any moment, and it started getting louder every day I used it, which was less than 7 days.</li>
            <li>Only thing was the power, you have to go over the areas a few times - but might be a good thing because of the areas</li>
            <li>super high quality blades do not pull my hair especially in the region of the balls!  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a product to trim your personal areas, this is NOT the right product.  </li>
            <li>but I suspect that is because it is made to work on sensitive areas, and I am sure it is hard to get one tool to do both.</li>
            <li>The guards either dig into sensitive skin or allow the blades to catch your skin.  </li>
            <li>decent quality, needs constant charging.</li>
            <li>The product was cheap and shoddy.</li>
            <li>Tends to get caught quite frequently on &amp;#34;loose skin&amp;#34; along with taking 3 or 4 passes over the same spot.</li>
            <li>Absolute garbage, I returned it in less than a week.</li>

            <li> Not bad but not great either.</li>
            <li> Some cutting but mostly pulling  in either direction or angle.  </li>
            <li> Average overall.</li>
            <li> Not nearly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it 6-7 times and every single time, I&#x27;ve cut myself!  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not sure it ever did charge properly)</li>
            <li> Works well, but wish it was a little stronger.</li>
            <li> I tried dry it both dry and wet, and still pulls the hairs out instead of cutting.  </li>
            <li> It cuts body hair but not smooth, the battery life is poor so if you are cutting a lot of hair on your body the battery will run down fast.</li>
            <li> So I charged it fully, and tried again, But again the same poor results!.  </li>
            <li> the charging stand is weak, and does not hold groomer in place during charging</li>
            <li> Still cannot hack through my tough beard</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product several times, and from my experience, absolutely terrible for manscaping.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I can not return this because I already used it.</li>
            <li> and I suppose that is why it pulls the hairs instead of cutting.  </li>
            <li> is you don&#x27;t have to worry about cutting your self.</li>
            <li> does the job without cutting</li>
            <li> While it looks ergonomical, it&#x27;s horribly awkward to use and impossible to maneuver.</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> This is an absolutely HORRIBLE product.</li>

            <li> I purchased this product because of positive reviews about manscaping.  I&#x27;ve used this product several times, and from my experience, absolutely terrible for manscaping. I&#x27;ve used it 6-7 times and every single time, I&#x27;ve cut myself!  If you&#x27;re looking for a product to trim your personal areas, this is NOT the right product.  The guards either dig into sensitive skin or allow the blades to catch your skin.  Either way, you get cut.  Move on.</li>
            <li> Love this new body trimmer by mangroomer.  super high quality blades do not pull my hair especially in the region of the balls!  love the silver look and grippy material on the side.  I have used it twice and battery holds up nicely.  I would recommend to anyone looking for a high quality body shaver!</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T DO IT! Don&#x27;t buy this wanna-be...it&#x27;s an imposter of the Philips/Norelco BG2040. They very much copied the design (looks) of the model BG2040, but that&#x27;s where the similarity ends. The battery charging LED quit working on the second day (I&#x27;m not sure it ever did charge properly) the shaving head is very cheaply made and looks like it would fall apart at any moment, and it started getting louder every day I used it, which was less than 7 days. I returned it and got the BG2040. What a difference! Get the Philips/Norelco BG2040 instead...trust me, you will not like this body groomer.</li>
            <li> Great product....Worked exactly as I had hoped...highly recommend</li>
            <li> decent quality, needs constant charging. but it does the job.</li>
            <li> pretty good product. Still cannot hack through my tough beard but I suspect that is because it is made to work on sensitive areas, and I am sure it is hard to get one tool to do both.</li>
            <li> Works well, but wish it was a little stronger.</li>
            <li> Horrible. It pulls out your hair and will cut the heck out of you</li>
            <li> Excellent. Only thing was the power, you have to go over the areas a few times - but might be a good thing because of the areas it&#x27;s shaving - you don&#x27;t want it too powerful. I handled all areas exactly the way and to the length I needed it. I&#x27;ll stay with this one.</li>
            <li> Great love it does not pull my hair it cut hair of all types and in private area.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best man shaver I use it in the shower and bath tube.</li>
            <li> Impressive battery life however compared to other mens shavers or electric grooming products this one falls short. Tends to get caught quite frequently on &amp;#34;loose skin&amp;#34; along with taking 3 or 4 passes over the same spot. Not bad but not great either. Average overall.</li>
            <li> Not nearly what I expected.  The reviews are way off.  The first day I got this and used the groomer, it pulls the hairs.  Some cutting but mostly pulling  in either direction or angle.  I tried dry it both dry and wet, and still pulls the hairs out instead of cutting.  Unfortunately I can not return this because I already used it. The power is very low too and I suppose that is why it pulls the hairs instead of cutting.  So I charged it fully, and tried again, But again the same poor results!.  BE AWARE!  IT DOES NOT PERFORM AS ADVERTISED OR REVIEWED !</li>
            <li> Bought it in April and it&#x27;s now July and it won&#x27;t charge. I&#x27;m sure I can get it replaced but if it broke within 3 months why would I trust the replacement?</li>
            <li> Pulls a lot of hair instead of trimming/shaving.</li>
            <li> This product is a HOMERUN! I use it to shave my face, body AND PUBES IT RULES 🙊</li>
            <li> It cuts body hair but not smooth, the battery life is poor so if you are cutting a lot of hair on your body the battery will run down fast. But if you are doing a touch up its not bad. The only good thing I have to say about it is you don&#x27;t have to worry about cutting your self.</li>
            <li> does the job without cutting</li>
            <li> This is an absolutely HORRIBLE product. I will never buy from this company again. The product was cheap and shoddy. The blades cut like they&#x27;re made from a tuna can and drew blood multiple times in multiple places. While it looks ergonomical, it&#x27;s horribly awkward to use and impossible to maneuver. The &amp;#34;power burst&amp;#34; function is a joke, the normal setting is about as powerful as as a dollar store flashlight so the power burst mode is necessary to accomplish anything more than one hair at a time. Absolute garbage, I returned it in less than a week.</li>
            <li> the charging stand is weak, and does not hold groomer in place during charging</li>
