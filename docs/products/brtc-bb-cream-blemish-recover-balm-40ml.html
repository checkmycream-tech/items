    <ol>
            <li>The color of this wasn&#x27;t a perfect match for me</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the best one for me.</li>
            <li>Excellent product!      </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good price, too!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Generally I believe this is a great product for someone with acne-prone, oily skin.</li>
            <li>I did a lot of research to decide which BB cream would best fit my skin type and color.</li>
            <li>Over all good coverage and oil control</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s good to go.</li>
            <li>good...</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t match my skin at all but after some powder it looks good...</li>
            <li>Everywhere I looked, this was recommended for best controlling oil and having full coverage.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am very pleased with this product and have been using it for over a year.</li>
            <li>It was amazing.  </li>
            <li>It never adjusts to my skin color on its own.</li>
            <li>When I do use this though, I feel confident that I look good for the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;For reference</li>
            <li>This time I really enjoyed it and was able to let my skin reap the benefits of this BB cream!</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It has excellent oil control and is the only product that has stayed on my skin for longer than 4 hours.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t know if I will still be able to use it in the summer.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine why anyone would think this is appealing.</li>
            <li>I bought this and after mixing with sunscreen, OBAGI, and my concealer, I love it.  </li>
            <li>Okay for combo skin.</li>
            <li>:) I use it on the winter but never in summer.</li>
            <li>so I feel way more confident at work.</li>
            <li>up throwing his away because I couldn&#x27;t even convince my friends to take it...for free!</li>
            <li>Well, most of the BB creams that are manufactured in Korea does not offer that varieties.</li>
            <li>I might stick with this one til I find the better one; however, for now, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to keep up with a makeup regime because the day after I put on foundation, I always break out.</li>
            <li>BB creams don&#x27;t come in many colors, but because they &amp;#34;oxidize&amp;#34; after 10-15 minutes on your skin, they shouldn&#x27;t look unnatural.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of scarring, it does an OK job of covering it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also has really good coverage if you put powder on right after applying</li>
            <li>It does a pretty good job of evening out my skin tone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But the Skin79 stuff is smoother and spreads much more easily, and still doesn&#x27;t make break out despite also having sun protection (which the BRTC one does not have).</li>
            <li>I love it now, and if my face is feeling nice and matte I&#x27;ll go ahead and use it-it does seem to keep my skin texture nice and control my blemishes as long as I don&#x27;t wear it on the most humid days!</li>
            <li>I have used other BB creams after and this has the thickest and best coverage among those I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but otherwise it won&#x27;t spread easily.</li>
            <li>Plus, the smell is really strongly medicinal.</li>
            <li>This product certainly gives me that nice coverage that I need.</li>
            <li>I have really light skin</li>
            <li>It fells light</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a light teatree oil scent.</li>
            <li>The color seems light, but does blend well with my skin tone after applied.</li>
            <li>My skin is light to medium.</li>
            <li>As far as oil control, it didn&#x27;t do a good job.</li>
            <li>The texture is wonderful and long lasting and would be perfect for a hot day, but it would simply not match my skin</li>
            <li>I apply this product on clean skin over acne blemishes then apply the rest of my makeup.</li>
            <li>far as breakouts go, I find that this product works the best at not slaughtering the condition of my pores and current blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this product and will for sure order again...</li>
            <li>Combination, very dry cheeks and fairly oily T-zone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first day I used it, I thought it was, but after that first day everything seemed fine.</li>
            <li>Being a very fair skinned red-head, I&#x27;ve always had a tough time finding liquid foundations and tinted moisturizers light enough to even remotely match my skin tone, and this product is the best for me between it&#x27;s lightness, coverage, and ability to not make me break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When you apply it to your face it looks like the most natural look I have ever achieved with any foundation, tinted moisturizer, etc.</li>
            <li>no blemish help or any other good things about it</li>
            <li>I set it with a powder but still it won&#x27;t last me more than 2 hours (if i&#x27;m lucky).</li>
            <li>This might work pretty good for other customers but it just didn&#x27;t work that well for me.</li>
            <li>, at first it looks like a dewy finish?</li>
            <li>The first BB cream I tried was from Missah.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my first BB cream.  </li>
            <li>It caused my already oily enough skin to secrete more oil.</li>
            <li>A bit too thick for my liking, but color was great for my neutral porcelain skin...</li>
            <li>I mix it with a moisturizer or facial oil to make them absorb better and sink in well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was the first BB cream I ever tried.</li>
            <li>I choose this BRTC based on general good reviews, and because foundations, creams and such tend to break me out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was hoping to cut out the use of moisturizer in my morning routine, but I feel like I actually have to use more since using this product.</li>
            <li>I get extremely pale in the winter and fairly bronzed in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Sensitive (easily irritated by anything scented or by too much salicylic acid)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>In the winter I am naturally very pale and this cream gives me a gorgeous porcelain complexion.</li>
            <li>First of all, I want to point out that this particular BB cream did not cause a break out on my acne prone face.</li>
            <li>This color matches my skintone fairly well and can be darkened up a bit with powders but overall, if you aren&#x27;t very pale, this is probably too light for you.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great for oily skin, its very thick but blends well.</li>
            <li>It almost dries my skin out too much, I need to moisturize at night to keep my skin from feeling flakey.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Also the reason I really wanted a bb cream is because of the claims that it will gradually lighten your skin</li>
            <li>With that said, I REALLY wanted this to work.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to give it fewer than 3 stars because it might work really well for someone else, but not for me.</li>
            <li>and It really doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>Now I am very concerned.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>Seriously, I&#x27;m really paleâ€”</li>
            <li>this cream is very drying.</li>
            <li>Bare mineral powder foundation can get some good coverage but takes way too long and doesn&#x27;t last through a work day, not to mention primers making me break out.</li>
            <li>and I bet that without the oils it might havea decent staying power.   </li>
            <li>It really makes you look very natural as if you had nothing on.</li>
            <li>It goes away once it&#x27;s on my face, but it&#x27;s kind of unpleasant putting it on - especially first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li>so my skin was a lot lighter than it normally would be.</li>
            <li>so if you have skin like me that is acne prone and easily scars, this will not cover dark post acne marks or any hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li>I used to get one to two new acne spots every couple of days</li>
            <li>/&gt;Without any powder and just moisturizer underneath it, this BB Cream has my face looking shiny (or super friggen \\&quot;dewy\\&quot;) and slightly sunburnt (because it is a bit dark for me), so I just put on some very light colored, mattifying powder on it</li>
            <li>I am light-skinned with pretty neutral tones, not a lot of yellow in my skin.</li>
            <li>If you have dry skin, stay away, and combo skin could go either way but is probably worth trying.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it manifests in dark post-blemish marks, other times I have bright red lumps and whiteheads erupting all over the place.</li>
            <li>BUT, recently, I have become aware that products from other countries are not held responsible for their ingredients and I am now very worried about the contents.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully as I use this cream longer, my skin will clear up even more.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Young, I am 21 years old.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lastly, it doesn&#x27;t control oil very well.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Within an hour it looks really sweaty, cakey, greasy, and overall grosse looking.</li>
            <li>Much better than the American BB creams, but perhaps not as heavy as I would like.</li>
            <li>It does not cover any of my blemishes (although it does amazing things for redness and pigmentation), just tones them down slightly</li>
            <li>Because it makes my skin look very matte and flat, I need to use a highlighter and blush with it to keep my face looking alive.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I am going to try the BRTC Jasmine Waters BB Cream next, hoping it does not settle in pores and fine lines, and is less drying.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Instead of this stuff, I recommend Skin79&#x27;s Hot Pink BB Cream.</li>
            <li>However, I would recommend it for someone with normal to dry skin because it looks very natural</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I really like the cream, my biggest qualm is the limited color.</li>
            <li>But if you are super duper translucent white, this is probably a bit too dark.</li>
            <li>I have not noticed any improvement in my skin&#x27;s general health, and no fading of scars and discoloration.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Any kind of powder and foundation (even the expensive ones I bought from sephora) make me break out.   </li>
            <li>, I am an Oriental with medium skin and occasionally use Bare MInerals Medium.</li>
            <li>After the first few times I used it, I  decided it was too greasy for my face and didn&#x27;t use it for awhile.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it is a decent product.</li>
            <li>Yes, I&#x27;d say this BB cream is a little dark for my skin tone, so I have to mix it with other lighter liquid foundations to better match the tones.</li>

            <li> BUT, recently, I have become aware that products from other countries are not held responsible for their ingredients and I am now very worried about the contents.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully as I use this cream longer, my skin will clear up even more.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Young, I am 21 years old.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lastly, it doesn&#x27;t control oil very well.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Within an hour it looks really sweaty, cakey, greasy, and overall grosse looking.</li>
            <li> Much better than the American BB creams, but perhaps not as heavy as I would like.</li>
            <li> It does not cover any of my blemishes (although it does amazing things for redness and pigmentation), just tones them down slightly</li>
            <li> Because it makes my skin look very matte and flat, I need to use a highlighter and blush with it to keep my face looking alive.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I am going to try the BRTC Jasmine Waters BB Cream next, hoping it does not settle in pores and fine lines, and is less drying.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Instead of this stuff, I recommend Skin79&#x27;s Hot Pink BB Cream.</li>
            <li> However, I would recommend it for someone with normal to dry skin because it looks very natural</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I really like the cream, my biggest qualm is the limited color.</li>
            <li> But if you are super duper translucent white, this is probably a bit too dark.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any improvement in my skin&#x27;s general health, and no fading of scars and discoloration.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Any kind of powder and foundation (even the expensive ones I bought from sephora) make me break out.   </li>
            <li> , I am an Oriental with medium skin and occasionally use Bare MInerals Medium.</li>
            <li> After the first few times I used it, I  decided it was too greasy for my face and didn&#x27;t use it for awhile.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it is a decent product.</li>
            <li> Yes, I&#x27;d say this BB cream is a little dark for my skin tone, so I have to mix it with other lighter liquid foundations to better match the tones.</li>
            <li> mainly save this for bad skin days  - when I am blemished and after peels/dermarolling as it is healing and has more coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> with very little amount, it covered my whole face.</li>
            <li> It provides just the right amount of coverage for me - evens out my skin tone, keeps my acne a little less noticeable</li>
            <li> Since I started using this cream I have still gotten new spots but they stayed small and dried up fast.</li>
            <li> I have moderate acne that never really goes away, it just migrates around my face.</li>
            <li> It has a slightly medicine-y scent that I personally like (but could be a con for others) because it gives me an extra boost of confidence in the creams acne fighting abilities.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Extremely acne prone, constant stubborn</li>
            <li> Just an FYI if you have dry skin you might want to moisturize before you apply this because it does cling to dry patches.</li>
            <li> Not recommended for medium to dark skin as it only comes in one shade</li>
            <li> I am also a little self-conscious of my big ol&#x27; pores.</li>
            <li> They usually offer few color tones because their targetted consumers are \\&quot;asians-- particularly Koreans\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I know Asian women value pale skin</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I chose this BRTC BB cream because the label said it was designed for oily, troubled skinâ€”which is exactly what I have.</li>
            <li> My skin is slightly oily and any makeup I  have no slides off by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair-skinned with slight yellowish undertones, but this BB cream sat on my face like a mask.</li>
            <li> Also, it tends to settle in my pores and skin imperfections slightly by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a little dark for me</li>
            <li> Bottom line, no i will not repurchase because it doesn&#x27;t control oil, it doesn&#x27;t match my skin tone and it is not full coverage as I want it to be.   </li>
            <li> but I made it work a little with bronzer, plus I started using it during winter</li>
            <li> (again, why I add a little bit of tinted moisturizer).</li>
            <li> I wake up, wash my face, use a little toner and throw on some of this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few BB Creams, one which made me break out, and an American version which was just a weak tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I solved these two problems by mixing it with a few drops of tinted moisturizer before applying.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use this for everyday as I prefer a lighter coverage.  </li>
            <li> and this felt heavy and</li>
            <li> Pale with olive undertones.</li>
            <li> Also, I am pale but this was not complimenting in the least.&lt;br /&gt;Ended</li>

            <li> I had such a horrible experience with Dr. Jart&#x27;s silver BB, so that was the main concern for me.</li>
            <li> I find the consistency to be thick and hard to spread.</li>
            <li> Also, it has that thick consistency, which makes it hard to spread around the face.</li>
            <li> Some people might hate it, but it does not bother me that much since they&#x27;re hardly noticeable after you apply them.</li>
            <li> as a matter of fact in the morning after I washed my face, I applied my SPF and let it sink in for at least 10 mins and then applied this bb cream</li>
            <li> product itself: Thick, creamy.</li>
            <li> It does not feel heavy or uncomfortable on your skin at all.   </li>
            <li> After reading poor reviews, I feel I had to write one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Made me break out even worse then I was.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a week now and I can see the difference in my skin. I have bad acne and have tried tons of products out there and none has worked well on me. My skin is clearing up now and my face is getting softer and whiter. I love this product. There&#x27;s only one thing that I am not experiencing which is oil control. It says it controls oil but I am still having to blot 2-3 times a day but I cant complain because this is the only product that controls my acne and works as a foundation. The coverage is medium yet it feels like I&#x27;m wearing nothing. I&#x27;d highly recommend this product and will for sure order again...the only drawback is it&#x27;s not controlling my oil.</li>
            <li> My skin:&lt;br /&gt;- Young, I am 21 years old.&lt;br /&gt;- Combination, very dry cheeks and fairly oily T-zone.&lt;br /&gt;- Sensitive (easily irritated by anything scented or by too much salicylic acid)&lt;br /&gt;- Pale with olive undertones. I get extremely pale in the winter and fairly bronzed in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;- Extremely acne prone, constant stubborn breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- My skin is slightly oily and any makeup I  have no slides off by the end of the day. Not this B.B. cream. It has excellent oil control and is the only product that has stayed on my skin for longer than 4 hours.&lt;br /&gt;- I used to get one to two new acne spots every couple of days and they would be extremely painful and inflamed. Since I started using this cream I have still gotten new spots but they stayed small and dried up fast. Hopefully as I use this cream longer, my skin will clear up even more.&lt;br /&gt;- In the winter I am naturally very pale and this cream gives me a gorgeous porcelain complexion. It does a pretty good job of evening out my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;- You only need a dime sized drop for your entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- This product only comes in one color and I don&#x27;t know if I will still be able to use it in the summer. The texture is wonderful and long lasting and would be perfect for a hot day, but it would simply not match my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;- It almost dries my skin out too much, I need to moisturize at night to keep my skin from feeling flakey.&lt;br /&gt;- Because it makes my skin look very matte and flat, I need to use a highlighter and blush with it to keep my face looking alive.&lt;br /&gt;- It does not cover any of my blemishes (although it does amazing things for redness and pigmentation), just tones them down slightly and I have to go in with concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other&lt;br /&gt;- It has a slightly medicine-y scent that I personally like (but could be a con for others) because it gives me an extra boost of confidence in the creams acne fighting abilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I really like the cream, my biggest qualm is the limited color. I know Asian women value pale skin and this product is formulated for the Asian market but I prefer to let myself get a bit of color in the summer.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research to decide which BB cream would best fit my skin type and color. Everywhere I looked, this was recommended for best controlling oil and having full coverage. I was disappointed that the coverage is not as opaque as I wish it was, this will give you a medium coverage so if you have skin like me that is acne prone and easily scars, this will not cover dark post acne marks or any hyperpigmentation. I tried to build the coverage but it didn&#x27;t work either. As far as oil control, it didn&#x27;t do a good job. as a matter of fact in the morning after I washed my face, I applied my SPF and let it sink in for at least 10 mins and then applied this bb cream and this make my skin look shiny, at first it looks like a dewy finish? I set it with a powder but still it won&#x27;t last me more than 2 hours (if i&#x27;m lucky). Perhaps my skin is TOO oily?!   The color of this wasn&#x27;t a perfect match for me but I made it work a little with bronzer, plus I started using it during winter so my skin was a lot lighter than it normally would be. During summer I know this will not match me. (I&#x27;m MAC NC20 if that helps)  Also the reason I really wanted a bb cream is because of the claims that it will gradually lighten your skin, I thought it would help with my post acne spots but it didn&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t think it made any difference AT ALL. I have been using it almost every day for the past 2 months.   With that said, I REALLY wanted this to work. When you apply it to your face it looks like the most natural look I have ever achieved with any foundation, tinted moisturizer, etc. It really makes you look very natural as if you had nothing on. It does not feel heavy or uncomfortable on your skin at all.   Bottom line, no i will not repurchase because it doesn&#x27;t control oil, it doesn&#x27;t match my skin tone and it is not full coverage as I want it to be.   However, I would recommend it for someone with normal to dry skin because it looks very natural and I bet that without the oils it might havea decent staying power.   Just an FYI if you have dry skin you might want to moisturize before you apply this because it does cling to dry patches.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before I selected this BB Cream but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the best one for me. I find the consistency to be thick and hard to spread. Plus, the smell is really strongly medicinal. I can&#x27;t imagine why anyone would think this is appealing. It goes away once it&#x27;s on my face, but it&#x27;s kind of unpleasant putting it on - especially first thing in the morning. I solved these two problems by mixing it with a few drops of tinted moisturizer before applying. This probably dilutes the coverage but otherwise it won&#x27;t spread easily. Lastly, it doesn&#x27;t control oil very well. It could be because I mix it, but I still have to reapply powder multiple times during the day. I have really light skin and it&#x27;s a little dark for me (again, why I add a little bit of tinted moisturizer). It never adjusts to my skin color on its own. I don&#x27;t want to give it fewer than 3 stars because it might work really well for someone else, but not for me.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!      I have really sensitive skin. Any kind of powder and foundation (even the expensive ones I bought from sephora) make me break out.   The first BB cream I tried was from Missah. This product break me out like crazy. When I recently purchased this product. It was amazing.  with very little amount, it covered my whole face. My skin looked brighter and covered up all the redness. It fells light and It really doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. I feel my acne is also reduced.</li>
            <li> I apply this product on clean skin over acne blemishes then apply the rest of my makeup. Within an hour it looks really sweaty, cakey, greasy, and overall grosse looking. I dont have oily skin but this makes it appear that way.</li>
            <li> After reading poor reviews, I feel I had to write one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first BB cream.  I really like it.  I have used other BB creams after and this has the thickest and best coverage among those I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mainly save this for bad skin days  - when I am blemished and after peels/dermarolling as it is healing and has more coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use this for everyday as I prefer a lighter coverage.  When I do use this though, I feel confident that I look good for the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;For reference, I am an Oriental with medium skin and occasionally use Bare MInerals Medium.</li>
            <li> I bought this and after mixing with sunscreen, OBAGI, and my concealer, I love it.  BUT, recently, I have become aware that products from other countries are not held responsible for their ingredients and I am now very worried about the contents.  How do we know there isn&#x27;t lead, Berrilium, etc. Now I am very concerned.</li>
            <li> This might work pretty good for other customers but it just didn&#x27;t work that well for me. It caused my already oily enough skin to secrete more oil.</li>
            <li> A bit too thick for my liking, but color was great for my neutral porcelain skin... A little goes a long way. Okay for combo skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for oily skin, its very thick but blends well. Not recommended for medium to dark skin as it only comes in one shade...pale! :) I use it on the winter but never in summer. Over all good coverage and oil control</li>
            <li> Made me break out even worse then I was. I had to immediately stop it and then my skin improved. Would not recommend for acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I have moderate acne that never really goes away, it just migrates around my face. Sometimes it manifests in dark post-blemish marks, other times I have bright red lumps and whiteheads erupting all over the place. I am also a little self-conscious of my big ol&#x27; pores. Bare mineral powder foundation can get some good coverage but takes way too long and doesn&#x27;t last through a work day, not to mention primers making me break out. Enter BRTC Blemish Recover Balm! This stuff rocks! I wake up, wash my face, use a little toner and throw on some of this stuff. It provides just the right amount of coverage for me - evens out my skin tone, keeps my acne a little less noticeable so I feel way more confident at work. AND it doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself: Thick, creamy. I am light-skinned with pretty neutral tones, not a lot of yellow in my skin. This color matches my skintone fairly well and can be darkened up a bit with powders but overall, if you aren&#x27;t very pale, this is probably too light for you. But if you are super duper translucent white, this is probably a bit too dark. It&#x27;s a good price, too! I vote try it out.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and this felt heavy and once my skin started getting oily, this just cracked and sat there. It looked horrible within 3 hours of having it on. Also, I am pale but this was not complimenting in the least.&lt;br /&gt;Ended up throwing his away because I couldn&#x27;t even convince my friends to take it...for free!</li>
            <li> First of all, I want to point out that this particular BB cream did not cause a break out on my acne prone face. I had such a horrible experience with Dr. Jart&#x27;s silver BB, so that was the main concern for me. This product certainly gives me that nice coverage that I need. When I put this on in the morning, it will last for about 7-8 hours, then I would have to do the re-touch if it&#x27;s necessary. A number of people pointed out that this BB cream does not have a variety for different types of skin tones. Well, most of the BB creams that are manufactured in Korea does not offer that varieties. They usually offer few color tones because their targetted consumers are \\&quot;asians-- particularly Koreans\\&quot;. Yes, I&#x27;d say this BB cream is a little dark for my skin tone, so I have to mix it with other lighter liquid foundations to better match the tones. Also, it has that thick consistency, which makes it hard to spread around the face. I mix it with a moisturizer or facial oil to make them absorb better and sink in well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, 3 steps that I follow before applying BB creams:&lt;br /&gt;1. squeeze BB about a dime size on back of your hand.&lt;br /&gt;2. Mix that with a pea-size of facial oil or a moisturizer to find that consistency&lt;br /&gt;  you&#x27;re looking for.&lt;br /&gt;3. Mix again with liquid foundation to match the color of your skin-tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a light teatree oil scent. Some people might hate it, but it does not bother me that much since they&#x27;re hardly noticeable after you apply them. I&#x27;d say the smell dissapears. I might stick with this one til I find the better one; however, for now, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Being a very fair skinned red-head, I&#x27;ve always had a tough time finding liquid foundations and tinted moisturizers light enough to even remotely match my skin tone, and this product is the best for me between it&#x27;s lightness, coverage, and ability to not make me break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without any powder and just moisturizer underneath it, this BB Cream has my face looking shiny (or super friggen \\&quot;dewy\\&quot;) and slightly sunburnt (because it is a bit dark for me), so I just put on some very light colored, mattifying powder on it and it&#x27;s good to go. It also has really good coverage if you put powder on right after applying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as breakouts go, I find that this product works the best at not slaughtering the condition of my pores and current blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very pleased with this product and have been using it for over a year.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after extensive research. After the first few times I used it, I  decided it was too greasy for my face and didn&#x27;t use it for awhile. I was really disappointed. After a month or so, I learned how to control the oil production on my face and tried it again with a mattifying primer. This time I really enjoyed it and was able to let my skin reap the benefits of this BB cream! I love it now, and if my face is feeling nice and matte I&#x27;ll go ahead and use it-it does seem to keep my skin texture nice and control my blemishes as long as I don&#x27;t wear it on the most humid days! I love it.</li>
            <li> This was the first BB cream I ever tried. I&#x27;ve never been able to keep up with a makeup regime because the day after I put on foundation, I always break out. I chose this BRTC BB cream because the label said it was designed for oily, troubled skinâ€”which is exactly what I have. This product did not make me break out. However, it does nothing to control oil, and ends up looking cakey. BB creams don&#x27;t come in many colors, but because they &amp;#34;oxidize&amp;#34; after 10-15 minutes on your skin, they shouldn&#x27;t look unnatural. This one does. I&#x27;m fair-skinned with slight yellowish undertones, but this BB cream sat on my face like a mask. Seriously, I&#x27;m really paleâ€”I hate being in the sun, and this stuff STILL looks too white on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, it does NOT photograph well! I wore this to a family gathering and in every photo, it looked like I&#x27;d applied my grandma&#x27;s pressed powder in a sauna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of this stuff, I recommend Skin79&#x27;s Hot Pink BB Cream. If you have oily skin, you still might need to blot your face in the afternoon. But the Skin79 stuff is smoother and spreads much more easily, and still doesn&#x27;t make break out despite also having sun protection (which the BRTC one does not have).</li>
            <li> I have tried a few BB Creams, one which made me break out, and an American version which was just a weak tinted moisturizer. I choose this BRTC based on general good reviews, and because foundations, creams and such tend to break me out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good...it did not make me break out. The first day I used it, I thought it was, but after that first day everything seemed fine. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now.  The color seems light, but does blend well with my skin tone after applied. My skin is light to medium. The coverage is moderate. Much better than the American BB creams, but perhaps not as heavy as I would like. I have a lot of scarring, it does an OK job of covering it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad...this cream is very drying. I was hoping to cut out the use of moisturizer in my morning routine, but I feel like I actually have to use more since using this product. Also, it tends to settle in my pores and skin imperfections slightly by the end of the day. Other than that, it is a decent product. I am going to try the BRTC Jasmine Waters BB Cream next, hoping it does not settle in pores and fine lines, and is less drying. I have not noticed any improvement in my skin&#x27;s general health, and no fading of scars and discoloration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generally I believe this is a great product for someone with acne-prone, oily skin. If you have dry skin, stay away, and combo skin could go either way but is probably worth trying.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t match my skin at all but after some powder it looks good... no blemish help or any other good things about it</li>
