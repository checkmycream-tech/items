    <ol>
            <li>O&#x27;clock Shadow\\&quot; before I was done, as that was about the best result this product could offer.    </li>
            <li>For once in my life I read up on the best cordless electric razor for the value.  </li>
            <li>As I mentioned I have no idea how this razor was best for the value.</li>
            <li>F5790 is the best foil shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>(All I do is wash with it in the shower, and when my skin dries, it&#x27;s perfectly prepared for shaving.)</li>
            <li>Kudos to Amazon for excellent customer service.</li>
            <li>Very happy with it.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend humored me in trying this model out, even though he was very happy with his [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I have been shaving with an electric razor for over 20 years and have to say, for me, this one is the best one I have used.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>The shaver is wonderful, one of the best I have ever seen.  </li>
            <li>This is probably the best designed one yet.</li>
            <li>I was hoping that this would be the perfect replacement for it.  </li>
            <li>I was very happy with this Remington F5790.  </li>
            <li>That is awesome customer service!!!</li>
            <li>I have been using electric shavers for over 50 years, and this is one of the best if not the best I have ever had.</li>
            <li>Perfect!</li>
            <li>The bottom line for me is that the F5790 gives me an excellent shave, and I know that when it comes time to replace it I won&#x27;t hesitate to get another one.</li>
            <li>the trimmer is excellent</li>
            <li>Best electric shaver I have ever used,</li>
            <li>The Remington F5790 was rated by Consumer Reports magazine as a &#x27;best buy&#x27;.</li>

            <li>A Great value for the money!</li>
            <li>Oh yeah it still hold a great charge!!</li>
            <li>Excellent shave.  </li>

            <li>and this one is one of the best.</li>
            <li>My husband was very happy with the product even though took of a bit longer to arrive.  </li>
            <li>Electronically, this razor is superb.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m still very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>day.&lt;br /&gt;Remington is the best!!!</li>
            <li>But this razor is very good !</li>
            <li>This Remington makes me very happy.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve never had to change the blades or foil and both are still in very good condition.  </li>
            <li>i cant get a  very good shave&lt;br</li>
            <li>Beside that that, the unit looks very nicely made, and the battery life is awesome.</li>
            <li>Loved it!</li>
            <li>I loved it!</li>
            <li>It is the best shaver that I got, perfect and wonderful result, I like it and it is easy to carry</li>
            <li>The 1700 has a very good feel in the hand with good balance, shape and size.  </li>
            <li>In the end, this would be a great razor to see if foil shaving is for you, but as the saying goes, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Great product at a great price</li>
            <li>I found this shaver at a great deal.</li>
            <li>Used corded or cordless as a bonus, its great.  </li>
            <li>I am extremely happy with it.</li>
            <li>The shaver does a great job</li>
            <li>For the price it was a great buy.</li>
            <li>Works great for the price.  </li>
            <li>Great value, fits well</li>
            <li>Of course no one razor works for everyone, but I&#x27;ve owned and been quite happy with this one for over three years.  </li>
            <li>The trim feature is great and does not reduce power.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>it has worked great.</li>
            <li>The battery life is great.</li>
            <li>Works great for me.</li>
            <li>Has great features, just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Great razor for the price.</li>
            <li>The shaver itself is great.</li>
            <li>I have had Remington shavers for many years and have been very happy....</li>
            <li>Just be sure to consider your options so you know what is best for your needs.</li>
            <li>Good advice from Consumer Reports and a great product from Remmington.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Remington shavers for many years and this one is the best I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I like the F5790 because it is mostly a no-frills shaver but has the triple screen that I find shaves the best.  </li>
            <li>The product was delivery very quickly and arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>But there is a bright side.</li>
            <li>did I get a good shave.</li>
            <li>, it just isn&#x27;t that good a shaver.  </li>
            <li>It takes forever to get a good shave from this razor.  </li>
            <li>I decided to give this a fair shot and try it since the price was right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I still feel stubble and when I use a razor after using this I can see there is still a fair amount that the electric cannot reach.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As for the quality of the shave its a fair performer.  </li>
            <li>The tilting head is what attracted me to this razor, and while it seems like a good idea</li>
            <li>This is a good razor and a good value for the money.</li>
            <li>It seems like a good shaver.</li>
            <li>and it did a good job</li>
            <li>yet it still shaves close and gives me a shave \\&quot;as good as a blade\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Good, close shave.  </li>
            <li>This is a good shaver.</li>
            <li>Otherwise this has been a good shaver.</li>
            <li>I find it shaves fairly close without irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remington seems to lose charge over time, even if unused.  </li>
            <li>But, if you don&#x27;t want to shell out $100+, the Remington is a good choice.</li>
            <li>good shave while it lasted...</li>
            <li>Gives a good, close shave</li>
            <li>Once those are mastered, it is as good as any electric.</li>
            <li>but this one is almost as good as that</li>
            <li>but it still is a good value compared to the cost of ownership of a Braun.  </li>
            <li>I use to get a good  shave in about 5 minutes</li>
            <li>I bought this because a consumer mag gave it a good rating.</li>
            <li>I feel that the pivot head does not made good contact on the face.</li>
            <li>Not quite as good as the Remington Titanium 3 headed shaver.</li>
            <li>Good shaver for my head.  </li>
            <li>Well, thatâ€™s good to know</li>
            <li>but I loved it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good quality unit.</li>
            <li>I feel that I gave them fair trials.</li>
            <li>It is good value for the money..</li>
            <li>But, if it doesn&#x27;t give you a good, close shave, forget about it...</li>
            <li>Does a good job for the money.</li>
            <li>Good close shave...</li>
            <li>Gives a good shave, but noisy.</li>
            <li>seems to be good value for the money</li>
            <li>Holds a charge well and provides a fairly close shave (not blade close, mind you)</li>
            <li>I was concerned that the price seemed too good.</li>
            <li>It is good for the inexpensive price.  </li>
            <li>Trimmer works good, too.  </li>
            <li>While I have yet to find the perfect shaver for me, I must say that I have found MANY shavers better suited than this one.    </li>
            <li>F5 is a good value and gives a great shave so that is better then a 3 star rating to</li>
            <li>If it lasts three years or better, I will be very pleased!</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the razor.</li>
            <li>and I am very satisfied</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this razor.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the Remington shaver.  </li>
            <li>First, the shave is excellent.  </li>
            <li>My father has arthritis and there would be no way he would be able to do it at all!  </li>
            <li>I would have liked a better fitting blade cover, but works great.</li>
            <li>I amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since he wasn&#x27;t thrilled with it, I decided to try it myself.</li>
            <li>This razor is OK if you have a good amount of time to shave.  </li>
            <li>I get nice close shaves with no irritation.  </li>
            <li>Nice features.</li>
            <li>From hubby: A nice shaver.</li>
            <li>The shaver does a good job of giving you a nice close shave, it was better than the Braun I had prepped with.</li>
            <li>At this point I will never again purchase a Remington product of any kind.</li>
            <li>This razor doesn&#x27;t shave well and is too bulky to do an effective job.  </li>
            <li>F4 I was going to get and honestly would recommend it over this one.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer works nicely for my sideburns.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll be replacing it fairly soon I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li>I can go weeks without having to recharge which is really nice for trips since I don&#x27;t have to take the charger.  </li>
            <li>I had one of these literally like 15 years ago - and I liked it</li>
            <li>Nice close shave.  </li>
            <li>a positive note, the battery charge life was very good.  </li>
            <li>this product works good pros battery charge very quickly cons noisy but would recommend.</li>
            <li>The 5790 holds a strong charge for 60+ shaving minutes and does a good job shaving.  </li>
            <li>I noticed from the start that the pivot head pivots very easily and gets looser with use.  </li>
            <li>Battery gauge is very easy to read.&lt;br</li>
            <li>On the plus side, it starts up every morning just fine and has good battery life, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy another one.</li>
            <li>I always check Consumer Reports for advice--they gave this one a very good rating--the price was reasonable</li>
            <li>So even though men may not be happy with this, I think women may find it useful.</li>
            <li>I find it comfortable to hold, and the battery life is good.</li>
            <li>I liked my Remington Titanium MS3 2700 better.</li>
            <li>This has many positive reviews and a very good price.  </li>
            <li>dont forget electrc shave lolol easy to take apart and clean</li>
            <li>has worked flawlessly for me for more than four years so far.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>It gives a very comfortable &amp; close shave.  </li>
            <li>This razor is pretty good and can come in handy.  </li>
            <li>it is ok.</li>
            <li>I thought I would try a elctric razor and found out that no matter how many passes I made (I tried going over areas 20 amd 30 times)</li>
            <li>Balanced--barely and could be quite a bit better.  </li>
            <li>I have had it more than 3 months,so I can&#x27;t return it.</li>
            <li>For the price I think you could find a better razor than this.  </li>
            <li>If they call it a \\&quot;system\\&quot; it means you have to pay more money.  </li>
            <li>This one has the advantage of more floating heads to get more surface area.  </li>
            <li>The shave is not consistantly close, many stray hairs and once in a while</li>
            <li>I cannot provide a comparison on whether the 3 heads are better than 2.  </li>
            <li>and I am no longer able to use the razor.</li>
            <li>In that time I&#x27;ve owned mostly Remingtons.  </li>
            <li>a charge and gives a better shave to boot.  </li>
            <li>Much better than $200 competitors (Braun, etc.).  </li>
            <li>I am sure not all foil shavers are like this</li>
            <li>The shaves that I have been able to achieve are not at all satisfactory.  </li>
            <li>like the Braun better.</li>
            <li>Perfect for shaving my bald head and edging up my facial hair.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d be better off buying something else</li>
            <li>The price was much better than the $89 shavers there</li>
            <li>I found it interesting that the reviews here are so varied -</li>
            <li>some love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been satisfied with the one I had years ago.</li>
            <li>Much better than the Braun&#x27;s I had.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m completely satisfied with this item.  </li>
            <li>I love everything about it.  </li>
            <li>have purchased many Remington&#x27;s over the years</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do any better job in areas</li>
            <li>but f5790 is ok</li>
            <li>so why pay more for it?  </li>
            <li>The battery is not lithium ion so a charging and battery indicators while welcome really are not needed.  </li>
            <li>After more than twenty years of using Remington, I&#x27;m probably going to have to switch to Braun.</li>
            <li>Better than ones I have had for twice the price.  </li>
            <li>The 4 head Remington did a much better job.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the F5790 for about six months and have never had a better shaver than this one.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been reading some of the many one star reviews</li>
            <li>and I have had many since I started shaving 30</li>
            <li>and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>My Gillette Mach 3 gives a better shave, but I like the convenience of an electric razor.</li>
            <li>or if you are going for the Home Improvement over kill award, maybe an air compressor with a basketball needle.  :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned many Remington shavers throughout the years.</li>
            <li>There has to be a better triple foil out there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve checked up with him several time now and he is very, very happy with the razor.</li>
            <li>The F5790 has more features but takes a bit of time getting used to how it shaves.</li>
            <li>I love the power meter and the F5790 lasts about 2 weeks before it needs a recharge.</li>
            <li>I am more than satisfied with the performance of the shaver.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>IT IS OK BUT COULD DO  BETTER GETTING A CLOSER SHAVE</li>
            <li>Way better than most.</li>
            <li>and I think that I will adjust to it more as I use it.  </li>
            <li>and I am pleased with the product</li>
            <li>This is his favorite shaver</li>
            <li>and when you do expect to pay more than $20.</li>
            <li>More than one foil assembly seating design has become worn within a couple of months to the point that it just lifts up off the shaver as soon as the power is turned on.</li>
            <li>Where&#x27;s the \\&quot;better mousetrap\\&quot; that Capitalism is supposed to produce?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It shaves ok.</li>
            <li>I have had many electric razors over the years all being remington microscreens.  </li>
            <li>Then I got F5790 and love it.  </li>
            <li>I probably used to spend more on blades and shaving cream in a year than I did on the Remington.  </li>
            <li>and I am no longer able to use the razor.</li>
            <li>The rotary works much better.</li>
            <li>I can see no reason why you would pay 75% more, and what more could you get for your money.</li>
            <li>For the money you can&#x27;t do any better, and I would recommend this shaver to a friend.</li>
            <li>Over the years I have mostly used the rotory type shavers like Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>rotary flex head I bought to replace it seems to work OK, but has to be recharged every four or five days.</li>
            <li>If you are a once a week shaver, it will probably do what you want it to do (i.e., more like clippers).</li>
            <li>and I am generally pleased.  </li>
            <li>I have used a Remington shaver for many years.  </li>
            <li>I have used Remington for years and have always paid more for the foil shaver.</li>
            <li>Sure it was bulky and noisy, but it DID shave well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t buy the model below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It took some adjusting, but I found that when I move the blade slower over my face it works a lot better.</li>
            <li>This rechargeable shaver holds its charge for many days.</li>
            <li>your money and buy something else.&lt;br /&gt;You could probably get a better razor by kicking in another twenty bucks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great shaver at a decent price.</li>
            <li>It does charge quickly and the LED charge gauge on the front is really nice.  </li>
            <li>It was more comfortable to hold and the trimmer worked better.</li>
            <li>To be fair and rate it at the actual going price of $45 to $50 I think 4 stars is fair.  </li>
            <li>I bought this shaver as my old one the Remington MS2 200 which gave me many years of great shaves needed to be replaced.</li>
            <li>Not quite as good as an older brand of Remington that I used for many years.  </li>
            <li>Compared to my forty year old remington, this one works great.</li>
            <li>This unit is loud and does not do a great job shaving.  </li>
            <li>It works great on whiskers one to maybe three days old.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean and you can run it in water (in rechargeable mode and no power cord plugged in!)  </li>
            <li>While that is a design flaw too the real issue in my mind is you need to have good hand/finger strength to be able to push and pull the thing out of the shaver to clean it.  </li>
            <li>The good news is that I pursued my quest for a new shaver &amp; ordered the Panasonic ES8243A Arc IV Nano Men&#x27;s Wet/Dry Rechargeable Shaver, Blue  which got very good reviews.  </li>
            <li>would have bumped it up to 4 easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to use anywhere</li>
            <li>razor gives me a clean shave mostly.  </li>
            <li>I just made sure to keep it clean and throw a bit of oil in it every so often.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-foil tears easily.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to change the blades and the screen and the motor/battery</li>
            <li>foil shavers seem to rip too easy.  </li>
            <li>It cleaned easily.</li>
            <li>If it had, these flaws could have been easily detected.</li>
            <li>But it is easy to charge.</li>
            <li>After dozens of drops, it is stil going strong.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this model and brand.</li>
            <li>Always delivered a good shave and has decent battery life.</li>
            <li>I strongly suspect that the head set needs to be replaced already.</li>
            <li>I have used Remington products before and liked them very much.</li>
            <li>Easy to order, top quality merchandise Remington does a clean smooth shave</li>
            <li>At first I liked how close it shaved.  </li>
            <li>A good two months after getting it, I had to buy new foils because one of them was already a goner.</li>
            <li>So if you are a man who has a job or wife that likes you clean shaven on a daily basis then this would most certainly be a great product for you.</li>
            <li>The fine folks at Remington do not take returns.</li>
            <li>this evening I had the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric razor, and I did it in half the time.  </li>
            <li>works fine.  </li>
            <li>THE SHAVER  IS JUST FINE</li>
            <li>everything on the shaver works fine and it met my expectations.</li>
            <li>The trimmer works just fine.  </li>
            <li>The blades and foil also work fine.  </li>
            <li>Once you get over the wake up call in the morning, it functions fine and makes for a close shave</li>
            <li>super shave job none better</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It contours your face better than the original micro screens, and it is quick and comfortable.</li>
            <li>but because it can&#x27;t give as close a shave as I like and is HUGE that 3 is stretching a bit.    </li>
            <li>Irritation was reduced with regular use, but it never was acceptable (fyi I&#x27;ve been happy with Braun, Norelco, and Panasonic</li>
            <li>The Flex360 is light weight.  </li>
            <li>The motor is way to light for this razor.  </li>
            <li>I rated it a 3 because it is easy to clean and works as stated</li>
            <li>I rated it a 3 because it is easy to clean and works as stated</li>
            <li>and this was a smooth ride.  </li>
            <li>I, however, also shave my head and let me tell you, this thing works great for that even though it&#x27;s not advertised as such.</li>
            <li>even if they offer this at a cheap price.</li>
            <li>I have been happy with this razor and wanted to get the same one.</li>
            <li>To much to spend to take this kind of chance.</li>
            <li>If you had problems like me, call Remington toll free number, explain to them the problem you have, and they will do anything to help you.  </li>
            <li>They will even exchange your shaver for a rotary one for free.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean after use.</li>
            <li>Its light, cheap feeling plastic has give and creaks under pressure, also the foils are held in place by the flimsiest and tiniest of plastic tabs</li>
            <li>The Braun in comparison freely and smoothly pivots to maintain a 90 degree angle to the skin anddoes so to perfection.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean and just keeps running and running.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I go, it is an easy to cary and clean this product after used them.</li>
            <li>LIGHT WEIGHT.&lt;br /&gt;great</li>
            <li>It worked best when I shaved everyday after a shower.</li>
            <li>I decided to write to the company, and instead of telling me what the problem was with the shaver, they just sent me a free replacement kit (foil + cutters).</li>
            <li>GET IT WHILE STILL AVAILABLE</li>
            <li>F5790 is well balanced and has a comfortable grip.  </li>
            <li>works great, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>However, I must admit that it was easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I suspect that replacing the cutters and foils when the time comes won&#x27;t be cheap</li>
            <li>The design of the foil and pivot on the F5790 works well and the shave is close and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Having happily used Remington shavers for the last fifty years I thought nothing about replacing my worn out Remington with this model.  </li>
            <li>Would often not capture and cut light neck whiskers.  </li>
            <li>Thanks remington for creating this kind of razor.</li>
            <li>It fits comfortably in your hand and has both a pivot and pop-up.</li>
            <li>Remington F5790 is satisfactory but does not do as good a job as my old Norelco.  </li>
            <li>wise Braun clearly is a nicer shaver then a Remington too</li>
            <li>It works good but is extremely loud.</li>
            <li>As far as the shave it gives; it does fairly good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be fair, I&#x27;ve also purchased and tried for a month or more - and ultimately disposed of, a Norelco and a Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>At first, it seemed pretty good</li>
            <li>It never shaved close and compared to my old Remington, didn&#x27;t even come close to a good shave.</li>
            <li>Good shave, good battery life, quick charging, let down by a plastic protective foil cover that won&#x27;t stay in place.</li>
            <li>The old, original Remington: the \\&quot;old brick\\&quot;, was one of the best electric shavers I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>He tried this out right after shearing off his wooly coat and said it was okay</li>
            <li>so I was able to use it right away.</li>
            <li>no matter how many times you try.&lt;br /&gt;3) has a pushbutton on/off switch rather than a slide switch right where your&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li>I get a clean shave and the shaver is easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>Fortunately I found a web site that had a video on how to use it and clean it.  </li>
            <li>I love it very much and would buy  one</li>
            <li>first impressions on this shaver is that it is HUGE!  </li>
            <li>It takes me significantly longer to shave with this (up to 10 times longer) than with a razor</li>
            <li>I had gone thru the original set of foil heads after 2 months and then the replacement set that i purchased with this shaver in about 2-3 months.</li>
            <li>The original didn&#x27;t have a front and back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I may not have picked up on all those differences which collectively pushed the Remington significantly lower on the electric shaver hierarchy.</li>
            <li>The first two shaves were OK.  </li>
            <li>Man was I excited.  </li>
            <li>I think it also may run on electric while charging which the original model could not do.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>After two months, the plastic housing for the covers broke apart when I took them off to clean the razor.    </li>
            <li>and I cannot get a clean shave like with a razor.  </li>
            <li>it gets some areas almost as clean as a razor but cannot give me a clean shave all over.  </li>
            <li>I would not say this shaver does a spectacular job, and it actually requires many passes to get everything.</li>
            <li>I like to have a clean shave, and the F5790 just couldn&#x27;t give me that.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;(sigh) I wish the old MS 260hadn&#x27;t fallen apart, since it lasts longer and shaves better, but at this point it&#x27;s more duct tape than plastic and case</li>
            <li>The head pivots and it rinses in the sink to clean.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s best feature, which is disappointing as you are buying it for the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;~ Rechargeable battery that does provide a good amount of usable life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>tossed a $200 braun (2 foil) that was self cleaning and lots of bells and whistles but couldn&#x27;t give me a clean</li>
            <li>(I know will be easier as I get accustom to it); and removing the screen head to clean the cutters is not the easiest experience.  </li>
            <li>The build quality is good, it is quiet and smooth.  </li>
            <li>and it gives a close clean shave.  </li>
            <li>The product is noisey and does not shave clean.</li>
            <li>I literally had to spend 15 minutes to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li>This shaver just does the job as good or better than any other.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Having never had a \\&quot;light\\&quot; beard, I can&#x27;t say for certain, but I would imagine that it would probably do a much better job than it did on mine.</li>
            <li>This shaver is an exceptional value which performs very well and is very durable.  </li>
            <li>He has tried this three times since and said that it would be great for a man who shaves daily but for him it wasn&#x27;t exactly his cup of tea.  </li>
            <li>He likes a bit of the wiskers inbetween shavings and said that it just doesn&#x27;t do a good enough job for the once or twice a week thing.  </li>
            <li>A good addition to the glove box for last minute shaving.  </li>
            <li>I was finally able to get the head to reattach by running the unit under a fast stream of water.  </li>
            <li>Shaver is great and did a good job, but important parts have failed and made the shaver worthless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>F5790 simply does NOT give a good shave, period.</li>
            <li>for those who are looking for a good razor at a low price this is it.</li>
            <li>but I think they need much work as it has many design flaws.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good enough when I don&#x27;t have time to shave with a blade, but doesn&#x27;t shave as close.</li>
            <li>The Pivot is kind of a gimmick, a fixed Foil shaver can be positioned manually on your face, which is what you do anyways with this model.</li>
            <li>I do not believe that either is true.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve given the shaver a really good cleaning several times</li>
            <li>The result is that I get a good shave on my face, and my neck looks like total crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does fit in my hand well as the grip is right.  </li>
            <li>Like other reviewers, I purchased this item and thought it was a great product.  </li>
            <li>remember little to no pressure is better and you have to give your face 2-4 weeks to adjust, get a good no alcohol based aftershave</li>
            <li>After 5 years as a primary shaver it still holds a great charge, the beard trimmer works like a charm, and I have not had any trouble with the three blades or foil.</li>
            <li>I could not get a shave that even came close to be being worthy of the name razor.  </li>
            <li>Charge lasts forever and shaves quick and close.</li>
            <li>When the battery dies, the razor quits and does not have a quick charge function.  </li>
            <li>Fuel gauge, auto detect overseas power, quick charge and others.  </li>
            <li>adequate job?</li>
            <li>As I said, the shave is ADEQUATE</li>
            <li>The liight indicators showing how much charge is left is great.  </li>
            <li>(yes it has a quick charge as well,</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m relegating this shaver to my desk drawer at work, should I ever find myself in need of a quick &#x27;touch-up.</li>
            <li>and I expected to enjoy a good shaver for some time.</li>
            <li>My lucky break came when I went on vacation and dropped my Braun on the tile bathroom floor of the hotel.</li>
            <li>I found this Remington to fit the bill nicely, and it was only $34.00.</li>
            <li>I found on my face, it works great - shaves very close, and as other reviews state, it is very quick.</li>
            <li>To Remington&#x27;s credit they have replaced the first two at no charge and shipped them to me for free.    </li>
            <li>It gives me a consistently close, smooth shave on both my head and face.  </li>
            <li>the very first day, it didn&#x27;t give me a close shave.</li>
            <li>its good holds charge long time</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean, and the swivel head does a decent job shaving.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;July 12 2012:  New cutters and screen shave better, yes.  </li>
            <li>ok, I just replace with new one at walmart...</li>
            <li>That said I alternate blade and electric all the time, and this is a pretty good one.  </li>
            <li>However, my rotary shaver that I still use always is easy to shave even if I didn&#x27;t shave for a whole week.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is rinseable, but that seems to be less effective than just cleaning the cut beard with the included brush - or better yet a can of air</li>
            <li>Great shaver, long lasting, easy to clean</li>
            <li>Still, if I&#x27;m in a real hurry, I&#x27;ll use it and it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>I read some con&#x27;s about the size of this shaver, but as I have big hands, I find it to be a very comfortable fit for me.  </li>
            <li>For my money this is a great little shaver.  </li>
            <li>It was quicker at the beginning and as time went on you would need to take a little more time and a few more reps but a very good razor.</li>
            <li>It took a few days to get my face used to this razor, but now it is great -- lots of power (sounds like a rice rocket taking off).  </li>
            <li>on the Braun, I want you all to know, this is a great shaver for the price, and don&#x27;t waste your money on the hype surrounding Braun razors.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This could have been a great shaver with a few common-sense tweaks.</li>
            <li>The indicator light is very helpful.  </li>
            <li>For nearly $60 dollars, you can find a better alternative.</li>
            <li>My dear hubby finally got around to shaving his beard off because it is getting warm.  </li>
            <li>Almost every day, for an entire year, despite trying my best, I would get to work and find at least one (and usually many) hairs that it had missed.  </li>
            <li>My 10 month old worn out rotary blades give me a better shave than this one.  </li>
            <li>My old TA 4570 gives a much better shave.  </li>
            <li>the flexible head allows for more efficient shaving than the old model performed.  .</li>
            <li>First the good; It actually shaves pretty close.</li>
            <li>But for anyone who actually enjoys shaving or wants to enjoy shaving and where shave closeness and comfort are more important than cost, then do yourself a favour and skip this shaver.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll worth it for the cost.</li>
            <li>My 8 year old Remington triple foil shaved much better.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is much better on the F5790 than on my old Remington.</li>
            <li>Over the nearly 40 years, I&#x27;ve had four different Remington&#x27;s, one being a great triple-cutter (MS3-2700 -</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny of $34.</li>
            <li>Works great, close shave and the battery life is far longer than my last shaver.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>but it was well worth it to get something that works.</li>
            <li>far, my impression is that it is not a terrible shaver for its price.</li>
            <li>I spend more than twice the time shaving as I did with my old remington and still&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am pretty loyal to Remington for that close shave, and this doesn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li>One surprising thing about the Remington is that the cutters and screen do not seem to fill up with whisker shavings like other shavers I have used.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had other remingtons with 3 foils and good results.  </li>
            <li>While the shaver works OK (but nothing special), the foils don&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>and he was right.</li>
            <li>A 7345XL, $59 at Kohls right now), and</li>
            <li>Yep, you heard right, ivory soap.</li>
            <li>It was as if the foil wasn&#x27;t allowing in any of the longer hair, just going right over it instead.  </li>
            <li>Please send me the right one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the blades or something else, but it just doesn&#x27;t give a good smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>While this shaver is a great product, for me it is really just to average.</li>
            <li>This one is not so hot and doesn&#x27;t shave any better than fixed head shavers.</li>
            <li>really like the Braun clean and renew system though it can get pricey buying all the refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really pleased with the new shaver as it really does shave as close as a blade.  </li>
            <li>The single good thing I can say about it is that the battery charge lasts as much as six weeks.</li>
            <li>- apparently it doesn&#x27;t work with all shapes and sizes of faces or something :)  </li>
            <li>As most have already said, the Remington F5790 delivers a good shave at first but after a few weeks I found I was having more pain due to the \\&quot;rougher\\&quot; shave.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this shaver, it is smooth shaving with very little effort.</li>
            <li>I was expecting it to leave the shaved area as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom, but even if it manages to catch the hair, the area is left feeling dry and not as smooth as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>Having used various Braun, Norelco, and Panasonic shavers over the years, I decided that I could probably be almost as happy with an (relatively) inexpensive Remington.  </li>
            <li>I figured Remington had to have tech as good as a 3-5 year old shaver from the big boys.  </li>
            <li>But since then, I&#x27;ve had more and more trouble with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The clippers actually work better than the blades, and I have a fair amount of facial hair to keep trimmed and neat as well as facial areas that need to be shaved clean.  </li>
            <li>It is also more difficult to clean (I haven&#x27;t been able to figure out how to get the head cover off easily to rinse it  out).</li>
            <li>did  Very fast and no irritation.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Instead of buying new heads, cheap as they are, I have switched back to a blade while I do some more shopping for a replacement.</li>
            <li>i liked my old remington tf 300 better.it gets a  better close shave easyer with less effort.</li>
            <li>I would much rather pony up a little bit more money to get a more reliable shaver.</li>
            <li>Since the beard trimmer is larger than on other electric shavers, and the way it was positioned so I could easily grip it, I found I loved shaving my legs with it.</li>
            <li>The charge does not last the 20 days but more like 2-4 days.  </li>
            <li>This razor is mediocre at best.</li>
            <li>I have used many electric shavers and I would rate this Remington somewhere above the Norelco shavers and beneath the Braun shavers.</li>
            <li>At first I thought I just needed to get used to it.  </li>
            <li>I just bought my first Norelco this morning (</li>
            <li>So, I really trust these guys when it comes to having a razor in my face!</li>
            <li>Also it shaves pretty close.</li>
            <li>At first I tried it on my face when hairs were longer.</li>
            <li>I then thought that it may be better suited for short hairs.</li>
            <li>Will it shave consistently over time and save you hassle on the way to work?</li>
            <li>However, after giving this one shot there was no way that I was willing to stay the course.  </li>
            <li>It does work pretty well though.  </li>
            <li>This was my first foil electric that I ever used/owned.  </li>
            <li>It has become a pretty convenient shaver.  </li>
            <li>Even before that, it only shaved ok.</li>
            <li>After using Braun shavers for most of my life I decided to try something different.</li>
            <li>it was loud just as loud as the remmington f5 but didnt shave anywhere near as good...</li>
            <li>Just ordered the first replacement foil and blades.  </li>
            <li>We were surprised to find this one was still available.  </li>
            <li>You hand and wrist will do a better job, especially with their implementation of it.  </li>
            <li>I suspect you will not have the issue of many people rating this low</li>
            <li>Fortunately I hadn&#x27;t thrown away the old screen assy</li>
            <li>Be aware of buying a replacement cutter and screen assy for this model.</li>
            <li>I love their regular microscreen shavers.</li>
            <li>First, I want to mention that the F5790 was a Remington replacement for a MS2-390 shaver with defective battery.  </li>
            <li>I finally have to replace the foils for the first time and thats mostly because I dropped it</li>
            <li>The first time I used the F5790, I was amazed with the first path I ran across my cheek.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this razor was because replacement cutters for my old Remington were no longer available.  </li>
            <li>I chose this product because I have used it many times in the past and have always been pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>This is the first review I have ever written.</li>
            <li>It performs as well or better than many more expensive shavers.</li>
            <li>My first electric razor in years</li>
            <li>Husband tried for the first this week and loves it.  </li>
            <li>The major benefit of shavers such as a Braun Activator is the self-cleaning mechanism, which may sound like a luxury that you don&#x27;t need, but is actually very important.</li>
            <li>Also, I do have sensitive and fair scin, and this does not burn or mark me up in any way, even with a few weeks worth of growth!</li>
            <li>Build quality a bit off (cheap price?), adapter not build-in, kind of bulky to bring for travel (but may not need it because the battery pretty long, over 3 weeks if used daily.)    </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, this is the first time that I have felt so positive about a product, that I felt obligated to voice my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Clean shave, battery lasts long, easy to clean, powerful, low price.    </li>
            <li>The cutters on the new model appear to be better and more firmly seated.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wide rectangular-shaped handle that felt neither comfortable nor secure in the hand.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend that you shave frequently and maybe even start with a clean razor shaved face.</li>
            <li>Three skinny, while being no worse, is not any better then two larger sizes foils</li>
            <li>really that means it should last 12 months for most people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t waste your money - Rated good by consumer reports but it is really a POS</li>
            <li>On the positive side, I like the size.</li>
            <li>While it does a decent job - like most other electric razors, it still never gets me as clean as I would like.  </li>
            <li>and if you don&#x27;t shave on weekends, you will not be able to cut the long hairs.</li>
            <li>OK, minor inconvenience.  </li>
            <li>I think my hair doesn&#x27;t go inside the top part of it correctly if it&#x27;s too long.</li>
            <li>I have a thick/rough beard and really likes the sped of the first razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I do find more pros than cons, I think the negative definitely outweighs the good in this case.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as past Norelco products.</li>
            <li>Not sure if that is good.  </li>
            <li>I had an older version with only two foils that did a much better job.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other electric shavers and found that rotary blades seem to work better for me than this more traditional type of shaver.  </li>
            <li>I let my beard go for 2 or 3 days, the shaver is less effective on longer hair???</li>
            <li>The price seemed low, but having used it several times I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>short don&#x27;t buy this model if you expect an easy shave.</li>
            <li>A single charge lasted more than two weeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can say that had I seen how large this shaver was I wouldn&#x27;t have gotten it.  </li>
            <li>I can say that had I seen how large this shaver was I wouldn&#x27;t have gotten it.  </li>
            <li>The F5790 is certainly an upgrade.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, the shaving head itself takes up too large a surface area.</li>
            <li>This razor ran for over two weeks on the first charge -- it came with a full charge, or maybe less than a full charge so it should do better on the next charge.  </li>
            <li>I am on the second shaver of this model - it does a fine job.</li>
            <li>Your not going to get as close of a shave on your neck as compared to using a traditional razor but for me thats fine because I get ingrown hairs on my neck if I do.</li>
            <li>It is inexpensive and it is a fine daily shaving tool.</li>
            <li>It works fine for touch up or daily shave.</li>
            <li>The shave is close with a single slow pass - the flex and pivot functions really allow this shaver to do a good job up top.</li>
            <li>and I spent more time re-shaving than if I had used a straight razor and shaving cream.</li>
            <li>This shaver was huge compared to my last Remington.  </li>
            <li>It has a comfortable solid feel and very close shave.  </li>
            <li>For the price, I expected it to perform as the online reviews indicated, as it was ranked one of the top head shavers for 2015.  </li>
            <li>Ergonomic--not really.  </li>
            <li>This shaver does not shave very close.  </li>
            <li>It gives a very close shave, but not evenly across the whole face.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice it until I pulled it out of the box and saw them side by side.  </li>
            <li>I used to have a Braun, but no way was I going to pay that much again for a razor at this time.  </li>
            <li>The angle of the foils and the fact that they pivot is a real plus when shaving the neck area.  </li>
            <li>But it just does not shave very close</li>
            <li>the whole heads attachment would stay on while shaving.</li>
            <li>My Panasonic doesn&#x27;t deliver as close of shave, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much either.</li>
            <li>It does not work very well.</li>
            <li>I guess I didn&#x27;t lose too much money</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak for battery life because I haven&#x27;t used it that much</li>
            <li>Very disapointing product.</li>
            <li>Braun looks \\&quot;more cool\\&quot;, has more flashy features, and is built with more solid materials.</li>
            <li>Perhaps not quite as ergonomic as others, but definitely usable and comfortable.    </li>
            <li>so much irritation there).</li>
            <li>However, this made-in-China item is a real turkey.</li>
            <li>Much easier on the Panasonic</li>
            <li>One or two buttons have always worked well and work much easier too then</li>
            <li>It gave me a very close shave and the trimmer</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m being generous here in giving it two stars, one for price and one for the somewhat reasonable shave closeness from a budget shaver.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>VERY DURABLE.AND</li>
            <li>thing is fast.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care much about that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cost too much.</li>
            <li>THIS ITEM TO AMAZON CUSTOMERS THANKS FROM ERIC JOHNSON</li>
            <li>Much quieter.</li>
            <li>The pivot is also bulky and ends up touching the skin, my old shaver foil had no pivot body around the foil so the only thing that touch the skin was the 3 foils, which made it much easier to maneuver.</li>
            <li>Very close.</li>
            <li>VERY noisy, does not work on my face.</li>
            <li>,thanks Frank Davis</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>/&gt;-blades don&#x27;t sit straight when replaced.</li>
            <li>The battery recharge is also much quicker than that of the MS3 1700.</li>
            <li>It is a quality item and works very well.</li>
            <li>, he really likes the close shave he gets.</li>
            <li>I had about three weeks worth of growth, and I used the tripper feature to knock that out, and then fixed up the stubble with the foil head.</li>
            <li>This shaver did dot perform very well for me at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very dissatisfied with this shaver.</li>
            <li>This thing hurts to use and doesn&#x27;t shave very well.</li>
            <li>Still use a blade if I want a really close shave.</li>
            <li>Nothing really worked.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First, as others have noted, it has a very clunky design.</li>
            <li>It gives to me a very deep and smooth bear cut.</li>
            <li>Are all of the rave reviews really legitimate???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I figured a well know brand name like Remington would insure at least a fairly good product.  </li>
            <li>use it for few weeks to get used to it, i would buy another if needed ,, definetly worth the price,very satisfied</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard, so kind of bummed.</li>
            <li>Three, it is quite powerful, even with the pop-up trimmer fully extended, and it holds enough of a charge for a week&#x27;s worth of shaves, without any noticeable loss of power and/or quality of shaves.</li>
            <li>Design is not really good because it seem to be able to break easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only owned about four electric shavers, and two of them were the original Remington micro screens, which this one pretty much is, albeit, a new style.</li>
            <li>This is my first foil shaver, the last one I had was given to me as a gift more than 20 years ago (different brand).</li>
            <li>They advertise you can clean it with water, but in the manual they only recommend that once a month.</li>
            <li>The motor sound&#x27;s tone isn&#x27;t pleasant either so it became annoying to use pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>The battery does not last as long as the older one I own.</li>
            <li>I decided I had only 2 things that were utmost important in my decison for a new shaver.</li>
            <li>In less than 10 minutes, I have a very smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>Battery life is adequate, but I expected more from such a huge shaver (maybe the big loud motor took up all the space).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The first thing that I noticed, is that it was fairly light compared to a couple of other electrics I&#x27;ve purchased over the years.</li>
            <li>Still it seems better to me than the average review it&#x27;s gotten to this point.  </li>
            <li>Thereâ€™s a good reason I have only used Norelco and Braun up to this point, and will go back to only using those brand of razors.  </li>
            <li>Many whiskers are not removed without multiple passes and/or using the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;The shave is fast and non-irritating except for the missed whiskers which require extra time.</li>
            <li>to shave off his beard to please his new girlfriend!</li>
            <li>and they sent a new one!</li>
            <li>My three previous have been a cheaper version that for the most part do their job.  </li>
            <li>I believe the F5790 provides a better shave than my previous razor</li>
            <li>It did a medioker job of shaving compared to my older one.</li>
            <li>but he said he would try it a few more times as I guess the hair is much softer when it&#x27;s been grown out like that for a bit.  </li>
            <li>My three main problems were as follows:  1.  </li>
            <li>The charge holds for about 5-7 decent days of shaving, so take the cord if you&#x27;ll need it longer on trips, etc.  </li>
            <li>It nicked me more than a shave with a razor blade and left my neck red and sore, without shaving away all the wiskers found there.</li>
            <li>but overall I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with the job it does on my head and will likely continue to use it for that even if I use a razor for my face.    </li>
            <li>It is too close to the main body when it pops up</li>
            <li>does do a decent shave...quickly and without water...</li>
            <li>This is like a toy you give your 3-year old son: it looks like an electric shaver, it makes a buzzing sound, but it doesn&#x27;t actually do anything.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This has 3 foils ,which is the main reason I wanted it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After letting it charge for a day, I gave it a shot, and it did a decent job on my face</li>
            <li>It replaced another older model Remington.</li>
            <li>For the money you can&#x27;t go wrong, I love the 3 Foil system the most out of all the shavers out there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Remington shavers for years, and when the last one wore out after 12 years of service, I thought I&#x27;d be brand loyal and go with Remington again.  </li>
            <li>Why can&#x27;t we manufacture a decent electric razor?</li>
            <li>The shave is only adequate.  </li>
            <li>I think a more expensive electric razor will get a better shave, but this is not bacd.  </li>
            <li>This shaver was a BIG disappointment after having seen it first in the June 2011 Consumer Reports magazine that gave it a CR Best Buy rating.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this electric shaver upon receiving it, but I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month and, frankly</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This model was highly rated by Consumers Reports, but it didn&#x27;t work up to my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;I returned it and had no problems with the service.</li>
            <li>HIghly recommended</li>
            <li>I bought this razor because it was rated highly by Consumer Reports.</li>
            <li>I have never been an electric razor guy, but I saw this one was fairly highly rated and thought I would try it.</li>
            <li>where the F5790 is highly rated.</li>
            <li>For a shaver with a high rating, who is doing the rating?  </li>
            <li>Even with the pivot action, some spots under chin need to be repeatedly shaved because the head is rather large.</li>
            <li>should have either gotten new foil/blades for my Panasonic, bought better new electric, or go back to blades (my current plan).  </li>
            <li>but I find it takes up too much of my time to use it to get it anywhere near as close a shave as I like.  </li>
            <li>the Braun had no trouble with--ones that don&#x27;t grow straight out.</li>
            <li>So far this razor has been giving me very close shaves</li>
            <li>The few wiskers it managed to grab it plucked more than cut</li>
            <li>so perhaps a teenage guy with a few wispy hairs might find this useful - sure didn&#x27;t work it</li>
            <li>This was definitely not what I expected (size wise) as I see much smaller electric razors in the stores.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer works OK but also requires a few passes before it cleans up nicely.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would have been willing to pay say twice as much if the foil heads would last say maybe a year and</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe this is normal for this type of razor</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sticking with my disposable razors, where I know I can use a fresh blade every time and get exacting close shave without all the extra work, just for electric.</li>
            <li>number of people normally have issues with the foils.  </li>
            <li>He says cheapy razors he&#x27;s owned in past were superior and one third the price.</li>
            <li>I take good care of my shavers and have not had to change blades and heads often, usually once every couple of years or so, but after only six months (the recommended time in the manual)</li>
            <li>for this Remington electric, it&#x27;s \\&quot;okay.\\&quot; Good, but certainly not great.</li>
            <li>I though, if I paid a ridiculously high price for a new shaver, I would be happier.</li>
            <li>Of course, your mileage may vary, but I&#x27;d certainly look around for other shavers before making a purchase of this model as you can probably do better for about the same price.</li>
            <li>I see one real advantage of the old one --- you could replace the foils separately on the old one and on the new one you need to replace the whole assembly.</li>
            <li>100 percent better than my husband&#x27;s previous razor!</li>
            <li>I have owned several Remington razors in the past and liked them better than other brands I have used.  </li>
            <li>My previous shaver, which is three year old, provides a better shave that this brand new Remington.</li>
            <li>If you are a long time Remington user, you will find this to be a nice upgrade, but if not I would check out other shavers first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li>We got the new shaver based on a Consumer Reports review and the price found on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>a lemon or Remington is going for the new movie star look.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Now that I have the new one</li>
            <li>I decided to pick up a new Remington</li>
            <li>and I am waiting delivery of my new Phillips-Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li>and I would recommend it to everyone needing a new foil shaver.</li>
            <li>This new Remington</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to the shavers with the 3 circular blades, so going to one like this was something new.  </li>
            <li>Their new ones I see they do sell just the foil.  </li>
            <li>I know I will have to get new foils every two months or so.</li>
            <li>Like the new charging stand.</li>
            <li>If I ever need a new one I will get anothe one like this.</li>
            <li>I had to return one brand new foil as defective when it wouldn&#x27;t snap into place at all.</li>
            <li>I do not like to give bad reviews, but I can honestly say that there are better products out there</li>
            <li>Two, it may be used wet - and both the cutters and foil can be rinsed under the sink to clean.</li>
            <li>F5790 delivers an improvement on past Remington Shavers but shows that they still can&#x27;t stand up to Braun and Panasonic for long term happiness.</li>
            <li>It is on the back and slides straight up, so you can&#x27;t really use it.  </li>
            <li>providing a decent close shave and more difficult to clean then a rotory shaver.</li>
            <li>The only thing I do not like very much about it is the trimmer.</li>
            <li>Very loud and did not shave well.</li>
            <li>Even with the pivot head, and very little stubble, it still does not catch every hair no matter how many times you go over it.  </li>
            <li>One minor problem was that one of the blades occasionally pops off when you remove the foil, but it&#x27;s easily reseated.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get a fairly smooth shave in less than 10 minutes, and it requires constant and repeated passes over the same skin area to achieve anything close to a smooth shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Of course my beard is very grey so the little hairs don&#x27;t show much, except in the right light.    </li>
            <li>I would rate this higher but after 3 weeks the head would not click back in place.  </li>
            <li>This is your average inexpensive cordless shaver, maybe not as cheap as some others out there even though it should be.</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver originally for an international trip to avoid any hassles with trying to take disposables or with trying to go on local shopping trips for toiletries.</li>
            <li>I had good luck with this razor during the first few months of use, but then it seemed to fall apart due to regular use.  </li>
            <li>Second one after I dropped the first one.</li>
            <li>I think that is pretty short lived!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Remington makes better shavers for not much more money.</li>
            <li>pleasantly surprised by the shave that I received!  </li>
            <li>Read on various websites and reviews that foil shavers were better for those that shaved on a daily basis such as myself.  </li>
            <li>I have always used a Remington shaver and this is the most difficult model to clean.</li>
            <li>requesting a new one when the soft vinyl cover on the on off switch broke and no one to repair it.</li>
            <li>so I had to remove the screens from the new plastic holder and insert them into the old holder and this seems to have solved the problem.  </li>
            <li>Just pull the old one out and put the new one in.  </li>
            <li>it was overdue for a new foil (the razor was a year old).</li>
            <li>The foil developed a hole after one month, the company would not send me a new foil.  </li>
            <li>With the Braun shavers I owned previously, I would replace the foil and cutter once every 18 months, just to keep the shave smooth.</li>
            <li>I believe the foil curves are too small and even with triple surfaces I get a better shave with my old Remington dual foils.  </li>
            <li>Very loud buzzing on this shaver compared to my old Norelco rotary.</li>
            <li>feel that the negative reviews for the Remington F5790 are attributed more to inexperience and new users of electric razors.  </li>
            <li>I previously had a Remington MS5100 that has worked great for at least 3 years.  </li>
            <li>I previously would use the foil on most of my face and the pop-up trimmer on my neck and to go back over anything that was missed.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s more convenient, no water and no shaving cream required so total time is probably less.  </li>
            <li>I charged this once so far and have used this for several weeks and it is still near full power and has not been recharged since the initial 24 hour charge.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You should use no pressure at all or at least very light pressure.  </li>
            <li>If I shave everyday, this shaver will work fine.</li>
            <li>He says that this shaver would not cut certain whiskers on his face even though he passed over the same area, 5, 10 and even 15 times!  </li>
            <li>They certainly haven&#x27;t lived up to the traditional Made in America reputation!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a hefty shaver, is is comfortable in the hand, but it is a little bulky.  </li>
            <li>For this reason, I would recommend investing the extra money in a shaver that can clean itself and save you valuable time and stress in the long run.</li>
            <li>Only complaints - louder than most - trimmer is a little klutzy.</li>
            <li>but because it can&#x27;t give as close a shave as I like and is HUGE that 3 is stretching a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you using razors stick with them and don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li>I am very dissatisfied with it, and have gone back to my old Panasonic Shaver.</li>
            <li>Slight problem learning how to clean and guard.</li>
            <li>This product is clearly inferior and I just hope I can get something for the piece of junk on Ebay.</li>
            <li>It takes a while to get your beard accustom to electric razors, and your face needs to be clean, dry and use a talcum product such as the Remington Powder Stick, which I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>clear plastic protective cover quit attaching months ago.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sleek and a bit loud.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this razor for my 97 year old father in law.</li>
            <li>I picked up my 15 year old electric razor and started using it again.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t use it until I found that I could use my old Remington cover with it..</li>
            <li>so have had to return to my old one.</li>
            <li>Wish I could get my old one fixed.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as my old Remington 3 head shaver</li>
            <li>My wallet smarts whenever it gets near one of those 300 dollar shavers.  </li>
            <li>I also like the fact it has LEDs showing how much power is left.  </li>
            <li>hoping that they have discovered the design flaw and fixed it.  </li>
            <li>I received this as a gift and it replaced an old Norelco that was just worn out.  </li>
            <li>It is not where near as close as a razor blade.</li>
            <li>and then when you get low the last light turns to red.  </li>
            <li>Then I would be self conscious about it for the rest of the day.  </li>
            <li>As if that weren&#x27;t enough, it&#x27;s much quieter too.  </li>
            <li>My old razor, a Remington MS 260, runs 3 weeks to a month&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
            <li>Do they shave as close as a blade or as close as my old MS 260?</li>
            <li>I have somewhat sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I purchased the Remington razor to replace a Remington Rotary razor that was over 10 years old.  </li>
            <li>The shaver is bulky and loud if that bothers you.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s really the only plus I would give it.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>When the time came to replace the blades I found that replacement blades cost nearly as much as replacing the entire unit.  </li>
            <li>but my wife says that my face feels baby soft which ive never had with the panasonic.</li>
            <li>WOW.  </li>
            <li>My husband wanted to replace the razor he had with one just like his old one.  </li>
            <li>My 5 year old Panasonic ES8068N wet/dry linear shaver was dying, going about 2-3 days between charges.  </li>
            <li>Braun has a weaker motor so not as loud</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver to replace my old Norelco</li>
            <li>This is an extremely loud electric shaver.</li>
            <li>This thing is really loud.</li>
            <li>My last shaver was a rotary shaver that works really will.</li>
            <li>wow, what a difference.</li>
            <li>Much slower than a razor and shave cream, and doesn&#x27;t actually cut hair.  </li>
            <li>And it I apply too much pressure, the trimmer pop back in.</li>
            <li>It gives the closest shave next to a Straight razor.</li>
            <li>It holds a charge well so far.</li>
            <li>I remember the old fashioned 6MF1 shavers which I wish I could buy now.</li>
            <li>pivoting action is &#x27;so-so.&#x27;</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li>I have used this shaver for nearly a year.  </li>
            <li>It not only doesn&#x27;t give him a smooth shave, it takes numerous passes over each area and actually misses hairs!</li>
            <li>It takes him 3 x longer to shave with this razor, than his old one.</li>
            <li>The package was ripped completely and held together with duct tape.</li>
            <li>This razor is incredibly loud.</li>
            <li>I got this for my dad to replace his old Remington MS2 370.</li>
            <li>SO, I have purchased replacement Ni-MH batteries for the old razor.</li>
            <li>And yes, it is loud.  </li>
            <li>IT DOES NOT SHAVE IF THE BEARD IS OVER 12 HOURS OLD.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick with my 25 year old Norelco.</li>
            <li>I gave up using that feature near the start, and just keep it locked into position.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m ready to write off Remington as a source for any shaver of mine in the future based on this piece of junk.</li>
            <li>This one however is a complete dud.</li>
            <li>In 2012 I bought a fancy Braun rechargeable foil shaver after my old trustworthy, $25.00 Remington broke.</li>
            <li>My old Remington died so I decided to upgrade.  </li>
            <li>I recently purchased a Norelco and it took me twice as long to get a reasonably close shave that didn&#x27;t seem to last a full</li>
            <li>So far it has performed well.</li>
            <li>Very close ,he does not need an extra blade to go over his face</li>
            <li>/&gt;Oh, and it&#x27;s LOUD.</li>
            <li>my old remington gave out so looked in Consumers mag.</li>
            <li>This thing has so many negative features that I will throw it in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li>not waste your time or money on this shaver.</li>
            <li>I am not a big electric shaver kind of guy, I have a Braun shaver that I had purchased a few years ago, but have moved back to the blades.</li>
            <li>THEY TOOK THE BEST PART OF THE SHAVING HEAD OFF AND REPLACED IT WITH A PIECE OF JUNK SOME IDIOT ENGINEER DESIGNED..</li>
            <li>The shave was so close and fast, there was absolutely no razor burn/irritation (normal for new users or improper use of electric razors).  </li>
            <li>I bought the Remington F5790 within the past year because my previous Remington that I loved had died.</li>
            <li>This one is also huge compared to my other razor and for all that size the battery life seems very short.</li>
            <li>It really is a good shaver with one major flaw and a couple of useless features.  </li>
            <li>It does take a little longer to shave, and it&#x27;s a little messier than the rotaries, but it gives a nice close shave now that I&#x27;m using it properly, which is all I could really ask for.  </li>
            <li>firmly, I get 5 o&#x27;clock shadow instead of a clean shave.  </li>
            <li>but it was mainly because I had the Braun 790cc-4 at the same time</li>
            <li>When the time comes to replace the blades, the old models required that I install each of the three blades individually -- not a tremendously difficult task, but one that requires careful attention and hand-eye</li>
            <li>I have reverted back to the older products.</li>
            <li>I only use it once or twice a month after the first 2 weeks of testing and I&#x27;ve only charged it once.</li>
            <li>He had an older model and requested the same thing again.  </li>
            <li>I think the main problem with this shaver is it has only one type of foil screen design.</li>
            <li>Next time I&#x27;ll read the reviews first, even though my prior experience has been positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;Update: After using this for about a week, I have found that it is a decent razor, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>They wear down fast and you have to replace them, so the savings don&#x27;t really make up for the replacement</li>
            <li>This razor gets an extremely close shave even closer than a blade if used right.  </li>
            <li>After a history of disappointing experiences with electric razors, I was looking forward to having a good experience with new and updated model.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t picture how much difference it would make considering how long it took me to get a somewhat close shave using this.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t picture how much difference it would make considering how long it took me to get a somewhat close shave using this.  </li>
            <li>Motor is to noisy almost sound like a small motor boat.</li>
            <li>This razor is barely a year old</li>
            <li>You do need to use the trimmer on the side to get the long hairs which doesnt take much effort and then use the shaver itself.</li>
            <li>The real plus is the long battery life .....</li>
            <li>razor works very well and holds a charge for a long period of time.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t shave nearly as well as the old Braun with the Flex head and the old Braun only had two blades and foils.</li>
            <li>First, this thing is by far louder than any other shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>For a brand new sharp razor it doesnt cut very well.</li>
            <li>After a while I started shaving every other day as I started enjoying shaving less and less.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can only order the foil kit which includes extra blades, which you certainly don&#x27;t need since you have only had the razor a short while, and the kit cost almost as much as the razor.</li>
            <li>The only possible drawback, and I am being overly critical here, is that the unit is naturally going to be little more top-heavy compared to the (less-expensive)</li>
            <li>It is smoother than an almost new Remington rotary blade shaver she gave me last Christmas.  </li>
            <li>When my Braun died, I looked at the prices of new ones and decided to go back to Remington.</li>
            <li>Normally a new shaver is supposed to be charged for  24 hrs before initial use, This shaver arrived fully charged indicating that it had been used..</li>
            <li>but the foil always ripped for me - bought a new one and it ripped like the next day -</li>
            <li>: it really doesn&#x27;t shave me all that closely, even with liquid preparation or the dry stuff.  </li>
            <li>It requires the pop-up trimmer for anything longer than 1/16 of an inch, multiple times over most spots to cleanly shave, face pulling and awkward movement to shave beneath my chin.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the Remington is awkward or heavy at all, in fact it feels perfect in my hands.  </li>
            <li>I few months ago I purchased a Braun Series 5 from Costco at a super deal.  </li>
            <li>They advertise this new one as having a third cutter, this is true but the 3 cutters are much smaller and a little shorter than the 2 cutters in my old one.</li>
            <li>They cost so much that they call them shaving systems, which reminds me of the vacuum cleaner man calling his canister vac a \\&quot;cleaning system\\&quot; not a vacuum cleaner.</li>
            <li>major flaw is that I followed the manual&#x27;s instructions for ordering replacement parts and this shaver isn&#x27;t even on the list on Remington&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li>It has three major advantages.</li>
            <li>This razor is a major improvement to the performance of my &amp;#34;very old&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t detect the subtle claims of smoothness in these foil shavers, to me they are mostly the same in feel.  </li>
            <li>All it does is wet the beard shavings and cakes them up in the blades making it even harder to clean.</li>
            <li>My last Remington before the F5790 was a fantastic shaver with one fatal flaw:  it only worked as a cordless, so when the battery went kaput a little over a year ago</li>
            <li>and I thought this would be a great replacement but turned out to be a bad bet.  </li>
            <li>Also, the general shape and ergonomics of the handle itself are just off.</li>
            <li>The charge indicator is very helpful and the charge lasts long enough for a two week vacation without the charger.  </li>
            <li>you were actually an adult male which I assume were the intended users.</li>
            <li>I literally had to go back into the garbage and pull out my old razor and charge it up to finish my face.  </li>
            <li>My old Remington triple foil was at the point that it only held a charge for a week and since i bought it reconditioned from Remington for $30 dollars</li>
            <li>this razor so far has been terrific...</li>
            <li>This means you need to frequently use the trimmer, especially on your neck.  </li>
            <li>Replace my old Remington F5790 Pivot &amp; Flex razor with the same thing.</li>
            <li>While my wiskers were growing, my wife said \\&quot;enough is enough\\&quot; and went a bought me a Norelco for an early Father&#x27;s day Present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>have not used it much since purchasing the replacement screen as I have been using my Father&#x27;s Day present on a regular basis, and keeping the Remington as my back up razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Our old shaver cord works on it; so I decided to keep it since I could not buy one locally.  </li>
            <li>It works very well, although it is bit harder to handle than the MS3 2700.  </li>
            <li>It offers two larger sized foils and the foil/blade replacements are a bit cheaper.  </li>
            <li>but it works to move the tiny sized blades to give a close shave as well, nearly as close as a Remington.  </li>
            <li>The blades rotate much slower than what I expected.</li>
            <li>Bought it to replace my old one that lasted several years.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, this unit fits in the old zipper pouch that came with my last MS2-390.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I like the swivel action of the head, the out of the way trimmer and the lights indicating the current status of the battery.  </li>
            <li>do find the reviews about holes occurring in the foil that allow the blade to cut the skin troublesome, although I have not had any problems with it so far (as I would hope, after only owning it for 2 days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After pulling, stretching, and burning, you can almost get as close as a normal razor, but it takes about 5 times as long.</li>
            <li>While most give me razorburn, this one had the added letdown of a poor shave.    </li>
            <li>It is noisy, it did not do a good job of shaving the hair on my face and neck, and it definitely does not compare much to my old Philips Norelco 7310XL Rotary Shaver that is less expensive and does do a decent job of cleaning up my face and neck.</li>
            <li>Maybe they are too thick to fit through the screen.  </li>
            <li>It did not do a good job cutting the longer hairs on my neck.</li>
            <li>A bit noisy and bulky, but if you can look past that not a bad shaver.  </li>
            <li>The price of this shaver essentially makes throwing the shaver away after a year and buying a new one feasible financially.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very strange, and I always have to go back over my neck with a real blade after I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>It shaves faster than the other two single foils, and that&#x27;s due mostly to the heads.</li>
            <li>you can not live with a loud shaver, go with a rotary shaver as foil shavers are inherently loud.  </li>
            <li>However, if you do not ordinarily use a facial shaver to trim the back of your neck</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband because of the excellent reviews, but he is very disappointed that this shaver does not give as close a shave as his old Braun.</li>
            <li>The disc cutters on the old model were loosely anchored and frequently detached</li>
            <li>Hard to take apart and clean.</li>
            <li>cord quickly became so  loose that it wouldn&#x27;t stay connected to the shaver unless you set it down and don&#x27;t move it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t extend up far enough above the heads of the razor, so I was often jabbing my face with the head cutters while trying to use the trimmer.</li>
            <li>i was using a panasonic es 7035 procurve and while i must admit the panasonic is sooo quiet, and the remington is quite loud the f5 takes only a quarter the amount of time to shave my face.</li>
            <li>I realized it took nearly twice the time to shave with this beast as I spent with my old shaver.  </li>
            <li>batteries at 12 volts must be on the small size, since I get only one week&#x27;s shaving out of a full 24-hour charge.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They improved the old school razor but failed to realize that it takes more than putting LED in your name to impress customers.</li>
            <li>I purchased this shaver to replace a tired Norelco rotary shaver, and initially I was pleased.</li>
            <li>The instructions said to use what I typically refer to the sideburn shavers on your face first, then go back over it with the foils.  </li>
            <li>with the last Remington shavers I&#x27;ve in the past 25 years, this one the battery can last 2 weeks easy, it is loud, has plenty of power for my thick hairs, and gives a very close shave.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Remington Razors for many, many years, and this is by far the worst one I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li>I can take the Braun on a nearly week long trip without having to charge it</li>
            <li>I have a pretty heavy beard.</li>
            <li>I noticed this within the first 2 seconds of using it, so I don&#x27;t understand how Remington could let this go unnoticed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But as time went on, performance really went down hill.</li>
            <li>My beard is pretty tough and wiry, and it might be too much to ask an electric shaver to give me a shave that is TRULY comparable to a top-of-the-line name-brand multi-bladed razor.</li>
            <li>One shaver is made in China and costs as much as an expensive meal while the other is made in Germany and costs more than four times as much.</li>
            <li>This shaver&#x27;s head is too large to handle tight areas.</li>
            <li>Not least important, it&#x27;s not an expensive razor.  </li>
            <li>it was done, and no long hair left over.</li>
            <li>Definitely not as close as my Braun 790cc-4 but much closer than a typical rotary.</li>
            <li>Although it seems to do a good job on flat skin, it&#x27;s very difficult to maneuver around curves.</li>
            <li>that I can certainly see this failing in a few months and no longer holding the foils in position.</li>
            <li>like the Remington&#x27;s sideburn trimmer slightly better, though it took me a time or two to get accustomed to it because it&#x27;s a little hard to tell where the blade is going to hit.  </li>
            <li>You would have to push WAY too hard to make the floating head useful.  </li>
            <li>Feels a little bulky (not ergonomically design although looks nice) and a little stiff to use.</li>
            <li>one thing I do like about this is that the motor seems really strong and when I skip shaving for several days this will mow through a thick beard and get it short enough that I can switch to my other razor for the close work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this is a good thing or a bad thing, but the first thing that went through my mind when I pulled it from the packaging was</li>

    <ol>
            <li> O&#x27;clock Shadow\\&quot; before I was done, as that was about the best result this product could offer.    </li>
            <li> For once in my life I read up on the best cordless electric razor for the value.  </li>
            <li> As I mentioned I have no idea how this razor was best for the value.</li>
            <li> F5790 is the best foil shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> (All I do is wash with it in the shower, and when my skin dries, it&#x27;s perfectly prepared for shaving.)</li>
            <li> Kudos to Amazon for excellent customer service.</li>
            <li> Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend humored me in trying this model out, even though he was very happy with his [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with an electric razor for over 20 years and have to say, for me, this one is the best one I have used.  </li>

            <li> I was hoping that this would be the perfect replacement for it.  </li>
            <li> I was very happy with this Remington F5790.  </li>
            <li> That is awesome customer service!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using electric shavers for over 50 years, and this is one of the best if not the best I have ever had.</li>
            <li> Perfect!</li>
            <li> The bottom line for me is that the F5790 gives me an excellent shave, and I know that when it comes time to replace it I won&#x27;t hesitate to get another one.</li>
            <li> the trimmer is excellent</li>
            <li> Best electric shaver I have ever used,</li>
            <li> The Remington F5790 was rated by Consumer Reports magazine as a &#x27;best buy&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I shave my head also and this razor works perfectly.  </li>
            <li> A Great value for the money!</li>
            <li> Oh yeah it still hold a great charge!!</li>
            <li> Excellent shave.  </li>
            <li> Which for me isn&#x27;t impressive.</li>
            <li> best shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned</li>
            <li> This is one of the best electric razors I have used.</li>
            <li> and this one is one of the best.</li>
            <li> My husband was very happy with the product even though took of a bit longer to arrive.  </li>
            <li> Electronically, this razor is superb.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m still very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> day.&lt;br /&gt;Remington is the best!!!</li>
            <li> But this razor is very good !</li>
            <li> This Remington makes me very happy.</li>
            <li> A very good shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had to change the blades or foil and both are still in very good condition.  </li>
            <li> i cant get a  very good shave&lt;br</li>
            <li> Beside that that, the unit looks very nicely made, and the battery life is awesome.</li>
            <li> Loved it!</li>
            <li> I loved it!</li>
            <li> It is the best shaver that I got, perfect and wonderful result, I like it and it is easy to carry</li>
            <li> The 1700 has a very good feel in the hand with good balance, shape and size.  </li>
            <li> In the end, this would be a great razor to see if foil shaving is for you, but as the saying goes, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price</li>
            <li> I found this shaver at a great deal.</li>
            <li> Used corded or cordless as a bonus, its great.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with it.</li>
            <li> The shaver does a great job</li>
            <li> For the price it was a great buy.</li>
            <li> Works great for the price.  </li>
            <li> Great value, fits well</li>
            <li> Of course no one razor works for everyone, but I&#x27;ve owned and been quite happy with this one for over three years.  </li>
            <li> The trim feature is great and does not reduce power.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li> it has worked great.</li>
            <li> The battery life is great.</li>
            <li> Works great for me.</li>
            <li> Has great features, just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Great razor for the price.</li>
            <li> The shaver itself is great.</li>
            <li> I have had Remington shavers for many years and have been very happy....</li>
            <li> Just be sure to consider your options so you know what is best for your needs.</li>
            <li> Good advice from Consumer Reports and a great product from Remmington.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Remington shavers for many years and this one is the best I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I like the F5790 because it is mostly a no-frills shaver but has the triple screen that I find shaves the best.  </li>
            <li> The product was delivery very quickly and arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> But there is a bright side.</li>
            <li> did I get a good shave.</li>
            <li> , it just isn&#x27;t that good a shaver.  </li>
            <li> It takes forever to get a good shave from this razor.  </li>
            <li> I decided to give this a fair shot and try it since the price was right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still feel stubble and when I use a razor after using this I can see there is still a fair amount that the electric cannot reach.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As for the quality of the shave its a fair performer.  </li>
            <li> The tilting head is what attracted me to this razor, and while it seems like a good idea</li>
            <li> This is a good razor and a good value for the money.</li>
            <li> It seems like a good shaver.</li>
            <li> and it did a good job</li>
            <li> yet it still shaves close and gives me a shave \\&quot;as good as a blade\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Good, close shave.  </li>
            <li> This is a good shaver.</li>
            <li> Otherwise this has been a good shaver.</li>
            <li> I find it shaves fairly close without irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remington seems to lose charge over time, even if unused.  </li>
            <li> But, if you don&#x27;t want to shell out $100+, the Remington is a good choice.</li>
            <li> good shave while it lasted...</li>
            <li> Gives a good, close shave</li>
            <li> Once those are mastered, it is as good as any electric.</li>
            <li> but this one is almost as good as that</li>
            <li> but it still is a good value compared to the cost of ownership of a Braun.  </li>
            <li> I use to get a good  shave in about 5 minutes</li>
            <li> I bought this because a consumer mag gave it a good rating.</li>
            <li> I feel that the pivot head does not made good contact on the face.</li>
            <li> Not quite as good as the Remington Titanium 3 headed shaver.</li>
            <li> Good shaver for my head.  </li>
            <li> Well, thatâ€™s good to know</li>
            <li> but I loved it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good quality unit.</li>
            <li> I feel that I gave them fair trials.</li>
            <li> It is good value for the money..</li>
            <li> But, if it doesn&#x27;t give you a good, close shave, forget about it...</li>
            <li> Does a good job for the money.</li>
            <li> Good close shave...</li>
            <li> Gives a good shave, but noisy.</li>
            <li> seems to be good value for the money</li>
            <li> Holds a charge well and provides a fairly close shave (not blade close, mind you)</li>
            <li> I was concerned that the price seemed too good.</li>
            <li> It is good for the inexpensive price.  </li>
            <li> Trimmer works good, too.  </li>
            <li> While I have yet to find the perfect shaver for me, I must say that I have found MANY shavers better suited than this one.    </li>
            <li> F5 is a good value and gives a great shave so that is better then a 3 star rating to</li>
            <li> If it lasts three years or better, I will be very pleased!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the razor.</li>
            <li> and I am very satisfied</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this razor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the Remington shaver.  </li>
            <li> First, the shave is excellent.  </li>
            <li> My father has arthritis and there would be no way he would be able to do it at all!  </li>
            <li> I would have liked a better fitting blade cover, but works great.</li>
            <li> I amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since he wasn&#x27;t thrilled with it, I decided to try it myself.</li>
            <li> This razor is OK if you have a good amount of time to shave.  </li>
            <li> I get nice close shaves with no irritation.  </li>
            <li> Nice features.</li>
            <li> From hubby: A nice shaver.</li>
            <li> The shaver does a good job of giving you a nice close shave, it was better than the Braun I had prepped with.</li>
            <li> At this point I will never again purchase a Remington product of any kind.</li>
            <li> This razor doesn&#x27;t shave well and is too bulky to do an effective job.  </li>
            <li> F4 I was going to get and honestly would recommend it over this one.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer works nicely for my sideburns.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll be replacing it fairly soon I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> I can go weeks without having to recharge which is really nice for trips since I don&#x27;t have to take the charger.  </li>
            <li> I had one of these literally like 15 years ago - and I liked it</li>
            <li> Nice close shave.  </li>
            <li> a positive note, the battery charge life was very good.  </li>
            <li> this product works good pros battery charge very quickly cons noisy but would recommend.</li>
            <li> The 5790 holds a strong charge for 60+ shaving minutes and does a good job shaving.  </li>
            <li> I noticed from the start that the pivot head pivots very easily and gets looser with use.  </li>
            <li> Battery gauge is very easy to read.&lt;br</li>
            <li> On the plus side, it starts up every morning just fine and has good battery life, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy another one.</li>
            <li> I always check Consumer Reports for advice--they gave this one a very good rating--the price was reasonable</li>
            <li> So even though men may not be happy with this, I think women may find it useful.</li>
            <li> I find it comfortable to hold, and the battery life is good.</li>
            <li> I liked my Remington Titanium MS3 2700 better.</li>
            <li> This has many positive reviews and a very good price.  </li>
            <li> dont forget electrc shave lolol easy to take apart and clean</li>
            <li> has worked flawlessly for me for more than four years so far.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> It gives a very comfortable &amp; close shave.  </li>
            <li> This razor is pretty good and can come in handy.  </li>
            <li> it is ok.</li>
            <li> I thought I would try a elctric razor and found out that no matter how many passes I made (I tried going over areas 20 amd 30 times)</li>
            <li> Balanced--barely and could be quite a bit better.  </li>
            <li> I have had it more than 3 months,so I can&#x27;t return it.</li>
            <li> For the price I think you could find a better razor than this.  </li>
            <li> If they call it a \\&quot;system\\&quot; it means you have to pay more money.  </li>
            <li> This one has the advantage of more floating heads to get more surface area.  </li>
            <li> The shave is not consistantly close, many stray hairs and once in a while</li>
            <li> I cannot provide a comparison on whether the 3 heads are better than 2.  </li>
            <li> and I am no longer able to use the razor.</li>
            <li> In that time I&#x27;ve owned mostly Remingtons.  </li>
            <li> a charge and gives a better shave to boot.  </li>
            <li> Much better than $200 competitors (Braun, etc.).  </li>
            <li> I am sure not all foil shavers are like this</li>
            <li> The shaves that I have been able to achieve are not at all satisfactory.  </li>
            <li> like the Braun better.</li>
            <li> Perfect for shaving my bald head and edging up my facial hair.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d be better off buying something else</li>
            <li> The price was much better than the $89 shavers there</li>
            <li> I found it interesting that the reviews here are so varied -</li>
            <li> some love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been satisfied with the one I had years ago.</li>
            <li> Much better than the Braun&#x27;s I had.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m completely satisfied with this item.  </li>
            <li> I love everything about it.  </li>
            <li> have purchased many Remington&#x27;s over the years</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do any better job in areas</li>
            <li> but f5790 is ok</li>
            <li> so why pay more for it?  </li>
            <li> The battery is not lithium ion so a charging and battery indicators while welcome really are not needed.  </li>
            <li> After more than twenty years of using Remington, I&#x27;m probably going to have to switch to Braun.</li>
            <li> Better than ones I have had for twice the price.  </li>
            <li> The 4 head Remington did a much better job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the F5790 for about six months and have never had a better shaver than this one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been reading some of the many one star reviews</li>
            <li> and I have had many since I started shaving 30</li>
            <li> and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> My Gillette Mach 3 gives a better shave, but I like the convenience of an electric razor.</li>
            <li> or if you are going for the Home Improvement over kill award, maybe an air compressor with a basketball needle.  :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned many Remington shavers throughout the years.</li>
            <li> There has to be a better triple foil out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve checked up with him several time now and he is very, very happy with the razor.</li>
            <li> The F5790 has more features but takes a bit of time getting used to how it shaves.</li>
            <li> I love the power meter and the F5790 lasts about 2 weeks before it needs a recharge.</li>
            <li> I am more than satisfied with the performance of the shaver.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> IT IS OK BUT COULD DO  BETTER GETTING A CLOSER SHAVE</li>
            <li> Way better than most.</li>
            <li> and I think that I will adjust to it more as I use it.  </li>
            <li> and I am pleased with the product</li>
            <li> This is his favorite shaver</li>
            <li> and when you do expect to pay more than $20.</li>
            <li> More than one foil assembly seating design has become worn within a couple of months to the point that it just lifts up off the shaver as soon as the power is turned on.</li>
            <li> Where&#x27;s the \\&quot;better mousetrap\\&quot; that Capitalism is supposed to produce?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It shaves ok.</li>
            <li> I have had many electric razors over the years all being remington microscreens.  </li>
            <li> Then I got F5790 and love it.  </li>
            <li> I probably used to spend more on blades and shaving cream in a year than I did on the Remington.  </li>
            <li> and I am no longer able to use the razor.</li>
            <li> The rotary works much better.</li>
            <li> I can see no reason why you would pay 75% more, and what more could you get for your money.</li>
            <li> For the money you can&#x27;t do any better, and I would recommend this shaver to a friend.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have mostly used the rotory type shavers like Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> rotary flex head I bought to replace it seems to work OK, but has to be recharged every four or five days.</li>
            <li> If you are a once a week shaver, it will probably do what you want it to do (i.e., more like clippers).</li>
            <li> and I am generally pleased.  </li>
            <li> I have used a Remington shaver for many years.  </li>
            <li> I have used Remington for years and have always paid more for the foil shaver.</li>
            <li> Sure it was bulky and noisy, but it DID shave well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t buy the model below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It took some adjusting, but I found that when I move the blade slower over my face it works a lot better.</li>
            <li> This rechargeable shaver holds its charge for many days.</li>
            <li> your money and buy something else.&lt;br /&gt;You could probably get a better razor by kicking in another twenty bucks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver at a decent price.</li>
            <li> It does charge quickly and the LED charge gauge on the front is really nice.  </li>
            <li> It was more comfortable to hold and the trimmer worked better.</li>
            <li> To be fair and rate it at the actual going price of $45 to $50 I think 4 stars is fair.  </li>
            <li> I bought this shaver as my old one the Remington MS2 200 which gave me many years of great shaves needed to be replaced.</li>
            <li> Not quite as good as an older brand of Remington that I used for many years.  </li>
            <li> Compared to my forty year old remington, this one works great.</li>
            <li> This unit is loud and does not do a great job shaving.  </li>
            <li> It works great on whiskers one to maybe three days old.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean and you can run it in water (in rechargeable mode and no power cord plugged in!)  </li>
            <li> While that is a design flaw too the real issue in my mind is you need to have good hand/finger strength to be able to push and pull the thing out of the shaver to clean it.  </li>
            <li> The good news is that I pursued my quest for a new shaver &amp; ordered the Panasonic ES8243A Arc IV Nano Men&#x27;s Wet/Dry Rechargeable Shaver, Blue  which got very good reviews.  </li>
            <li> would have bumped it up to 4 easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to use anywhere</li>
            <li> razor gives me a clean shave mostly.  </li>
            <li> I just made sure to keep it clean and throw a bit of oil in it every so often.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-foil tears easily.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to change the blades and the screen and the motor/battery</li>
            <li> foil shavers seem to rip too easy.  </li>
            <li> It cleaned easily.</li>
            <li> If it had, these flaws could have been easily detected.</li>
            <li> But it is easy to charge.</li>
            <li> After dozens of drops, it is stil going strong.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this model and brand.</li>
            <li> Always delivered a good shave and has decent battery life.</li>
            <li> I strongly suspect that the head set needs to be replaced already.</li>
            <li> I have used Remington products before and liked them very much.</li>
            <li> Easy to order, top quality merchandise Remington does a clean smooth shave</li>
            <li> At first I liked how close it shaved.  </li>
            <li> A good two months after getting it, I had to buy new foils because one of them was already a goner.</li>
            <li> So if you are a man who has a job or wife that likes you clean shaven on a daily basis then this would most certainly be a great product for you.</li>
            <li> The fine folks at Remington do not take returns.</li>
            <li> this evening I had the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric razor, and I did it in half the time.  </li>
            <li> works fine.  </li>
            <li> THE SHAVER  IS JUST FINE</li>
            <li> everything on the shaver works fine and it met my expectations.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works just fine.  </li>
            <li> The blades and foil also work fine.  </li>
            <li> Once you get over the wake up call in the morning, it functions fine and makes for a close shave</li>
            <li> super shave job none better</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It contours your face better than the original micro screens, and it is quick and comfortable.</li>
            <li> but because it can&#x27;t give as close a shave as I like and is HUGE that 3 is stretching a bit.    </li>
            <li> Irritation was reduced with regular use, but it never was acceptable (fyi I&#x27;ve been happy with Braun, Norelco, and Panasonic</li>
            <li> The Flex360 is light weight.  </li>
            <li> The motor is way to light for this razor.  </li>
            <li> I rated it a 3 because it is easy to clean and works as stated</li>
            <li> I rated it a 3 because it is easy to clean and works as stated</li>
            <li> and this was a smooth ride.  </li>
            <li> I, however, also shave my head and let me tell you, this thing works great for that even though it&#x27;s not advertised as such.</li>
            <li> even if they offer this at a cheap price.</li>
            <li> I have been happy with this razor and wanted to get the same one.</li>
            <li> To much to spend to take this kind of chance.</li>
            <li> If you had problems like me, call Remington toll free number, explain to them the problem you have, and they will do anything to help you.  </li>
            <li> They will even exchange your shaver for a rotary one for free.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean after use.</li>
            <li> Its light, cheap feeling plastic has give and creaks under pressure, also the foils are held in place by the flimsiest and tiniest of plastic tabs</li>
            <li> The Braun in comparison freely and smoothly pivots to maintain a 90 degree angle to the skin anddoes so to perfection.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean and just keeps running and running.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I go, it is an easy to cary and clean this product after used them.</li>
            <li> LIGHT WEIGHT.&lt;br /&gt;great</li>
            <li> It worked best when I shaved everyday after a shower.</li>
            <li> I decided to write to the company, and instead of telling me what the problem was with the shaver, they just sent me a free replacement kit (foil + cutters).</li>
            <li> GET IT WHILE STILL AVAILABLE</li>
            <li> F5790 is well balanced and has a comfortable grip.  </li>
            <li> works great, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> However, I must admit that it was easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I suspect that replacing the cutters and foils when the time comes won&#x27;t be cheap</li>
            <li> The design of the foil and pivot on the F5790 works well and the shave is close and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Having happily used Remington shavers for the last fifty years I thought nothing about replacing my worn out Remington with this model.  </li>
            <li> Would often not capture and cut light neck whiskers.  </li>
            <li> Thanks remington for creating this kind of razor.</li>
            <li> It fits comfortably in your hand and has both a pivot and pop-up.</li>
            <li> Remington F5790 is satisfactory but does not do as good a job as my old Norelco.  </li>
            <li> wise Braun clearly is a nicer shaver then a Remington too</li>
            <li> It works good but is extremely loud.</li>
            <li> As far as the shave it gives; it does fairly good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To be fair, I&#x27;ve also purchased and tried for a month or more - and ultimately disposed of, a Norelco and a Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> At first, it seemed pretty good</li>
            <li> It never shaved close and compared to my old Remington, didn&#x27;t even come close to a good shave.</li>
            <li> Good shave, good battery life, quick charging, let down by a plastic protective foil cover that won&#x27;t stay in place.</li>
            <li> The old, original Remington: the \\&quot;old brick\\&quot;, was one of the best electric shavers I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> He tried this out right after shearing off his wooly coat and said it was okay</li>
            <li> so I was able to use it right away.</li>
            <li> no matter how many times you try.&lt;br /&gt;3) has a pushbutton on/off switch rather than a slide switch right where your&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li> I get a clean shave and the shaver is easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> Fortunately I found a web site that had a video on how to use it and clean it.  </li>
            <li> I love it very much and would buy  one</li>
            <li> first impressions on this shaver is that it is HUGE!  </li>
            <li> It takes me significantly longer to shave with this (up to 10 times longer) than with a razor</li>
            <li> I had gone thru the original set of foil heads after 2 months and then the replacement set that i purchased with this shaver in about 2-3 months.</li>
            <li> The original didn&#x27;t have a front and back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I may not have picked up on all those differences which collectively pushed the Remington significantly lower on the electric shaver hierarchy.</li>
            <li> The first two shaves were OK.  </li>
            <li> Man was I excited.  </li>
            <li> I think it also may run on electric while charging which the original model could not do.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> After two months, the plastic housing for the covers broke apart when I took them off to clean the razor.    </li>
            <li> and I cannot get a clean shave like with a razor.  </li>
            <li> it gets some areas almost as clean as a razor but cannot give me a clean shave all over.  </li>
            <li> I would not say this shaver does a spectacular job, and it actually requires many passes to get everything.</li>
            <li> I like to have a clean shave, and the F5790 just couldn&#x27;t give me that.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;(sigh) I wish the old MS 260hadn&#x27;t fallen apart, since it lasts longer and shaves better, but at this point it&#x27;s more duct tape than plastic and case</li>
            <li> The head pivots and it rinses in the sink to clean.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s best feature, which is disappointing as you are buying it for the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;~ Rechargeable battery that does provide a good amount of usable life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> tossed a $200 braun (2 foil) that was self cleaning and lots of bells and whistles but couldn&#x27;t give me a clean</li>
            <li> (I know will be easier as I get accustom to it); and removing the screen head to clean the cutters is not the easiest experience.  </li>
            <li> The build quality is good, it is quiet and smooth.  </li>
            <li> and it gives a close clean shave.  </li>
            <li> The product is noisey and does not shave clean.</li>
            <li> I literally had to spend 15 minutes to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li> This shaver just does the job as good or better than any other.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Having never had a \\&quot;light\\&quot; beard, I can&#x27;t say for certain, but I would imagine that it would probably do a much better job than it did on mine.</li>
            <li> This shaver is an exceptional value which performs very well and is very durable.  </li>
            <li> He has tried this three times since and said that it would be great for a man who shaves daily but for him it wasn&#x27;t exactly his cup of tea.  </li>
            <li> He likes a bit of the wiskers inbetween shavings and said that it just doesn&#x27;t do a good enough job for the once or twice a week thing.  </li>
            <li> A good addition to the glove box for last minute shaving.  </li>
            <li> I was finally able to get the head to reattach by running the unit under a fast stream of water.  </li>
            <li> Shaver is great and did a good job, but important parts have failed and made the shaver worthless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> F5790 simply does NOT give a good shave, period.</li>
            <li> for those who are looking for a good razor at a low price this is it.</li>
            <li> but I think they need much work as it has many design flaws.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good enough when I don&#x27;t have time to shave with a blade, but doesn&#x27;t shave as close.</li>
            <li> The Pivot is kind of a gimmick, a fixed Foil shaver can be positioned manually on your face, which is what you do anyways with this model.</li>
            <li> I do not believe that either is true.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given the shaver a really good cleaning several times</li>
            <li> The result is that I get a good shave on my face, and my neck looks like total crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does fit in my hand well as the grip is right.  </li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I purchased this item and thought it was a great product.  </li>
            <li> remember little to no pressure is better and you have to give your face 2-4 weeks to adjust, get a good no alcohol based aftershave</li>
            <li> After 5 years as a primary shaver it still holds a great charge, the beard trimmer works like a charm, and I have not had any trouble with the three blades or foil.</li>
            <li> I could not get a shave that even came close to be being worthy of the name razor.  </li>
            <li> Charge lasts forever and shaves quick and close.</li>
            <li> When the battery dies, the razor quits and does not have a quick charge function.  </li>
            <li> Fuel gauge, auto detect overseas power, quick charge and others.  </li>
            <li> adequate job?</li>
            <li> As I said, the shave is ADEQUATE</li>
            <li> The liight indicators showing how much charge is left is great.  </li>
            <li> (yes it has a quick charge as well,</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m relegating this shaver to my desk drawer at work, should I ever find myself in need of a quick &#x27;touch-up.</li>
            <li> and I expected to enjoy a good shaver for some time.</li>
            <li> My lucky break came when I went on vacation and dropped my Braun on the tile bathroom floor of the hotel.</li>
            <li> I found this Remington to fit the bill nicely, and it was only $34.00.</li>
            <li> I found on my face, it works great - shaves very close, and as other reviews state, it is very quick.</li>
            <li> To Remington&#x27;s credit they have replaced the first two at no charge and shipped them to me for free.    </li>
            <li> It gives me a consistently close, smooth shave on both my head and face.  </li>
            <li> the very first day, it didn&#x27;t give me a close shave.</li>
            <li> its good holds charge long time</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean, and the swivel head does a decent job shaving.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;July 12 2012:  New cutters and screen shave better, yes.  </li>
            <li> ok, I just replace with new one at walmart...</li>
            <li> That said I alternate blade and electric all the time, and this is a pretty good one.  </li>
            <li> However, my rotary shaver that I still use always is easy to shave even if I didn&#x27;t shave for a whole week.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is rinseable, but that seems to be less effective than just cleaning the cut beard with the included brush - or better yet a can of air</li>
            <li> Great shaver, long lasting, easy to clean</li>
            <li> Still, if I&#x27;m in a real hurry, I&#x27;ll use it and it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li> I read some con&#x27;s about the size of this shaver, but as I have big hands, I find it to be a very comfortable fit for me.  </li>
            <li> For my money this is a great little shaver.  </li>
            <li> It was quicker at the beginning and as time went on you would need to take a little more time and a few more reps but a very good razor.</li>
            <li> It took a few days to get my face used to this razor, but now it is great -- lots of power (sounds like a rice rocket taking off).  </li>
            <li> on the Braun, I want you all to know, this is a great shaver for the price, and don&#x27;t waste your money on the hype surrounding Braun razors.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This could have been a great shaver with a few common-sense tweaks.</li>
            <li> The indicator light is very helpful.  </li>
            <li> For nearly $60 dollars, you can find a better alternative.</li>
            <li> My dear hubby finally got around to shaving his beard off because it is getting warm.  </li>
            <li> Almost every day, for an entire year, despite trying my best, I would get to work and find at least one (and usually many) hairs that it had missed.  </li>
            <li> My 10 month old worn out rotary blades give me a better shave than this one.  </li>
            <li> My old TA 4570 gives a much better shave.  </li>
            <li> the flexible head allows for more efficient shaving than the old model performed.  .</li>
            <li> First the good; It actually shaves pretty close.</li>
            <li> But for anyone who actually enjoys shaving or wants to enjoy shaving and where shave closeness and comfort are more important than cost, then do yourself a favour and skip this shaver.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll worth it for the cost.</li>
            <li> My 8 year old Remington triple foil shaved much better.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is much better on the F5790 than on my old Remington.</li>
            <li> Over the nearly 40 years, I&#x27;ve had four different Remington&#x27;s, one being a great triple-cutter (MS3-2700 -</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny of $34.</li>
            <li> Works great, close shave and the battery life is far longer than my last shaver.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> but it was well worth it to get something that works.</li>
            <li> far, my impression is that it is not a terrible shaver for its price.</li>
            <li> I spend more than twice the time shaving as I did with my old remington and still&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am pretty loyal to Remington for that close shave, and this doesn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li> One surprising thing about the Remington is that the cutters and screen do not seem to fill up with whisker shavings like other shavers I have used.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other remingtons with 3 foils and good results.  </li>
            <li> While the shaver works OK (but nothing special), the foils don&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> and he was right.</li>
            <li> A 7345XL, $59 at Kohls right now), and</li>
            <li> Yep, you heard right, ivory soap.</li>
            <li> It was as if the foil wasn&#x27;t allowing in any of the longer hair, just going right over it instead.  </li>
            <li> Please send me the right one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the blades or something else, but it just doesn&#x27;t give a good smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> While this shaver is a great product, for me it is really just to average.</li>
            <li> This one is not so hot and doesn&#x27;t shave any better than fixed head shavers.</li>
            <li> really like the Braun clean and renew system though it can get pricey buying all the refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really pleased with the new shaver as it really does shave as close as a blade.  </li>
            <li> The single good thing I can say about it is that the battery charge lasts as much as six weeks.</li>
            <li> - apparently it doesn&#x27;t work with all shapes and sizes of faces or something :)  </li>
            <li> As most have already said, the Remington F5790 delivers a good shave at first but after a few weeks I found I was having more pain due to the \\&quot;rougher\\&quot; shave.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this shaver, it is smooth shaving with very little effort.</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to leave the shaved area as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom, but even if it manages to catch the hair, the area is left feeling dry and not as smooth as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> Having used various Braun, Norelco, and Panasonic shavers over the years, I decided that I could probably be almost as happy with an (relatively) inexpensive Remington.  </li>
            <li> I figured Remington had to have tech as good as a 3-5 year old shaver from the big boys.  </li>
            <li> But since then, I&#x27;ve had more and more trouble with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The clippers actually work better than the blades, and I have a fair amount of facial hair to keep trimmed and neat as well as facial areas that need to be shaved clean.  </li>
            <li> It is also more difficult to clean (I haven&#x27;t been able to figure out how to get the head cover off easily to rinse it  out).</li>
            <li> did  Very fast and no irritation.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Instead of buying new heads, cheap as they are, I have switched back to a blade while I do some more shopping for a replacement.</li>
            <li> i liked my old remington tf 300 better.it gets a  better close shave easyer with less effort.</li>
            <li> I would much rather pony up a little bit more money to get a more reliable shaver.</li>
            <li> Since the beard trimmer is larger than on other electric shavers, and the way it was positioned so I could easily grip it, I found I loved shaving my legs with it.</li>
            <li> The charge does not last the 20 days but more like 2-4 days.  </li>
            <li> This razor is mediocre at best.</li>
            <li> I have used many electric shavers and I would rate this Remington somewhere above the Norelco shavers and beneath the Braun shavers.</li>
            <li> At first I thought I just needed to get used to it.  </li>
            <li> I just bought my first Norelco this morning (</li>
            <li> So, I really trust these guys when it comes to having a razor in my face!</li>
            <li> Also it shaves pretty close.</li>
            <li> At first I tried it on my face when hairs were longer.</li>
            <li> I then thought that it may be better suited for short hairs.</li>
            <li> Will it shave consistently over time and save you hassle on the way to work?</li>
            <li> However, after giving this one shot there was no way that I was willing to stay the course.  </li>
            <li> It does work pretty well though.  </li>
            <li> This was my first foil electric that I ever used/owned.  </li>
            <li> It has become a pretty convenient shaver.  </li>
            <li> Even before that, it only shaved ok.</li>
            <li> After using Braun shavers for most of my life I decided to try something different.</li>
            <li> it was loud just as loud as the remmington f5 but didnt shave anywhere near as good...</li>
            <li> Just ordered the first replacement foil and blades.  </li>
            <li> We were surprised to find this one was still available.  </li>
            <li> You hand and wrist will do a better job, especially with their implementation of it.  </li>
            <li> I suspect you will not have the issue of many people rating this low</li>
            <li> Fortunately I hadn&#x27;t thrown away the old screen assy</li>
            <li> Be aware of buying a replacement cutter and screen assy for this model.</li>
            <li> I love their regular microscreen shavers.</li>
            <li> First, I want to mention that the F5790 was a Remington replacement for a MS2-390 shaver with defective battery.  </li>
            <li> I finally have to replace the foils for the first time and thats mostly because I dropped it</li>
            <li> The first time I used the F5790, I was amazed with the first path I ran across my cheek.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this razor was because replacement cutters for my old Remington were no longer available.  </li>
            <li> I chose this product because I have used it many times in the past and have always been pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> This is the first review I have ever written.</li>
            <li> It performs as well or better than many more expensive shavers.</li>
            <li> My first electric razor in years</li>
            <li> Husband tried for the first this week and loves it.  </li>
            <li> The major benefit of shavers such as a Braun Activator is the self-cleaning mechanism, which may sound like a luxury that you don&#x27;t need, but is actually very important.</li>
            <li> Also, I do have sensitive and fair scin, and this does not burn or mark me up in any way, even with a few weeks worth of growth!</li>
            <li> Build quality a bit off (cheap price?), adapter not build-in, kind of bulky to bring for travel (but may not need it because the battery pretty long, over 3 weeks if used daily.)    </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, this is the first time that I have felt so positive about a product, that I felt obligated to voice my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Clean shave, battery lasts long, easy to clean, powerful, low price.    </li>
            <li> The cutters on the new model appear to be better and more firmly seated.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wide rectangular-shaped handle that felt neither comfortable nor secure in the hand.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend that you shave frequently and maybe even start with a clean razor shaved face.</li>
            <li> Three skinny, while being no worse, is not any better then two larger sizes foils</li>
            <li> really that means it should last 12 months for most people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money - Rated good by consumer reports but it is really a POS</li>
            <li> On the positive side, I like the size.</li>
            <li> While it does a decent job - like most other electric razors, it still never gets me as clean as I would like.  </li>
            <li> and if you don&#x27;t shave on weekends, you will not be able to cut the long hairs.</li>
            <li> OK, minor inconvenience.  </li>
            <li> I think my hair doesn&#x27;t go inside the top part of it correctly if it&#x27;s too long.</li>
            <li> I have a thick/rough beard and really likes the sped of the first razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I do find more pros than cons, I think the negative definitely outweighs the good in this case.  </li>
            <li> Not as good as past Norelco products.</li>
            <li> Not sure if that is good.  </li>
            <li> I had an older version with only two foils that did a much better job.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other electric shavers and found that rotary blades seem to work better for me than this more traditional type of shaver.  </li>
            <li> I let my beard go for 2 or 3 days, the shaver is less effective on longer hair???</li>
            <li> The price seemed low, but having used it several times I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li> short don&#x27;t buy this model if you expect an easy shave.</li>
            <li> A single charge lasted more than two weeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can say that had I seen how large this shaver was I wouldn&#x27;t have gotten it.  </li>
            <li> I can say that had I seen how large this shaver was I wouldn&#x27;t have gotten it.  </li>
            <li> The F5790 is certainly an upgrade.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, the shaving head itself takes up too large a surface area.</li>
            <li> This razor ran for over two weeks on the first charge -- it came with a full charge, or maybe less than a full charge so it should do better on the next charge.  </li>
            <li> I am on the second shaver of this model - it does a fine job.</li>
            <li> Your not going to get as close of a shave on your neck as compared to using a traditional razor but for me thats fine because I get ingrown hairs on my neck if I do.</li>
            <li> It is inexpensive and it is a fine daily shaving tool.</li>
            <li> It works fine for touch up or daily shave.</li>
            <li> The shave is close with a single slow pass - the flex and pivot functions really allow this shaver to do a good job up top.</li>
            <li> and I spent more time re-shaving than if I had used a straight razor and shaving cream.</li>
            <li> This shaver was huge compared to my last Remington.  </li>
            <li> It has a comfortable solid feel and very close shave.  </li>
            <li> For the price, I expected it to perform as the online reviews indicated, as it was ranked one of the top head shavers for 2015.  </li>
            <li> Ergonomic--not really.  </li>
            <li> This shaver does not shave very close.  </li>
            <li> It gives a very close shave, but not evenly across the whole face.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice it until I pulled it out of the box and saw them side by side.  </li>
            <li> I used to have a Braun, but no way was I going to pay that much again for a razor at this time.  </li>
            <li> The angle of the foils and the fact that they pivot is a real plus when shaving the neck area.  </li>
            <li> But it just does not shave very close</li>
            <li> the whole heads attachment would stay on while shaving.</li>
            <li> My Panasonic doesn&#x27;t deliver as close of shave, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much either.</li>
            <li> It does not work very well.</li>
            <li> I guess I didn&#x27;t lose too much money</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak for battery life because I haven&#x27;t used it that much</li>
            <li> Very disapointing product.</li>
            <li> Braun looks \\&quot;more cool\\&quot;, has more flashy features, and is built with more solid materials.</li>
            <li> Perhaps not quite as ergonomic as others, but definitely usable and comfortable.    </li>
            <li> so much irritation there).</li>
            <li> However, this made-in-China item is a real turkey.</li>
            <li> Much easier on the Panasonic</li>
            <li> One or two buttons have always worked well and work much easier too then</li>
            <li> It gave me a very close shave and the trimmer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m being generous here in giving it two stars, one for price and one for the somewhat reasonable shave closeness from a budget shaver.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> VERY DURABLE.AND</li>
            <li> thing is fast.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care much about that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cost too much.</li>
            <li> THIS ITEM TO AMAZON CUSTOMERS THANKS FROM ERIC JOHNSON</li>
            <li> Much quieter.</li>
            <li> The pivot is also bulky and ends up touching the skin, my old shaver foil had no pivot body around the foil so the only thing that touch the skin was the 3 foils, which made it much easier to maneuver.</li>
            <li> Very close.</li>
            <li> VERY noisy, does not work on my face.</li>
            <li> ,thanks Frank Davis</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> /&gt;-blades don&#x27;t sit straight when replaced.</li>
            <li> The battery recharge is also much quicker than that of the MS3 1700.</li>
            <li> It is a quality item and works very well.</li>
            <li> , he really likes the close shave he gets.</li>
            <li> I had about three weeks worth of growth, and I used the tripper feature to knock that out, and then fixed up the stubble with the foil head.</li>
            <li> This shaver did dot perform very well for me at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very dissatisfied with this shaver.</li>
            <li> This thing hurts to use and doesn&#x27;t shave very well.</li>
            <li> Still use a blade if I want a really close shave.</li>
            <li> Nothing really worked.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First, as others have noted, it has a very clunky design.</li>
            <li> It gives to me a very deep and smooth bear cut.</li>
            <li> Are all of the rave reviews really legitimate???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I figured a well know brand name like Remington would insure at least a fairly good product.  </li>
            <li> use it for few weeks to get used to it, i would buy another if needed ,, definetly worth the price,very satisfied</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard, so kind of bummed.</li>
            <li> Three, it is quite powerful, even with the pop-up trimmer fully extended, and it holds enough of a charge for a week&#x27;s worth of shaves, without any noticeable loss of power and/or quality of shaves.</li>
            <li> Design is not really good because it seem to be able to break easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only owned about four electric shavers, and two of them were the original Remington micro screens, which this one pretty much is, albeit, a new style.</li>
            <li> This is my first foil shaver, the last one I had was given to me as a gift more than 20 years ago (different brand).</li>
            <li> They advertise you can clean it with water, but in the manual they only recommend that once a month.</li>
            <li> The motor sound&#x27;s tone isn&#x27;t pleasant either so it became annoying to use pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> The battery does not last as long as the older one I own.</li>
            <li> I decided I had only 2 things that were utmost important in my decison for a new shaver.</li>
            <li> In less than 10 minutes, I have a very smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> Battery life is adequate, but I expected more from such a huge shaver (maybe the big loud motor took up all the space).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The first thing that I noticed, is that it was fairly light compared to a couple of other electrics I&#x27;ve purchased over the years.</li>
            <li> Still it seems better to me than the average review it&#x27;s gotten to this point.  </li>
            <li> Thereâ€™s a good reason I have only used Norelco and Braun up to this point, and will go back to only using those brand of razors.  </li>
            <li> Many whiskers are not removed without multiple passes and/or using the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;The shave is fast and non-irritating except for the missed whiskers which require extra time.</li>
            <li> to shave off his beard to please his new girlfriend!</li>
            <li> and they sent a new one!</li>
            <li> My three previous have been a cheaper version that for the most part do their job.  </li>
            <li> I believe the F5790 provides a better shave than my previous razor</li>
            <li> It did a medioker job of shaving compared to my older one.</li>
            <li> but he said he would try it a few more times as I guess the hair is much softer when it&#x27;s been grown out like that for a bit.  </li>
            <li> My three main problems were as follows:  1.  </li>
            <li> The charge holds for about 5-7 decent days of shaving, so take the cord if you&#x27;ll need it longer on trips, etc.  </li>
            <li> It nicked me more than a shave with a razor blade and left my neck red and sore, without shaving away all the wiskers found there.</li>
            <li> but overall I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with the job it does on my head and will likely continue to use it for that even if I use a razor for my face.    </li>
            <li> It is too close to the main body when it pops up</li>
            <li> does do a decent shave...quickly and without water...</li>
            <li> This is like a toy you give your 3-year old son: it looks like an electric shaver, it makes a buzzing sound, but it doesn&#x27;t actually do anything.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This has 3 foils ,which is the main reason I wanted it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After letting it charge for a day, I gave it a shot, and it did a decent job on my face</li>
            <li> It replaced another older model Remington.</li>
            <li> For the money you can&#x27;t go wrong, I love the 3 Foil system the most out of all the shavers out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Remington shavers for years, and when the last one wore out after 12 years of service, I thought I&#x27;d be brand loyal and go with Remington again.  </li>
            <li> Why can&#x27;t we manufacture a decent electric razor?</li>
            <li> The shave is only adequate.  </li>
            <li> I think a more expensive electric razor will get a better shave, but this is not bacd.  </li>
            <li> This shaver was a BIG disappointment after having seen it first in the June 2011 Consumer Reports magazine that gave it a CR Best Buy rating.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this electric shaver upon receiving it, but I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month and, frankly</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This model was highly rated by Consumers Reports, but it didn&#x27;t work up to my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;I returned it and had no problems with the service.</li>
            <li> HIghly recommended</li>
            <li> I bought this razor because it was rated highly by Consumer Reports.</li>
            <li> I have never been an electric razor guy, but I saw this one was fairly highly rated and thought I would try it.</li>
            <li> where the F5790 is highly rated.</li>
            <li> For a shaver with a high rating, who is doing the rating?  </li>
            <li> Even with the pivot action, some spots under chin need to be repeatedly shaved because the head is rather large.</li>
            <li> should have either gotten new foil/blades for my Panasonic, bought better new electric, or go back to blades (my current plan).  </li>
            <li> but I find it takes up too much of my time to use it to get it anywhere near as close a shave as I like.  </li>
            <li> the Braun had no trouble with--ones that don&#x27;t grow straight out.</li>
            <li> So far this razor has been giving me very close shaves</li>
            <li> The few wiskers it managed to grab it plucked more than cut</li>
            <li> so perhaps a teenage guy with a few wispy hairs might find this useful - sure didn&#x27;t work it</li>
            <li> This was definitely not what I expected (size wise) as I see much smaller electric razors in the stores.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer works OK but also requires a few passes before it cleans up nicely.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would have been willing to pay say twice as much if the foil heads would last say maybe a year and</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe this is normal for this type of razor</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sticking with my disposable razors, where I know I can use a fresh blade every time and get exacting close shave without all the extra work, just for electric.</li>
            <li> number of people normally have issues with the foils.  </li>
            <li> He says cheapy razors he&#x27;s owned in past were superior and one third the price.</li>
            <li> I take good care of my shavers and have not had to change blades and heads often, usually once every couple of years or so, but after only six months (the recommended time in the manual)</li>
            <li> for this Remington electric, it&#x27;s \\&quot;okay.\\&quot; Good, but certainly not great.</li>
            <li> I though, if I paid a ridiculously high price for a new shaver, I would be happier.</li>
            <li> Of course, your mileage may vary, but I&#x27;d certainly look around for other shavers before making a purchase of this model as you can probably do better for about the same price.</li>
            <li> I see one real advantage of the old one --- you could replace the foils separately on the old one and on the new one you need to replace the whole assembly.</li>
            <li> 100 percent better than my husband&#x27;s previous razor!</li>
            <li> I have owned several Remington razors in the past and liked them better than other brands I have used.  </li>
            <li> My previous shaver, which is three year old, provides a better shave that this brand new Remington.</li>
            <li> If you are a long time Remington user, you will find this to be a nice upgrade, but if not I would check out other shavers first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li> We got the new shaver based on a Consumer Reports review and the price found on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> a lemon or Remington is going for the new movie star look.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Now that I have the new one</li>
            <li> I decided to pick up a new Remington</li>
            <li> and I am waiting delivery of my new Phillips-Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li> and I would recommend it to everyone needing a new foil shaver.</li>
            <li> This new Remington</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to the shavers with the 3 circular blades, so going to one like this was something new.  </li>
            <li> Their new ones I see they do sell just the foil.  </li>
            <li> I know I will have to get new foils every two months or so.</li>
            <li> Like the new charging stand.</li>
            <li> If I ever need a new one I will get anothe one like this.</li>
            <li> I had to return one brand new foil as defective when it wouldn&#x27;t snap into place at all.</li>
            <li> I do not like to give bad reviews, but I can honestly say that there are better products out there</li>
            <li> Two, it may be used wet - and both the cutters and foil can be rinsed under the sink to clean.</li>
            <li> F5790 delivers an improvement on past Remington Shavers but shows that they still can&#x27;t stand up to Braun and Panasonic for long term happiness.</li>
            <li> It is on the back and slides straight up, so you can&#x27;t really use it.  </li>
            <li> providing a decent close shave and more difficult to clean then a rotory shaver.</li>
            <li> The only thing I do not like very much about it is the trimmer.</li>
            <li> Very loud and did not shave well.</li>
            <li> Even with the pivot head, and very little stubble, it still does not catch every hair no matter how many times you go over it.  </li>
            <li> One minor problem was that one of the blades occasionally pops off when you remove the foil, but it&#x27;s easily reseated.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get a fairly smooth shave in less than 10 minutes, and it requires constant and repeated passes over the same skin area to achieve anything close to a smooth shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Of course my beard is very grey so the little hairs don&#x27;t show much, except in the right light.    </li>
            <li> I would rate this higher but after 3 weeks the head would not click back in place.  </li>
            <li> This is your average inexpensive cordless shaver, maybe not as cheap as some others out there even though it should be.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver originally for an international trip to avoid any hassles with trying to take disposables or with trying to go on local shopping trips for toiletries.</li>
            <li> I had good luck with this razor during the first few months of use, but then it seemed to fall apart due to regular use.  </li>
            <li> Second one after I dropped the first one.</li>
            <li> I think that is pretty short lived!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Remington makes better shavers for not much more money.</li>
            <li> pleasantly surprised by the shave that I received!  </li>
            <li> Read on various websites and reviews that foil shavers were better for those that shaved on a daily basis such as myself.  </li>
            <li> I have always used a Remington shaver and this is the most difficult model to clean.</li>
            <li> requesting a new one when the soft vinyl cover on the on off switch broke and no one to repair it.</li>
            <li> so I had to remove the screens from the new plastic holder and insert them into the old holder and this seems to have solved the problem.  </li>
            <li> Just pull the old one out and put the new one in.  </li>
            <li> it was overdue for a new foil (the razor was a year old).</li>
            <li> The foil developed a hole after one month, the company would not send me a new foil.  </li>
            <li> With the Braun shavers I owned previously, I would replace the foil and cutter once every 18 months, just to keep the shave smooth.</li>
            <li> I believe the foil curves are too small and even with triple surfaces I get a better shave with my old Remington dual foils.  </li>
            <li> Very loud buzzing on this shaver compared to my old Norelco rotary.</li>
            <li> feel that the negative reviews for the Remington F5790 are attributed more to inexperience and new users of electric razors.  </li>
            <li> I previously had a Remington MS5100 that has worked great for at least 3 years.  </li>
            <li> I previously would use the foil on most of my face and the pop-up trimmer on my neck and to go back over anything that was missed.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s more convenient, no water and no shaving cream required so total time is probably less.  </li>
            <li> I charged this once so far and have used this for several weeks and it is still near full power and has not been recharged since the initial 24 hour charge.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You should use no pressure at all or at least very light pressure.  </li>
            <li> If I shave everyday, this shaver will work fine.</li>
            <li> He says that this shaver would not cut certain whiskers on his face even though he passed over the same area, 5, 10 and even 15 times!  </li>
            <li> They certainly haven&#x27;t lived up to the traditional Made in America reputation!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a hefty shaver, is is comfortable in the hand, but it is a little bulky.  </li>
            <li> For this reason, I would recommend investing the extra money in a shaver that can clean itself and save you valuable time and stress in the long run.</li>
            <li> Only complaints - louder than most - trimmer is a little klutzy.</li>
            <li> but because it can&#x27;t give as close a shave as I like and is HUGE that 3 is stretching a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you using razors stick with them and don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I am very dissatisfied with it, and have gone back to my old Panasonic Shaver.</li>
            <li> Slight problem learning how to clean and guard.</li>
            <li> This product is clearly inferior and I just hope I can get something for the piece of junk on Ebay.</li>
            <li> It takes a while to get your beard accustom to electric razors, and your face needs to be clean, dry and use a talcum product such as the Remington Powder Stick, which I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> clear plastic protective cover quit attaching months ago.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sleek and a bit loud.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this razor for my 97 year old father in law.</li>
            <li> I picked up my 15 year old electric razor and started using it again.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t use it until I found that I could use my old Remington cover with it..</li>
            <li> so have had to return to my old one.</li>
            <li> Wish I could get my old one fixed.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as my old Remington 3 head shaver</li>
            <li> My wallet smarts whenever it gets near one of those 300 dollar shavers.  </li>
            <li> I also like the fact it has LEDs showing how much power is left.  </li>
            <li> hoping that they have discovered the design flaw and fixed it.  </li>
            <li> I received this as a gift and it replaced an old Norelco that was just worn out.  </li>
            <li> It is not where near as close as a razor blade.</li>
            <li> and then when you get low the last light turns to red.  </li>
            <li> Then I would be self conscious about it for the rest of the day.  </li>
            <li> As if that weren&#x27;t enough, it&#x27;s much quieter too.  </li>
            <li> My old razor, a Remington MS 260, runs 3 weeks to a month&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
            <li> Do they shave as close as a blade or as close as my old MS 260?</li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I purchased the Remington razor to replace a Remington Rotary razor that was over 10 years old.  </li>
            <li> The shaver is bulky and loud if that bothers you.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s really the only plus I would give it.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> When the time came to replace the blades I found that replacement blades cost nearly as much as replacing the entire unit.  </li>
            <li> but my wife says that my face feels baby soft which ive never had with the panasonic.</li>
            <li> WOW.  </li>
            <li> My husband wanted to replace the razor he had with one just like his old one.  </li>
            <li> My 5 year old Panasonic ES8068N wet/dry linear shaver was dying, going about 2-3 days between charges.  </li>
            <li> Braun has a weaker motor so not as loud</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to replace my old Norelco</li>
            <li> This is an extremely loud electric shaver.</li>
            <li> This thing is really loud.</li>
            <li> My last shaver was a rotary shaver that works really will.</li>
            <li> wow, what a difference.</li>
            <li> Much slower than a razor and shave cream, and doesn&#x27;t actually cut hair.  </li>
            <li> And it I apply too much pressure, the trimmer pop back in.</li>
            <li> It gives the closest shave next to a Straight razor.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge well so far.</li>
            <li> I remember the old fashioned 6MF1 shavers which I wish I could buy now.</li>
            <li> pivoting action is &#x27;so-so.&#x27;</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this shaver for nearly a year.  </li>
            <li> It not only doesn&#x27;t give him a smooth shave, it takes numerous passes over each area and actually misses hairs!</li>
            <li> It takes him 3 x longer to shave with this razor, than his old one.</li>
            <li> The package was ripped completely and held together with duct tape.</li>
            <li> This razor is incredibly loud.</li>
            <li> I got this for my dad to replace his old Remington MS2 370.</li>
            <li> SO, I have purchased replacement Ni-MH batteries for the old razor.</li>
            <li> And yes, it is loud.  </li>
            <li> IT DOES NOT SHAVE IF THE BEARD IS OVER 12 HOURS OLD.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with my 25 year old Norelco.</li>
            <li> I gave up using that feature near the start, and just keep it locked into position.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m ready to write off Remington as a source for any shaver of mine in the future based on this piece of junk.</li>
            <li> This one however is a complete dud.</li>
            <li> In 2012 I bought a fancy Braun rechargeable foil shaver after my old trustworthy, $25.00 Remington broke.</li>
            <li> My old Remington died so I decided to upgrade.  </li>
            <li> I recently purchased a Norelco and it took me twice as long to get a reasonably close shave that didn&#x27;t seem to last a full</li>
            <li> So far it has performed well.</li>
            <li> Very close ,he does not need an extra blade to go over his face</li>
            <li> /&gt;Oh, and it&#x27;s LOUD.</li>
            <li> my old remington gave out so looked in Consumers mag.</li>
            <li> This thing has so many negative features that I will throw it in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> not waste your time or money on this shaver.</li>
            <li> I am not a big electric shaver kind of guy, I have a Braun shaver that I had purchased a few years ago, but have moved back to the blades.</li>
            <li> THEY TOOK THE BEST PART OF THE SHAVING HEAD OFF AND REPLACED IT WITH A PIECE OF JUNK SOME IDIOT ENGINEER DESIGNED..</li>
            <li> The shave was so close and fast, there was absolutely no razor burn/irritation (normal for new users or improper use of electric razors).  </li>
            <li> I bought the Remington F5790 within the past year because my previous Remington that I loved had died.</li>
            <li> This one is also huge compared to my other razor and for all that size the battery life seems very short.</li>
            <li> It really is a good shaver with one major flaw and a couple of useless features.  </li>
            <li> It does take a little longer to shave, and it&#x27;s a little messier than the rotaries, but it gives a nice close shave now that I&#x27;m using it properly, which is all I could really ask for.  </li>
            <li> firmly, I get 5 o&#x27;clock shadow instead of a clean shave.  </li>
            <li> but it was mainly because I had the Braun 790cc-4 at the same time</li>
            <li> When the time comes to replace the blades, the old models required that I install each of the three blades individually -- not a tremendously difficult task, but one that requires careful attention and hand-eye</li>
            <li> I have reverted back to the older products.</li>
            <li> I only use it once or twice a month after the first 2 weeks of testing and I&#x27;ve only charged it once.</li>
            <li> He had an older model and requested the same thing again.  </li>
            <li> I think the main problem with this shaver is it has only one type of foil screen design.</li>
            <li> Next time I&#x27;ll read the reviews first, even though my prior experience has been positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;Update: After using this for about a week, I have found that it is a decent razor, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> They wear down fast and you have to replace them, so the savings don&#x27;t really make up for the replacement</li>
            <li> This razor gets an extremely close shave even closer than a blade if used right.  </li>
            <li> After a history of disappointing experiences with electric razors, I was looking forward to having a good experience with new and updated model.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t picture how much difference it would make considering how long it took me to get a somewhat close shave using this.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t picture how much difference it would make considering how long it took me to get a somewhat close shave using this.  </li>
            <li> Motor is to noisy almost sound like a small motor boat.</li>
            <li> This razor is barely a year old</li>
            <li> You do need to use the trimmer on the side to get the long hairs which doesnt take much effort and then use the shaver itself.</li>
            <li> The real plus is the long battery life .....</li>
            <li> razor works very well and holds a charge for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t shave nearly as well as the old Braun with the Flex head and the old Braun only had two blades and foils.</li>
            <li> First, this thing is by far louder than any other shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> For a brand new sharp razor it doesnt cut very well.</li>
            <li> After a while I started shaving every other day as I started enjoying shaving less and less.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can only order the foil kit which includes extra blades, which you certainly don&#x27;t need since you have only had the razor a short while, and the kit cost almost as much as the razor.</li>
            <li> The only possible drawback, and I am being overly critical here, is that the unit is naturally going to be little more top-heavy compared to the (less-expensive)</li>
            <li> It is smoother than an almost new Remington rotary blade shaver she gave me last Christmas.  </li>
            <li> When my Braun died, I looked at the prices of new ones and decided to go back to Remington.</li>
            <li> Normally a new shaver is supposed to be charged for  24 hrs before initial use, This shaver arrived fully charged indicating that it had been used..</li>
            <li> but the foil always ripped for me - bought a new one and it ripped like the next day -</li>
            <li> : it really doesn&#x27;t shave me all that closely, even with liquid preparation or the dry stuff.  </li>
            <li> It requires the pop-up trimmer for anything longer than 1/16 of an inch, multiple times over most spots to cleanly shave, face pulling and awkward movement to shave beneath my chin.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the Remington is awkward or heavy at all, in fact it feels perfect in my hands.  </li>
            <li> I few months ago I purchased a Braun Series 5 from Costco at a super deal.  </li>
            <li> They advertise this new one as having a third cutter, this is true but the 3 cutters are much smaller and a little shorter than the 2 cutters in my old one.</li>
            <li> They cost so much that they call them shaving systems, which reminds me of the vacuum cleaner man calling his canister vac a \\&quot;cleaning system\\&quot; not a vacuum cleaner.</li>
            <li> major flaw is that I followed the manual&#x27;s instructions for ordering replacement parts and this shaver isn&#x27;t even on the list on Remington&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li> It has three major advantages.</li>
            <li> This razor is a major improvement to the performance of my &amp;#34;very old&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t detect the subtle claims of smoothness in these foil shavers, to me they are mostly the same in feel.  </li>
            <li> All it does is wet the beard shavings and cakes them up in the blades making it even harder to clean.</li>
            <li> My last Remington before the F5790 was a fantastic shaver with one fatal flaw:  it only worked as a cordless, so when the battery went kaput a little over a year ago</li>
            <li> and I thought this would be a great replacement but turned out to be a bad bet.  </li>
            <li> Also, the general shape and ergonomics of the handle itself are just off.</li>
            <li> The charge indicator is very helpful and the charge lasts long enough for a two week vacation without the charger.  </li>
            <li> you were actually an adult male which I assume were the intended users.</li>
            <li> I literally had to go back into the garbage and pull out my old razor and charge it up to finish my face.  </li>
            <li> My old Remington triple foil was at the point that it only held a charge for a week and since i bought it reconditioned from Remington for $30 dollars</li>
            <li> this razor so far has been terrific...</li>
            <li> This means you need to frequently use the trimmer, especially on your neck.  </li>
            <li> Replace my old Remington F5790 Pivot &amp; Flex razor with the same thing.</li>
            <li> While my wiskers were growing, my wife said \\&quot;enough is enough\\&quot; and went a bought me a Norelco for an early Father&#x27;s day Present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> have not used it much since purchasing the replacement screen as I have been using my Father&#x27;s Day present on a regular basis, and keeping the Remington as my back up razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Our old shaver cord works on it; so I decided to keep it since I could not buy one locally.  </li>
            <li> It works very well, although it is bit harder to handle than the MS3 2700.  </li>
            <li> It offers two larger sized foils and the foil/blade replacements are a bit cheaper.  </li>
            <li> but it works to move the tiny sized blades to give a close shave as well, nearly as close as a Remington.  </li>
            <li> The blades rotate much slower than what I expected.</li>
            <li> Bought it to replace my old one that lasted several years.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, this unit fits in the old zipper pouch that came with my last MS2-390.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I like the swivel action of the head, the out of the way trimmer and the lights indicating the current status of the battery.  </li>
            <li> do find the reviews about holes occurring in the foil that allow the blade to cut the skin troublesome, although I have not had any problems with it so far (as I would hope, after only owning it for 2 days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After pulling, stretching, and burning, you can almost get as close as a normal razor, but it takes about 5 times as long.</li>
            <li> While most give me razorburn, this one had the added letdown of a poor shave.    </li>
            <li> It is noisy, it did not do a good job of shaving the hair on my face and neck, and it definitely does not compare much to my old Philips Norelco 7310XL Rotary Shaver that is less expensive and does do a decent job of cleaning up my face and neck.</li>
            <li> Maybe they are too thick to fit through the screen.  </li>
            <li> It did not do a good job cutting the longer hairs on my neck.</li>
            <li> A bit noisy and bulky, but if you can look past that not a bad shaver.  </li>
            <li> The price of this shaver essentially makes throwing the shaver away after a year and buying a new one feasible financially.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very strange, and I always have to go back over my neck with a real blade after I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> It shaves faster than the other two single foils, and that&#x27;s due mostly to the heads.</li>
            <li> you can not live with a loud shaver, go with a rotary shaver as foil shavers are inherently loud.  </li>
            <li> However, if you do not ordinarily use a facial shaver to trim the back of your neck</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband because of the excellent reviews, but he is very disappointed that this shaver does not give as close a shave as his old Braun.</li>
            <li> The disc cutters on the old model were loosely anchored and frequently detached</li>
            <li> Hard to take apart and clean.</li>
            <li> cord quickly became so  loose that it wouldn&#x27;t stay connected to the shaver unless you set it down and don&#x27;t move it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t extend up far enough above the heads of the razor, so I was often jabbing my face with the head cutters while trying to use the trimmer.</li>
            <li> i was using a panasonic es 7035 procurve and while i must admit the panasonic is sooo quiet, and the remington is quite loud the f5 takes only a quarter the amount of time to shave my face.</li>
            <li> I realized it took nearly twice the time to shave with this beast as I spent with my old shaver.  </li>
            <li> batteries at 12 volts must be on the small size, since I get only one week&#x27;s shaving out of a full 24-hour charge.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They improved the old school razor but failed to realize that it takes more than putting LED in your name to impress customers.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver to replace a tired Norelco rotary shaver, and initially I was pleased.</li>
            <li> The instructions said to use what I typically refer to the sideburn shavers on your face first, then go back over it with the foils.  </li>
            <li> with the last Remington shavers I&#x27;ve in the past 25 years, this one the battery can last 2 weeks easy, it is loud, has plenty of power for my thick hairs, and gives a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Remington Razors for many, many years, and this is by far the worst one I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li> I can take the Braun on a nearly week long trip without having to charge it</li>
            <li> I have a pretty heavy beard.</li>
            <li> I noticed this within the first 2 seconds of using it, so I don&#x27;t understand how Remington could let this go unnoticed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But as time went on, performance really went down hill.</li>
            <li> My beard is pretty tough and wiry, and it might be too much to ask an electric shaver to give me a shave that is TRULY comparable to a top-of-the-line name-brand multi-bladed razor.</li>
            <li> One shaver is made in China and costs as much as an expensive meal while the other is made in Germany and costs more than four times as much.</li>
            <li> This shaver&#x27;s head is too large to handle tight areas.</li>
            <li> Not least important, it&#x27;s not an expensive razor.  </li>
            <li> it was done, and no long hair left over.</li>
            <li> Definitely not as close as my Braun 790cc-4 but much closer than a typical rotary.</li>
            <li> Although it seems to do a good job on flat skin, it&#x27;s very difficult to maneuver around curves.</li>
            <li> that I can certainly see this failing in a few months and no longer holding the foils in position.</li>
            <li> like the Remington&#x27;s sideburn trimmer slightly better, though it took me a time or two to get accustomed to it because it&#x27;s a little hard to tell where the blade is going to hit.  </li>
            <li> You would have to push WAY too hard to make the floating head useful.  </li>
            <li> Feels a little bulky (not ergonomically design although looks nice) and a little stiff to use.</li>
            <li> one thing I do like about this is that the motor seems really strong and when I skip shaving for several days this will mow through a thick beard and get it short enough that I can switch to my other razor for the close work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is a good thing or a bad thing, but the first thing that went through my mind when I pulled it from the packaging was</li>
            <li> Yes, it is a bit large, but it doesn&#x27;t take long to get used to the size and shape as the pivoting head requires less twisting and turning to maintain contact with the shaving area.  </li>
            <li> Braun does get more hairs with the first swipe and is a little less irritating to my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works but you still need to move the shaver around to be right or press too hard at the risk of wearing out the foils sooner then</li>
            <li> The pivoting head doesn&#x27;t pivot much, too stiff.</li>
            <li> Works well, especially on longer whiskers that my older Braun was missing.  </li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t going to buy this one due to the low reviews even after returning a couple of other brand of shavers.  </li>
            <li> If you were hoping that this review would say this razor is just as good as the much more expensive Braun, you&#x27;ll be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> If you use the pop-up trimmer to shave the back of your neck, it could conceivably be a just tad more difficult to get the correct angle compared with the double-headers, which (quite understandably) have less mass at the business end.</li>
            <li> but I find the shape of the new one to be less ergonomic.  </li>
            <li> Dry shave was was worse than shaving with a disposable razor and wet shave performed better, but still not as close as he wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This shaver does not provide a close shave, in fact it leaves many medium long hairs uncut.  </li>
            <li> If you take proper care of your equipment, it&#x27;ll last a long time.</li>
            <li> This one however while it charges fast, when peaked it lasts less long that my two single foil shavers.  </li>
            <li> I also have a Braun, about ten years old that I bought at Odd Job for 19 bucks.</li>
            <li> In case you&#x27;re wondering, I just have an AVERAGE beard, certainly not heavy.  </li>
            <li> Shaving with this electric razor takes a long time - repeatedly covering the same areas to try and get a closer shave.  </li>
            <li> They also all do a lousy job when the beard gets more than a few days old, you need to use a blade then they will pull your beard and take forever to shave it otherwise.    </li>
            <li> Takes a long time to shave, lots of misses, have to use the trimmer head daily.</li>
            <li> Even across the relatively flat surface of my cheek it leaves whiskers behind.&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> It takes me twice as long to shave with the Remington to get a shave equal to the Braun</li>
            <li> Finally, one thing I noticed about the Remington was that the whole head is supposed to pivot to follow the contours of the face but in practice it never did as it was very stiff and felt as if it was semi-locked in one position.</li>
            <li> It&#x27; hard to get the foil off to clean inside, the little tiny ridges on the&lt;br</li>
            <li> This thing S.U.C.K.S.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s loud, I mean holding a nest of hornets next to your ear loud.</li>
            <li> Again, the little plastic nubs that are meant to hold the foil assembly firmly in place should embarrass any engineer worth</li>
            <li> : the only \\&quot;cons\\&quot; would be the screen protector is not marked for \\&quot;front/back\\&quot; and takes several tries to get snapped back in place</li>
            <li> With any electric razor there are always a few hairs that are hard to cut, so I always shave once a week with a 5-blade razor to get a clean start for the next week.  </li>
            <li> I guess what I&#x27;m trying to say is that if you&#x27;re on a very tight budget and don&#x27;t mind the negatives, you can get a somewhat decent shave from this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost impossible to shave above the neck area, and one has to keep going over the same areas many times, and still there is stubble left.  </li>
            <li> It is big, it is heavy, and it is loud.  </li>
            <li> Trimmer is also poor design - stays right next to razor, so you &#x27;shave&#x27; your hair when trimming sideburns.  </li>
            <li> I even managed to wake my 5-year old son up, who&#x27;s two rooms down the hall, on a few occasions when I shaved early in the morning.</li>
            <li> I am not usually a negative person, but I got this shaver for Christmas, and was pretty let down with how poorly it performed.</li>
            <li> I now have to be very careful when storing the shaver to be sure I don&#x27;t damage the expensive foils.</li>
            <li> not as fast a shave as your ms3 1700 also problems with the head being too hard to remove at times.</li>
            <li> I love the shaver but the condition it arrived in was deplorable.</li>
            <li> head pops off after a few months&#x27; use...seems to be a clear design defect....</li>
            <li> I have been searching for an electric shaver for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have been a long time user of Remington products.  </li>
            <li> Shaving took twice as long.  </li>
            <li> It stays charged for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> Oh, and this thing lasts forever as long as you don&#x27;t drop it on the restroom floor (too often).</li>
            <li> for those thinking about or trying to decide foil over rotary let me just say that i tried all the rotary razors and always found that it took way to long to shave my face...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wishing I had spent the extra money on a Braun.</li>
            <li> give a close shave and stays charged for long time...</li>
            <li> That is when the problem occurs when my hair is too long.</li>
            <li> Will not cut long hair (1/32\\&quot; and over) .</li>
            <li> Some reviews complain it is heavy and loud.</li>
            <li> Plus, it seemed to take me twice as long to even get a satisfactory shave compared to my Norelco.</li>
            <li> Given all the minor problems I have had with the Remmington</li>
            <li> and I thought the instructions were not clear.  </li>
            <li> So a razor that gave me good shaves, and should have lasted for a couple of years, is worthless after three months.</li>
            <li> Finally, the foils wouldn&#x27;t stay snapped down onto the blades after only two months of use.  </li>
            <li> tried using this after a shower, dry shave, and wet shave all with the same results.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;~ Tested both wet and dry, daily over a weeks time.</li>
            <li> Had a Remington in the past and wanted a new one.</li>
            <li> I am 25 years only and have medium thickness for facial hair and usually shave every second day.</li>
            <li> If you get them on wrong the blade cuts a little hole in them real quick.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming that it&#x27;s not much different from other shavers I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li> (the swivel head seems pretty weak.)    </li>
            <li> Even though there are three foils they don&#x27;t have different opening sizes to cut different lengths of beard.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes at least in my case I get some beard stubble that is longer and apparently this shaver skips over those longer stubble&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I find that due to the size it can be difficult to get into the nooks and crannies easily</li>
            <li> It was too \\&quot;floppy\\&quot; for my taste, and difficult to clean.  </li>
            <li> I found I switched back to the Panasonic, only reverting to the Remington if the batteries were dead on the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> This is not a new unit.</li>
            <li> Also, if shave every single day, then this shaver will work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;LL GO BACK TO A CONVENTIONAL RAZOR.</li>
            <li> Sorry to be so negative , but I would want to be fairly warned about this poor product if I was in the market for a new electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Everything the fellow reviewers have said was wrong with this shaver was true.</li>
            <li> The foil screen head will not stay snapped on and keeps coming loose during use.  </li>
            <li> at least 6 or 7 years ago I decided I would get a new one.  </li>
            <li> I had the same problem as a previous reviewer who wrote:    </li>
            <li> The pop up trimmer didn&#x27;t cut close enough and was only about half the width of the trimmer on my previous Remington MS5100.  </li>
            <li> It STILL shaves as close as a blade, though; and the batteries last two and a half weeks on the average.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes progress isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> /&gt;~ Wet or dry use.&lt;br /&gt;~ 3-position pop-up trimmer</li>
            <li> big improvement of this shaver over previous models.  </li>
            <li> AND I HAVE HAD SEVERAL PREVIOUSLY.</li>
            <li> This made it that much more difficult to shave the hard to get hairs on your neck that grow at strange angles and also increased the shaving time.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, the F5790 holds its charge twice as long.  </li>
            <li> The initial shave was quite adequate, but within a few weeks I began to get nicks and scratches which soon became quite uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> But soft plastic doesn&#x27;t click into place over and over like hard plastic pieces do.</li>
            <li> you want to travel with this, be warned that you might be charged for an extra bag (to hold the razor) but at least when you shave in your hotel it will only take you a minute or two to get the job done and be on your way.</li>
            <li> and you have to be careful with the cleaning process.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the worse shave of my life.    </li>
            <li> Leaves a rough finish shave almost like a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.  </li>
            <li> Maybe they really wanted one of those 300 buck systems and this was a poor sub?</li>
            <li> It is 6 inches tall by 2.5 inches wide.  </li>
            <li> I may use this on occasion, in the future, when I don&#x27;t shave for a few days and don&#x27;t have to go to work</li>
            <li> I have used foil razors for the last few years and can get a close shave with my razor but not with this one.</li>
            <li> Replacing the foils should not be a problem if you are careful.  </li>
            <li> I would never have bought another shaver, but my wife insists I am too rough and scratchy.</li>
            <li> Not only does this shaver provide a subpar shave, it does so unevenly.</li>
            <li> So be careful buying this -</li>
            <li> Using the trimmer helped, some, but that required careful maneuvering to try to minimize the skin irritation from the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have said where the foil simply will not stay in after just a few weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> I know I am being harsh and critical of the Remington</li>
            <li> No real negatives.</li>
            <li> It was what I had expected.  </li>
            <li> does not give a close shave as expected.</li>
            <li> Save yourself the trouble of having to send it back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different brands of electric shaver over the years.</li>
            <li> The product works just as expected.  </li>
            <li> It is about what I expected from an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> I knew Remington was a budget brand, but still expected a longer life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While struggling to use it, you&#x27;ll get serenaded with a loud rumble (though as others mentioned, it will mow through a thick beard).  </li>
            <li> It did cut through thick hear, but never got close enough on my neck even with daily use.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not a huge fan of electric razors, but I do like the convenience for occasional use.  </li>
            <li> It worked well enough on my face, as some other reviewers said, it took several passes in some areas and left irritation behind (for me it was the bottom of my face just where it curves into my neck...</li>
            <li> The only small minus was the plastic guard for the blades fits very loosely.</li>
            <li> Less mess than the blade; about the same amount of time; but the shave is not as close.</li>
            <li> Not good enough to pull me away from a plain, old blade for long-term use however.</li>
            <li> Not only do I not have to precariously balance amid wet soap in the shower to shave, but the beard trimmer lets me shave when I&#x27;ve gotten lazy and let things grow out a bit.</li>
            <li> The sad thing is even when you have new foil cover , the razor does a lack luster job which always requires you to touch up with regular razor.</li>
            <li> I got it because a previous Remington product had started to deteriorate - the power button plastic cover came loose   and almost came off.    </li>
            <li> Not a good product, does not shave your face very well, blades not sharp or just designed poorly.</li>
            <li> Remington usually delivers solid products, but I think this razor is subpar.</li>
            <li> I have used numerous electric shavers in the past including another model by Remington</li>
            <li> But the worst design decision has to be the level at which the foils surface meets the side chrome plastic trim (chrome coloured plastic) where during normal shaving that same plastic makes full contact with the skin creating quite the friction and discomfort.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical because I had never used an electric razor like this before</li>
            <li> Noise level hasn&#x27;t been an issue as mentioned in some other reviews.</li>
            <li> a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But &#x27;tough-beard&#x27; guys like me... stick with sharp metal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shave and the trimmer performs extremely well and the cord/cordless feature covers me if I forget to charge it.</li>
            <li> motor sounds like a wailing banshee (extremely loud)&lt;br /&gt;Pivoting head is a joke</li>
            <li> Not built as well as 2 other shaves</li>
            <li> No nicks or burns as other reviews have stated.  </li>
            <li> I bought this in 2013 from Amazon for $34.00, I&#x27;m not sure why it is $88.00 a year later.</li>
            <li> Remington&#x27;s tend to be noisier than other brands</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how to describe it any other way.    </li>
            <li> I used it for 5 or 6 times and it just didn&#x27;t seem  to stay sharp and cut well.</li>
            <li> It is just that I must be very careful in protecting the head.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you let your facial hair grow for a few days, it will have trouble grabbing the longer hairs, but so does every other razor I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> In fact, it leaves hairs behind that I have to go back and use my smaller trimmer to remove.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m old and ill, and am disappointed to have this kind of hassle to deal with.  </li>
            <li> It was very difficult to clean.  </li>
            <li> It shaves closer--with less effort and irritation--than any other shaver I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to push as hard anymore, or go over the same spots again and again.  </li>
            <li> But the pivot A.) do NOT pivot unless you push it with your finger, and B.) have this oversized plastic guard around the screens that makes it extremely hard to get the screens in contact with hair such as under your nose.</li>
            <li> This thing is not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> I guess that makes it a perfectly average shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it got the really long hairs that the foil razors usually won&#x27;t cut.  </li>
            <li> AND HE USUALLY LIKES THIS BRAND FOR LONG TIME AGO</li>
            <li> They did a lousy job, took forever, and didn&#x27;t cut very close.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredibly slow, which wouldn&#x27;t be a problem if it actually gave a close shave.</li>
            <li> The new Remington was a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it cuts the whiskers or just wears them down.  </li>
            <li> Once a week, they&lt;br /&gt;need recharging since the charge indicator is down in the red.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Though my husband likes the shave he gets, the shaver starts breaking down after about 18 months.</li>
            <li> The pivoting head is the other useless feature as it only is needed to speed up the learning curve in how to hold it in hopes of you not returning it after using it only a couple of times.  </li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t for the bad replacement part experience, I would have given this product 4 stars and if I wasn&#x27;t able to make use of my old screen holder I would have given this only 1 star because of this bad experience.  </li>
            <li> but after reading other reviews can see how this missing item could be a blessing if and when the battery dies permanently since you can also use this plugged in.  </li>
            <li> I get ingrown hairs which I did not get with my previous razor.</li>
            <li> I have had it less than two months and&lt;br</li>
            <li> Had a previous Remington and was looking forward to the improvements with this one.  </li>
            <li> I went through 4 foils in less than six months.</li>
            <li> Unlike my previous Remington (MS3 2700), this one pivots as well as flexes.  </li>
            <li> Realizing that I was avoiding the Remington, I finally gave in and started seriously looking at the newer Panasonics.</li>
            <li> I was looking on an auction site and bought a F5 for literally less then the replacement blades are for it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Aside from being noisier than any of my previous rotary razors</li>
            <li> In less than a year I have had to replace the foil cover because of holes in the foil which tears your face apart.</li>
            <li> However, this one appears to run at a slightly slower speed.</li>
            <li> F5790: it has been the closest and fastest shave that I&#x27;ve ever had with any electric razor, including previous Remington&#x27;s; and faster than using a Gillette Mach-5 and shave cream.  </li>
            <li> My foil shaver does NOT shave closer than my previous rotary-type razors.</li>
            <li> It takes slightly longer to shave than a razor</li>
            <li> In less than 10 mins.</li>
            <li> But on the box it says to replace the blades after 6 months and mine lasted 2 and a half years</li>
            <li> Such results are to be expected after a few months of heavy use, but not after a mere several weeks.  </li>
            <li> I used to take my previous shaver to the office (a quiet-running Norelco) and touch up any areas I missed in my pre-coffee, early-morning funk.</li>
            <li> I previously used a Norelco and had no issues.</li>
            <li> Gives me a shave faster and closer than my previous Remington</li>
            <li> Electric razors will never shave as close as blades, but the trade off is less mess, faster shaving times and less irritation.</li>
            <li> years - the other two just plain wore out.  </li>
            <li> When I get done shaving, it hardly seems like I have shaved, the whiskers are so long.</li>
            <li> just a fyi i have tried the braun 7 series in which i paid a huge price for and was sooo disappointed with that product</li>
            <li> It shaves my beard as close as a razor without the mess.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in it at first because it was very noisy and the close shave was not there.</li>
            <li> it just doesn&#x27;t work well; the swivel seems too tight so you get it not tilting at all as you move it across your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this is nothing new.  </li>
            <li> But I must keep my Norelco for longer whiskers, because this new Remington is completely powerless with them.</li>
            <li> I never tried the trimmer as I was pretty mad about the performance of the shaver.</li>
            <li> The flip up trimmer seems a little flimsy</li>
            <li> Just grew to be a pain keeping track of the little spring.</li>
            <li> It seems as if it tends to bind up a little bit, which might have something to do with the light-weight, &#x27;plasticky&#x27; nature of the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The little plastic nubs designed to snap it into place are an engineering marvel of stupidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found little improvement in how close of shave I got.</li>
            <li> I use the shaver on my head and face it cut little or any hairs.</li>
            <li> I was going over spots seemingly 6-7 times and feeling like I was having to push very hard to get it to actually cut anything.  </li>
            <li> The 24 charge time is horrible for such a light razor.  </li>
            <li> I now have a Braun 340 from Amazon and it shaves much closer and has a cutting head that takes care of the longer hairs.</li>
            <li> gave it a few weeks, as some shavers/faces take a bit to work well together.  </li>
            <li> Those weeks were frustrating, as it both irritated my face (about as much as my Panasonic with a broken foil and a 2 year old blade) and failed to get close.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s gone dead on me in the car a few times.</li>
            <li> For those of you using razors stick with them and don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> SO WASTE OF MONEY.....     </li>
            <li> After a few shaves to get used to the razor</li>
            <li> I wasted $50 on this Remington.  </li>
            <li> And I was constantly missing hairs when I shaved with it.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money and a waste of shave time in the morning.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dropped it a few times and all i had to do was buy relpacement head peices from (you guessed it) Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Had a prior Remington that was satisfactory, but not great.</li>
            <li> All I know is that I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> You have to use the razor everyday to get a close shaver.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is a waste because of were it is located.</li>
            <li> I also got a few nicks when going over an area too often.</li>
            <li> I will use it for a travel razor but not for everyday.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> My husband sometimes shaves every few days.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this shaver.</li>
            <li> The shaver head guard and  cleaning brush were missing.</li>
            <li> It was a day and a-half growth (I have fairly heavy growth).  </li>
            <li> Razor arrived with missing parts from the factory.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The so-called shave time of 4 minutes is a sham.</li>
            <li> Has already been consigned to the waste basket.  </li>
            <li> It is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Save your money before you waste it on this shaver.</li>
            <li> I have had this electric razor a few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste the 55.00 for it.</li>
            <li> course we all know that electrical products from China either work poorly, work for a short time, or do not work at all.  </li>
            <li> and I have noticed that in the past 5 years or so the products quality have gone down hill.</li>
            <li> I usually buy what they recommend, but this time they let me down.</li>
            <li> This was not really an easy option with the F5790  3.  </li>
            <li> The problem is the holes in the foil are too small or poorly positioned and individual hair just slides over.</li>
            <li> I was shocked when I started it up for the first time.</li>
            <li> However, sometimes I get lazy and don&#x27;t shave for a few days.</li>
            <li> I usually get quite a few years out of Remington shavers before the battery goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All shavers take longer to shave than with a razor, but this one was very slow and required numerous attempts before any sort of trimming occurred (hard to call it a shave, so</li>
            <li> It cut little by little, if you know what I mean.  </li>
            <li> As I write this review my face is raw and bleeding from using this razor.</li>
            <li> It is also smoother cutting than a 1990 vintage Braun I have, even with a new screen and cutters on the Braun.  </li>
            <li> If I pull the skin tight and press the shaver hard</li>
            <li> Takes very little time to finish the job with the triple shaving heads.</li>
            <li> I do have a thick and heavy beard</li>
            <li> The poor design makes it harder to hold than its peers, and the head does a lackluster job of pivoting.  </li>
            <li> I usually shave immediately after I shower</li>
            <li> I was pretty disappointed in the results from this razor.</li>
            <li> I guess when it dies it&#x27;s dead!</li>
            <li> and then I would find random stubble hairs that had been missed later in the day.  </li>
            <li> I have used Remington electric shavers for the past 35+ years</li>
            <li> I thought that titanium blades and a foil razor would give me a better shave, wrong, wrong, wrong.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> It is not much better on or around ones chin.</li>
            <li> It is not much more than a noisy vibrator.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if the problem will reoccur.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally: Remington bean counters must have forced engineers to change to softer plastic to save a few pennies.</li>
            <li> Still, I was not entirely satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I have used a myriad of shavers over the past years.  </li>
            <li> for the negative, I have to repeatedly go over and over my neck area, for some reason the shaver has trouble in that area??&lt;br</li>
            <li> though I usually replace them once a year, just as a maintenance move.  </li>
            <li> My son asked for this as a Christmas present, when he decided (alas!)</li>
            <li> My husband does not have a heavy, or thick beard.</li>
            <li> Moreover, it took considerable effort cutting the hair on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> The head is so unbalanced that to make it swivel and align to the skin as claimed takes excessive force against the skin to make it swivel.</li>
            <li> The weight distribution of the head and the pivot point are so completely wrong that the head simply doesn&#x27;t swivel against gravity without a lot of pressure.</li>
            <li> The manual is poorly written, and doesn&#x27;t explain what the code is for the flashing lights indicating whether it is fully charged, charging or partially charged.</li>
            <li> Due to the numerous passes, I had quite bad razor burn afterward.  </li>
            <li> but I am disappointed on how fast the blades and cover need to be replaced.</li>
            <li> It remains to be seen how long it lasts and how expensive the replacement heads are.</li>
            <li> While it did a decent job on short stubble, say one day growth for me,  anything longer than that and shaving time increased dramatically and the closeness of the shave suffered horribly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe I got a bad set; we&#x27;ll see when the new ones arrive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was tired of the time and mess of blade shaving for 50 years.  </li>
            <li> looks as though head cover was cheaply made, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Angle makes it difficult to remove stray hairs that the foils can&#x27;t trim.&lt;br /&gt;-one blade comes loose all the time&lt;br</li>
            <li> Save your hard earned money and do not purchase this razor.</li>
            <li> People who say they have to press too hard with the razor and get their face cut have no idea how you should shave with an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> &#x27;Hard to believe?  </li>
            <li> This is hard to explain, but the razor body blocks your view a little.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It would pop out of place, banging into my face, and pushing it hard to stay on</li>
            <li> 34;pop-up&amp;#34; trimmer, but the shaver I received does not pop up and is hard to use.  </li>
            <li> but it hardly cuts the hair at all on my neck.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a non-pivot razor by Remington because of all of these designed-by-monkeys pivot-that-doesn&#x27;t-pivot razors.    </li>
            <li> I press hard when I shave and</li>
            <li> I could not get myself to spend at least an additional $100 (over the Panasonic)for a Braun.</li>
            <li> That is a negative</li>
            <li> suckers</li>
            <li> Thank God for the trimmer, at least I had a way to get all the hairs on the front of my neck and face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;M NOT THRILLED WITH THIS SHAVER.</li>
            <li> with disappointment and always come back to Remington for a close shave.  </li>
            <li> lately I have felt their quality has suffered while the price increased.</li>
            <li> its big, awkward and noisy.&lt;br /&gt;2) will not shave the hairs on your neck,</li>
            <li> purchased the F5790 around Oct. 4th 2012,  when i opened the&lt;br /&gt; package out popped a coupon that expired late 2011 in my 2012 package.</li>
            <li> The part I don&#x27;t like is that it is sooooo slow.  </li>
            <li> the mean time, I had decided to take a chance and purchase the replacement screen and cutters and it appears to work.  </li>
            <li> I had only used rotary shavers in the past, and had bad experiences with quality of cut.  </li>
            <li> big awkward head; impossible to shave around your nose or your upper lip.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Never had serious issues other than having one of the tips that hold the blade on fail.</li>
            <li> As I stated in my title, I&#x27;m not sure if this shaver is made poor or if it&#x27;s just the technology that is inferior to rotary shavers.</li>
            <li> Would of given 5 stars except it is very difficult to remove the cutter assembly for daily cleaning.  </li>
            <li> now I have a worthless shaver don&#x27;t want to go buy a new screen.</li>
            <li> I realize that the vast majority of postings for any product review tends to be negative: because you have a bad experience and you want to shout it from the mountain tops</li>
            <li> Finding foils is next to impossible</li>
            <li> I find that if I have a problem cutting a stubborn hair the answer is less pressure or no pressure, not more.  </li>
            <li> I can not understand why Remington can&#x27;t make a longer lasting product, I payed $48.00 and the shaver was bad after 2 months.</li>
            <li> now it takes at least 10 minutes to do a poor job</li>
            <li> Having said that, it&#x27;s really not a fair comparison at all.</li>
            <li> That is not good.</li>
            <li> Shaver came with the wrong plastic head guard that does not fit or stay in place when shaver is not being used (listed as item number 6 in &amp;#34;Product Features&amp;#34; section of package insert).</li>
            <li> This shaver is a totally different technology and it works terrible if your hair is to long.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was rather disappointed, but before I sent it back</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed with this recent model Remington.  </li>
            <li> From just dumb luck</li>
            <li> I keep going back to give it another chance, and I am always disappointed.</li>
            <li> You have to push very hard to get it to work just marginally well.</li>
            <li> If you have a tough beard, like mine, this shaver does the job.  </li>
            <li> Since I was following instructions that told me I could order parts at that site, it is very disappointing that the manufacturer doesn&#x27;t stock parts for this shaver.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Handling&lt;br /&gt;Decent, but not great.  </li>
            <li> The foil also seems to be of poor quality, and I get tons of irritation when I shave with this model.</li>
            <li> Worse yet, you cannot get screens or blades even from Remington....</li>
            <li> I had to replace a microscreen razor which was of poor quality and now this.  </li>
            <li> It does a particularly poor job under the jaw line and around the throat.</li>
            <li> my opinion, the secret to a close shave with any electric razor is skin preparation.</li>
            <li> Not happy at all.  </li>
            <li> Behind the ears is a bit tricky because of the devices bulk</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it wasn&#x27;t, at least for</li>
            <li> I routinely skip a day or two on weekends and incompatibility between my facial hair and the shaver was just too annoying.  </li>
            <li> If you skip shaving a day or two, then it is worse.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s satisfactory but not great.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is about electric shavers and neck hairs, but they ALL seem to ignore approximately 1/2 the hairs that I have there.</li>
            <li> and they had gotten thin from being used 3-5 times a week for just over 5 years</li>
            <li> After that it did an incredibly poor job.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-precision trimmer (built in) poorly designed.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this shaver to replace the Remington MS3 1700 that I have had for approximately five years.</li>
            <li> Therefore is irritating and time consuming.</li>
            <li> and this is the worst shaver by far!</li>
            <li> Anyone who has cleaned an electric shaver knows how incredibly tedious and frustrating it can be.</li>
            <li> Terrible for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Cleaning was annoying, required brushing, and was never really done.  </li>
            <li> This one is by far the worst when it comes to the life of the foil.</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst shaver I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> Got tired of replacing the expensive foils and blades.  </li>
            <li> , other hate it.  </li>
            <li> I am a little disappointed in its performance.</li>
            <li> It is a bit difficult to close the lid</li>
            <li> Rather it looked like I had tried to shave with a dulll and rusty pair of sheep shears and the Reminton was just about as uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Protective plastic head cover difficult to snap into place over the shaving head.</li>
            <li> Ill call it a trim).  </li>
            <li> Not impressed with this product.  </li>
            <li> F5790 (with a promise from the company that it would work as a corded after the battery failed).  </li>
            <li> Sorry Remington,</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, the foil head cover failed to stay on, meaning it came off in the drawer.</li>
            <li> If the foil gets bent, it because useless, so that made me nervous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, I find it difficult to get a close shave with this product.</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars because of the mediocre job it did on my face but advertising this as a head shaver</li>
            <li> When there is a second day&#x27;s growth, this shaver is simply terrible.</li>
            <li> as a result, I have to do weird things to get the shaver to work at all.  </li>
            <li> This is way expensive.</li>
            <li> It just fails after a while.</li>
            <li> My MS2-250, probably wrong model number, gave the closest shave ever for me</li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> Neck areas are the worst, probably only cuts 70% of the hair on my neck.  </li>
            <li> He got terrible facial skin burn from it.</li>
            <li> I hate the 3 round spinning head ones I have yet to try one that even comes close to this one.</li>
            <li> Needless to say the shaver never gave a close shave and stubble showed up soon after shaving.  </li>
            <li> given how useless this product was.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Hasn&#x27;t failed yet&lt;</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> I took it to my workbench magnifier to see if there was anything I did wrong.</li>
            <li> It is extremely uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> get a lousy shave.&lt;br /&gt;8</li>
            <li> Very poor trimmer and difficult to shave longer hairs.</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed to receive something that was not a complete product.</li>
            <li> very poorly around neck</li>
            <li> unhappy with electric razor.</li>
            <li> It just does not seem to have sufficient cutting ability.  </li>
            <li> After cleaning the cutting blades with the provided brush the hairpocket, that&#x27;s the plastic holder for the foils, will not stay on the unit when its turned on.  </li>
            <li> There is no comparison for comfort or cutting.</li>
            <li> It is awkward.  </li>
            <li> Trimmer attachment works but adds to the noise and is awkward.</li>
            <li> Disappointment awaits you if you buy this product.  </li>
            <li> It made noise like it was doing a lot of cutting.</li>
            <li> It goes without saying I was mad as hell since I had to shell out $40.00 for the part.</li>
            <li> WRONG!</li>
            <li> DID A LOUSY JOB!  </li>
            <li> This was really annoying if I was at work and felt my face and then noticed random stray hairs that had been missed even though I went over that spot 10 times that morning.  </li>
            <li> plastic head are nearly impossible to grasp.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> Nope, the clasp design is just bad.</li>
            <li> This Remington is not all bad though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason for 4 rather than 5 stars is I think the way the foils are to be removed from the shaver for cleaning is a bad design flaw.  </li>
            <li> Now the bad, where to start...</li>
            <li> TOO BAD</li>
            <li> Nope, the clasp design is just bad.</li>
            <li> It is actually painful to get under my nose shaved.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still quite shocked that this somehow passed the design checks and QA at Remington.</li>
            <li> This razor is actually painful for me to use.</li>
            <li> This, sadly, is among the worst.  </li>
            <li> I was also disappointed that there was no stand for this</li>
            <li> I was disappointed by the quality of the shave provided by this shaver.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> but I was really disappointed that I couldn&#x27;t use this thing at all.</li>
            <li> Disappointed with the quality of shave.  </li>
            <li> Bought this shaver a year ago and am extremely disappointed with it&#x27;s performance as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Had been using F4790 for 4+ year and wanted a closer shave but was disappointed</li>
            <li> My husband was very unhappy with this razor.</li>
            <li> I am very unhappy about this product.  </li>
            <li> Hate it?  </li>
            <li> I am chucking this crap for a braun.</li>
            <li> I hate it.  </li>
            <li> Bad review!  </li>
            <li> Bad mistake!  </li>
            <li> I hated the Braun from the start.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I am a very unhappy customer!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in the performance.</li>
            <li> This razor is the worst razor I have ever had.  </li>
            <li> It holds its charge well, and it isn&#x27;t horrible.</li>
            <li> The worst razor I have ever bought.  </li>
            <li> The results were terrible.  </li>
            <li> The popup trimmer is terrible.  </li>
            <li> I have never written a review before now, but this product is the worst I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li> but the noice is terrible.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE WORST SHAVER EVER.</li>
            <li> I paid around $90.00 for it and it was the worst shave ever.</li>
            <li> This is especially difficult when shaving my neck/jawbone area.</li>
            <li> The shave is terrible.</li>
            <li> I have used electric shavers for 25 years and this is the worst shaver I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Worst of all, Remington changed the foil head design and the head now pops off every time I shave.  </li>
            <li> This is the worst shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s sleek and a bit loud.  For the price, I expected it to perform as the online reviews indicated, as it was ranked one of the top head shavers for 2015.  Even with the pivot head, and very little stubble, it still does not catch every hair no matter how many times you go over it.  I was expecting it to leave the shaved area as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom, but even if it manages to catch the hair, the area is left feeling dry and not as smooth as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the razor. Arrived in record time.</li>
            <li> it is ok. It is a bit difficult to close the lid and you have to be careful with the cleaning process.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor for my 97 year old father in law. It arrived in a short period of time. He likes it and that&#x27;s all that matters.</li>
            <li> Loved it! Even with sencative skin.</li>
            <li> If you have a tough beard, like mine, this shaver does the job.  Razor burn happens with or without pre-shave.</li>
            <li> My husband used this for a month and here is what he had to say about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I would classify this as a mid-range shaver. It has a battery gauge which indicates when it&#x27;s time to recharge. It is easy to clean, and the swivel head does a decent job shaving. However, I found the design to be bulky compared with my regular shaver. Also, this one had some difficulty getting neck hairs. It is also somewhat loud.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since he wasn&#x27;t thrilled with it, I decided to try it myself. Except, of course, on my legs. I loved it! Not only do I not have to precariously balance amid wet soap in the shower to shave, but the beard trimmer lets me shave when I&#x27;ve gotten lazy and let things grow out a bit. Since the beard trimmer is larger than on other electric shavers, and the way it was positioned so I could easily grip it, I found I loved shaving my legs with it. So even though men may not be happy with this, I think women may find it useful.</li>
            <li> I thought I would try a elctric razor and found out that no matter how many passes I made (I tried going over areas 20 amd 30 times) I could not get a shave that even came close to be being worthy of the name razor.  Rather it looked like I had tried to shave with a dulll and rusty pair of sheep shears and the Reminton was just about as uncomfortable.  The few wiskers it managed to grab it plucked more than cut and  I found myself wondering if anyone in the company actually tried this thing before releasing it.  Absolutely the worse shave of my life.    Disclaimer:  I do have a thick and heavy beard so perhaps a teenage guy with a few wispy hairs might find this useful - sure didn&#x27;t work it you were actually an adult male which I assume were the intended users.</li>
            <li> Having used various Braun, Norelco, and Panasonic shavers over the years, I decided that I could probably be almost as happy with an (relatively) inexpensive Remington.  I figured Remington had to have tech as good as a 3-5 year old shaver from the big boys.  Let&#x27;s see how it went.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Design&lt;br /&gt;Well, it&#x27;s a shaver (and a big one at that), that&#x27;s about it.  Ergonomic--not really.  Aesthetically pleasing--nope.  Balanced--barely and could be quite a bit better.  Quality--doesn&#x27;t look or feel like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Handling&lt;br /&gt;Decent, but not great.  The poor design makes it harder to hold than its peers, and the head does a lackluster job of pivoting.  While struggling to use it, you&#x27;ll get serenaded with a loud rumble (though as others mentioned, it will mow through a thick beard).  Battery life is adequate, but I expected more from such a huge shaver (maybe the big loud motor took up all the space).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a few weeks, as some shavers/faces take a bit to work well together.  Those weeks were frustrating, as it both irritated my face (about as much as my Panasonic with a broken foil and a 2 year old blade) and failed to get close.  It did cut through thick hear, but never got close enough on my neck even with daily use.  Irritation was reduced with regular use, but it never was acceptable (fyi I&#x27;ve been happy with Braun, Norelco, and Panasonic shavers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict&lt;br /&gt;I should have either gotten new foil/blades for my Panasonic, bought better new electric, or go back to blades (my current plan).  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> From a male member of my family:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very unhappy with electric razor. It does not cut close and I spent more time re-shaving than if I had used a straight razor and shaving cream. I usually shave immediately after I shower and I tried using this razon with (and without) pre-shave lotion - neither way did I get a good shave. I picked up my 15 year old electric razor and started using it again.</li>
            <li> I have been a blade shaver for years.  I had only used rotary shavers in the past, and had bad experiences with quality of cut.  So, I decided to try this Remington model.  First, the shave is excellent.  In less than 10 minutes, I have a very smooth shave.  With just a few passes (gentle, circular motion) it rivaled what a blade did.  I did have to work on my neck some with it, but I have to do that with a blade, too.    I noticed from the start that the pivot head pivots very easily and gets looser with use.  The foil covers must be removed for cleaning daily.  After two months, the plastic housing for the covers broke apart when I took them off to clean the razor.    In the end, this would be a great razor to see if foil shaving is for you, but as the saying goes, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Remington usually delivers solid products, but I think this razor is subpar. It&#x27;s incredibly slow, which wouldn&#x27;t be a problem if it actually gave a close shave. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t. The foil also seems to be of poor quality, and I get tons of irritation when I shave with this model. I would much rather pony up a little bit more money to get a more reliable shaver. This thing is not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> Compared to my forty year old remington, this one works great. Charge lasts forever and shaves quick and close.</li>
            <li> I have had Remington shavers for many years and have been very happy....requesting a new one when the soft vinyl cover on the on off switch broke and no one to repair it. I got this F5790 for xmas. Didn&#x27;t use it until I found that I could use my old Remington cover with it..I travel alot and needed to protect it in my dopkit. It did a medioker job of shaving compared to my older one. Now when I tour it on the screens pop up, making it unusable...so have had to return to my old one. I have had it more than 3 months,so I can&#x27;t return it.Wish I could get my old one fixed.</li>
            <li> I had the same problem as a previous reviewer who wrote:    \\&quot;After about 1 month of use, suddenly one morning the foil head decides that it will no longer stay clasped to the body.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Works well, especially on longer whiskers that my older Braun was missing.  Very comfortable shave.  Protective plastic head cover difficult to snap into place over the shaving head.</li>
            <li> I am a little disappointed in its performance. It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as my old Remington 3 head shaver and I can&#x27;t figure out why. It is also more difficult to clean (I haven&#x27;t been able to figure out how to get the head cover off easily to rinse it  out).</li>
            <li> We got the new shaver based on a Consumer Reports review and the price found on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;When the shaver arrived we plugged it in to charge and the nex morning my husband said it just didn&#x27;t do the job.  I tried it on him and he was right. I don&#x27;t know if we got a lemon or Remington is going for the new movie star look.&lt;br /&gt;I had to box it up, send it back (and pay postage) and go buy a different brand of shaver locally, it works great.&lt;br /&gt;Is there a rating below one star?</li>
            <li> I have been searching for an electric shaver for a long time.  I have literally tried dozens of brands and types of shaver.  This, sadly, is among the worst.  While most give me razorburn, this one had the added letdown of a poor shave.    All shavers take longer to shave than with a razor, but this one was very slow and required numerous attempts before any sort of trimming occurred (hard to call it a shave, so Ill call it a trim).  Due to the numerous passes, I had quite bad razor burn afterward.  I also had the \\&quot;5 O&#x27;clock Shadow\\&quot; before I was done, as that was about the best result this product could offer.    While I have yet to find the perfect shaver for me, I must say that I have found MANY shavers better suited than this one.    I do not like to give bad reviews, but I can honestly say that there are better products out there that this one, at several price points as well.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this electric shaver upon receiving it, but I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month and, frankly, it just isn&#x27;t that good a shaver.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the blades or something else, but it just doesn&#x27;t give a good smooth shave.  I&#x27;ve used other electric shavers and found that rotary blades seem to work better for me than this more traditional type of shaver.  Of course, your mileage may vary, but I&#x27;d certainly look around for other shavers before making a purchase of this model as you can probably do better for about the same price.</li>
            <li> It takes forever to get a good shave from this razor.  It just does not seem to have sufficient cutting ability.  I am very dissatisfied with it, and have gone back to my old Panasonic Shaver.</li>
            <li> After a history of disappointing experiences with electric razors, I was looking forward to having a good experience with new and updated model.  Unfortunately, this is nothing new.  When I try to compare this with the strait razor - I find no reason to switch.  Shaving with this electric razor takes a long time - repeatedly covering the same areas to try and get a closer shave.  After pulling, stretching, and burning, you can almost get as close as a normal razor, but it takes about 5 times as long.</li>
            <li> The Flex360 is light weight.  The motor is way to light for this razor.  The charge does not last the 20 days but more like 2-4 days.  The 24 charge time is horrible for such a light razor.  When the battery dies, the razor quits and does not have a quick charge function.  This shaver does not shave very close.  Leaves a rough finish shave almost like a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.  Worse yet, you cannot get screens or blades even from Remington....they are simply not to be found.       I have been a long time user of Remington products.  I had to replace a microscreen razor which was of poor quality and now this.  Recent quality is on the nose dive with Remington products.  I am no longer buying Remington razors.      Save your hard earned money and do not purchase this razor.</li>
            <li> This razor is OK if you have a good amount of time to shave.  You have to go over the same areas several times to get a close shave.  If your beard is longer it seems to give you a closer shave then if you are shaving every day.  For the price I think you could find a better razor than this.  I was pretty disappointed in the results from this razor.</li>
            <li> My wallet smarts whenever it gets near one of those 300 dollar shavers.  They cost so much that they call them shaving systems, which reminds me of the vacuum cleaner man calling his canister vac a \\&quot;cleaning system\\&quot; not a vacuum cleaner. If they call it a \\&quot;system\\&quot; it means you have to pay more money.  For my money this is a great little shaver.  I have two others, one I reviewed for the Vine.  This one has the advantage of more floating heads to get more surface area.  It shaves faster than the other two single foils, and that&#x27;s due mostly to the heads. I can&#x27;t detect the subtle claims of smoothness in these foil shavers, to me they are mostly the same in feel.  They also all do a lousy job when the beard gets more than a few days old, you need to use a blade then they will pull your beard and take forever to shave it otherwise.    That said I alternate blade and electric all the time, and this is a pretty good one.  It even has a lot of the features found on those 300 dollar shaving systems. Fuel gauge, auto detect overseas power, quick charge and others.  This one however while it charges fast, when peaked it lasts less long that my two single foil shavers.  I think the power usage is up with the multifoils.  I sometimes shave on the go and it&#x27;s gone dead on me in the car a few times. Still it seems better to me than the average review it&#x27;s gotten to this point.  Maybe they really wanted one of those 300 buck systems and this was a poor sub?</li>
            <li> This razor is mediocre at best. Yes it can recharge and the charge lasts over a week for me, but thats where it ends. The shave is not consistantly close, many stray hairs and once in a while I get ingrown hairs which I did not get with my previous razor. For nearly $60 dollars, you can find a better alternative.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used razors because I could never see how an electric could give as close a shave.  I decided to give this a fair shot and try it since the price was right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impressions on this shaver is that it is HUGE!  It is 6 inches tall by 2.5 inches wide.  This was definitely not what I expected (size wise) as I see much smaller electric razors in the stores.  I was also disappointed that there was no stand for this but after reading other reviews can see how this missing item could be a blessing if and when the battery dies permanently since you can also use this plugged in.  It does fit in my hand well as the grip is right.  I also like the fact it has LEDs showing how much power is left.  I charged this once so far and have used this for several weeks and it is still near full power and has not been recharged since the initial 24 hour charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried using this after a shower, dry shave, and wet shave all with the same results.  It takes me significantly longer to shave with this (up to 10 times longer) than with a razor and I cannot get a clean shave like with a razor.  If I pull the skin tight and press the shaver hard it gets some areas almost as clean as a razor but cannot give me a clean shave all over.  I still feel stubble and when I use a razor after using this I can see there is still a fair amount that the electric cannot reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those that like electric razors and are used to the stubble feel and claim this is as close as a blade may like this but I find it takes up too much of my time to use it to get it anywhere near as close a shave as I like.  I may use this on occasion, in the future, when I don&#x27;t shave for a few days and don&#x27;t have to go to work but this will never replace or even get the same amount of use as my razor blade.  The trimmer works OK but also requires a few passes before it cleans up nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I have never owned an electric razor I cannot provide a comparison on whether the 3 heads are better than 2.  I can&#x27;t picture how much difference it would make considering how long it took me to get a somewhat close shave using this.  I can say that had I seen how large this shaver was I wouldn&#x27;t have gotten it.  I can also say that it hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin nor have I had discomfort with the edges like another reviewer mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be sticking with my razor.  I rated it a 3 because it is easy to clean and works as stated but because it can&#x27;t give as close a shave as I like and is HUGE that 3 is stretching a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you using razors stick with them and don&#x27;t waste your money.I can&#x27;t picture how much difference it would make considering how long it took me to get a somewhat close shave using this.

            <li> My dear hubby finally got around to shaving his beard off because it is getting warm.  He tried this out right after shearing off his wooly coat and said it was okay but not what he wanted but he said he would try it a few more times as I guess the hair is much softer when it&#x27;s been grown out like that for a bit.  He has tried this three times since and said that it would be great for a man who shaves daily but for him it wasn&#x27;t exactly his cup of tea.  He likes a bit of the wiskers inbetween shavings and said that it just doesn&#x27;t do a good enough job for the once or twice a week thing.  So if you are a man who has a job or wife that likes you clean shaven on a daily basis then this would most certainly be a great product for you.</li>
            <li> While this shaver is a great product, for me it is really just to average. I have used many electric shavers and I would rate this Remington somewhere above the Norelco shavers and beneath the Braun shavers. The major benefit of shavers such as a Braun Activator is the self-cleaning mechanism, which may sound like a luxury that you don&#x27;t need, but is actually very important. Anyone who has cleaned an electric shaver knows how incredibly tedious and frustrating it can be. For this reason, I would recommend investing the extra money in a shaver that can clean itself and save you valuable time and stress in the long run. Overall, though (if you don&#x27;t mind the cleaning aspect) this shaver does its job, and does it well. For the price it is offered, I would definitely recommend it. Just be sure to consider your options so you know what is best for your needs.</li>
            <li> For once in my life I read up on the best cordless electric razor for the value.  My three previous have been a cheaper version that for the most part do their job.  This razor is the worst razor I have ever had.  I can spend 5 minutes on one side of my face and still have stubble all over.  I literally had to go back into the garbage and pull out my old razor and charge it up to finish my face.  As I mentioned I have no idea how this razor was best for the value.</li>
            <li> This shaver does the job--mostly. I would not say this shaver does a spectacular job, and it actually requires many passes to get everything. It holds its charge well, and it isn&#x27;t horrible. I guess that makes it a perfectly average shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One major flaw is that I followed the manual&#x27;s instructions for ordering replacement parts and this shaver isn&#x27;t even on the list on Remington&#x27;s website. Since I was following instructions that told me I could order parts at that site, it is very disappointing that the manufacturer doesn&#x27;t stock parts for this shaver. I guess when it dies it&#x27;s dead!</li>
            <li> I was wondering if anyone has had this problem.  I have had two F5790s and they have both had the same problem.  After cleaning the cutting blades with the provided brush the hairpocket, that&#x27;s the plastic holder for the foils, will not stay on the unit when its turned on.  It just pops off.  I am now waiting on my third F5790 from Remington hoping that they have discovered the design flaw and fixed it.  To Remington&#x27;s credit they have replaced the first two at no charge and shipped them to me for free.    As for the quality of the shave its a fair performer.  Nothing to rave about but it does well enough for a morning shave.</li>
            <li> This razor has several problems, chief among them is that it does not provide a close shave at all. I have used foil razors for the last few years and can get a close shave with my razor but not with this one. This one is also huge compared to my other razor and for all that size the battery life seems very short. The tilting head is what attracted me to this razor, and while it seems like a good idea it just doesn&#x27;t work well; the swivel seems too tight so you get it not tilting at all as you move it across your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I do like about this is that the motor seems really strong and when I skip shaving for several days this will mow through a thick beard and get it short enough that I can switch to my other razor for the close work.</li>
            <li> It gives a very close shave, but not evenly across the whole face. Also, it often burns my skin, leaving nicks on his face.</li>
            <li> I previously had a Remington MS5100 that has worked great for at least 3 years.  It finally broke though and I thought this would be a great replacement but turned out to be a bad bet.  I ended up returning the F5790 to Walmart.  My three main problems were as follows:  1.  The shaver for some reason just misses a lot of hairs - it literally doubled my shaving time compared to my last Remington MS5100 and then I would find random stubble hairs that had been missed later in the day.  This was really annoying if I was at work and felt my face and then noticed random stray hairs that had been missed even though I went over that spot 10 times that morning.  2. The pop up trimmer didn&#x27;t cut close enough and was only about half the width of the trimmer on my previous Remington MS5100.  This made it that much more difficult to shave the hard to get hairs on your neck that grow at strange angles and also increased the shaving time.  I previously would use the foil on most of my face and the pop-up trimmer on my neck and to go back over anything that was missed.  This was not really an easy option with the F5790  3.  This shaver was huge compared to my last Remington.  I didn&#x27;t really notice it until I pulled it out of the box and saw them side by side.  Overall I would not recommend the F5790.  I am 25 years only and have medium thickness for facial hair and usually shave every second day.</li>
            <li> I bought this Razor two months ago. After about 2 month of use, suddenly one morning the foil head decides that it will no longer stay clasped to the body and I am no longer able to use the razor. Nope, the clasp design is just bad. It should no longer be on Amazon&#x27;s listing.   UPDATE: Whoops! The fine folks at Remington do not take returns. SO WASTE OF MONEY.....     DO NOT BUY!!!!!</li>
            <li> This model does everything well except shave your beard.  You have to go over &amp; over &amp; over the area to get it to cut anything.  I don&#x27;t know if it cuts the whiskers or just wears them down.  In case you&#x27;re wondering, I just have an AVERAGE beard, certainly not heavy.  I have to admit, I&#x27;m not a huge fan of electric razors, but I do like the convenience for occasional use.  I received this as a gift and it replaced an old Norelco that was just worn out.  There is no comparison for comfort or cutting.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed by the quality of the shave provided by this shaver. It is not where near as close as a razor blade. It does a particularly poor job under the jaw line and around the throat. I have gone back to using my razor blade.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used an electric razor in years but shaving cream is killing my face so I decided to try again.  I used to have a Braun, but no way was I going to pay that much again for a razor at this time.  I don&#x27;t think the Remington is awkward or heavy at all, in fact it feels perfect in my hands.  The angle of the foils and the fact that they pivot is a real plus when shaving the neck area.  Electric razors will never shave as close as blades, but the trade off is less mess, faster shaving times and less irritation.</li>
            <li> This shaver misses a lot of hairs, especially on the neck.  My husband wishes he had chosen a different one.</li>
            <li> It took a few days to get my face used to this razor, but now it is great -- lots of power (sounds like a rice rocket taking off).  My old Remington triple foil was at the point that it only held a charge for a week and since i bought it reconditioned from Remington for $30 dollars at least 6 or 7 years ago I decided I would get a new one.  Now that I have the new one I see one real advantage of the old one --- you could replace the foils separately on the old one and on the new one you need to replace the whole assembly. Replacing the foils should not be a problem if you are careful.  The times I had to replace the foils were not the  fault of the razor, but my neglect in taking the foils off and putting them on.  If you get them on wrong the blade cuts a little hole in them real quick.  This razor ran for over two weeks on the first charge -- it came with a full charge, or maybe less than a full charge so it should do better on the next charge.  I like the green lights that tell how much charge it has and then when you get low the last light turns to red.  Time to charge it.  I also like that in a pinch or if I want to use it plugged in I can use it that way.    After a few shaves to get used to the razor I get nice close shaves with no irritation.  People who say they have to press too hard with the razor and get their face cut have no idea how you should shave with an electric razor.  You should use no pressure at all or at least very light pressure.  If you just let the razor glide over your face it cuts quite well.  I find that if I have a problem cutting a stubborn hair the answer is less pressure or no pressure, not more.  With any electric razor there are always a few hairs that are hard to cut, so I always shave once a week with a 5-blade razor to get a clean start for the next week.  Of course my beard is very grey so the little hairs don&#x27;t show much, except in the right light.    This is a good razor and a good value for the money.</li>
            <li> I have used this shaver about twice each week for almost two years. After dozens of drops, it is stil going strong.</li>
            <li> It seems like a good shaver. Nice features. But it just does not shave very close and if you don&#x27;t shave on weekends, you will not be able to cut the long hairs. I wasted $50 on this Remington.  I now have a Braun 340 from Amazon and it shaves much closer and has a cutting head that takes care of the longer hairs. BUY THE BRAUN AND FORGET ABOUT THIS REMINGTON.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this product.  Would not purchase again.  Does not give a close shave, and does not meet expectations.</li>
            <li> From hubby: A nice shaver. I am not a big electric shaver kind of guy, I have a Braun shaver that I had purchased a few years ago, but have moved back to the blades. When my wife said she had ordered it through Vine, I knew that I would have to prep my face before I used this. For the month prior I used the Braun and then switched to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a hefty shaver, is is comfortable in the hand, but it is a little bulky.  The shaver does a good job of giving you a nice close shave, it was better than the Braun I had prepped with. It&#x27;s pivoting head allows for you to get at all the angles well. I did not like the sides of the foil (the holding arms) because they would gouge at my skin. I used this shaver for about a month or so and it did a good job, I just don&#x27;t have the skin for an electric razor--if I my skin could take the effects, I would probably be using it still.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for 25 years now.  In that time I&#x27;ve owned mostly Remingtons.  After my $139 Braun broke back in the 80&#x27;s, I swore to stick with Remington.  I also had a brief period of using manual razors.  Perhaps I have tougher hair than most, but I found manual shaving to be expensive, because I needed to replace the blades often to keep it from hurting when I shaved.  My last Remington before the F5790 was a fantastic shaver with one fatal flaw:  it only worked as a cordless, so when the battery went kaput a little over a year ago I decided to pick up a new Remington F5790 (with a promise from the company that it would work as a corded after the battery failed).  One year later I say, emphatically, WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK.  You would have to push WAY too hard to make the floating head useful.  The Triple foil is way too big to get at all the nooks and crannies on your face.  Shaving took twice as long.  At first I thought I just needed to get used to it.  But I never did.  And I was constantly missing hairs when I shaved with it.  Almost every day, for an entire year, despite trying my best, I would get to work and find at least one (and usually many) hairs that it had missed.  Then I would be self conscious about it for the rest of the day.  I like to have a clean shave, and the F5790 just couldn&#x27;t give me that.  My recommendation to Remington is to cut out the gimmickry and make a simple shaver that works.  It doesn&#x27;t have to be fancy, it just has to work.  I just bought my first Norelco this morning (A 7345XL, $59 at Kohls right now), and this evening I had the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric razor, and I did it in half the time.  Not only that, but it got the really long hairs that the foil razors usually won&#x27;t cut.  As if that weren&#x27;t enough, it&#x27;s much quieter too.  Sorry Remington, but you&#x27;re fired.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product. It was too \\&quot;floppy\\&quot; for my taste, and difficult to clean.  I got it because a previous Remington product had started to deteriorate - the power button plastic cover came loose   and almost came off.    Try another model.  This one is not so hot and doesn&#x27;t shave any better than fixed head shavers.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Remington F5790 back on April 25, 2011 it is now April 17, 2012 and I am waiting delivery of my new Phillips-Norelco shaver. I had gone thru the original set of foil heads after 2 months and then the replacement set that i purchased with this shaver in about 2-3 months. Everything the fellow reviewers have said was wrong with this shaver was true. From the heads not staying attached to the shaver to the foil heads needing to be replaced every 2 or 3 months. I have used Remington electric shavers for the past 35+ years and I have noticed that in the past 5 years or so the products quality have gone down hill. At this point I will never again purchase a Remington product of any kind. I can not understand why Remington can&#x27;t make a longer lasting product, I payed $48.00 and the shaver was bad after 2 months. I would have been willing to pay say twice as much if the foil heads would last say maybe a year and the whole heads attachment would stay on while shaving.</li>
            <li> the foil tops flying off and i hold it on for 5 minutes yhrn it works</li>
            <li> This shaver was a BIG disappointment after having seen it first in the June 2011 Consumer Reports magazine that gave it a CR Best Buy rating. It is noisy, it did not do a good job of shaving the hair on my face and neck, and it definitely does not compare much to my old Philips Norelco 7310XL Rotary Shaver that is less expensive and does do a decent job of cleaning up my face and neck.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this as a gift.  She chose Remington because her father had worked for Remington-Rand Corporation in a division unrelated to shavers.  It is smoother than an almost new Remington rotary blade shaver she gave me last Christmas.  It is also smoother cutting than a 1990 vintage Braun I have, even with a new screen and cutters on the Braun.  One surprising thing about the Remington is that the cutters and screen do not seem to fill up with whisker shavings like other shavers I have used.  I would never have bought another shaver, but my wife insists I am too rough and scratchy.</li>
            <li> This is a triple screen tilting head rechargeable razor.  It is inexpensive, compared to others I&#x27;ve seen.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER: it really doesn&#x27;t shave me all that closely, even with liquid preparation or the dry stuff.  If I&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t press firmly, I get 5 o&#x27;clock shadow instead of a clean shave.  I have had it less than two months and&lt;br /&gt;already I&#x27;ve had to order a replacement set of screens and cutters.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I got a bad set; we&#x27;ll see when the new ones arrive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The batteries at 12 volts must be on the small size, since I get only one week&#x27;s shaving out of a full 24-hour charge.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe this is normal for this type of razor but I doubt it.  My old razor, a Remington MS 260, runs 3 weeks to a month&lt;br /&gt;on a charge and gives a better shave to boot.  I replaced it because the switch cover is gone and I have to hold the case&lt;br /&gt;together with duct tape- yet it still shaves close and gives me a shave \\&quot;as good as a blade\\&quot;.  Maybe I just got a set of&lt;br /&gt;bad cutters or screens; the PRC is not noted for its quality control on consumer items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered replacement screens and cutters (as I already mentioned) and I&#x27;ll update this when they arrive and I get&lt;br /&gt;another chance to try the razor.  I like the design, it&#x27;s just the shave I&#x27;m underwhelmed about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;July 12 2012:  New cutters and screen shave better, yes.  Do they shave as close as a blade or as close as my old MS 260? No.  Do they do&lt;br /&gt;an adequate job? Yeah.  Admittedly, this wasn&#x27;t the fanciest shaver in the store, and it didn&#x27;t pretend to be.  As I said, the shave is ADEQUATE&lt;br /&gt;to keep me neat looking.  The clippers actually work better than the blades, and I have a fair amount of facial hair to keep trimmed and neat as well as facial areas that need to be shaved clean.  It works  for both situations.  The batteries are 7-day batteries, period.  Once a week, they&lt;br /&gt;need recharging since the charge indicator is down in the red.&lt;br /&gt;(sigh) I wish the old MS 260hadn&#x27;t fallen apart, since it lasts longer and shaves better, but at this point it&#x27;s more duct tape than plastic and case parts just keep dying.  It STILL shaves as close as a blade, though; and the batteries last two and a half weeks on the average.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes progress isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Remington and Norelco electric razors for decades, but the Remington F5790 is the best foil shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  It shaves closer--with less effort and irritation--than any other shaver I&#x27;ve used. And, it&#x27;s effortless to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, the secret to a close shave with any electric razor is skin preparation. For years, I tried everything I could find to prepare my skin and beard--including powders and lotions recommended by shaver manufacturers.  But, nothing has worked as well as washing my face with ivory soap. &#x27;Yep, you heard right, ivory soap. (All I do is wash with it in the shower, and when my skin dries, it&#x27;s perfectly prepared for shaving.) &#x27;Hard to believe?  Well, try it.</li>
            <li> Good, close shave.  Much better than $200 competitors (Braun, etc.).  Only complaints - louder than most - trimmer is a little klutzy.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin and this was a smooth ride.  Remington is the brand you want for a shave, these guys have been in the business longer than anyone else as an SPECIALIZED brand of razor needs. So, I really trust these guys when it comes to having a razor in my face!</li>
            <li> As most have already said, the Remington F5790 delivers a good shave at first but after a few weeks I found I was having more pain due to the \\&quot;rougher\\&quot; shave. They improved the old school razor but failed to realize that it takes more than putting LED in your name to impress customers. My Panasonic doesn&#x27;t deliver as close of shave, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much either. After a while I started shaving every other day as I started enjoying shaving less and less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remington F5790 delivers an improvement on past Remington Shavers but shows that they still can&#x27;t stand up to Braun and Panasonic for long term happiness. If you are a long time Remington user, you will find this to be a nice upgrade, but if not I would check out other shavers first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> Remington F5790 is satisfactory but does not do as good a job as my old Norelco.  Motor is to noisy almost sound like a small motor boat.</li>
            <li> This is a good shaver. It stays charged for a long period of time. Also it shaves pretty close. The only thing I do not like very much about it is the trimmer. It does not work very well.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price and I could not be happier. This shaver does it all and I would recommend it to everyone needing a new foil shaver.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Remington razor to replace a Remington Rotary razor that was over 10 years old.  I made a mistake, if i do not shave every day, I do not get a close shave, or any type of shave for that matter, i need to go back to my Gilette Fusion Blade Razor.  I thought that titanium blades and a foil razor would give me a better shave, wrong, wrong, wrong.  Waste of money and a waste of shave time in the morning.</li>
            <li> I bought this on the reccommendation of Consumer Reports.  I was very disappointed.  It is clunky.  It is NOISY.  It is awkward.  It does not even begin to give a close shave.  It was very difficult to clean.  I am returning it and going back to my Braun.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> A bit noisy and bulky, but if you can look past that not a bad shaver.  A good addition to the glove box for last minute shaving.  The head pivots and it rinses in the sink to clean.  The charge holds for about 5-7 decent days of shaving, so take the cord if you&#x27;ll need it longer on trips, etc.  All in all not too shabby.  The shipping was super-fast!!!  Kudos to Amazon for excellent customer service.</li>
            <li> I found this shaver at a great deal. Under $20. I thought I would give a foil shaver a try for a change. This shaver would not cut anything. At first I tried it on my face when hairs were longer. It would not cut them at all. I then thought that it may be better suited for short hairs. Nope, it wouldn&#x27;t cut that either. I returned this and tried another one. Same thing happened. I guess I didn&#x27;t lose too much money but I was really disappointed that I couldn&#x27;t use this thing at all. I am sure not all foil shavers are like this but I am going to stick to the rotary shavers after this experience. The shaver is bulky and loud if that bothers you. It does vibrate a lot. I never tried the trimmer as I was pretty mad about the performance of the shaver. I can&#x27;t speak for battery life because I haven&#x27;t used it that much but it does run on the corded option as well. That&#x27;s really the only plus I would give it.</li>
            <li> This razer has seen regular use since 2010 and it is now May 2015. The blades and foil have never been replaced. After 5 years as a primary shaver it still holds a great charge, the beard trimmer works like a charm, and I have not had any trouble with the three blades or foil. Is it the closest shave ever? No. Will it shave consistently over time and save you hassle on the way to work? Yes. The fact you can shave with it plugged in is an added benefit from experience.</li>
            <li> I have used numerous electric shavers in the past including another model by Remington and this is the worst shaver by far! Not only does this shaver provide a subpar shave, it does so unevenly. It nicked me more than a shave with a razor blade and left my neck red and sore, without shaving away all the wiskers found there. It is not much better on or around ones chin. This shaver&#x27;s head is too large to handle tight areas. It is not much more than a noisy vibrator. My previous shaver, which is three year old, provides a better shave that this brand new Remington. Very disapointing product.</li>
            <li> I replaced a Remington F5790 with the same model.  Very happy with it. I strongly recommend this model and brand.</li>
            <li> I would rate this higher but after 3 weeks the head would not click back in place.  I was finally able to get the head to reattach by running the unit under a fast stream of water.  I am not sure if the problem will reoccur.  Otherwise this has been a good shaver.</li>
            <li> The  electric razor stopped working 6 weeks after I bought it.  Does not cut well then stopped working.  The worst razor I have ever bought.  Do not buy this razor.</li>
            <li> Hate it?  Yes - because the foil should not have a hole worn through it after 5 weeks of use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 star also to Amazon for not allowing a return or exchange for this product, even though it is obviously defective</li>
            <li> The shaves that I have been able to achieve are not at all satisfactory.  Please advise how I can return it.</li>
            <li> Had a previous Remington and was looking forward to the improvements with this one.  Not happy at all.  The foil screen head will not stay snapped on and keeps coming loose during use.  Only had the razor for two months, so this is unacceptable!</li>
            <li> Bought this based on leading consumer magazine review.  Bad review!  My 10 month old worn out rotary blades give me a better shave than this one.  Need to use regular razor every time to get what this misses - and it&#x27;s a lot.  Trimmer is also poor design - stays right next to razor, so you &#x27;shave&#x27; your hair when trimming sideburns.  Going to send it back to Remington.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and I know all about how skin needs time to adjust to an electric razor.  However, after giving this one shot there was no way that I was willing to stay the course.  The results were terrible.  I had to go over the same spot for the razor to actually cut the hair.  Terrible for sensitive skin.  It cut little by little, if you know what I mean.  I&#x27;m sticking with my disposable razors, where I know I can use a fresh blade every time and get exacting close shave without all the extra work, just for electric.</li>
            <li> In this review I compare this Remington razor to the Braun Series 5.  If you were hoping that this review would say this razor is just as good as the much more expensive Braun, you&#x27;ll be disappointed.  It does work pretty well though.  I find it shaves fairly close without irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the comparison razor [[ASIN:B000G1EQ1W Braun Series 5 (8995) Men&#x27;s Shaver]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun does get more hairs with the first swipe and is a little less irritating to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun looks \\&quot;more cool\\&quot;, has more flashy features, and is built with more solid materials. It feels heavier in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remington seems to lose charge over time, even if unused.  Maybe I got a refurbished unit or something.  I can take the Braun on a nearly week long trip without having to charge it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the Remington&#x27;s sideburn trimmer slightly better, though it took me a time or two to get accustomed to it because it&#x27;s a little hard to tell where the blade is going to hit.  This is hard to explain, but the razor body blocks your view a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the Braun clean and renew system though it can get pricey buying all the refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the Braun better. But, if you don&#x27;t want to shell out $100+, the Remington is a good choice.</li>
            <li> Feels a little bulky (not ergonomically design although looks nice) and a little stiff to use.</li>
            <li> Purchased this razor for my father who disliked it so much he gave it to my brother who disliked it so much I now have it to return.  Very loud and did not shave well.</li>
            <li> This was my first foil electric that I ever used/owned.  Up to this point, I&#x27;ve always used non-electric razor&#x27;s and rotary electric shavers, with rotary being the majority of what I&#x27;ve used in the last 5-6 years.  The first time I used it, I was very disappointed.  I was going over spots seemingly 6-7 times and feeling like I was having to push very hard to get it to actually cut anything.  I was rather disappointed, but before I sent it back I decided to have a look at the usage instructions.    The instructions said to use what I typically refer to the sideburn shavers on your face first, then go back over it with the foils.  I noticed an immediate difference.  I don&#x27;t have to push as hard anymore, or go over the same spots again and again.  It has become a pretty convenient shaver.  I read some con&#x27;s about the size of this shaver, but as I have big hands, I find it to be a very comfortable fit for me.  Perhaps not quite as ergonomic as others, but definitely usable and comfortable.    I could chalk my experience up to never using a foil before.  It does take a little longer to shave, and it&#x27;s a little messier than the rotaries, but it gives a nice close shave now that I&#x27;m using it properly, which is all I could really ask for.  If I do decide to buy another foil, I would re-purchase this one.  I am pretty loyal to Remington for that close shave, and this doesn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 54 and have a lot of experience with electric shavers and razor blades. I&#x27;ve used this razor for 9 months and already have torn one of the foils -- which if you&#x27;ve ever done this it hurts when the blades underneath touch your skin. Even before that, it only shaved ok. I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard and I could not get a close shave. I also don&#x27;t like the trimmer. It doesn&#x27;t extend up far enough above the heads of the razor, so I was often jabbing my face with the head cutters while trying to use the trimmer. I had to use the trimmer on my neck and cheeks below my ears because the razor didn&#x27;t shave this area well enough. I&#x27;m about to order a replacement foil, since the razor still has plenty of life in it. And after that I&#x27;ll replace the razor.    On the plus side, it starts up every morning just fine and has good battery life, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy another one.</li>
            <li> This is your average inexpensive cordless shaver, maybe not as cheap as some others out there even though it should be. My boyfriend humored me in trying this model out, even though he was very happy with his [[ASIN:B002N5MHLU Panasonic ES-LA63-S Arc IV Multi Flex Nanotech Rechargeable Shaver]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;~ Low purchase price.&lt;br /&gt;~ Wet or dry use.&lt;br /&gt;~ 3-position pop-up trimmer - This is probably it&#x27;s best feature, which is disappointing as you are buying it for the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;~ Rechargeable battery that does provide a good amount of usable life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;~ Tested both wet and dry, daily over a weeks time. Dry shave was was worse than shaving with a disposable razor and wet shave performed better, but still not as close as he wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I do find more pros than cons, I think the negative definitely outweighs the good in this case.  This shaver now sits in a drawer and hasn&#x27;t been used since the initial use.</li>
            <li> Shaver is great and did a good job, but important parts have failed and made the shaver worthless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the foil head cover failed to stay on, meaning it came off in the drawer. If the foil gets bent, it because useless, so that made me nervous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the foil head itself stopped staying on while shaving. It would pop out of place, banging into my face, and pushing it hard to stay on felt dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally: Remington bean counters must have forced engineers to change to softer plastic to save a few pennies. But soft plastic doesn&#x27;t click into place over and over like hard plastic pieces do. So a razor that gave me good shaves, and should have lasted for a couple of years, is worthless after three months.</li>
            <li> This razor doesn&#x27;t shave well and is too bulky to do an effective job.  Very poor trimmer and difficult to shave longer hairs.</li>
            <li> Perfect for shaving my bald head and edging up my facial hair. Oh, and this thing lasts forever as long as you don&#x27;t drop it on the restroom floor (too often). I&#x27;ve dropped it a few times and all i had to do was buy relpacement head peices from (you guessed it) Amazon.com. Thank you Remmington and Amazon.</li>
            <li> Your description of the product and the instruction booklet furnished with it describe a &amp;#34;pop-up&amp;#34; trimmer, but the shaver I received does not pop up and is hard to use.  Also, I find it difficult to get a close shave with this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver originally for an international trip to avoid any hassles with trying to take disposables or with trying to go on local shopping trips for toiletries. It worked well enough on my face, as some other reviewers said, it took several passes in some areas and left irritation behind (for me it was the bottom of my face just where it curves into my neck... so much irritation there). I, however, also shave my head and let me tell you, this thing works great for that even though it&#x27;s not advertised as such. The shave is close with a single slow pass - the flex and pivot functions really allow this shaver to do a good job up top. Behind the ears is a bit tricky because of the devices bulk but overall I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with the job it does on my head and will likely continue to use it for that even if I use a razor for my face.    I gave it 3 stars because of the mediocre job it did on my face but advertising this as a head shaver would have bumped it up to 4 easily.</li>
            <li> I have used numerous electric shavers over the decades. The last one was a Norelco/Phillips which was a big improvement over the Braun that preceded it. Still, I was not entirely satisfied with it. When the time came to replace the blades I found that replacement blades cost nearly as much as replacing the entire unit.  I decided to replace the shaver. This new Remington F5790 simply does NOT give a good shave, period. Being retired I am not as fastidious about shaving every day. When there is a second day&#x27;s growth, this shaver is simply terrible.</li>
            <li> I had good luck with this razor during the first few months of use, but then it seemed to fall apart due to regular use.  OF COURSE, it had to happen when I was traveling and as a result, I have to do weird things to get the shaver to work at all.  I am hoping that I have kept the receipt because I&#x27;m planning on returning it when I get back home.    You&#x27;d be better off buying something else even if they offer this at a cheap price.</li>
            <li> I fully concur with Rupert&#x27;s review above....head pops off after a few months&#x27; use...seems to be a clear design defect....good shave while it lasted...</li>
            <li> I recently picked one of these up at WalMart as I left my shaver at home on a trip.  The price was much better than the $89 shavers there so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I&#x27;m used to the shavers with the 3 circular blades, so going to one like this was something new.  It is big, it is heavy, and it is loud.  It vibrates a lot - it will give you a workout while you shave.  Shaving in a hotel room while your family sleeps is not even an option, you will wake them up.  I found on my face, it works great - shaves very close, and as other reviews state, it is very quick. I find that due to the size it can be difficult to get into the nooks and crannies easily though (around your nose, up close to your sideburns, etc.).  The problem lies in shaving my neck - I figured with the movable foils, it would conform to my neck and do well - but it hardly cuts the hair at all on my neck.  I can go over it again and again and it simply won&#x27;t cut some hair.  I&#x27;ve tried all positions, all rotations, varying amounts of pressure, etc. and nothing.  Trying to cut hair on the back of my neck is a different story - it won&#x27;t even touch it.  I found it interesting that the reviews here are so varied - some love it, other hate it.  Some say it shaves close, others say it doesn&#x27;t shave close at all.  So be careful buying this - the inconsistency points to some sort of design issue in my opinion - apparently it doesn&#x27;t work with all shapes and sizes of faces or something :)  The popup trimmer is terrible.  It is on the back and slides straight up, so you can&#x27;t really use it.  It is too close to the main body when it pops up - I can&#x27;t trim my sideburns at all with it.  It does charge quickly and the LED charge gauge on the front is really nice.  Based on my experience with this, I would suggest looking for a different shaver.</li>
            <li> Bought the saver as a gift. The person used the shaver a couple of times then it started pulling instead of shaving. Needed to return the product. Would not reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> Easy to order, top quality merchandise Remington does a clean smooth shave and yes I would recommend Amazon but you were recommended to me and I am very satisfied</li>
            <li> After using Braun shavers for most of my life I decided to try something different. I wish I had not. The biggest problem with the Remington is that the foil breaks too often. I have owned this shaver for 18 months, and I am on my fourth foil. Pieces just fall out of the foil and this results in nicked skin. With the Braun shavers I owned previously, I would replace the foil and cutter once every 18 months, just to keep the shave smooth. I never had one break. This Remington is not all bad though. I find it comfortable to hold, and the battery life is good. It was also cheaper than Braun, but this benefit has been negated by the need to replace the foil with such regularity.</li>
            <li> this razor so far has been terrific... i was using a panasonic es 7035 procurve and while i must admit the panasonic is sooo quiet, and the remington is quite loud the f5 takes only a quarter the amount of time to shave my face. ive only had the f5 for 3 days but my wife says that my face feels baby soft which ive never had with the panasonic. for those who are looking for a good razor at a low price this is it. for those thinking about or trying to decide foil over rotary let me just say that i tried all the rotary razors and always found that it took way to long to shave my face... foil razors are the closest thing to a razor shave thats out there... just a fyi i have tried the braun 7 series in which i paid a huge price for and was sooo disappointed with that product it was loud just as loud as the remmington f5 but didnt shave anywhere near as good... and the fact that at kohls i purchased this f5 razor for 28 dollars this product gets 4 stars for me. and  for the newbs to the  electric shaving world remember little to no pressure is better and you have to give your face 2-4 weeks to adjust, get a good no alcohol based aftershave as well it helps soothe and protect from irritation to your skin</li>
            <li> I liked my Remington Titanium MS3 2700 better. It was more comfortable to hold and the trimmer worked better. The pivoting head doesn&#x27;t pivot much, too stiff.</li>
            <li> Second one after I dropped the first one. Would buy another.</li>
            <li> When my Braun died, I looked at the prices of new ones and decided to go back to Remington. I&#x27;d been satisfied with the one I had years ago. However, this made-in-China item is a real turkey. It shaves close enough, but it&#x27;s so noisy, you practically need ear protection to use it, especially the trimmer. It also misses hairs the Braun had no trouble with--ones that don&#x27;t grow straight out. This means you need to frequently use the trimmer, especially on your neck.  I&#x27;m wishing I had spent the extra money on a Braun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver and have been using it daily for well over a year.  Just ordered the first replacement foil and blades.  Gives a good, close shave and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it.</li>
            <li> I been using Braun Electric Shavers for over 20 years until I couldn&#x27;t find an inexpensive replacement. I saw the Remington F5790 for around $50 so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. WOW.  What a close shaver. Much better than the Braun&#x27;s I had.  The flip up trimmer seems a little flimsy so I&#x27;m concerned about it&#x27;s future workings.  The plastic exterior coating used for the shaver housing may not wear well either.  But, these negatives are for future observations so I&#x27;m completely satisfied with this item.  Especially the low cost!</li>
            <li> Replace my old Remington F5790 Pivot &amp; Flex razor with the same thing. I have been happy with this razor and wanted to get the same one. Works well and gives a close shave.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with an electric razor for over 20 years and have to say, for me, this one is the best one I have used.  I always check Consumer Reports for advice--they gave this one a very good rating--the price was reasonable so I bought it.  I love everything about it.  Good advice from Consumer Reports and a great product from Remmington.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I purchased this item and thought it was a great product.  It is sturdy and looked as if it would last a while.  So after a month the screen started popping off.  While my wiskers were growing, my wife said \\&quot;enough is enough\\&quot; and went a bought me a Norelco for an early Father&#x27;s day Present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the mean time, I had decided to take a chance and purchase the replacement screen and cutters and it appears to work.  The replacement appears to be made a bit differently and only works in one direction.  The original didn&#x27;t have a front and back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not used it much since purchasing the replacement screen as I have been using my Father&#x27;s Day present on a regular basis, and keeping the Remington as my back up razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased many Remington&#x27;s over the years and I think now I will stick with the Norelco&#x27;s going forward.  To much to spend to take this kind of chance.</li>
            <li> I have used a myriad of shavers over the past years.  This shaver just does the job as good or better than any other.  Used corded or cordless as a bonus, its great.  It shaves my beard as close as a razor without the mess. I recommend this to any man with a beard.</li>
            <li> While the shaver works OK (but nothing special), the foils don&#x27;t last. I went through 4 foils in less than six months. This is way expensive. I used Braun for years and had nothing like this experience. I am chucking this crap for a braun. I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed with this recent model Remington.  I have used Remington shavers for ever.  My old TA 4570 gives a much better shave.  The good news is that I pursued my quest for a new shaver &amp; ordered the Panasonic ES8243A Arc IV Nano Men&#x27;s Wet/Dry Rechargeable Shaver, Blue  which got very good reviews.  I am very happy with the Panasonic.  It gives a very comfortable &amp; close shave.  I could not get myself to spend at least an additional $100 (over the Panasonic)for a Braun.</li>
            <li> This item was sent without a cord.  It is truly a cordless shaver!  Our old shaver cord works on it; so I decided to keep it since I could not buy one locally.  The shaver is wonderful, one of the best I have ever seen.  Was very disappointed to receive something that was not a complete product.</li>
            <li> I have used Remington electric razors for decades.  This is probably the best designed one yet. I am extremely happy with it.</li>
            <li> A very good shaver. Slight problem learning how to clean and guard. Once those are mastered, it is as good as any electric. Buy it!</li>
            <li> Though my husband likes the shave he gets, the shaver starts breaking down after about 18 months. Being African American, he has the curly hairs that are a challenge when shaving. This shaver works well. It just fails after a while.</li>
            <li> My husband wanted to replace the razor he had with one just like his old one.  We were surprised to find this one was still available.  He loves it!</li>
            <li> Unlike my previous Remington (MS3 2700), this one pivots as well as flexes.  It works very well, although it is bit harder to handle than the MS3 2700.  On the other hand, the F5790 holds its charge twice as long.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old Panasonic ES8068N wet/dry linear shaver was dying, going about 2-3 days between charges.  I was hoping that this would be the perfect replacement for it.  Unfortunately, it wasn&#x27;t, at least for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likes:&lt;br /&gt;- Battery life is good.&lt;br /&gt;- Battery gauge is very easy to read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislikes:&lt;br /&gt;- Didn&#x27;t do any better job in areas I had a problem with when using the Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;- Cleaning was annoying, required brushing, and was never really done.  Much easier on the Panasonic: squirt in liquid soap then run it under water to rinse.&lt;br /&gt;- While it did a decent job on short stubble, say one day growth for me,  anything longer than that and shaving time increased dramatically and the closeness of the shave suffered horribly.  It was as if the foil wasn&#x27;t allowing in any of the longer hair, just going right over it instead.  Using the trimmer helped, some, but that required careful maneuvering to try to minimize the skin irritation from the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried switching over to the Remington but the dislikes kept bothering me.  I routinely skip a day or two on weekends and incompatibility between my facial hair and the shaver was just too annoying.  I found I switched back to the Panasonic, only reverting to the Remington if the batteries were dead on the Panasonic.  Realizing that I was avoiding the Remington, I finally gave in and started seriously looking at the newer Panasonics. I wound up buying the [[ASIN:B002N5MHLK Panasonic ES-LA93-K Vortex Men&#x27;s Shaver]] while looking at another model during a Gold Box sale a month or so ago and have not regretted it.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t keep head on razor after ten use&#x27;s. now I have a worthless shaver don&#x27;t want to go buy a new screen. looks as though head cover was cheaply made, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> i liked my old remington tf 300 better.it gets a  better close shave easyer with less effort. but f5790 is ok</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t going to buy this one due to the low reviews even after returning a couple of other brand of shavers.  However, Remington shavers have always given me the closest shave, about the same as a blade for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The F5 is a good value and gives a great shave so that is better then a 3 star rating to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The F4 I was going to get and honestly would recommend it over this one.  It offers two larger sized foils and the foil/blade replacements are a bit cheaper.  Three skinny, while being no worse, is not any better then two larger sizes foils so why pay more for it?  The F4 looks like the plastic sides though might rub your face and why I resisted buying it.  From just dumb luck I was looking on an auction site and bought a F5 for literally less then the replacement blades are for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price I paid even five stars isn&#x27;t enough.  To be fair and rate it at the actual going price of $45 to $50 I think 4 stars is fair.  I&#x27;ve used it for over a month now.  It really is a good shaver with one major flaw and a couple of useless features.  The battery is not lithium ion so a charging and battery indicators while welcome really are not needed.  Three of four skinny blades only increases the overall cost of ownership but does nothing to improve the shave quality or speed over two larger sized ones.  The pivoting head is the other useless feature as it only is needed to speed up the learning curve in how to hold it in hopes of you not returning it after using it only a couple of times.  You hand and wrist will do a better job, especially with their implementation of it.  It works but you still need to move the shaver around to be right or press too hard at the risk of wearing out the foils sooner then otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with the last Remington shavers I&#x27;ve in the past 25 years, this one the battery can last 2 weeks easy, it is loud, has plenty of power for my thick hairs, and gives a very close shave.  My MS2-250, probably wrong model number, gave the closest shave ever for me but this one is almost as good as that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can not live with a loud shaver, go with a rotary shaver as foil shavers are inherently loud.  Braun has a weaker motor so not as loud but it works to move the tiny sized blades to give a close shave as well, nearly as close as a Remington.  Design wise Braun clearly is a nicer shaver then a Remington too but you will pay for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A number of people normally have issues with the foils.  Remington foils I think are the thinnest.  Therefore they shave the closest but also are the easiest to get a break in the foil.  Their new ones I see they do sell just the foil.  That is a negative but it still is a good value compared to the cost of ownership of a Braun.  They say to replace in 6 months but really that means it should last 12 months for most people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for 4 rather than 5 stars is I think the way the foils are to be removed from the shaver for cleaning is a bad design flaw.  If you rinse out the area well where it clicks I suspect you will not have the issue of many people rating this low have said where the foil simply will not stay in after just a few weeks of use.  While that is a design flaw too the real issue in my mind is you need to have good hand/finger strength to be able to push and pull the thing out of the shaver to clean it.  My father has arthritis and there would be no way he would be able to do it at all!  One or two buttons have always worked well and work much easier too then this design.</li>
            <li> Aside from being noisier than any of my previous rotary razors I was very happy with this Remington F5790.  It gave me a very close shave and the trimmer works fine.  HOWEVER.....I bought a replacement screen assembly and cutter kit which has a slightly different styled plastic screen holder THAT WON&#x27;T STAY SNAPPED ONTO THE SHAVER HEAD!!!!!  This is an official OEM Remington replacement but is defectively designed.  Fortunately I hadn&#x27;t thrown away the old screen assy so I had to remove the screens from the new plastic holder and insert them into the old holder and this seems to have solved the problem.  If it wasn&#x27;t for the bad replacement part experience, I would have given this product 4 stars and if I wasn&#x27;t able to make use of my old screen holder I would have given this only 1 star because of this bad experience.  As it turns out, I&#x27;m back to satisfactory saving because of my ingenuity.  Be aware of buying a replacement cutter and screen assy for this model.</li>
            <li> Do not buy any of the Remington \\&quot;pivot\\&quot; head shavers. I love their regular microscreen shavers. But the pivot A.) do NOT pivot unless you push it with your finger, and B.) have this oversized plastic guard around the screens that makes it extremely hard to get the screens in contact with hair such as under your nose. It is actually painful to get under my nose shaved.    It&#x27;s hard to find a non-pivot razor by Remington because of all of these designed-by-monkeys pivot-that-doesn&#x27;t-pivot razors.    After more than twenty years of using Remington, I&#x27;m probably going to have to switch to Braun.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to replace my old Norelco I&#x27;d had for 20+ years.  Bad mistake!  At first I liked how close it shaved.  Then, I noticed the head guard didn&#x27;t want to snap back.  OK, minor inconvenience.  I then noticed it would leave a hair now and then that refused to be shaved off, and I&#x27;d have to use the pop-up trimmer to get rid of it.  I realized it took nearly twice the time to shave with this beast as I spent with my old shaver.  Finally, the foils wouldn&#x27;t stay snapped down onto the blades after only two months of use.  I had to hold them on with my fingers to get the shaver to shave!  I&#x27;m back to using my 20-year-old Norelco.  Don&#x27;t even think of buying this piece of junk!</li>
            <li> The blades and cover needed replacing after 2 months. I think that is pretty short lived! The shaver does a great job but I am disappointed on how fast the blades and cover need to be replaced.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY!!! Foil head after 1 month wont stay clasped...,my 3rd one...thats ok, I just replace with new one at walmart...suckers</li>
            <li> So far this razor has been giving me very close shaves and I would recommend it.For the price it was a great buy.</li>
            <li> This is an extremely loud electric shaver. Do not buy if concerned about your hearing. I am not kidding. This thing is really loud.</li>
            <li> give a close shave and stays charged for long time...&lt;br /&gt;now for the negative, I have to repeatedly go over and over my neck area, for some reason the shaver has trouble in that area??&lt;br /&gt;If I let my beard go for 2 or 3 days, the shaver is less effective on longer hair???</li>
            <li> I was tired of the time and mess of blade shaving for 50 years.  Picked this &amp;#34;best buy&amp;#34; per Consumer Reports.  Less mess than the blade; about the same amount of time; but the shave is not as close.</li>
            <li> Had a prior Remington that was satisfactory, but not great. This is a  big improvement - shaves faster and closer.&lt;br /&gt; This model was rated a &amp;#34;best buy&amp;#34; by Consumers Union and I tend to agree. The disc cutters on the old model were loosely anchored and frequently detached The cutters on the new model appear to be better and more firmly seated.&lt;br /&gt;Also the flexible head allows for more efficient shaving than the old model performed.  .</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver while on vacation when I had left my Norelco at home.  I figured a well know brand name like Remington would insure at least a fairly good product.  I was wrong.  This shaver does not provide a close shave, in fact it leaves many medium long hairs uncut.  Even if I attempt to go over the same area a dozen times at all angles and directions it refuses to cut maybe 5% of the hair (bristles) on my face.  If you skip shaving a day or two, then it is worse.  Neck areas are the worst, probably only cuts 70% of the hair on my neck.  This shaver will go into the trash.  Sorry to be so negative , but I would want to be fairly warned about this poor product if I was in the market for a new electric shaver.</li>
            <li> My last shaver was a rotary shaver that works really will. This shaver is a totally different technology and it works terrible if your hair is to long. Here a very simple example... If I shave everyday, this shaver will work fine. However, sometimes I get lazy and don&#x27;t shave for a few days. That is when the problem occurs when my hair is too long. I think my hair doesn&#x27;t go inside the top part of it correctly if it&#x27;s too long. However, my rotary shaver that I still use always is easy to shave even if I didn&#x27;t shave for a whole week. As I stated in my title, I&#x27;m not sure if this shaver is made poor or if it&#x27;s just the technology that is inferior to rotary shavers. Beside that that, the unit looks very nicely made, and the battery life is awesome. Also, if shave every single day, then this shaver will work perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the 5 star customer service.  If you had problems like me, call Remington toll free number, explain to them the problem you have, and they will do anything to help you.  They will even exchange your shaver for a rotary one for free.  That is awesome customer service!!!</li>
            <li> Works great for the price.  Better than ones I have had for twice the price.  Easy to clean after use.</li>
            <li> This unit is loud and does not do a great job shaving.  Consider a different unit before buying this one.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t shave well. The 4 head Remington did a much better job. I use to get a good  shave in about 5 minutes now it takes at least 10 minutes to do a poor job</li>
            <li> I have never written a review before now, but this product is the worst I&#x27;ve ever seen. As I write this review my face is raw and bleeding from using this razor. In less than a year I have had to replace the foil cover because of holes in the foil which tears your face apart. You can only order the foil kit which includes extra blades, which you certainly don&#x27;t need since you have only had the razor a short while, and the kit cost almost as much as the razor. The sad thing is even when you have new foil cover , the razor does a lack luster job which always requires you to touch up with regular razor. This razor is barely a year old and i think i am going to throw it in the trash as soon as i finish this review!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have had this razor for months. I keep going back to give it another chance, and I am always disappointed. I move it over my face, but it seems to have no effect on my whiskers.  Maybe they are too thick to fit through the screen.  Who knows?  All I know is that I wasted my money. I bought this because a consumer mag gave it a good rating. I usually buy what they recommend, but this time they let me down. It works for some people, but not for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this review as I received this shaver as a gift and tried it for just over 2 weeks before I gave up on it. I think Remington is on to something with this shaver but I think they need much work as it has many design flaws.  First the good; It actually shaves pretty close. Definitely not as close as my Braun 790cc-4 but much closer than a typical rotary. The price of this shaver essentially makes throwing the shaver away after a year and buying a new one feasible financially.  Now the bad, where to start... First, this thing is by far louder than any other shaver I&#x27;ve ever used. I even managed to wake my 5-year old son up, who&#x27;s two rooms down the hall, on a few occasions when I shaved early in the morning. The motor sound&#x27;s tone isn&#x27;t pleasant either so it became annoying to use pretty quickly. Second, I compared the shaver&#x27;s build quality to my Braun Series 7 and wow, what a difference. Its light, cheap feeling plastic has give and creaks under pressure, also the foils are held in place by the flimsiest and tiniest of plastic tabs that I can certainly see this failing in a few months and no longer holding the foils in position. But the worst design decision has to be the level at which the foils surface meets the side chrome plastic trim (chrome coloured plastic) where during normal shaving that same plastic makes full contact with the skin creating quite the friction and discomfort. I&#x27;m still quite shocked that this somehow passed the design checks and QA at Remington. Also, the general shape and ergonomics of the handle itself are just off. It&#x27;s a wide rectangular-shaped handle that felt neither comfortable nor secure in the hand.  Finally, one thing I noticed about the Remington was that the whole head is supposed to pivot to follow the contours of the face but in practice it never did as it was very stiff and felt as if it was semi-locked in one position. The Braun in comparison freely and smoothly pivots to maintain a 90 degree angle to the skin anddoes so to perfection.  I know I am being harsh and critical of the Remington but it was mainly because I had the Braun 790cc-4 at the same time and I couldn&#x27;t help comparing the two, but in hindsight had I not had the Braun next to it to compare I may not have picked up on all those differences which collectively pushed the Remington significantly lower on the electric shaver hierarchy. Having said that, it&#x27;s really not a fair comparison at all. One shaver is made in China and costs as much as an expensive meal while the other is made in Germany and costs more than four times as much. So keep that in mind when deciding on which shaver to choose.  I guess what I&#x27;m trying to say is that if you&#x27;re on a very tight budget and don&#x27;t mind the negatives, you can get a somewhat decent shave from this. But for anyone who actually enjoys shaving or wants to enjoy shaving and where shave closeness and comfort are more important than cost, then do yourself a favour and skip this shaver. I&#x27;m being generous here in giving it two stars, one for price and one for the somewhat reasonable shave closeness from a budget shaver.</li>
            <li> use it for few weeks to get used to it, i would buy another if needed ,, definetly worth the price,very satisfied</li>
            <li> This shaver provides a close shave within a short time  It is easy to use and easy to clean. I have been using electric shavers for over 50 years, and this is one of the best if not the best I have ever had.</li>
            <li> Great value, fits well</li>
            <li> I have used Remington shavers for years.  I like them.  This one is rechargeable, and can be washed under the faucet.  I usually get quite a few years out of Remington shavers before the battery goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A big improvement of this shaver over previous models.  When the time comes to replace the blades, the old models required that I install each of the three blades individually -- not a tremendously difficult task, but one that requires careful attention and hand-eye coordination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the replacement kit for this model has the three blades mounted in a bracket.  Just pull the old one out and put the new one in.  Perfect!</li>
            <li> Husband says it does not shave well at all. He says cheapy razors he&#x27;s owned in past were superior and one third the price.</li>
            <li> I am on the second shaver of this model - it does a fine job. I get a clean shave and the shaver is easy to keep clean. No problems.</li>
            <li> First, I want to mention that the F5790 was a Remington replacement for a MS2-390 shaver with defective battery.  No questions asked; I sent them the MS2-390 and they sent me the F5790.  That says something for Remington&#x27;s warranty credibility.  I&#x27;ve used the F5790 for about six months and have never had a better shaver than this one.  It gives me a consistently close, smooth shave on both my head and face.  Yes, it is a bit large, but it doesn&#x27;t take long to get used to the size and shape as the pivoting head requires less twisting and turning to maintain contact with the shaving area.  My only criticism is that the screen head is more difficult than it should be to remove for cleaning.  I haven&#x27;t had to change blades/screens yet so I can&#x27;t comment on that process, but I&#x27;m assuming that it&#x27;s not much different from other shavers I&#x27;ve had.  The bottom line for me is that the F5790 gives me an excellent shave, and I know that when it comes time to replace it I won&#x27;t hesitate to get another one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been reading some of the many one star reviews and I don&#x27;t get it.  Of course no one razor works for everyone, but I&#x27;ve owned and been quite happy with this one for over three years.  I&#x27;ve never had to change the blades or foil and both are still in very good condition.  If you let your facial hair grow for a few days, it will have trouble grabbing the longer hairs, but so does every other razor I&#x27;ve used.  It&#x27;s easy to clean and just keeps running and running.  One minor problem was that one of the blades occasionally pops off when you remove the foil, but it&#x27;s easily reseated.  No real negatives.</li>
            <li> Does the job close shave</li>
            <li> This shaver is an exceptional value which performs very well and is very durable.  I would buy this product again without hesitation.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this razor.  2nd. one I have owned.  The price and quality are unbeatable.  Would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> does do a decent shave...quickly and without water...just what hubby needed! Have gone online and ordered an extra foil to have on hand. Holds charge well.</li>
            <li> its good holds charge long time the trimmer is excellent dont forget electrc shave lolol easy to take apart and clean</li>
            <li> Like a foil shaver.  The liight indicators showing how much charge is left is great.  The trim feature is great and does not reduce power.  It&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Much slower than a razor and shave cream, and doesn&#x27;t actually cut hair.  This is like a toy you give your 3-year old son: it looks like an electric shaver, it makes a buzzing sound, but it doesn&#x27;t actually do anything.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s satisfactory but not great.  I like the charge remaining feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remington makes better shavers for not much more money.</li>
            <li> Not as good as past Norelco products. The blades rotate much slower than what I expected. I have reverted back to the older products.</li>
            <li> Disappointed with the quality of shave.  I had an older version with only two foils that did a much better job.  I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard, so kind of bummed.</li>
            <li> I like the design and the way it curve. I feel that the pivot head does not made good contact on the face. You have to use the razor everyday to get a close shaver. The trimmer is a waste because of were it is located. It scrape my face and does not cut the short length hair. And it I apply too much pressure, the trimmer pop back in.</li>
            <li> It gives the closest shave next to a Straight razor. 100 percent better than my husband&#x27;s previous razor! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Easy to use anywhere I go, it is an easy to cary and clean this product after used them. Thanks</li>
            <li> Best electric shaver I have ever used, and I have had many since I started shaving 30+ years ago.  We&#x27;ll worth it for the cost.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s great.  At first I was skeptical because I had never used an electric razor like this before and I thought the instructions were not clear.  Fortunately I found a web site that had a video on how to use it and clean it.  So that gave me the confidence to buy it and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> The Remington F5790 was rated by Consumer Reports magazine as a &#x27;best buy&#x27;. It has three major advantages. One, it may be used corded or cordless. Two, it may be used wet - and both the cutters and foil can be rinsed under the sink to clean. Three, it is quite powerful, even with the pop-up trimmer fully extended, and it holds enough of a charge for a week&#x27;s worth of shaves, without any noticeable loss of power and/or quality of shaves. The only possible drawback, and I am being overly critical here, is that the unit is naturally going to be little more top-heavy compared to the (less-expensive) Remington double-headed models. If you use the pop-up trimmer to shave the back of your neck, it could conceivably be a just tad more difficult to get the correct angle compared with the double-headers, which (quite understandably) have less mass at the business end. However, if you do not ordinarily use a facial shaver to trim the back of your neck this is a moot point. Moot.</li>
            <li> Not quite as good as the Remington Titanium 3 headed shaver. The moveable head is an advantage but makes cleaning somewhat more difficult</li>
            <li> pleasantly surprised by the shave that I received!  I shave my head also and this razor works perfectly.  A Great value for the money!</li>
            <li> USED THIS PRODUCTFOR YEARS! THE CLOSEST ELECTRIC SHAVE YOU COULD EVER HAVE!!&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!! VERY DURABLE.AND LIGHT WEIGHT.&lt;br /&gt;great razor.!</li>
            <li> This is the third Remington I&#x27;ve had over the last 20+ years - the other two just plain wore out.  It has a comfortable solid feel and very close shave.  I&#x27;ve never had razor burn from it, and the one time I did get a scratch from it was bacuse it was overdue for a new foil (the razor was a year old).</li>
            <li> It was what I had expected.  I have owned several Remington razors in the past and liked them better than other brands I have used.  My Gillette Mach 3 gives a better shave, but I like the convenience of an electric razor.</li>
            <li> Husband likes the razor a lot and  has no problems with it to date.  Had a Remington in the past and wanted a new one.</li>
            <li> This is my second razor so you know I like it. I keep one in each bathroom now. Would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This has to be one of the largest electric razors I have ever purchased.  Possibly the largest I have ever seen, including all the electric razors (about 20 ) that we threw out after my grandfather passed away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has 3 foils ,which is the main reason I wanted it.  I&#x27;ve had other remingtons with 3 foils and good results.  2 foils-just don&#x27;t cut it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tossed a $200 braun (2 foil) that was self cleaning and lots of bells and whistles but couldn&#x27;t give me a clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor gives me a clean shave mostly.  Its so big, that above my chin and below my lower lip, its tricky to get in the curve and cut close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is fast.  Probably the fastest razor I&#x27;ve ever owned when it comes to shaving (yes it has a quick charge as well,b ut I don&#x27;t care much about that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is rinseable, but that seems to be less effective than just cleaning the cut beard with the included brush - or better yet a can of air or if you are going for the Home Improvement over kill award, maybe an air compressor with a basketball needle.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to travel with this, be warned that you might be charged for an extra bag (to hold the razor) but at least when you shave in your hotel it will only take you a minute or two to get the job done and be on your way.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty heavy beard. I have never found an electric razor that does as well as a blade. The Remington F5790 is no different. I had to go over an area several times to get through my stubble and it still fell short. It worked best when I shaved everyday after a shower. If I waited a day in between it struggled. I also got a few nicks when going over an area too often. Not liking nicks is the reason I try electric razors. On the positive side, I like the size. It felt substantial. It also holds a charge for quite a while. The trimmer works nicely for my sideburns. I will use it for a travel razor but not for everyday.</li>
            <li> Pro:   Clean shave, battery lasts long, easy to clean, powerful, low price.    Con:  Build quality a bit off (cheap price?), adapter not build-in, kind of bulky to bring for travel (but may not need it because the battery pretty long, over 3 weeks if used daily.)    It works well, but sometimes it pulls, so it hurts afterwards.    Design is not really good because it seem to be able to break easily. (the swivel head seems pretty weak.)    Budget recommendation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned many Remington shavers throughout the years. This one is by far the worst when it comes to the life of the foil. A good two months after getting it, I had to buy new foils because one of them was already a goner. It goes without saying I was mad as hell since I had to shell out $40.00 for the part. I decided to write to the company, and instead of telling me what the problem was with the shaver, they just sent me a free replacement kit (foil + cutters). I do not think that solves the problem since now I know I will have to get new foils every two months or so. Guess I will buy a Braun shaver instead. Bummer!</li>
            <li> Good shaver for my head.  I use it everyday. I will be a Remington customer forever and ever and ever.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good enough when I don&#x27;t have time to shave with a blade, but doesn&#x27;t shave as close. Will use when traveling in 3rd world nations [I won&#x27;t need water to shave] which I do often. It holds a charge well so far. I only use it once or twice a month after the first 2 weeks of testing and I&#x27;ve only charged it once. It&#x27;s been about 4 months since purchasing it.</li>
            <li> The foil developed a hole after one month, the company would not send me a new foil.  Well, thatâ€™s good to knowâ€”now I know why I havenâ€™t before bought a Remington product, nor will I again.  Thereâ€™s a good reason I have only used Norelco and Braun up to this point, and will go back to only using those brand of razors.  I have never had a foil on either of those brands goâ€”everâ€”though I usually replace them once a year, just as a maintenance move.  This product is clearly inferior and I just hope I can get something for the piece of junk on Ebay.</li>
            <li> For a brand new sharp razor it doesnt cut very well. It takes me about 15-20 minutes to shave all my stubble. I remember the old fashioned 6MF1 shavers which I wish I could buy now.</li>
            <li> Bought it to replace my old one that lasted several years. Never had serious issues other than having one of the tips that hold the blade on fail. Just grew to be a pain keeping track of the little spring. Always delivered a good shave and has decent battery life. Noise level hasn&#x27;t been an issue as mentioned in some other reviews. Like the new charging stand.</li>
            <li> My 8 year old Remington triple foil shaved much better. There has to be a better triple foil out there.</li>
            <li> Not a good product, does not shave your face very well, blades not sharp or just designed poorly. Cost too much. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I kept wavering between 2 stars and 3 stars on this review, and finally settled on 3 to give Remington the benefit of doubt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My reason? My beard is pretty tough and wiry, and it might be too much to ask an electric shaver to give me a shave that is TRULY comparable to a top-of-the-line name-brand multi-bladed razor. (I use the 5-blade Gillette Fusion)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for this Remington electric, it&#x27;s \\&quot;okay.\\&quot; Good, but certainly not great. The first thing that I noticed, is that it was fairly light compared to a couple of other electrics I&#x27;ve purchased over the years. I&#x27;m not sure if this is a good thing or a bad thing, but the first thing that went through my mind when I pulled it from the packaging was \\&quot;cheap!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After letting it charge for a day, I gave it a shot, and it did a decent job on my face --but my neck was a different story. I don&#x27;t know what it is about electric shavers and neck hairs, but they ALL seem to ignore approximately 1/2 the hairs that I have there. It&#x27;s very strange, and I always have to go back over my neck with a real blade after I&#x27;m done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pivoting action is &#x27;so-so.&#x27; It seems as if it tends to bind up a little bit, which might have something to do with the light-weight, &#x27;plasticky&#x27; nature of the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having never had a \\&quot;light\\&quot; beard, I can&#x27;t say for certain, but I would imagine that it would probably do a much better job than it did on mine. If that&#x27;s your situation --give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But &#x27;tough-beard&#x27; guys like me... stick with sharp metal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m relegating this shaver to my desk drawer at work, should I ever find myself in need of a quick &#x27;touch-up.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Jonathan Sabin</li>
            <li> I have ordered several items from amazon and this was a good,fast service recieved item.However,I have e-mailed amazon 3 times to explain my dilema about one of my orders and no one cares to listen,.I have ordered the diet drug Alli from amazon for around 2-3 years.This last batch I recieved was the counterfeit batch that has hit the market.I did toss it out since they do not want to listen or do anything.This will make me think twice befroe ordering from them again.Go the health site and there is the diffenece between regular alli and the counterfeit.   But no one seems to care</li>
            <li> This razor is pretty good and can come in handy.  While it does a decent job - like most other electric razors, it still never gets me as clean as I would like.  Still, if I&#x27;m in a real hurry, I&#x27;ll use it and it&#x27;s fine.  Not good enough to pull me away from a plain, old blade for long-term use however.</li>
            <li> FROM ERIC THE SHAVER  IS JUST FINE EXLALENT  ITEM I RECAMENDID THIS ITEM TO AMAZON CUSTOMERS THANKS FROM ERIC JOHNSON 6/26/2014</li>
            <li> Bought ths for my elderly father. He got terrible facial skin burn from it.</li>
            <li> My son asked for this as a Christmas present, when he decided (alas!) to shave off his beard to please his new girlfriend!</li>
            <li> this product works good pros battery charge very quickly cons noisy but would recommend.</li>
            <li> Works well, I think it only took one or two days to get here.  I would have liked a better fitting blade cover, but works great.</li>
            <li> THATS FOR MY HUSBAND , AND HE USUALLY LIKES THIS BRAND FOR LONG TIME AGO&lt;br /&gt;EXCELLENT</li>
            <li> F&lt;br /&gt;from the very first day, it didn&#x27;t give me a close shave. Whenever I go out to a public function, I have to use a blade and shaving cream instead.</li>
            <li> I bought, charged and shaved once. Had no problem with the shave but the noice is terrible. I have always used Norelco and only bought this because I thought it had a lot to offer for the price. I have returned and replaced with another Norelco. Much quieter.</li>
            <li> My husband sometimes shaves every few days.  He says that this shaver would not cut certain whiskers on his face even though he passed over the same area, 5, 10 and even 15 times!  Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> Purchased this razor for my Grandfather. I&#x27;ve checked up with him several time now and he is very, very happy with the razor.</li>
            <li> It works good but is extremely loud. Makes me wonder if it is defective. I will probably not purchase another one.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor in 2007 from a marshalls for $25 and it has gone WAY above my expectations it has worked great. I finally have to replace the foils for the first time and thats mostly because I dropped it and they had gotten thin from being used 3-5 times a week for just over 5 years they say to change them every 6 months not the case for myself I just made sure to keep it clean and throw a bit of oil in it every so often. You do need to use the trimmer on the side to get the long hairs which doesnt take much effort and then use the shaver itself. Your not going to get as close of a shave on your neck as compared to using a traditional razor but for me thats fine because I get ingrown hairs on my neck if I do. All in all I would recommend this razor you just have to find the way to shave that works for you. I hate the 3 round spinning head ones I have yet to try one that even comes close to this one. Oh yeah it still hold a great charge!!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money - Rated good by consumer reports but it is really a POS</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this shaver.</li>
            <li> I have used this shaver for nearly a year.  I find it to performed as advertised and as rated in Consumer Reports.  It replaced another older model Remington.</li>
            <li> Bought one of these shaver 3 months ago and the foil head ALREADY has a hole in in.  The replacement foil heads are $26.99 on Remington web site [...]    I would not recommend this product unless you want to have a lot of money invested in shaving your face.     As far as the shave it gives; it does fairly good. I just simply can&#x27;t afford to keep buying replacement foil and head every 3 months.</li>
            <li> I had a Remington MS3-1000, very basic but I loved it. The F5790 has more features but takes a bit of time getting used to how it shaves. The Pivot is kind of a gimmick, a fixed Foil shaver can be positioned manually on your face, which is what you do anyways with this model. The shaver is much larger in size as well which makes it more difficult to maneuver above the mouth and around the ears. The pivot is also bulky and ends up touching the skin, my old shaver foil had no pivot body around the foil so the only thing that touch the skin was the 3 foils, which made it much easier to maneuver. I love the power meter and the F5790 lasts about 2 weeks before it needs a recharge. You can also shave with the cord connected in case it it all out of juice. The trimmer is much better on the F5790 than on my old Remington. For the money you can&#x27;t go wrong, I love the 3 Foil system the most out of all the shavers out there.</li>
            <li> Excellent shave.  Very close. Did not leave a rash. Would of given 5 stars except it is very difficult to remove the cutter assembly for daily cleaning.  I have always used a Remington shaver and this is the most difficult model to clean.</li>
            <li> I needed a replacement for my Remington MS3 1700 electric razor and purchased the F5790.  I believe the F5790 provides a better shave than my previous razor but I find the shape of the new one to be less ergonomic.  The 1700 has a very good feel in the hand with good balance, shape and size.  The F5790 is longer, bulkier and without the balance of the 1700.  In an age when everything seems to be getting smaller, this razor got bigger.  What were they thinking?  Oh well.</li>
            <li> Great shaver, long lasting, easy to clean</li>
            <li> My husband was very unhappy with this razor. It not only doesn&#x27;t give him a smooth shave, it takes numerous passes over each area and actually misses hairs! It takes him 3 x longer to shave with this razor, than his old one.My husband does not have a heavy, or thick beard.</li>
            <li> I love the shaver but the condition it arrived in was deplorable. The package was ripped completely and held together with duct tape. The shaver head guard and  cleaning brush were missing. Normally a new shaver is supposed to be charged for  24 hrs before initial use, This shaver arrived fully charged indicating that it had been used.. I should have returned the shaver but because of the cost and time involved to do so, and because I needed it I decided to keep it..I am more than satisfied with the performance of the shaver. It is just that I must be very careful in protecting the head.&lt;br /&gt;  Thank You</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for about 2 years now and I can&#x27;t wait to buy a different one.  Pro  The battery life is great. Remington did well here.  Cons  This razor is incredibly loud. Compared to a Norelco, this thing is obnoxious.  Never cuts close.  Trimmer attachment works but adds to the noise and is awkward.</li>
            <li> I amazing. I love it.</li>
            <li> VERY noisy, does not work on my face.</li>
            <li> I got this for my dad to replace his old Remington MS2 370. He has used it for a few months now and does not like it as much. Says it doesn&#x27;t shave as close. SO, I have purchased replacement Ni-MH batteries for the old razor. Now I get to solder them in place!!!</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this model from Remington. However, this one appears to run at a slightly slower speed. Which for me isn&#x27;t impressive. I have a thick/rough beard and really likes the sped of the first razor. All-in-all it&#x27;s a good quality unit.</li>
            <li> GET IT WHILE STILL AVAILABLE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will preface to say, I&#x27;m not \\&quot;Deborah\\&quot;, but her husband. I realize that the vast majority of postings for any product review tends to be negative: because you have a bad experience and you want to shout it from the mountain tops - you feel that you&#x27;ve been screwed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this is the first time that I have felt so positive about a product, that I felt obligated to voice my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been a Remington shaver customer/user since the mid-70&#x27;s.  The old, original Remington: the \\&quot;old brick\\&quot;, was one of the best electric shavers I&#x27;ve ever used.  Over the nearly 40 years, I&#x27;ve had four different Remington&#x27;s, one being a great triple-cutter (MS3-2700 - some 15 years ago) and 3 two-cutters, the last being a MS2-390.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, I&#x27;ve also purchased and tried for a month or more - and ultimately disposed of, a Norelco and a Panasonic.  I feel that I gave them fair trials. They did a lousy job, took forever, and didn&#x27;t cut very close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel that the negative reviews for the Remington F5790 are attributed more to inexperience and new users of electric razors.  It takes a while to get your beard accustom to electric razors, and your face needs to be clean, dry and use a talcum product such as the Remington Powder Stick, which I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT - my initial week of use of the Remington F5790: it has been the closest and fastest shave that I&#x27;ve ever had with any electric razor, including previous Remington&#x27;s; and faster than using a Gillette Mach-5 and shave cream.  I&#x27;d almost say, it&#x27;s almost as close as a shave with the Mach-5.  The F5790 is well balanced and has a comfortable grip.  The first time I used the F5790, I was amazed with the first path I ran across my cheek.  It was a day and a-half growth (I have fairly heavy growth).  I would have sworn that I just ran the Mach-5 up my cheek.  The shave was so close and fast, there was absolutely no razor burn/irritation (normal for new users or improper use of electric razors).  Even my old/last Remington MS2-390 (discontinued, $70, 2-cutter), would give me razor burn/irritation several times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: the only \\&quot;cons\\&quot; would be the screen protector is not marked for \\&quot;front/back\\&quot; and takes several tries to get snapped back in place (I know will be easier as I get accustom to it); and removing the screen head to clean the cutters is not the easiest experience.  AND - Remington!  You need to provide a travel pouch!  Thankfully, this unit fits in the old zipper pouch that came with my last MS2-390.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot attest to the durability of the product, but for the price of $43 (regular $55) and the fact that I believe that the F5790 is no longer being manufactured, I am purchasing a second F5790 to keep for when this one wears out and/or for traveling.</li>
            <li> The Shaver isgreat but the head Cover doesn&#x27;t seem to work well.</li>
            <li> This shaver - I have tried for months to like this shaver, but I cannot.  It requires the pop-up trimmer for anything longer than 1/16 of an inch, multiple times over most spots to cleanly shave, face pulling and awkward movement to shave beneath my chin.  I thought - maybe its me, maybe I need to train my face for this to work - but it isn&#x27;t me.  This thing just doesn&#x27;t shave well.  The net result is that I&#x27;ve decided to grow a beard.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this shaver, it is smooth shaving with very little effort.I would recommend this shaver. It is good value for the money..,thanks Frank Davis</li>
            <li> super shave job none better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Remington shavers for years, and when the last one wore out after 12 years of service, I thought I&#x27;d be brand loyal and go with Remington again.  I went to Target and blithely pick the F5790 off the rack and used it for about 4 months.  Then the foil holder would not stay seated.  I cleaned it out under the tap, and it stayed for a couple of days, then it just keeps popping up away from the blades.  And yes, it is loud.  I am a very unhappy customer!</li>
            <li> NOT item pictured!!  Had to return.</li>
            <li> best shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned</li>
            <li> I am very unhappy about this product.  I would like a refund.  The only reason  I purchased this razor was because replacement cutters for my old Remington were no longer available.  When I get done shaving, it hardly seems like I have shaved, the whiskers are so long.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver as my old one the Remington MS2 200 which gave me many years of great shaves needed to be replaced. They advertise this new one as having a third cutter, this is true but the 3 cutters are much smaller and a little shorter than the 2 cutters in my old one. It takes me longer to shave as I must keep going over and over the same areas. It works but I&#x27;ll be replacing it fairly soon I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> IT IS OK BUT COULD DO  BETTER GETTING A CLOSER SHAVE</li>
            <li> This is one of the best electric razors I have used. I have had avout 6 differn electric razors in the last 35 yrs. and this one is one of the best. Way better than most. If I ever need a new one I will get anothe one like this.</li>
            <li> works great, especially for the price.  Almost as well as the $200.00  razor I had before I bought this one.</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst shaver I have ever owned.  The first two shaves were OK.  After that it did an incredibly poor job.  Thank God for the trimmer, at least I had a way to get all the hairs on the front of my neck and face.  Needless to say the shaver never gave a close shave and stubble showed up soon after shaving.  After 6 months of trying to get this to work, I am DONE!</li>
            <li> Not quite as good as an older brand of Remington that I used for many years.  But, it is doing the job and I think that I will adjust to it more as I use it.  Thanks</li>
            <li> It did not do a good job cutting the longer hairs on my neck. Moreover, it took considerable effort cutting the hair on my cheeks. However, I must admit that it was easy to clean.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE WORST SHAVER EVER. IT DOES NOT SHAVE IF THE BEARD IS OVER 12 HOURS OLD. YOU MUST PRE-SHAVE WITH THE TRIMMER BEFORE A SHAVE.&lt;br /&gt;THE HEAD KEEPS FALLING OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SHAVE. I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND ANOTHER REMINGTON SHAVE AND I HAVE HAD SEVERAL PREVIOUSLY. THEY TOOK THE BEST PART OF THE SHAVING HEAD OFF AND REPLACED IT WITH A PIECE OF JUNK SOME IDIOT ENGINEER DESIGNED.. TOO BAD&lt;br /&gt;STAY AWAY FROM REMINGTON...</li>
            <li> shaves so-so. I&#x27;ll stick with my 25 year old Norelco.</li>
            <li> does not give a close shave as expected. I&#x27;ve always had remington shavers and  I&#x27;M NOT THRILLED WITH THIS SHAVER.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because I have used it many times in the past and have always been pleased with it.  My order reached me on the day that it was promised, it was well packed  and I am pleased with the product so I gave it a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> I have always used rotary razors for years.  Read on various websites and reviews that foil shavers were better for those that shaved on a daily basis such as myself.  After 3 months of use,  I beg to differ.  My foil shaver does NOT shave closer than my previous rotary-type razors. In fact, it leaves hairs behind that I have to go back and use my smaller trimmer to remove.  Very disappointed in the performance.</li>
            <li> Razor arrived with missing parts from the factory. Quality control at end of the line is nonexistent!!  Would not try to repurchase.</li>
            <li> This product was utterly ineffective. Save yourself the trouble of having to send it back. This is the first review I have ever written. I thought it necessary given how useless this product was.</li>
            <li> Bought this shaver a year ago and am extremely disappointed with it&#x27;s performance as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-foil tears easily.  Had to replace foils twice in 1 year.&lt;br /&gt;-shaves very poorly around neck area.&lt;br /&gt;-precision trimmer (built in) poorly designed.  Angle makes it difficult to remove stray hairs that the foils can&#x27;t trim.&lt;br /&gt;-one blade comes loose all the time&lt;br /&gt;-blades don&#x27;t sit straight when replaced.</li>
            <li> This is not a new unit. Refurbished or something. The battery does not last as long as the older one I own. Shaves well.</li>
            <li> My husband was very happy with the product even though took of a bit longer to arrive.  This is his favorite shaver</li>
            <li> It is the best shaver that I got, perfect and wonderful result, I like it and it is easy to carry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Remington shavers for many years and this one is the best I&#x27;ve used.  The real plus is the long battery life ..... I can go weeks without having to recharge which is really nice for trips since I don&#x27;t have to take the charger.  It is easy to change the blades and the screen and the motor/battery has worked flawlessly for me for more than four years so far.</li>
            <li> The 5790 holds a strong charge for 60+ shaving minutes and does a good job shaving.  The downside is that every 3 - 6 months you can expect jagged holes to appear in the foils which cut your face. Finding foils is next to impossible and when you do expect to pay more than $20. That is not good. They should last longer......</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different brands of electric shaver over the years. The last time I needed to buy one, I chose the Remington F5790. At first, it seemed pretty good and I expected to enjoy a good shaver for some time. But since then, I&#x27;ve had more and more trouble with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The so-called shave time of 4 minutes is a sham. I can&#x27;t get a fairly smooth shave in less than 10 minutes, and it requires constant and repeated passes over the same skin area to achieve anything close to a smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The swiveling head is a joke. I gave up using that feature near the start, and just keep it locked into position. The head is so unbalanced that to make it swivel and align to the skin as claimed takes excessive force against the skin to make it swivel. The weight distribution of the head and the pivot point are so completely wrong that the head simply doesn&#x27;t swivel against gravity without a lot of pressure. Did someone actually try this feature out? Was an engineer actually involved in its design?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clear plastic protective cover quit attaching months ago. I now have to be very careful when storing the shaver to be sure I don&#x27;t damage the expensive foils. The little plastic nubs designed to snap it into place are an engineering marvel of stupidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foil assembly does not stay in place. And these foils and heads are supposed to last a year? I had to return one brand new foil as defective when it wouldn&#x27;t snap into place at all. More than one foil assembly seating design has become worn within a couple of months to the point that it just lifts up off the shaver as soon as the power is turned on. Again, the little plastic nubs that are meant to hold the foil assembly firmly in place should embarrass any engineer worth his salt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging cord quickly became so  loose that it wouldn&#x27;t stay connected to the shaver unless you set it down and don&#x27;t move it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m ready to write off Remington as a source for any shaver of mine in the future based on this piece of junk. I expect a shaver to be designed well when it comes from an American business. They certainly haven&#x27;t lived up to the traditional Made in America reputation!</li>
            <li> I am not usually a negative person, but I got this shaver for Christmas, and was pretty let down with how poorly it performed. It just doesn&#x27;t seem to do a thing. Now matter how many times you go across the same section on your face, you&#x27;ll still find plenty of hairs left, completely uncut. I have used Remington products before and liked them very much. This one however is a complete dud. Save yourself the money and hassle and buy a different shaver.</li>
            <li> This shaver has the features and options I was looking for. The shave and the trimmer performs extremely well and the cord/cordless feature covers me if I forget to charge it.</li>
            <li> This piece of tonsorial trash is enough to send me back to lather and disposables. \\&quot;We\\&quot; can land a scientific laboratory on Mars, send specific driving directions spoken and illustrated simultaneously to tens of thousands of cars, and recapture the genome of 60,000 year-old Neanderthal fossils! Why can&#x27;t we manufacture a decent electric razor? Where&#x27;s the \\&quot;better mousetrap\\&quot; that Capitalism is supposed to produce?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor serves only to rub my whiskers off, and that only in spots. I have to finish the job with a disposable. The single good thing I can say about it is that the battery charge lasts as much as six weeks. I can&#x27;t even speculate on its durability since I&#x27;m planning to throw it away as soon as I select a replacement.</li>
            <li> I have used Remington shavers for 40 years.  This, without doubt, is the poorest shaving Remington I have ever used.  I believe the foil curves are too small and even with triple surfaces I get a better shave with my old Remington dual foils.  Electronically, this razor is superb.  But, if it doesn&#x27;t give you a good, close shave, forget about it...</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long battery life&lt;br /&gt;Hasn&#x27;t failed yet&lt;br /&gt;Power Gauge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too big and bulky&lt;br /&gt;The motor sounds like a wailing banshee (extremely loud)&lt;br /&gt;Pivoting head is a joke&lt;br /&gt;Rips hairs off face instead of cutting&lt;br /&gt;Cheap construction&lt;br /&gt;My $20 Phillips is comparable to this shaver</li>
            <li> I had one of these literally like 15 years ago - and I liked it but the foil always ripped for me - bought a new one and it ripped like the next day - I press hard when I shave and foil shavers seem to rip too easy.  I like them - but the foil always rips for me and I cut myself.</li>
            <li> It shaves ok. Hard to take apart and clean. Not built as well as 2 other shaves I have owned - I hope it lasts.</li>
            <li> I ordered this shaver to replace the Remington MS3 1700 that I have had for approximately five years. The F5790 is certainly an upgrade.  I like the swivel action of the head, the out of the way trimmer and the lights indicating the current status of the battery.  The battery recharge is also much quicker than that of the MS3 1700.</li>
            <li> I have had many electric razors over the years all being remington microscreens.  I few months ago I purchased a Braun Series 5 from Costco at a super deal.  I had always wanted one and never could to afford it.  Man was I excited.  I hate it.  The build quality is good, it is quiet and smooth.  The part I don&#x27;t like is that it is sooooo slow.  It takes forever to shave.  Then I got F5790 and love it.  Its fastest shaving razor I have ever had and it gives a close clean shave.  No nicks or burns as other reviews have stated.  Works great for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this in 2013 from Amazon for $34.00, I&#x27;m not sure why it is $88.00 a year later. It is worth every penny of $34. In 2012 I bought a fancy Braun rechargeable foil shaver after my old trustworthy, $25.00 Remington broke. I though, if I paid a ridiculously high price for a new shaver, I would be happier. Boy was I wrong. I hated the Braun from the start. I paid around $90.00 for it and it was the worst shave ever. It never shaved close and compared to my old Remington, didn&#x27;t even come close to a good shave. My lucky break came when I went on vacation and dropped my Braun on the tile bathroom floor of the hotel. It shattered into a bunch of peices. Now faced with replacing it, I started doing some research. I decided I had only 2 things that were utmost important in my decison for a new shaver. It had to provide a close shave, and it had to work when I plugged in the charger and not just run on battery power. I found this Remington to fit the bill nicely, and it was only $34.00. So after wasting $90. on the Braun, I want you all to know, this is a great shaver for the price, and don&#x27;t waste your money on the hype surrounding Braun razors.</li>
            <li> My old Remington died so I decided to upgrade.  This has many positive reviews and a very good price.  It&#x27;s performance has matched my expectations.  Does a good job for the money.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband because of the excellent reviews, but he is very disappointed that this shaver does not give as close a shave as his old Braun.</li>
            <li> The shave is only adequate.  Requires lot of time to get close shave, even if using a pre shave lotion.</li>
            <li> Shaver came with the wrong plastic head guard that does not fit or stay in place when shaver is not being used (listed as item number 6 in &amp;#34;Product Features&amp;#34; section of package insert). Please send me the right one.</li>
            <li> The product works just as expected.  He had an older model and requested the same thing again.  It is a quality item and works very well.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my husband for Christmas and he has used it several times since, he really likes the close shave he gets.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the Remington shaver.  It takes slightly longer to shave than a razor but it&#x27;s more convenient, no water and no shaving cream required so total time is probably less.  I haven&#x27;t used an electric razor in quite awhile and I&#x27;m really pleased with the new shaver as it really does shave as close as a blade.  It&#x27;s easy to clean and you can run it in water (in rechargeable mode and no power cord plugged in!)  Not least important, it&#x27;s not an expensive razor.  I probably used to spend more on blades and shaving cream in a year than I did on the Remington.  I suspect that replacing the cutters and foils when the time comes won&#x27;t be cheap but I&#x27;m still very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This razor is actually painful for me to use. I&#x27;ve since gotten another Braun, which I should have done to start with.</li>
            <li> This model was highly rated by Consumers Reports, but it didn&#x27;t work up to my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;I returned it and had no problems with the service.</li>
            <li> Works great, close shave and the battery life is far longer than my last shaver. This is my first foil shaver, the last one I had was given to me as a gift more than 20 years ago (different brand). If you take proper care of your equipment, it&#x27;ll last a long time.</li>
            <li> Father-in-law loves it.</li>
            <li> The electric razor did not shave as advertised. Has already been consigned to the waste basket.  It is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I had the same problem as the below review:&lt;br /&gt;I bought this Razor a month ago. After about 1 month of use, suddenly one morning the foil head decides that it will no longer stay clasped to the body and I am no longer able to use the razor. I took it to my workbench magnifier to see if there was anything I did wrong. Nope, the clasp design is just bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all (Norelco, Braun, etc.) with disappointment and always come back to Remington for a close shave.  The design of the foil and pivot on the F5790 works well and the shave is close and comfortable.  Remington&#x27;s tend to be noisier than other brands but it&#x27;s worth it given the quality of the shave.  I recently purchased a Norelco and it took me twice as long to get a reasonably close shave that didn&#x27;t seem to last a full day.&lt;br /&gt;Remington is the best!!!</li>
            <li> It takes forever to shave.  One can&#x27;t get a close shave with this model.  I&#x27;ve used Remington Razors for many, many years, and this is by far the worst one I&#x27;ve ever had.  It&#x27;s almost impossible to shave above the neck area, and one has to keep going over the same areas many times, and still there is stubble left.  i&#x27;m old and ill, and am disappointed to have this kind of hassle to deal with.  I suggest no one else try this thing.</li>
            <li> not as fast a shave as your ms3 1700 also problems with the head being too hard to remove at times.</li>
            <li> Disappointment awaits you if you buy this product.  I give this a 1 star because there wasn&#x27;t anything lower.. Save your money before you waste it on this shaver. Will not cut long hair (1/32\\&quot; and over) . The problem is the holes in the foil are too small or poorly positioned and individual hair just slides over. You have to push very hard to get it to work just marginally well. Has great features, just doesn&#x27;t work. Don&#x27;t know how to describe it any other way.    But there is a bright side. After posting review, I was contacted by Remington Customer service. Discussed problems with a customer service rep and he told me that a foil razor would not work well with my beard. I&#x27;m 75 and I would be happier with a rotary. And if I would return the foil razor with proof of purchase, Remington would replace it with a rotary.  Which they did. The rotary works much better. I had to pay the return postage but it was well worth it to get something that works.</li>
            <li> Good close shave...husband loves it..</li>
            <li> The product is noisey and does not shave clean. Skips hairs,even after several passes. Therefore is irritating and time consuming.</li>
            <li> Got tired of replacing the expensive foils and blades.  They wear down fast and you have to replace them, so the savings don&#x27;t really make up for the replacement costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will not buy remington again.</li>
            <li> I was in the hospital and couldn&#x27;t walk so my wife bought me this for shaving. In short it shaves in patches and if you try and go over where it missed you can get a burn. Give me back my blade and shving cream</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only owned about four electric shavers, and two of them were the original Remington micro screens, which this one pretty much is, albeit, a new style. It was fully charged out of the box(it has a power gauge) so I was able to use it right away. I think it also may run on electric while charging which the original model could not do. I had about three weeks worth of growth, and I used the tripper feature to knock that out, and then fixed up the stubble with the foil head. In less than 10 mins. it was done, and no long hair left over. I went to BJ&#x27;s Wholesale, and they only had one model, and it was a Braun for a 180.00. This model I purchased at Walmart for 50.00, and I can see no reason why you would pay 75% more, and what more could you get for your money. Some reviews complain it is heavy and loud. I do not believe that either is true. It contours your face better than the original micro screens, and it is quick and comfortable. For the money you can&#x27;t do any better, and I would recommend this shaver to a friend. They had some cheaper models, but I have learned not to buy the cheapest or the most expensive items in a store. If it lasts three years or better, I will be very pleased! Also, I do have sensitive and fair scin, and this does not burn or mark me up in any way, even with a few weeks worth of growth!</li>
            <li> I have used electric shavers for about 20 years. Over the years I have mostly used the rotory type shavers like Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;But lately I have felt their quality has suffered while the price increased. So I decided to try a foil type electric.&lt;br /&gt;I found this shaver at a local store on sale for $39 after Christmas. I was very disappointed in it at first because it was very noisy and the close shave was not there. I decided to keep shaving with it hoping a adjustment to my skin was needed.&lt;br /&gt;After a couple weeks I found little improvement in how close of shave I got. Plus, it seemed to take me twice as long to even get a satisfactory shave compared to my Norelco. I think the main problem with this shaver is it has only one type of foil screen design. Even though there are three foils they don&#x27;t have different opening sizes to cut different lengths of beard.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes at least in my case I get some beard stubble that is longer and apparently this shaver skips over those longer stubble&#x27;s. I would say if your going to try this shaver. I would recommend that you shave frequently and maybe even start with a clean razor shaved face. Given all the minor problems I have had with the Remmington I cannot recommend it. I found it noisy,&lt;br /&gt;not providing a decent close shave and more difficult to clean then a rotory shaver. Oh, and don&#x27;t bother trying to rinse the heads under water as the shaver states can be done. All it does is wet the beard shavings and cakes them up in the blades making it even harder to clean.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver at a decent price. It performs as well or better than many more expensive shavers.</li>
            <li> Good shave, good battery life, quick charging, let down by a plastic protective foil cover that won&#x27;t stay in place.</li>
            <li> Quit on me in about three months, called Remington and they sent a new one! Gives a good shave, but noisy.</li>
            <li> This razor gets an extremely close shave even closer than a blade if used right.  It was quicker at the beginning and as time went on you would need to take a little more time and a few more reps but a very good razor. But on the box it says to replace the blades after 6 months and mine lasted 2 and a half years so yeah and it still shaved but I decided to replace the blade because it got a hole it in. But this razor is very good ! HIghly recommended</li>
            <li> This shaver did dot perform very well for me at all. The battery was fully charged. I use the shaver on my head and face it cut little or any hairs. It made noise like it was doing a lot of cutting. I even tried the hair on my arm the same thing happen. Nothing. So I thought it was me so I had my son to try it and he got the same results. This shaver is not what is design for at lest for me. I&#x27;m very dissatisfied with this shaver.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor because it was rated highly by Consumer Reports. It does not come with a case. So far it has performed well. It remains to be seen how long it lasts and how expensive the replacement heads are.</li>
            <li> razor works very well and holds a charge for a long period of time. seems to be good value for the money</li>
            <li> Having happily used Remington shavers for the last fifty years I thought nothing about replacing my worn out Remington with this model.  I screwed up.  The initial shave was quite adequate, but within a few weeks I began to get nicks and scratches which soon became quite uncomfortable.  Such results are to be expected after a few months of heavy use, but not after a mere several weeks.  Next time I&#x27;ll read the reviews first, even though my prior experience has been positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a positive note, the battery charge life was very good.  A single charge lasted more than two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rotary flex head I bought to replace it seems to work OK, but has to be recharged every four or five days.</li>
            <li> I have never been an electric razor guy, but I saw this one was fairly highly rated and thought I would try it. Now I know why I am not an electric razor guy. This thing hurts to use and doesn&#x27;t shave very well. If you are a once a week shaver, it will probably do what you want it to do (i.e., more like clippers). But, for a guy who likes a blade close shave every day--useless. However, I have no complaints with the vendor. The product was delivery very quickly and arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> everything on the shaver works fine and it met my expectations. I love it very much and would buy  one</li>
            <li> My first electric razor in years and I am generally pleased.  Holds a charge well and provides a fairly close shave (not blade close, mind you) without the razor burn I was getting with blades.</li>
            <li> It is about what I expected from an electric razor.  Still use a blade if I want a really close shave.</li>
            <li> Great razor for the price.</li>
            <li> I have used a Remington shaver for many years.  I like the F5790 because it is mostly a no-frills shaver but has the triple screen that I find shaves the best.  I will continue to look for another F5790 when my present one craters.</li>
            <li> My Husband loves the shave he gets with this razor. Very close ,he does not need an extra blade to go over his face</li>
            <li> Always had used a rotary razor.  Decided to try a foil razor and chose this one based on reviews, etc.  Gave it 6 months to try to get a close shave.  Would often not capture and cut light neck whiskers.  Had to take multiple passes on regular whiskers.  Tried a lighter touch and a heavier touch.  Nothing really worked.  I gave up and went back to a rotary.  The charge indicator is very helpful and the charge lasts long enough for a two week vacation without the charger.  It cleaned easily.</li>
            <li> I was concerned that the price seemed too good. I have used Remington for years and have always paid more for the foil shaver. The price seemed low, but having used it several times I am very pleased.  Very quiet and a close shave. The protective head cover is rather cheep, but it works.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver to replace a tired Norelco rotary shaver, and initially I was pleased. Sure it was bulky and noisy, but it DID shave well. I washed it out often, and used Remington Shaver Saver to extend the life of the heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as time went on, performance really went down hill. I&#x27;ve given the shaver a really good cleaning several times (take apart - not just wash out) and used a pre-shave product to help... yet the performance was not there. I strongly suspect that the head set needs to be replaced already. I paid extra for the titanium heads, and if that did help - I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t buy the model below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of buying new heads, cheap as they are, I have switched back to a blade while I do some more shopping for a replacement. I knew Remington was a budget brand, but still expected a longer life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I don&#x27;t recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> I have had this electric razor a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, my impression is that it is not a terrible shaver for its price. It has some power, and gives a close shave on my face. However, there are several glaring design flaws that lead me to believe that this shaver underwent NO QUALITY CONTROL WHATSOEVER. If it had, these flaws could have been easily detected. As a result, I will likely send this back for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, as others have noted, it has a very clunky design. It feels like I am shaving with a brick. Additionally, the shaving head itself takes up too large a surface area. This is especially difficult when shaving my neck/jawbone area. Although it seems to do a good job on flat skin, it&#x27;s very difficult to maneuver around curves. The result is that I get a good shave on my face, and my neck looks like total crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest problem I have with the Remington, however, is the plastic on either side of the head that allows it to pivot. BIG DESIGN FLAW! It scrapes my face with every pass (especially on the curves). It is extremely uncomfortable. I noticed this within the first 2 seconds of using it, so I don&#x27;t understand how Remington could let this go unnoticed. Or maybe they did know about it, and just let it go to market anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do find the reviews about holes occurring in the foil that allow the blade to cut the skin troublesome, although I have not had any problems with it so far (as I would hope, after only owning it for 2 days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and it&#x27;s LOUD. I was shocked when I started it up for the first time. I used to take my previous shaver to the office (a quiet-running Norelco) and touch up any areas I missed in my pre-coffee, early-morning funk. There is no way I can start this thing up in the office without the risk that my coworkers will think I&#x27;m running a chainsaw. I am assuming that the loudness is a function of its high-powered motor, but it&#x27;s a bit ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This could have been a great shaver with a few common-sense tweaks. In conclusion, I would keep it if it weren&#x27;t for the plastic corners that dig into my flesh on every pass, but that was a deal-breaker for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;Update: After using this for about a week, I have found that it is a decent razor, especially for the price. It took some adjusting, but I found that when I move the blade slower over my face it works a lot better. I will probably keep it at this point.</li>
            <li> my old remington gave out so looked in Consumers mag. where the F5790 is highly rated. WRONG! This thing has so many negative features that I will throw it in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;1) its big, awkward and noisy.&lt;br /&gt;2) will not shave the hairs on your neck, no matter how many times you try.&lt;br /&gt;3) has a pushbutton on/off switch rather than a slide switch right where your&lt;br /&gt;  fingers and thumb hit it and punch it off ten times per shave.&lt;br /&gt;4) pivot and flex head?---not without pushing it with your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;5) big awkward head; impossible to shave around your nose or your upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;6) the head cover wont snap on correctly and pops off the minute you put it down.&lt;br /&gt;7) I spend more than twice the time shaving as I did with my old remington and still&lt;br /&gt;  get a lousy shave.&lt;br /&gt;8) It&#x27; hard to get the foil off to clean inside, the little tiny ridges on the&lt;br /&gt;  plastic head are nearly impossible to grasp.&lt;br /&gt;In short don&#x27;t buy this model if you expect an easy shave.</li>
            <li> Had been using F4790 for 4+ year and wanted a closer shave but was disappointed&lt;br /&gt;also on 2nd cleaning one of the cutters came apart. Found quite a problem to put it back together. purchased the F5790 around Oct. 4th 2012,  when i opened the&lt;br /&gt; package out popped a coupon that expired late 2011 in my 2012 package.</li>
            <li> Takes a long time to shave, lots of misses, have to use the trimmer head daily. I junked it after a month.</li>
            <li> I previously used a Norelco and had no issues. With this shaver I find that I have to go back over some spots with a manual razor that this electric razor  doesn&#x27;t get.</li>
            <li> For a shaver with a high rating, who is doing the rating?  This shaver should be an insult to the Remington name.</li>
            <li> Many whiskers are not removed without multiple passes and/or using the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;The shave is fast and non-irritating except for the missed whiskers which require extra time.</li>
            <li> It is good for the inexpensive price.  The indicator light is very helpful.  The trimmer works just fine.  The blades and foil also work fine.  I think a more expensive electric razor will get a better shave, but this is not bacd.  It is inexpensive and it is a fine daily shaving tool.</li>
            <li> This Remington makes me very happy. It gives to me a very deep and smooth bear cut. Similar to those obtained with shaver blade. Thanks remington for creating this kind of razor.</li>
            <li> Th e frame is above the screens  i cant get a  very good shave&lt;br /&gt;iwould like a refund if possible</li>
            <li> It works great on whiskers one to maybe three days old.  Gives me a shave faster and closer than my previous Remington did  Very fast and no irritation.  But I must keep my Norelco for longer whiskers, because this new Remington is completely powerless with them.</li>
            <li> This rechargeable shaver holds its charge for many days. It fits comfortably in your hand and has both a pivot and pop-up. It works fine for touch up or daily shave. Even with the pivot action, some spots under chin need to be repeatedly shaved because the head is rather large. Takes very little time to finish the job with the triple shaving heads.</li>
            <li> Nice close shave.  Trimmer works good, too.  Needs a recharge after about a week.  Not sure if that is good.  But it is easy to charge.</li>
            <li> The shaver met my expectations. The only small minus was the plastic guard for the blades fits very loosely. The shaver itself is great. Dana</li>
            <li> I bought this on a Consumer Reports recommendation. This thing S.U.C.K.S.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s loud, I mean holding a nest of hornets next to your ear loud. It wakes my wife up every morning when I&#x27;m shaving. The shave is terrible. Even across the relatively flat surface of my cheek it leaves whiskers behind.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and buy something else.&lt;br /&gt;You could probably get a better razor by kicking in another twenty bucks.&lt;br /&gt;If I could give it a zero rating, I would.</li>
            <li> I used it for 5 or 6 times and it just didn&#x27;t seem  to stay sharp and cut well. I wouldn&#x27;t waste the 55.00 for it.</li>
            <li> I have used electric shavers for 25 years and this is the worst shaver I have ever used.  It misses hairs, takes me forever to shave, and doesn&#x27;t leave a claen shave.  Worst of all, Remington changed the foil head design and the head now pops off every time I shave.  After buying Remington products for decades they have now lost me as a customer FOREVER!</li>
            <li> This razor would not shave the my husband&#x27;s face NOR the blond hairs off my legs (ARRRGH)!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would someone PLEASE tell me how I keep falling for rave reviews-----and then getting items that DO NOT WORK.  Are all of the rave reviews really legitimate???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course we all know that electrical products from China either work poorly, work for a short time, or do not work at all.  SOOOOOOOO sad!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not waste your time or money on this shaver.</li>
            <li> Husband tried for the first this week and loves it.  Likes the option of having it on a cord or cordless.  Shaved close too.</li>
            <li> I PURCHASED IT TO SHAVE MY HEAD; NOT RECOMMENDED BY THE MANUFACTURER!  TRIED IT ANYWAY, DID A LOUSY JOB!  I&#x27;LL GO BACK TO A CONVENTIONAL RAZOR.</li>
            <li> This is the worst shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  I literally had to spend 15 minutes to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li> I bought the Remington F5790 within the past year because my previous Remington that I loved had died. I also have a Braun, about ten years old that I bought at Odd Job for 19 bucks. The new Remington was a big disappointment. It didn&#x27;t shave nearly as well as the old Braun with the Flex head and the old Braun only had two blades and foils. It takes me twice as long to shave with the Remington to get a shave equal to the Braun and I had to learn to shave in a circular motion. If I wanted to do that I would have bought a Norelco! They advertise you can clean it with water, but in the manual they only recommend that once a month. The manual is poorly written, and doesn&#x27;t explain what the code is for the flashing lights indicating whether it is fully charged, charging or partially charged. I take good care of my shavers and have not had to change blades and heads often, usually once every couple of years or so, but after only six months (the recommended time in the manual) it started tearing up my face. I bought it for its price, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stan</li>
            <li> Very loud buzzing on this shaver compared to my old Norelco rotary. Once you get over the wake up call in the morning, it functions fine and makes for a close shave</li>
            <li> This razor is a major improvement to the performance of my &amp;#34;very old&amp;#34; Remington.  I can shave i about 1/2 the time and get a closer feel.  So far, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
