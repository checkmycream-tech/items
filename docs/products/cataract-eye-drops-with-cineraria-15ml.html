            <li>It just seems hopeful to me, that a product that has been used for a 100 years or more, might have something going for it!  </li>

            <li>I  am pleased with this product!</li>

            <li>This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Amazing stuff.</li>
            <li>I carried out my own six month trial and made a video of the effects http://m.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;L2LxQZbfh5g</li>
            <li>Based on recommendations from people who used these drops in their own eyes and said there was no burning or irritation, I decided to try it with my dog.</li>
            <li>and I am so impressed with the results so far</li>
            <li>as long as she is happy , I can&#x27;t be more happy with product.</li>
            <li>Will be purchasing more</li>
            <li>These drops are working better than Refresh Optive.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this product and will continue to use it on my dogs.</li>
            <li>It seems to have dissolved the film that was growing so prominent.  </li>
            <li>Way better than the trama &amp; expense of surgery  </li>
            <li>and he can see much better now.  </li>
            <li>you experience eye pain, changes in vision, continued redness or irritation of the eye or if the condition worsens or persists for more than 72 hours, discontinue use and see a doctor.&amp;#34;  I contacted the seller (Grounds for Tea) to request a refund.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s able to follow movement with both eyes now.</li>
            <li>: )</li>
            <li>and I glad I found this and got it</li>
            <li>and it did a miracle to my dogs eye :-)</li>
            <li>Maybe if anything, it would soothe her eyes and make them feel better.  </li>
            <li>It is safe to use</li>
            <li>Hoping for a healing!  :-)</li>
            <li>and I hope he get even better.</li>
            <li>I will keep trying I so want her to see better</li>
            <li>and I am enjoying it.</li>
            <li>either so they do not sting or irritate her eyes :)</li>
            <li>more thing...</li>
            <li>but now she is going visiting again :)</li>
            <li>BUT I notice that she seems to be getting around better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gonna assume her vision has gotten better.</li>
            <li>Then again the toric lens surgery works for most people</li>
            <li>so pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;VERY pleased</li>
            <li>I AM GLAD</li>
            <li>an improvement  colors appear brighter  not a hazy as they had been thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li>and I give a better review.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased that she has regained some of her vision.  </li>
            <li>and I feel like my vision has more clarity.</li>
            <li>My eyes were getting progressively more cloudy in the AM.</li>
            <li>Satisfied met my expectations.</li>
            <li>I love these drops.  </li>
            <li>They make my eyes feel better immediately and seems to be doing their job.</li>
            <li>I also use the pellets and many  nutritional products and foods to support eyes.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed.</li>
            <li>So maybe after another month and another bottle I will be able to tell if it worked.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice to see the hair around his eyes stay clean and</li>
            <li>after a week, his eye was significantly clearer!</li>
            <li>I am thrilled at how quickly it has improved my dog&#x27;s eyes.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m really happy so far.</li>
            <li>I also see many light beams shooting out from car lights when night driving.  </li>
            <li>but for free :)so i decided to try them out before i bought the others.</li>
            <li>fast shipping good product</li>
            <li>Good by for the money, since the Vets wants almost $40000 dollars for surgery.</li>
            <li>All is well and good , thanks</li>
            <li>Good product fast shipping</li>
            <li>overall and delivery times have been really good as well, will continue to re-order &amp; pray!</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>So that&#x27;s made life easy.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>My  2-year-old pug, does not have a cataract, but does have very mild pigmentary keratitis that appeared in an area where he had a corneal ulcer about a year ago.</li>
            <li>so the sheen doesn&#x27;t match the high gloss in his good eye, but it&#x27;s getting there</li>
            <li>Feels fine in my eyes.</li>
            <li>I also bought MSM drops for the eyes since my eyes tire more easily at night, great for dry eyes</li>
            <li>If you want super comfortable contacts try Bausch &amp; Lombs Ultra!</li>
            <li>This product was received quickly and at a better cost than at the veterinarian&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li>but they are so mild you don&#x27;t need to see me for 2 years!</li>
            <li>Will update if some positive changes take place that I can honestly accredit to the drops.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy using these eye drops each day.</li>
            <li>I would throw the ball and unless it touched her or made a sound she would have no clue where it went...</li>
            <li>I put this in my 15 year old dog&#x27;s eyes (a Shih-Tzu) and immediately they became bright and shiny.</li>
            <li>They have not eliminated my cataracts, but I am told that the kind that I have are fast growing.  </li>
            <li>Purchased these for my dog who has Cataracts in both eyes, at first she couldn&#x27;t see and was bumping into every things, but since I &#x27;ve  been using this eye drops, her sight has becoming a lot better, I would recommend these drops for anyone dog who is suffering from Cataracts.</li>
            <li>To much government control!!!</li>
            <li>Within 2 days I could see a significant chnge in his eyes.</li>
            <li>In fact I believe in one week there were significant changes.</li>
            <li>This product is natural and works great for my dry and strained eyes at work, best eye drops i have used for overall eye health.</li>
            <li>Tobie has had marked clearing in the most efffected eye, and seems to be seeing a lot better.</li>
            <li>I like these drops - they go in easily and feel wonderful, and I believe they have improved my overall eye health and visual clarity.</li>
            <li>KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.PUT INTO SMALLER BOTTLES IN A CARRYING CASE FOR CONVINE OF USE.</li>
            <li>Good price - using daily but don&#x27;t know if they are having any effect.</li>
            <li>Peanuts wish come true.</li>
            <li>Delivery was done quickly and without any error.  </li>
            <li>quickly)....</li>
            <li>Her eye is very clear now and looks a lot better.</li>
            <li>After used these two drops, she thinks that CAN C makes her vision more improvement than Natural Ophthalmics.</li>
            <li>I take 2 a day as opposed to three times a day and feel that they are effective in overall eye health.</li>
            <li>definitely worth trying to avoid surgery.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>If she can see better/clearer, its worth it.  </li>
            <li>Worth it</li>
            <li>The shipment arrived right on time without any issues.  </li>
            <li>Her right eye</li>
            <li>I use this in conjunction with Native Remedies CataractClear for an eye flare up and when you can&#x27;t get to the ophthalmlogist right away.</li>
            <li>Worked right away for me.</li>
            <li>I am not yet sure whether this is helping my cataracts from developing further, but it feels good in my dry eyes.</li>
            <li>I began using the drops three times a day and now, only a month later, the cataract in my right eye is so much better, I can make out just about every kind of shape.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping,using 3-4 times daily on 10 y.o. shepherd.time will tell how effective it is</li>
            <li>seller ships very fast</li>
            <li>She thinks  her vision absolutely improved!</li>
            <li>and she thinks it is really work!</li>
            <li>After three weeks she tried another cataract drops (CAN C) to compare the result because I bought her different brand eye drops to decide which one is better.</li>
            <li>he is diabetic and is blind from cataracts,he is also my very best friend.  </li>
            <li>I just finished my first bottle of these homeopathic cataract eye drops.  </li>
            <li>bought the first bottle.</li>
            <li>Will order more product in the future.</li>
            <li>If it works I&#x27;ll gladly come back and update my post.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I am giving the gift of eyesight back to my dog.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I am giving the gift of eyesight back to my dog.  </li>
            <li>As I work on the computer daily, this has helped to see better</li>
            <li>When I first started using it, she had film and build up in her eye.</li>
            <li>so maybe it works better on younger dogs.</li>
            <li>but I thought I&#x27;d research eye drops, first.</li>
            <li>he kinda sees the trash can and the walls a bit better when i put him outside.</li>
            <li>It seems a lot of people have been helped with these eye drops, but unfortunately, I&#x27;m not one of them.  </li>
            <li>received my first bottle of these drops and applied two drops in one eye.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the earlier the drops are started when cataracts start to develop the better the results.  </li>
            <li>It has actually cleared up most of the cloudiness in my eyes.</li>
            <li>I stopped using them and  fortunately the bulging and super red irritation stopped about a week after discontinued use.</li>
            <li>I should add that the so called specialist was ready to put a toric lens in my right eye 3 weeks after the 1st surgery even though there is no astigmatism in that eye.  </li>
            <li>When I began, the cataract in my right eye was very opaque.</li>
            <li>There were so many positive reviews I was hoping for the same results.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had good luck with a different eye drop that I am currently using.</li>
            <li>I have only been using a month and really can&#x27;t tell if its working, but will continue because something is better than nothing at all.  </li>
            <li>within about 4 days he went to the vet for a check up,it was confirmed that rebel can now see from his right eye quite well, and his left eye,not so well.  </li>
            <li>I noted that a lot of the positive reviews were premature...</li>
            <li>Based on some positive reviews, I purchased this product with a bit of hope and used it for about a week.</li>
            <li>But today for the first time when I called him to eat he walk straight to his bowl.</li>
            <li>but I now see very clearly..with the first</li>
            <li>Our dog recently became diabetic and lost his vision very quickly.</li>
            <li>My 15 year old golden has started getting cataract, I have been using this and really see the difference in her eyes!</li>
            <li>When I began the drops, his eyes were gray (from the cataracts) and the original brown of his eyes was barely visible......</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use it much..</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen much change for my elderly dog.  </li>
            <li>THERE WAS JUST NO DIFFERENCE BEFORE OR AFTER THE WHOLE BOTTLE WAS USED.</li>
            <li>This product really works.  </li>
            <li>The cineraria drops made my eyes feel really good/rested</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m convinced this was a reaction to the Can-C, not the cineraria which is very soothing.  </li>
            <li>Real improvement with his vision.</li>
            <li>Whole foods and Bilberry supplements.</li>
            <li>So my dogs eye was real cloudy and had really he couldn&#x27;t see even when I put food in front of him</li>
            <li>I have been using on my dog for a while, haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference, but I will keep using it.  </li>
            <li>Any ways, with her diabetes and cataracts, I have just been very concerned about the eyesight and well-being of my dog</li>
            <li>These drops work very well and have provided comfort for my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t notice much change in cataracts in my dog.</li>
            <li>And, he continues to so demonstrably ENJOY having the drops administered which is a double blessing.</li>
            <li>I had to discontinue these drops, because they irritated my eyes too much.  </li>
            <li>I find the drops to be very helpful.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>They really do work.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s be real, they are not--</li>
            <li>Absolutely.  </li>
            <li>The eye drops are very soothing when I use them.  </li>
            <li>Im very optimistic about it helping her cataracts though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth a try if your pet has recently developed cataracts.</li>
            <li>The cataract in my dog&#x27;s eye is much improved.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if they are really helping him.</li>
            <li>Thanks again for saving my life.</li>
            <li>They are very soothing and I will continue to use them.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do much for the cataract</li>
            <li>however I noticed it was very beneficial for healing and cleansing the cornea.</li>
            <li>Thanks arrived on time.couldn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Thanks thou</li>
            <li>Better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Very soothing for me and my dog.</li>
            <li>She checked his eyes again and informed me that he was able to see some (maybe near sighted or just shadows out of his left eye).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any news regarding how effective this product is yet , as I have only started on my 2nd bottle .&lt;br</li>
            <li>Each one of our dogs have their own personal dish in different sizes and colors.</li>
            <li>I gave her the drops for 2 weeks 2 times a day and WOW what a change!!!</li>
            <li>so she was only in familiar places.  </li>
            <li>but the expense was more than double this product for the exact same components.  </li>
            <li>My point is, I will try anything safe to avoid surgery in my other eye.  </li>
            <li>I gave her only one drop in each eye everyday for about 2 weeks and by the end of two weeks her eyes where crystal clear and beautiful.</li>
            <li>When I first received Natural Ophthalmis drops</li>
            <li>, anything more than 1 drop just ends up dribbling down his lil&#x27;</li>
            <li>she was shocked,and a little bit peeved,but we see it as a good thing,thank you all again  kath and mike and especially Rebel!</li>
            <li>Am arleady noticing more clarity and less straining in my vision.</li>
            <li>If it would have worked even half as well as it was described, I would gladly pay the price and re-order as needed.</li>
            <li>(Less is better with homeopathic remedies).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my eyes, though to be fair, I had trouble making a habit of putting them in regularly.</li>
            <li>His lenses looked like red opals, and his sight was diminishing quickly.</li>
            <li>I will buy the product since I did see quite a few good reviews on animals but not enough on people but will write my review after giving it ample time.  </li>
            <li>so pleased as there wasn&#x27;t much traditional western medicine could do for my dog.  </li>
            <li>Since there are a few people stating it is working for them and their pets, that&#x27;s good enough for me.  </li>
            <li>Less than a week after putting the first application into his eyes I noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews, and had high hopes with this product, but it didn&#x27;t seem to help my dog any.</li>
            <li>Why this high price on Cataract Care?  </li>
            <li>I recommend them to my highly to my friends</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I need a little more time</li>
            <li>Will see what happens in a few more weeks.</li>
            <li>Dallas has loved this game ever since she was a puppy</li>
            <li>But i must admit i was expecting a lkittle more than the very slight change i saw.</li>
            <li>My holistic Vet prescribed these drops for my 12 year old poodle - these are they exact same drops and much cheaper than the Vet&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>is it, where did it go, lemme at it&amp;#34; trooper to 3) a resigned, depressed shell of her old self only casually interested in much anything.  </li>
            <li>I cannot say much about this product yet because I am still waiting to see more results, but over a period of time it does help with small (newly developed) cataract.</li>
            <li>I still will have his eyes checked with my new vet</li>
            <li>Also, I went to a new eye doctor.</li>
            <li>so far feel better after a few days</li>
            <li>Other than that, I would like to say that I&#x27;m a great believer in natural healing products, and have definitely noticed benefits from other products.</li>
            <li>And I too thought I was too young for these!</li>
            <li>I have noticed a significant difference, especially in her one eye where the cataract covered her entire iris.  </li>
            <li>this is your all natural pet product!</li>
            <li>it works my dogs eyes have improved they look much better and darker than before no more ghost looking eyes .</li>
            <li>Needless to say, I am thrilled!</li>
            <li>To be fair, I&#x27;m a very sensitive type of person and things do effect me differently than most, but experiencing this sudden and scary change in my vision was enough for me to stop using the drops.</li>
            <li>Perhaps my eye was not bad enough when I started using them initially for me to notice an improvement, or perhaps using them in conjunction with the Can-C</li>
            <li>He is walking better with hardly any accidents.</li>
            <li>After just a few days of using these drops we saw a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>Wear contacts around the clock to see clearly.</li>
            <li>After 2 weeks of use, there is amazing improvement - his vision is slowly returning, and he is obviously &#x27;looking&#x27; at things again.</li>
            <li>This product really works for my 12 yr old German Shepherd girl.</li>
            <li>We hoped these eye drops would help clear up his cataracts but nothing happened.</li>
            <li>My eyes are getting clear and clear every day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed that I can see so clearly.  </li>
            <li>My dogs eyes have started to clear</li>
            <li>Too early to tell.</li>
            <li>At this point it&#x27;s too early to tell if Natural Ophthalmics is working or not.</li>
            <li>So she returned to the Natural Ophthalmics again.</li>
            <li>I have a 9 year old Mini Schnauzer that has contracted Diabetes.</li>
            <li>So far, no response.</li>
            <li>My puppy developed cataracts within a matter of weeks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been purchasing and using this on my elderly dog (who is 14 years old).  </li>
            <li>My 11 year old dog has had diabetes since she was 7.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to help my baby out, and was especially concerned</li>
            <li>My 16 1/2 year old toy poodle has a severe case of cataracts.</li>
            <li>I purchased these eye drops for my almost 12 years old Border Collie dog.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m told it should go away in 6 to 12 months at least for most people.  </li>
            <li>but so far I&#x27;m not in the &amp;#34;most&#x27; catagory.  </li>
            <li>cataracts\\&quot;) for nearly 2.5 mos.</li>
            <li>and he comes at a near gallop, tail wagging.</li>
            <li>IT IS ALSO A NATURAL PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>her vision is far from 100%.  </li>
            <li>So far, My vision hasn&#x27;t improved, However, My eyes often burn &amp; this relieves the burning..</li>
            <li>will recommend it completely</li>
            <li>This was purchased for the treatment of cataracts that had developed in a cat and a dog.  </li>
            <li>and it is natural to the body.</li>
            <li>Thanks for inventing such miracle product.</li>
            <li>Thank you for a natural solution for cataracts, which I have a start of it.  </li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time, well packaged and delivered directly to my door.</li>
            <li>I began using the Natural Ophthalmics drops with Cineraria about a month ago.</li>
            <li>I want to buy this product but have to admit many reviews are basing their results on only a few weeks or a month of usage.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m assuming it got worse since I could not treat it with warm compresses for a month.</li>
            <li>Have only been using for a short time, but my friend&#x27;s 14 year old poodle is beginning to show slight improvement in one of his eyes and is behaving as if he sees more clearly.  </li>
            <li>Whereas previously If the ball wandered more than 10 degrees off axis from where she was headed, she would lose sight of it, then lose interest; but now she not only tracks the ball with 90% accuracy, she also chases it further, longer, and exhausts herself in a way I haven&#x27;t seen in over a year--</li>
            <li>I am only left with a slight amount of clouding that I am sure will disappear with continued use.</li>
            <li>I am a Naturopath; Master Herbalist and C. Nutritionist... 3 months is usually the magic number of regular prescribed use.  </li>
            <li>And my floaters are getting smaller with only first drop.</li>
            <li>Whereas his bad eye was quite white in color due to the cataract which came on SO suddenly, the color has changed significantly and is now more of a light blue depending under direct light -- in fact, his dark brown eyes actually look normal depending on the angle/lighting.</li>
            <li>She could have become completely blind and suffered more pain if I didn&#x27;t seek medical attention right away.  </li>
            <li>My 12 year old Labrador mix developed cataracts several years ago.</li>
            <li>his eye drops 3x a day...and the nearly opaque white cataract is nearly GONE.</li>
            <li>Actually worked on my 15 year old springer!</li>
            <li>I definitely experienced clearer vision cataract is still there just not as bad</li>
            <li>I really haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice any change from when I was using Cataract  Care by Similasan.  </li>
            <li>I used a similar product to help clear a cataract on one of my pugs.</li>
            <li>After 2 days of me noticing the Cloudiness in his eye lense, he was completely blinded in his left eye.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>By the way I gave him her left overs of the old bottle he has cataracts and wanted to try it...</li>
            <li>She now has that old sparkle back.  </li>
            <li>I have been using these eyedrops daily for nearly a year.  </li>
            <li>The first day my vision seemed clearer, the second day I didn&#x27;t notice anything, but the third day my left eye&#x27;s vision broke up into dozens of light fractals (like broken mirror pieces) to the degree</li>
            <li>It does help a little, better than expected, but not near as well as I hoped.</li>
            <li>One eye has a very noticeable cataract and the other has one beginning to form.</li>
            <li>I have the beginnings of cataracts and my aunt used this for a long time for the same purpose and highly recommended them for me.</li>
            <li>Again, My personal advice when dealing with such matters would seek the professional advice of a specialist.</li>
            <li>Also She does not wipe her eyes as much when it goes from really dark to us turning the lights</li>
            <li>Been using these for several years and my opthamologist says my cataracts have barely budged in that time.</li>
            <li>Well, I finally had cataract surgery on one eye, next month the other eye, so I can&#x27;t really grade this.</li>
            <li>I do not know if they are helping with my cataracts since I don&#x27;t go back to the ophthalmologist until April,but they are very cool and soothing to my eyes, especially since I am also using prescription drops which can be irritating.</li>
            <li>and I certainly hope so because it has given me hope Thani won&#x27;t need to shell out a few thousand for surgery for her.</li>
            <li>Our furry little one has all the problems that puppy mills create from the lack of teeth to crippled back legs and now she has developed old age cataracts.  </li>

            <li> I carried out my own six month trial and made a video of the effects http://m.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;L2LxQZbfh5g</li>
            <li> Based on recommendations from people who used these drops in their own eyes and said there was no burning or irritation, I decided to try it with my dog.</li>
            <li> and I am so impressed with the results so far</li>
            <li> as long as she is happy , I can&#x27;t be more happy with product.</li>

            <li> I LOVE this product and will continue to use it on my dogs.</li>
            <li> It seems to have dissolved the film that was growing so prominent.  </li>
            <li> Way better than the trama &amp; expense of surgery  </li>
            <li> and he can see much better now.  </li>
            <li> you experience eye pain, changes in vision, continued redness or irritation of the eye or if the condition worsens or persists for more than 72 hours, discontinue use and see a doctor.&amp;#34;  I contacted the seller (Grounds for Tea) to request a refund.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s able to follow movement with both eyes now.</li>

            <li> It is safe to use</li>
            <li> Hoping for a healing!  :-)</li>

            <li> but now she is going visiting again :)</li>
            <li> BUT I notice that she seems to be getting around better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna assume her vision has gotten better.</li>
            <li> Then again the toric lens surgery works for most people</li>

            <li> /&gt;VERY pleased</li>
            <li> I AM GLAD</li>

            <li> and I give a better review.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased that she has regained some of her vision.  </li>
            <li> and I feel like my vision has more clarity.</li>
            <li> My eyes were getting progressively more cloudy in the AM.</li>
            <li> Satisfied met my expectations.</li>
            <li> I love these drops.  </li>
            <li> They make my eyes feel better immediately and seems to be doing their job.</li>
            <li> I also use the pellets and many  nutritional products and foods to support eyes.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed.</li>
            <li> So maybe after another month and another bottle I will be able to tell if it worked.</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so nice to see the hair around his eyes stay clean and</li>
            <li> after a week, his eye was significantly clearer!</li>
            <li> I am thrilled at how quickly it has improved my dog&#x27;s eyes.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m really happy so far.</li>
            <li> I also see many light beams shooting out from car lights when night driving.  </li>
            <li> but for free :)so i decided to try them out before i bought the others.</li>
            <li> fast shipping good product</li>
            <li> Good by for the money, since the Vets wants almost $40000 dollars for surgery.</li>
            <li> All is well and good , thanks</li>
            <li> Good product fast shipping</li>
            <li> overall and delivery times have been really good as well, will continue to re-order &amp; pray!</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> So that&#x27;s made life easy.</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> My  2-year-old pug, does not have a cataract, but does have very mild pigmentary keratitis that appeared in an area where he had a corneal ulcer about a year ago.</li>
            <li> so the sheen doesn&#x27;t match the high gloss in his good eye, but it&#x27;s getting there</li>
            <li> Feels fine in my eyes.</li>
            <li> I also bought MSM drops for the eyes since my eyes tire more easily at night, great for dry eyes</li>
            <li> If you want super comfortable contacts try Bausch &amp; Lombs Ultra!</li>
            <li> This product was received quickly and at a better cost than at the veterinarian&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li> but they are so mild you don&#x27;t need to see me for 2 years!</li>
            <li> Will update if some positive changes take place that I can honestly accredit to the drops.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy using these eye drops each day.</li>
            <li> I would throw the ball and unless it touched her or made a sound she would have no clue where it went...</li>
            <li> I put this in my 15 year old dog&#x27;s eyes (a Shih-Tzu) and immediately they became bright and shiny.</li>
            <li> They have not eliminated my cataracts, but I am told that the kind that I have are fast growing.  </li>
            <li> Purchased these for my dog who has Cataracts in both eyes, at first she couldn&#x27;t see and was bumping into every things, but since I &#x27;ve  been using this eye drops, her sight has becoming a lot better, I would recommend these drops for anyone dog who is suffering from Cataracts.</li>
            <li> To much government control!!!</li>
            <li> Within 2 days I could see a significant chnge in his eyes.</li>
            <li> In fact I believe in one week there were significant changes.</li>
            <li> This product is natural and works great for my dry and strained eyes at work, best eye drops i have used for overall eye health.</li>
            <li> Tobie has had marked clearing in the most efffected eye, and seems to be seeing a lot better.</li>
            <li> I like these drops - they go in easily and feel wonderful, and I believe they have improved my overall eye health and visual clarity.</li>
            <li> KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.PUT INTO SMALLER BOTTLES IN A CARRYING CASE FOR CONVINE OF USE.</li>
            <li> Good price - using daily but don&#x27;t know if they are having any effect.</li>
            <li> Peanuts wish come true.</li>
            <li> Delivery was done quickly and without any error.  </li>
            <li> quickly)....</li>
            <li> Her eye is very clear now and looks a lot better.</li>
            <li> After used these two drops, she thinks that CAN C makes her vision more improvement than Natural Ophthalmics.</li>
            <li> I take 2 a day as opposed to three times a day and feel that they are effective in overall eye health.</li>
            <li> definitely worth trying to avoid surgery.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> If she can see better/clearer, its worth it.  </li>
            <li> Worth it</li>
            <li> The shipment arrived right on time without any issues.  </li>
            <li> Her right eye</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with Native Remedies CataractClear for an eye flare up and when you can&#x27;t get to the ophthalmlogist right away.</li>
            <li> Worked right away for me.</li>
            <li> I am not yet sure whether this is helping my cataracts from developing further, but it feels good in my dry eyes.</li>
            <li> I began using the drops three times a day and now, only a month later, the cataract in my right eye is so much better, I can make out just about every kind of shape.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping,using 3-4 times daily on 10 y.o. shepherd.time will tell how effective it is</li>
            <li> seller ships very fast</li>
            <li> She thinks  her vision absolutely improved!</li>
            <li> and she thinks it is really work!</li>
            <li> After three weeks she tried another cataract drops (CAN C) to compare the result because I bought her different brand eye drops to decide which one is better.</li>
            <li> he is diabetic and is blind from cataracts,he is also my very best friend.  </li>
            <li> I just finished my first bottle of these homeopathic cataract eye drops.  </li>
            <li> bought the first bottle.</li>
            <li> Will order more product in the future.</li>
            <li> If it works I&#x27;ll gladly come back and update my post.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I am giving the gift of eyesight back to my dog.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I am giving the gift of eyesight back to my dog.  </li>
            <li> As I work on the computer daily, this has helped to see better</li>
            <li> When I first started using it, she had film and build up in her eye.</li>
            <li> so maybe it works better on younger dogs.</li>
            <li> but I thought I&#x27;d research eye drops, first.</li>
            <li> he kinda sees the trash can and the walls a bit better when i put him outside.</li>
            <li> It seems a lot of people have been helped with these eye drops, but unfortunately, I&#x27;m not one of them.  </li>
            <li> received my first bottle of these drops and applied two drops in one eye.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the earlier the drops are started when cataracts start to develop the better the results.  </li>
            <li> It has actually cleared up most of the cloudiness in my eyes.</li>
            <li> I stopped using them and  fortunately the bulging and super red irritation stopped about a week after discontinued use.</li>
            <li> I should add that the so called specialist was ready to put a toric lens in my right eye 3 weeks after the 1st surgery even though there is no astigmatism in that eye.  </li>
            <li> When I began, the cataract in my right eye was very opaque.</li>
            <li> There were so many positive reviews I was hoping for the same results.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had good luck with a different eye drop that I am currently using.</li>
            <li> I have only been using a month and really can&#x27;t tell if its working, but will continue because something is better than nothing at all.  </li>
            <li> within about 4 days he went to the vet for a check up,it was confirmed that rebel can now see from his right eye quite well, and his left eye,not so well.  </li>
            <li> I noted that a lot of the positive reviews were premature...</li>
            <li> Based on some positive reviews, I purchased this product with a bit of hope and used it for about a week.</li>
            <li> But today for the first time when I called him to eat he walk straight to his bowl.</li>
            <li> but I now see very clearly..with the first</li>
            <li> Our dog recently became diabetic and lost his vision very quickly.</li>
            <li> My 15 year old golden has started getting cataract, I have been using this and really see the difference in her eyes!</li>
            <li> When I began the drops, his eyes were gray (from the cataracts) and the original brown of his eyes was barely visible......</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it much..</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen much change for my elderly dog.  </li>
            <li> THERE WAS JUST NO DIFFERENCE BEFORE OR AFTER THE WHOLE BOTTLE WAS USED.</li>
            <li> This product really works.  </li>
            <li> The cineraria drops made my eyes feel really good/rested</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m convinced this was a reaction to the Can-C, not the cineraria which is very soothing.  </li>
            <li> Real improvement with his vision.</li>
            <li> Whole foods and Bilberry supplements.</li>
            <li> So my dogs eye was real cloudy and had really he couldn&#x27;t see even when I put food in front of him</li>
            <li> I have been using on my dog for a while, haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference, but I will keep using it.  </li>
            <li> Any ways, with her diabetes and cataracts, I have just been very concerned about the eyesight and well-being of my dog</li>
            <li> These drops work very well and have provided comfort for my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice much change in cataracts in my dog.</li>
            <li> And, he continues to so demonstrably ENJOY having the drops administered which is a double blessing.</li>
            <li> I had to discontinue these drops, because they irritated my eyes too much.  </li>
            <li> I find the drops to be very helpful.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> They really do work.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s be real, they are not--</li>
            <li> Absolutely.  </li>
            <li> The eye drops are very soothing when I use them.  </li>
            <li> Im very optimistic about it helping her cataracts though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth a try if your pet has recently developed cataracts.</li>
            <li> The cataract in my dog&#x27;s eye is much improved.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if they are really helping him.</li>
            <li> Thanks again for saving my life.</li>
            <li> They are very soothing and I will continue to use them.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do much for the cataract</li>
            <li> however I noticed it was very beneficial for healing and cleansing the cornea.</li>
            <li> Thanks arrived on time.couldn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Thanks thou</li>
            <li> Better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Very soothing for me and my dog.</li>
            <li> She checked his eyes again and informed me that he was able to see some (maybe near sighted or just shadows out of his left eye).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any news regarding how effective this product is yet , as I have only started on my 2nd bottle .&lt;br</li>
            <li> Each one of our dogs have their own personal dish in different sizes and colors.</li>
            <li> I gave her the drops for 2 weeks 2 times a day and WOW what a change!!!</li>
            <li> so she was only in familiar places.  </li>
            <li> but the expense was more than double this product for the exact same components.  </li>
            <li> My point is, I will try anything safe to avoid surgery in my other eye.  </li>
            <li> I gave her only one drop in each eye everyday for about 2 weeks and by the end of two weeks her eyes where crystal clear and beautiful.</li>
            <li> When I first received Natural Ophthalmis drops</li>
            <li> , anything more than 1 drop just ends up dribbling down his lil&#x27;</li>
            <li> she was shocked,and a little bit peeved,but we see it as a good thing,thank you all again  kath and mike and especially Rebel!</li>
            <li> Am arleady noticing more clarity and less straining in my vision.</li>
            <li> If it would have worked even half as well as it was described, I would gladly pay the price and re-order as needed.</li>
            <li> (Less is better with homeopathic remedies).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my eyes, though to be fair, I had trouble making a habit of putting them in regularly.</li>
            <li> His lenses looked like red opals, and his sight was diminishing quickly.</li>
            <li> I will buy the product since I did see quite a few good reviews on animals but not enough on people but will write my review after giving it ample time.  </li>
            <li> so pleased as there wasn&#x27;t much traditional western medicine could do for my dog.  </li>
            <li> Since there are a few people stating it is working for them and their pets, that&#x27;s good enough for me.  </li>
            <li> Less than a week after putting the first application into his eyes I noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews, and had high hopes with this product, but it didn&#x27;t seem to help my dog any.</li>
            <li> Why this high price on Cataract Care?  </li>
            <li> I recommend them to my highly to my friends</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I need a little more time</li>
            <li> Will see what happens in a few more weeks.</li>
            <li> Dallas has loved this game ever since she was a puppy</li>
            <li> But i must admit i was expecting a lkittle more than the very slight change i saw.</li>
            <li> My holistic Vet prescribed these drops for my 12 year old poodle - these are they exact same drops and much cheaper than the Vet&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> is it, where did it go, lemme at it&amp;#34; trooper to 3) a resigned, depressed shell of her old self only casually interested in much anything.  </li>
            <li> I cannot say much about this product yet because I am still waiting to see more results, but over a period of time it does help with small (newly developed) cataract.</li>
            <li> I still will have his eyes checked with my new vet</li>
            <li> Also, I went to a new eye doctor.</li>
            <li> so far feel better after a few days</li>
            <li> Other than that, I would like to say that I&#x27;m a great believer in natural healing products, and have definitely noticed benefits from other products.</li>
            <li> And I too thought I was too young for these!</li>
            <li> I have noticed a significant difference, especially in her one eye where the cataract covered her entire iris.  </li>
            <li> this is your all natural pet product!</li>
            <li> it works my dogs eyes have improved they look much better and darker than before no more ghost looking eyes .</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I am thrilled!</li>
            <li> To be fair, I&#x27;m a very sensitive type of person and things do effect me differently than most, but experiencing this sudden and scary change in my vision was enough for me to stop using the drops.</li>
            <li> Perhaps my eye was not bad enough when I started using them initially for me to notice an improvement, or perhaps using them in conjunction with the Can-C</li>
            <li> He is walking better with hardly any accidents.</li>
            <li> After just a few days of using these drops we saw a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> Wear contacts around the clock to see clearly.</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of use, there is amazing improvement - his vision is slowly returning, and he is obviously &#x27;looking&#x27; at things again.</li>
            <li> This product really works for my 12 yr old German Shepherd girl.</li>
            <li> We hoped these eye drops would help clear up his cataracts but nothing happened.</li>
            <li> My eyes are getting clear and clear every day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed that I can see so clearly.  </li>
            <li> My dogs eyes have started to clear</li>
            <li> Too early to tell.</li>
            <li> At this point it&#x27;s too early to tell if Natural Ophthalmics is working or not.</li>
            <li> So she returned to the Natural Ophthalmics again.</li>
            <li> I have a 9 year old Mini Schnauzer that has contracted Diabetes.</li>
            <li> So far, no response.</li>
            <li> My puppy developed cataracts within a matter of weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing and using this on my elderly dog (who is 14 years old).  </li>
            <li> My 11 year old dog has had diabetes since she was 7.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to help my baby out, and was especially concerned</li>
            <li> My 16 1/2 year old toy poodle has a severe case of cataracts.</li>
            <li> I purchased these eye drops for my almost 12 years old Border Collie dog.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m told it should go away in 6 to 12 months at least for most people.  </li>
            <li> but so far I&#x27;m not in the &amp;#34;most&#x27; catagory.  </li>
            <li> cataracts\\&quot;) for nearly 2.5 mos.</li>
            <li> and he comes at a near gallop, tail wagging.</li>
            <li> IT IS ALSO A NATURAL PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> her vision is far from 100%.  </li>
            <li> So far, My vision hasn&#x27;t improved, However, My eyes often burn &amp; this relieves the burning..</li>
            <li> will recommend it completely</li>
            <li> This was purchased for the treatment of cataracts that had developed in a cat and a dog.  </li>
            <li> and it is natural to the body.</li>
            <li> Thanks for inventing such miracle product.</li>
            <li> Thank you for a natural solution for cataracts, which I have a start of it.  </li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, well packaged and delivered directly to my door.</li>
            <li> I began using the Natural Ophthalmics drops with Cineraria about a month ago.</li>
            <li> I want to buy this product but have to admit many reviews are basing their results on only a few weeks or a month of usage.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming it got worse since I could not treat it with warm compresses for a month.</li>
            <li> Have only been using for a short time, but my friend&#x27;s 14 year old poodle is beginning to show slight improvement in one of his eyes and is behaving as if he sees more clearly.  </li>
            <li> Whereas previously If the ball wandered more than 10 degrees off axis from where she was headed, she would lose sight of it, then lose interest; but now she not only tracks the ball with 90% accuracy, she also chases it further, longer, and exhausts herself in a way I haven&#x27;t seen in over a year--</li>
            <li> I am only left with a slight amount of clouding that I am sure will disappear with continued use.</li>
            <li> I am a Naturopath; Master Herbalist and C. Nutritionist... 3 months is usually the magic number of regular prescribed use.  </li>
            <li> And my floaters are getting smaller with only first drop.</li>
            <li> Whereas his bad eye was quite white in color due to the cataract which came on SO suddenly, the color has changed significantly and is now more of a light blue depending under direct light -- in fact, his dark brown eyes actually look normal depending on the angle/lighting.</li>
            <li> She could have become completely blind and suffered more pain if I didn&#x27;t seek medical attention right away.  </li>
            <li> My 12 year old Labrador mix developed cataracts several years ago.</li>
            <li> his eye drops 3x a day...and the nearly opaque white cataract is nearly GONE.</li>
            <li> Actually worked on my 15 year old springer!</li>
            <li> I definitely experienced clearer vision cataract is still there just not as bad</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice any change from when I was using Cataract  Care by Similasan.  </li>
            <li> I used a similar product to help clear a cataract on one of my pugs.</li>
            <li> After 2 days of me noticing the Cloudiness in his eye lense, he was completely blinded in his left eye.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> By the way I gave him her left overs of the old bottle he has cataracts and wanted to try it...</li>
            <li> She now has that old sparkle back.  </li>
            <li> I have been using these eyedrops daily for nearly a year.  </li>
            <li> The first day my vision seemed clearer, the second day I didn&#x27;t notice anything, but the third day my left eye&#x27;s vision broke up into dozens of light fractals (like broken mirror pieces) to the degree</li>
            <li> It does help a little, better than expected, but not near as well as I hoped.</li>
            <li> One eye has a very noticeable cataract and the other has one beginning to form.</li>
            <li> I have the beginnings of cataracts and my aunt used this for a long time for the same purpose and highly recommended them for me.</li>
            <li> Again, My personal advice when dealing with such matters would seek the professional advice of a specialist.</li>
            <li> Also She does not wipe her eyes as much when it goes from really dark to us turning the lights</li>
            <li> Been using these for several years and my opthamologist says my cataracts have barely budged in that time.</li>
            <li> Well, I finally had cataract surgery on one eye, next month the other eye, so I can&#x27;t really grade this.</li>
            <li> I do not know if they are helping with my cataracts since I don&#x27;t go back to the ophthalmologist until April,but they are very cool and soothing to my eyes, especially since I am also using prescription drops which can be irritating.</li>
            <li> and I certainly hope so because it has given me hope Thani won&#x27;t need to shell out a few thousand for surgery for her.</li>
            <li> Our furry little one has all the problems that puppy mills create from the lack of teeth to crippled back legs and now she has developed old age cataracts.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this for our 15 year old Australian shepherd/border collie who was losing his vision due to cataracts.  </li>
            <li> , his other eye was developing a cataract too (as indicated in my earlier review, this condition developed SO</li>
            <li> This product was highly recommended and a little cheaper, so I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> perhaps I haven&#x27;t used it long enough...</li>
            <li> no apparent side effects in either pet.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product long enough to see a god response.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen no effect good or bad other than the soothing effect you get with regular eyedrops.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have bought a lot of different eye drops because I have dry eyes.</li>
            <li> After a few months on the Can-C and cineraria drops, the skin around my eyes became red, itchy and sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I was so sad thinking that we had to live with that and specially because he was so active before that.</li>
            <li> Our dog&#x27;s eyes were getting really cloudy and dull, and she clearly was having trouble seeing things.  </li>
            <li> Recommended by vet; I forget 2x a day so unable to accurately evaluate.</li>
            <li> When I took him to the vet for a free health exam, after adopting him from a shelter, the vet didn&#x27;t see anything wrong with my dog&#x27;s eyes.</li>
            <li> I was diagnosed with a small cataract last year and immediately started using both Can-C and Natural Ophthalmics Cineraria drops.  </li>
            <li> her cataracts would make her totally blind, so I did some internet searching and came across more expensive products with mixed reviews, and saw this product was much cheaper, and also had mixed reviews.  </li>
            <li> There is a tiny spot of cataracts in the center of his eye, but nothing like before....</li>
            <li> MAYBE BECAUSE I WAITED TO LONG TO USE IT.</li>
            <li> So, as long as it seems to be helping, I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I phoned the company &amp; they do say you must give it 9 months as it took a long time to develop the cataract &amp; will take time to get rid of it.  </li>
            <li> My dog has had tear stains for a long time.</li>
            <li> There were a couple of grey areas on the cornea as well.</li>
            <li> but we have a long ways to go.</li>
            <li> After only 3 weeks the yellow is all gone and my vision is now slightly cloudy once in while and fading day by day.</li>
            <li> After the first few times I used it I began to notice irritation of my eyes, the feeling that something foreign was in my eyes, and slightly blurry vision.</li>
            <li> Give it a try, it&#x27;s affordable and lasts a long time!  </li>
            <li> My neighbor of 12 years stopped me the other day and actually commented on Dallas&#x27; behavior.</li>
            <li> Seemed to irritate my dogs eyes briefly but other than that saw no reduction in the cataract.</li>
            <li> That eye looks perfect plus I&#x27;ve tested his bad eye and can tell he has vision whereas the vet had pronounced him blind in that eye.</li>
            <li> and they are not as dry.</li>
            <li> After about 2 months of use,my eyes no longer burn or feel dry.</li>
            <li> &gt; The drops weren&#x27;t soothing and seemed to dry my eyes even further&lt;br /&gt;than</li>
            <li> The drops did not live up to my expectations.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The past couple years she has developed cataracts, and the past 6 months they have gotten larger, to the point that she can barely see.  </li>
            <li> you very much for giving my dog her game back!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 5-1-13</li>
            <li> Im not sure if it helped too much, but there may be a slight difference in her sight.</li>
            <li> My 5 1/2 year old dog was diagnosed with Juvenile Cataracts.</li>
            <li> old toy poodle with \\&quot;juvenile</li>
            <li> It was about half the cost of similar products.</li>
            <li> I have not had my dog back to the vets since I started to use these drops but I will say her eyes look a little clearer</li>
            <li> But what convinced my husband and I that this little bottle actually worked.</li>
            <li> and I could see all the little letters and numbers, unlike last time.</li>
            <li> Disappointing but cheap eye drops.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that it will last forever, but at least I can still drive and it&#x27;s kept me going since my last surgery.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is almost empty, with no visible difference since I started using it.</li>
            <li> It is a total waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I ordered these eye drops and it came as expected and on time.</li>
            <li> I was perfectly careful not to touch the tip to my dog&#x27;s eye or area or to anything else.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The center of my field of vision was so cloudy</li>
            <li> She has only been using them a few weeks, so no real improvement in the cataracts.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my 13 year old 17 pound Holy Wire Terrier mix, and as she began slowly losing her vision, I watched her go from being a 1) lifelong</li>
            <li> #60;$20--I was certainly not about to shell out $3k+ for cataract surgery</li>
            <li> This may sound crazy but I suffer with blurry vision in one eye due to medication/steroids prescribed by my doctors.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After a week and a half, the grey area is gone and the pigment is fading as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are other alternatives like Wheatgrass @</li>
            <li> I stopped using the other product all together and depended on using this product solely.</li>
            <li> It was uveitis, and her vet said it was caused by her body attacking the cataracts as a foreign invader.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple of weeks and if the components do what the other brand say they are supposed to then this is working just as well as the brand name did.  </li>
            <li> I bought the item for my dog as his eyes have deteriorated recently due to cataracts in both eyes.</li>
            <li> when theese drops run out i am buying the other ones.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for my dog as well as other products I&#x27;ve bought</li>
            <li> This has improved my vision, as I have to wait to get my cataracts removed due to diabetes in the eyes.  </li>
            <li> was very careful about that</li>
            <li> Bottle over half empty and cannot discern any benefit.</li>
            <li> stated that my cataracts had not progressed any in the past year and a half since I had seen him last.  </li>
            <li> Along with that, my vision had changed very little which had not been the case the last few visits.  </li>
            <li> The day after surgery I could see a dark arc in my peripherol vision which is called &amp;#34;negative dysphotopsias&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> At least it&#x27;s only one eye.</li>
            <li> My doxie is 9, This is his 3rd bottle, it seems to slowly reverse the cataracts, but if you stop, they progress again.</li>
            <li> He said I had early cataracts that may or may not get worse.</li>
            <li> At one point, she had a problem going up and down the stairs</li>
            <li> I actually didnt mean to buy theese drops</li>
            <li> I could only see a very small circle in my peripheral vision.</li>
            <li> My dog is diabetic and has cataracts, I started using these less than a month and her vision already is improving</li>
            <li> No more running into things and no more listening for the ball to hit the floor, she is starting to catch her treats we throw at her</li>
            <li> Her eyes are clearer and brighter and she&#x27;s flinching half as much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I swear, her eyes appear less foggy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unbelievable, I just keep looking at things and reading distant signs.  </li>
            <li> Dogs can live happily blind.</li>
            <li> it help a little bit.</li>
            <li> They worked a little i guess.</li>
            <li> i think they are help a little bit.</li>
            <li> I recommend the anyone who has a furry little baby and he or she has cataracts to purchase these eye drops.</li>
            <li> After having Lasik surgery 10 years ago, I was not excited to have another surgery on my eyes, I saw the reviews and took a chance.</li>
            <li> I will continue to add drops but it comes down to hope and faith that this stuff has some beneficial effect!</li>
            <li> Am now cutting back to once daily.</li>
            <li> Instant relief for tired eyes.</li>
            <li> Initially, I saw no difference in my cataract which was getting progressively worse.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on these drops.</li>
            <li> This is a follow up posting from a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> Did not seem to help, and he actually seemed like he was seeing worse after using these drops.</li>
            <li> it has been a few weeks of putting them in his eyes.</li>
            <li> The left eye is also clearing, but it was worse.  </li>
            <li> I do have cataracts, it may take a few bottles.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months and also bought the pellets.  </li>
            <li> , I usually get the Eye drops in a few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I desperately hoped this would help my 13 old Maltese but her cataract has only gotten worse.  </li>
            <li> Increasingly, the brown color has been returning, and it&#x27;s just like there&#x27;s a slight film (almost like a dull Saran Wrap covering) on that eye now --</li>
            <li> Of course, this product is being used in conjunction with raw honey drops.</li>
            <li> I also have blepharitis &amp; dry eye which got worse after the surgery.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to follow instructions, you won&#x27;t be sorry!!!</li>
            <li> My dog developed cataracts due to diabetes, and despite being at 50% maturity, they are now rated at 30% maturity according to my Vet who was shocked at how well these have worked on him.</li>
            <li> Not sure if they are helping or not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what was wrong with my dogs eyes, but problem has not come back while using this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure...</li>
            <li> I have noticed in the past week that she isn&#x27;t so skiddish around people because she can see them now.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed in the past week that she isn&#x27;t so skiddish around people because she can see them now.  </li>
            <li> I played with her again this past weekend</li>
            <li> no more tear stains.</li>
            <li> My pets seem to like it, but I am not sure if it is helping their pre-cataract stage.</li>
            <li> We have used one bottle usually giving the drops twice per day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure.  </li>
            <li> I had lasik surgery and subsequently have been getting worse and worse cataracts.  </li>
            <li> These are for my dog, so hard for me to rate.  </li>
            <li> I plan to continue using them twice per day at least until April.</li>
            <li> and I was minimally hoping I could keep him from going totally blind.</li>
            <li> That was a yr ago, at this time I notice if I don&#x27;t give her once a day drops at least 3 times a week her eyes will start to cloud up.</li>
            <li> But they do at least help?  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say anything negative about this product;</li>
            <li> I get them in his eyes at least once a day, but try for twice.</li>
            <li> I am going to have to order the pills as this is next to impossible to get into my rottweilers eyes.</li>
            <li> Our 15 yo lab has cataracts to bad her eyes were white.  </li>
            <li> You can hardly tell the spot in my vision was there!</li>
            <li> recent bottle makes me disappointed.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s working but very slowly</li>
            <li> Like the incurable cancer victim in desperate search of some miracle, I decided what the heck, I&#x27;ll gamble the &amp;</li>
            <li> the cataracts and my vision have gotten worse.  </li>
            <li> So, neither the manufacturer or the seller will stand behind this product.</li>
            <li> As my dogs cataracts got worse and her brown eyes would become a bluish/grayish haze, I would think of that song by Crystal Gale, &amp;#34;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> and my eyes are not as tired at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> Over time, his eye sight seems to be getting poor and he squints a lot in the sun.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know what the science is behind it but hope it continues.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t seem to be getting worse, so perhaps they are helping.  </li>
            <li> Time will tell and I am hopeful for my little furry one that it does work as she has had all the bad luck this world can give</li>
            <li> AT the time of diagnosis, she said he&#x27;d lost sight in the bad eye, but I test him from time to time and it&#x27;s obvious he CAN see out of his bad eye.</li>
            <li> unbelievable !!!</li>
            <li> i was skeptical about this product, after all, it is for eyes and furthermore my dog&#x27;s eyes.  </li>
            <li> Would he still be as blind as he is or are these drops helping?</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, there has been no change after month one.</li>
            <li> it make my brown eyes blue,&amp;#34; and get sad.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my dog ( a cocker spaniel) who has progressive cataracts and was almost blind, he couldn&#x27;t find people or even his food</li>
            <li> Poor package!  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, those are just claims.</li>
            <li> had one of my yorkies 15 became blind..</li>
            <li> So before when it was feeding time he would always to the wrong dishor go awsy grom his feeding area.</li>
            <li> , it was so scary to think this could have just kept me from reading books,watching TV.</li>
            <li> but it is expensive</li>
            <li> and I hated she could not play anymore without getting frustrated and laying down.  </li>
            <li> Extremely disappointing experience, all the way around.  </li>
            <li> (sorry, Haley!).  </li>
            <li> Very difficult to answer as I have no clinical results or tests that prove it works or does not work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update, I think the Batch or Lot of the Cineraria Eye Drops has gone bad.</li>
            <li> I felt so bad started looking for something that may help..</li>
            <li> I told him about this product and he was shocked.</li>
            <li> a frustrated, &amp;#34;where</li>
            <li> Without these eyedrops, I have terrible symptoms from cataracts, itching, dryness, multicolored circles, etc.</li>

            <li> My dog developed cataracts due to diabetes, and despite being at 50% maturity, they are now rated at 30% maturity according to my Vet who was shocked at how well these have worked on him. In a dog with diabetes, this is remarkable! I will keep using these.</li>
            <li> this works excellent for cataracts I will recommend it</li>
            <li> The shipment arrived right on time without any issues.  Have only been using for a short time, but my friend&#x27;s 14 year old poodle is beginning to show slight improvement in one of his eyes and is behaving as if he sees more clearly.  Happy for any improvement!</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve had cataracts,  I&#x27;ve been using this and it seems to be working.  I don&#x27;t know that it will last forever, but at least I can still drive and it&#x27;s kept me going since my last surgery.  Hopefully, it will prevent future surgery.</li>
            <li> Have started using this a week ago. Too early to tell. Feels fine in my eyes. No burning.</li>
            <li> Works great! Will be purchasing more</li>
            <li> I carried out my own six month trial and made a video of the effects http://m.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;L2LxQZbfh5g</li>
            <li> These drops are working better than Refresh Optive.  But I still need to get cataract surgery.</li>
            <li> Clears my eyes.. Don&#x27;t use it much..</li>
            <li> The bottle is almost empty, with no visible difference since I started using it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me but maybe will for others.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my eyes, though to be fair, I had trouble making a habit of putting them in regularly.</li>
            <li> I do not believe this product helps cataracts.....I do Not recommend buying it 5/5/15</li>
            <li> At this point it&#x27;s too early to tell if Natural Ophthalmics is working or not. Ask me in 6 months.</li>
            <li> I am not yet sure whether this is helping my cataracts from developing further, but it feels good in my dry eyes.</li>
            <li> Bought this eyedrops for my Mom. She is very satisfied with it. She thinks  her vision absolutely improved! Good eyedrops !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: My Mom used this drops for 3 week and she thinks it is really work! After three weeks she tried another cataract drops (CAN C) to compare the result because I bought her different brand eye drops to decide which one is better. After used these two drops, she thinks that CAN C makes her vision more improvement than Natural Ophthalmics. But the only matter about CAN C is she feels headache after used it. So she returned to the Natural Ophthalmics again.</li>
            <li> It did not get rid of the cataract but it did controll them But I have not used it like it mention  too</li>
            <li> i was skeptical about this product, after all, it is for eyes and furthermore my dog&#x27;s eyes.  he is diabetic and is blind from cataracts,he is also my very best friend.  i bought the product,and started using it on Rebel,..within about 4 days he went to the vet for a check up,it was confirmed that rebel can now see from his right eye quite well, and his left eye,not so well.  we are so grateful to you all, our dog can now see the stairs/walls and doors again,and even us ( his mom and dad)even if only in shadow.  he even took a toy away from his younger sister today...she was shocked,and a little bit peeved,but we see it as a good thing,thank you all again  kath and mike and especially Rebel!</li>
            <li> My 12 year old Labrador mix developed cataracts several years ago. When I began the drops, his eyes were gray (from the cataracts) and the original brown of his eyes was barely visible......after about a year of use his eyes are brown again![[ASIN:B001J5X6L0 Similasan Cataract Care Eye Drops, .33 Ounce Bottle]] There is a tiny spot of cataracts in the center of his eye, but nothing like before....I LOVE this product and will continue to use it on my dogs.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen much change for my elderly dog.  Maybe not using it&lt;br /&gt;correctly.  Will see what happens in a few more weeks.</li>
            <li> I have been using the drops for 2 months now going on 3 and I have no change - in fact the cataracts and my vision have gotten worse.  I am continuing... hope against hope.  I noted that a lot of the positive reviews were premature... the people had just started the product and were already reviewing.  Misleading.  I am a Naturopath; Master Herbalist and C. Nutritionist... 3 months is usually the magic number of regular prescribed use.  So I am still hoping but it is looking like I am heading for surgery.  The M.D.&#x27;s all say these drops do not work on humans... at lest the 3 I have personally talked to.  Still hoping.  Will update if some positive changes take place that I can honestly accredit to the drops.  And I too thought I was too young for these!</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT DID ABSOLUTLY NOTHING..MAYBE BECAUSE I WAITED TO LONG TO USE IT. THERE WAS JUST NO DIFFERENCE BEFORE OR AFTER THE WHOLE BOTTLE WAS USED.</li>
            <li> fast shipping good product</li>
            <li> Works great I definitely experienced clearer vision cataract is still there just not as bad</li>
            <li> I have a 9 year old Mini Schnauzer that has contracted Diabetes. Over a period of about 3 months we noticed that he was also getting cataracts. For about 5 months i have been putting these drops in his eyes. He has gotten blinder by the month. Still adding these drops. Not sure if they are helping or not. Would he still be as blind as he is or are these drops helping? Very difficult to answer as I have no clinical results or tests that prove it works or does not work. I will continue to add drops but it comes down to hope and faith that this stuff has some beneficial effect!</li>
            <li> No results at this time, will update if I see changes.</li>
            <li> My dog is diabetic and has cataracts, I started using these less than a month and her vision already is improving</li>
            <li> I purchased this for our 15 year old Australian shepherd/border collie who was losing his vision due to cataracts.  This product really works.  It seems to have dissolved the film that was growing so prominent.  Way better than the trama &amp; expense of surgery  and he can see much better now.  Amazing!</li>
            <li> I just finished my first bottle of these homeopathic cataract eye drops.  I do not know if they are helping with my cataracts since I don&#x27;t go back to the ophthalmologist until April,but they are very cool and soothing to my eyes, especially since I am also using prescription drops which can be irritating. I plan to continue using them twice per day at least until April.</li>
            <li> Based on some positive reviews, I purchased this product with a bit of hope and used it for about a week. After the first few times I used it I began to notice irritation of my eyes, the feeling that something foreign was in my eyes, and slightly blurry vision. I tried lowering the dosage from the maximum recommended two drops to one drop per eye but the problem persisted.  Here is the warning on the product which is not shown as part of the product image or mentioned in the description:  &amp;#34;If you experience eye pain, changes in vision, continued redness or irritation of the eye or if the condition worsens or persists for more than 72 hours, discontinue use and see a doctor.&amp;#34;  I contacted the seller (Grounds for Tea) to request a refund. The seller stated that their return policy only allows for unopened/unused products and that I should contact the manufacturer, which I did. So far, no response. It now appears that I am out a chunk of money for a product that I can&#x27;t use.  Extremely disappointing experience, all the way around.  *** UPDATE 5/30/15 *** No response from manufacturer. So, neither the manufacturer or the seller will stand behind this product.</li>
            <li> I STARTED USING THE DROPS A WEEK AGO SO I&#x27;M WAITING TO SEE THE RESULTS-SEEMS SOOTHING TO MY EYES- TIME WILL TELL&amp; RETURN CHECK UP W/ MY EYE DOC.</li>
            <li> Purchased these for my dog who has Cataracts in both eyes, at first she couldn&#x27;t see and was bumping into every things, but since I &#x27;ve  been using this eye drops, her sight has becoming a lot better, I would recommend these drops for anyone dog who is suffering from Cataracts. Good by for the money, since the Vets wants almost $40000 dollars for surgery.</li>
            <li> Instant relief for tired eyes. Can&#x27;t say if they are fending off the cataracts but I feel that if any OTC product will help , than I am all in. I take 2 a day as opposed to three times a day and feel that they are effective in overall eye health.</li>
            <li> I was diagnosed with a small cataract last year and immediately started using both Can-C and Natural Ophthalmics Cineraria drops.  The cineraria drops made my eyes feel really good/rested and they looked clearer.  Initially, I saw no difference in my cataract which was getting progressively worse.  After a few months on the Can-C and cineraria drops, the skin around my eyes became red, itchy and sensitive.  I&#x27;m convinced this was a reaction to the Can-C, not the cineraria which is very soothing.  But, I did stop using both for several months, all the time noticing decreasing vision in the eye with the cataract.  Just a couple of weeks ago I started using the cineraria drops again all by themselves and the results have been miraculous.  My vision has improved dramatically -- would not have believed it possible in such a short period of time.  I will definitely continue to use these drops.  Perhaps my eye was not bad enough when I started using them initially for me to notice an improvement, or perhaps using them in conjunction with the Can-C somehow reduced their effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Maltese eyes after 2 weeks of treatment became infected and red.  Had to go to Vet to get antibiotics for his eyes.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews for this product, and the reviews looked good, so I bought a bottle for my labrador retrievers eye. It made my dogs eye even cloudier! I threw it in the garbage. I would not recommend this stuff!</li>
            <li> Caused increased glare fron lights.</li>
            <li> Actually worked on my 15 year old springer! Real improvement with his vision. It was about half the cost of similar products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what was wrong with my dogs eyes, but problem has not come back while using this product.</li>
            <li> Im not sure if it helped too much, but there may be a slight difference in her sight.</li>
            <li> This product is natural and works great for my dry and strained eyes at work, best eye drops i have used for overall eye health.</li>
            <li> There were so many positive reviews I was hoping for the same results.  Unfortunately, there has been no change after month one.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews, and had high hopes with this product, but it didn&#x27;t seem to help my dog any.</li>
            <li> I have baby cataracts. Wear contacts around the clock to see clearly. Over the years I have bought a lot of different eye drops because I have dry eyes. Having cataracts developing made me buy this product as it seemed awesome.... But I was wishful thinking as it was not that great. I give this product a &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; -it is over priced at what it claims to do for  human eyes. All you ppls ranting about it, I say more power to you, literally! But for me, I will stick with these 2 awesome products. My best find yet is a 10$ bottle of Thera-Tears! If you want super comfortable contacts try Bausch &amp; Lombs Ultra!</li>
            <li> I have been holding back a cataract for several years now with these herbal drops.. definitely worth trying to avoid surgery.</li>
            <li> NEEDED PRODUCT&lt;br /&gt;GOOD PRICE FOR  QUALITY PRODUCT. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.PUT INTO SMALLER BOTTLES IN A CARRYING CASE FOR CONVINE OF USE. AVOID EYE SURGERGY.</li>
            <li> My puppy developed cataracts within a matter of weeks. After 2 days of me noticing the Cloudiness in his eye lense, he was completely blinded in his left eye.&lt;br /&gt;I tried to get him to follow my hand by covering his good eye and he couldn&#x27;t see at all : (&lt;br /&gt;I looked up homeopathic remedies vs. $5,000 for cataract surgery.&lt;br /&gt;I bought the first bottle. Within 2 months of 2 times daily use, he could see shadows with his left eye.&lt;br /&gt;I took him back to his Vet. She checked his eyes again and informed me that he was able to see some (maybe near sighted or just shadows out of his left eye). He&#x27;s able to follow movement with both eyes now. : )&lt;br /&gt;It does take a while. I&#x27;m just thankful he can see again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller ships very fast, I usually get the Eye drops in a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ^ - ^&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, I think the Batch or Lot of the Cineraria Eye Drops has gone bad. This is my 4th bottle and this time it made my dogs lens cloud even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other alternatives like Wheatgrass @ Whole foods and Bilberry supplements. They help reduce Lens cloudiness and Bilberry tastes good, so your dog shouldn&#x27;t mind it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This recent bottle makes me disappointed.</li>
            <li> I took these eye droos  for my cataract and they did nothing.  Disappointing but cheap eye drops.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on these drops.</li>
            <li> It is a total waste of money.  Drops cannot correct or imrove cataracts.  Therefore, this product does nothing but lighten your wallet.</li>
            <li> My holistic Vet prescribed these drops for my 12 year old poodle - these are they exact same drops and much cheaper than the Vet&#x27;s.  I can&#x27;t tell if they are helping him yet, but he doesn&#x27;t mind them.</li>
            <li> So my dogs eye was real cloudy and had really he couldn&#x27;t see even when I put food in front of him he couldn&#x27;t see but since I been using this 3x a day and it&#x27;s only been about 3-4 days now and I am so impressed with the results so far and I glad I found this and got it I also used it with he drops for red eyes and eye wash and this was a extra booster and it did a miracle to my dogs eye :-)</li>
            <li> I have been using on my dog for a while, haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference, but I will keep using it.  I would rather try something than nothing.</li>
            <li> I combined this with another care produce and the results were no different. I stopped using the other product all together and depended on using this product solely. I noticed a reduction in the results that were happening before with another care product and  my personal conclusion with using this, I disagree, that this product helped in my situation in any way. Again, My personal advice when dealing with such matters would seek the professional advice of a specialist. if you don&#x27;t, It may help you? It may not!</li>
            <li> Without these eyedrops, I have terrible symptoms from cataracts, itching, dryness, multicolored circles, etc. Thank you so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kathleen Fisher</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know how to rate this product, because it&#x27;s one that would have to be used for quite some time before results would be seen. I&#x27;m seeing an eye doctor within three or four months, and will ask if he notices any changes. At that time, I&#x27;ll post in again. Other than that, I would like to say that I&#x27;m a great believer in natural healing products, and have definitely noticed benefits from other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing and using this on my elderly dog (who is 14 years old).  It seems to be helping him.  So, as long as it seems to be helping, I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
            <li> It is soothing but it did nothing for my cataracts.</li>
            <li> Product is soothing to my eyes and I&#x27;m noticing  a gradual improvement in my vision. Will order more product in the future.</li>
            <li> I have not had my dog back to the vets since I started to use these drops but I will say her eyes look a little clearer and they are not as dry. She doesn&#x27;t seem to mind me putting them in her eyes and I actually think she finds it soothing.  She doesn&#x27;t fight me at all when it is eye drop time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure...as with everyone else I want it to work. I&#x27;ve seen no effect good or bad other than the soothing effect you get with regular eyedrops. If it works I&#x27;ll gladly come back and update my post.</li>
            <li> My 11 year old dog has had diabetes since she was 7.  The past couple years she has developed cataracts, and the past 6 months they have gotten larger, to the point that she can barely see.  I had to stop taking her out on walks at night because she became too frightened, and I had to keep her on a regular routine so she was only in familiar places.  I really wanted to help my baby out, and was especially concerned her cataracts would make her totally blind, so I did some internet searching and came across more expensive products with mixed reviews, and saw this product was much cheaper, and also had mixed reviews.  I thought I would give it a try.  Maybe if anything, it would soothe her eyes and make them feel better.  She has had 2 emergency trips to the vet for a condition that caused her eyes to turn a cloudy gray over her entire eyes and really red where the whites of her eyes are.  It was uveitis, and her vet said it was caused by her body attacking the cataracts as a foreign invader.  She could have become completely blind and suffered more pain if I didn&#x27;t seek medical attention right away.  Any ways, with her diabetes and cataracts, I have just been very concerned about the eyesight and well-being of my dog so I thought for the price I&#x27;d give this a try.  The directions say to use the drops 3 times a day.  I&#x27;ve only been putting them in her eyes 1-2 times, and as I write this review, it&#x27;s only been 3 weeks that I&#x27;ve been using this product.  HOLY SCHMOLY!!!!  I have noticed a significant difference, especially in her one eye where the cataract covered her entire iris.  I can see her brown eyes again!  As my dogs cataracts got worse and her brown eyes would become a bluish/grayish haze, I would think of that song by Crystal Gale, &amp;#34;Don&#x27;t it make my brown eyes blue,&amp;#34; and get sad.  Now I&#x27;m grateful to see the reverse affect after 3 weeks and can&#x27;t wait to see more results!  definitely going to keep using this.  Give it a try, it&#x27;s affordable and lasts a long time!  I&#x27;m so glad I am giving the gift of eyesight back to my dog.  I have noticed in the past week that she isn&#x27;t so skiddish around people because she can see them now.  Thank you!!!long time!  I&#x27;m so glad I am giving the gift of eyesight back to my dog.  I have noticed in the past week that she isn&#x27;t so skiddish around people because she can see them now.  Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> I like these drops - they go in easily and feel wonderful, and I believe they have improved my overall eye health and visual clarity.</li>
            <li> The eye drops work very good.  Helps me to see clearer.  As I work on the computer daily, this has helped to see better and my eyes are not as tired at the end of the day.  It is safe to use and I recommend it for anyone who is dealing with a cataract.</li>
            <li> This is a follow up posting from a few weeks ago.  I then stated that I had read to use the drops for 9 months continually and I was at 6 months and planned to continue.  Well, I went in for an eye exam and my therapeutic optometrist stated that my cataracts had not progressed any in the past year and a half since I had seen him last.  I did not tell him about the drops...didn&#x27;t know if he was open to the idea.  But for now, I am going to keep using them because for me, it is a very good sign that they had not progressed at all!  Along with that, my vision had changed very little which had not been the case the last few visits.  It just seems hopeful to me, that a product that has been used for a 100 years or more, might have something going for it!  Hoping for a healing!  :-)</li>
            <li> it help a little bit.</li>
            <li> My 5 1/2 year old dog was diagnosed with Juvenile Cataracts. His lenses looked like red opals, and his sight was diminishing quickly. He was hurting himself bumping into things. After 2 weeks of use, there is amazing improvement - his vision is slowly returning, and he is obviously &#x27;looking&#x27; at things again. I believe his sight will be fully restored using this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dog ( a cocker spaniel) who has progressive cataracts and was almost blind, he couldn&#x27;t find people or even his food and he crashed with the walls and stuff. I was so sad thinking that we had to live with that and specially because he was so active before that. I tried this because I read the reviews, we apply it on him 2 times at day, and now my dog runs,  he didn&#x27;t crash anymore, he find everything. All this with just with one bottle, we are trying the second now and I hope he get even better. I totally recomend this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 4weeks and still no change in my dogs eyes. I will keep trying I so want her to see better</li>
            <li> I enjoy using these eye drops each day. This product was recommended to me by my doctor and I am enjoying it.</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice any change from when I was using Cataract  Care by Similasan.  Why this high price on Cataract Care?  I use to buy it in the drug stores for 8 to 10 dollars.  Then it just vanished from all stores and Amazon was the only place I could find it, but then the price kept going up.  I think FDA became involved and didn&#x27;t want people to buy it because it worked and the doctors lost business.  To much government control!!!</li>
            <li> These drops work very well and have provided comfort for my eyes.  Delivery was done quickly and without any error.  This is a good product and and a good company.</li>
            <li> Have only been using the pellets and eye drops for about 2.5 weeks. Am arleady noticing more clarity and less straining in my vision. Will continue the treatment til next check up.</li>
            <li> Our furry little one has all the problems that puppy mills create from the lack of teeth to crippled back legs and now she has developed old age cataracts.  I started using another brand name drop and found it helped some but the expense was more than double this product for the exact same components.  I have been using this for a couple of weeks and if the components do what the other brand say they are supposed to then this is working just as well as the brand name did.  Time will tell and I am hopeful for my little furry one that it does work as she has had all the bad luck this world can give but she still loves unconditionally.</li>
            <li> Good price - using daily but don&#x27;t know if they are having any effect.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by two optometrists.&lt;br /&gt;It is soothing to my eyes. I don&#x27;t have any news regarding how effective this product is yet , as I have only started on my 2nd bottle .&lt;br /&gt; I have been advised that the process takes  time . I am also taking the same brand homeopathic pellets.</li>
            <li> Seems to soothe my dogs eyes. She has only been using them a few weeks, so no real improvement in the cataracts.</li>
            <li> I am  using these on myself and my dog to treat coming cataracts in both of us. The results are not in yet, but the product is soothing without leaving a blur. I also soothes my eyes from hay fever-like itchiness and it worked beautifully. No problem remembering to take these every day!</li>
            <li> My 16 1/2 year old toy poodle has a severe case of cataracts. I feel these homeopathic drops have helped her. Her eyes look clearer now. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> All is well and good , thanks</li>
            <li> Well, I finally had cataract surgery on one eye, next month the other eye, so I can&#x27;t really grade this.</li>
            <li> It has been just about 2 weeks since I started the drops in my dogs eyes, Dallas had big Cataracts in both eyes, I noticed it everytime we played fetch. I would throw the ball and unless it touched her or made a sound she would have no clue where it went... I gave her the drops for 2 weeks 2 times a day and WOW what a change!!! I played with her again this past weekend and she did not miss a beat! She would run after it, move her eyes when I would move my hand she followed it. Dallas has loved this game ever since she was a puppy and I hated she could not play anymore without getting frustrated and laying down.  Also She does not wipe her eyes as much when it goes from really dark to us turning the lights on.&lt;br /&gt;She does not cringe or get upset with the drops either so they do not sting or irritate her eyes :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much for giving my dog her game back!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 5-1-13&lt;br /&gt;Just reordered the second bottle for Dallas! She is doing great No more running into things and no more listening for the ball to hit the floor, she is starting to catch her treats we throw at her too!!&lt;br /&gt;One more thing... My neighbor of 12 years stopped me the other day and actually commented on Dallas&#x27; behavior. He said she is looking great and running around more. I told him about this product and he was shocked. Dallas use to run the neighborhood and when her sight was going she stuck close to home but now she is going visiting again :) By the way I gave him her left overs of the old bottle he has cataracts and wanted to try it... I will update on him after a month.</li>
            <li> Our dog&#x27;s eyes were getting really cloudy and dull, and she clearly was having trouble seeing things.  After just a few days of using these drops we saw a huge difference.  She now has that old sparkle back.  She&#x27;s gettin the band back together!</li>
            <li> so far feel better after a few days</li>
            <li> Bottle over half empty and cannot discern any benefit. For both of us. Been over a month. Used daily.&lt;br /&gt;No sensation.&lt;br /&gt;Not any different than saline drops, i.e. water in your eyes.</li>
            <li> So far so good! Her eyes are clearer and brighter and she&#x27;s flinching half as much.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using them on her (dog) for a month but I&#x27;m really happy so far.</li>
            <li> This product was received quickly and at a better cost than at the veterinarian&#x27;s office.  Thank you.  Will shop from you again.</li>
            <li> Been using these for several years and my opthamologist says my cataracts have barely budged in that time.</li>
            <li> Poor package!  Nothing improve after 1 month try.&lt;br /&gt;Just the same regular Eye drop sell in Wal-Mart. Not recommend to buy.</li>
            <li> Used on my elderly dog who already has cataracts. Did not seem to help, and he actually seemed like he was seeing worse after using these drops. I&#x27;ve had good luck with a different eye drop that I am currently using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product faithfully in my dogs eyes. One eye has a very noticeable cataract and the other has one beginning to form. When I first started using it, she had film and build up in her eye. Her eye is very clear now and looks a lot better. There is still a cataract there and I can&#x27;t say if it had gotten smaller or not BUT I notice that she seems to be getting around better. At one point, she had a problem going up and down the stairs and now she seems to be taking the stairs a lot easier. I&#x27;d like to say it&#x27;s because of this product and I certainly hope so because it has given me hope Thani won&#x27;t need to shell out a few thousand for surgery for her. Not to mention, the veterinarian doesn&#x27;t recommend surgery for a dog her age. I will definitely continue use as I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in the way she moves around the house. I&#x27;m gonna assume her vision has gotten better.</li>
            <li> My eyes feel refreshed, drops do not sting my eyes and I&#x27;ll keep you updated on my vision!  Thank You</li>
            <li> My vision has not improved but I guess the product is supposed to be used only as preventive medicine, still waiting to see results</li>
            <li> Good product fast shipping</li>
            <li> did not use them - had the itchy eyes after, so tossed away...</li>
            <li> I purchased these eye drops for my almost 12 years old Border Collie dog.He was getting cataracts both eyes. I did alot of research on these eye drops before purchasing. I ordered these eye drops and it came as expected and on time. Within 2 days I could see a significant chnge in his eyes. He lets me put one drop in each eye twice a day without hesitation. I&#x27;m so happy I purchased these drops. My dog is now playing with his toys and even watches squirrels in trees. I would recommend these drops to any one. Be sure to follow instructions, you won&#x27;t be sorry!!!</li>
            <li> My dogs eyes actually got infected using this and I had to buy some antibiotic eye drops for him.&lt;br /&gt;So I can&#x27;t use it because for some reason, maybe my bottle was contaminated or gone bad?&lt;br /&gt;And I was perfectly careful not to touch the tip to my dog&#x27;s eye or area or to anything else.&lt;br /&gt;I was very careful about that and I KNOW that I did not contaminate it myself - it had to be&lt;br /&gt;bad when I got it.l</li>
            <li> I want to buy this product but have to admit many reviews are basing their results on only a few weeks or a month of usage.  I phoned the company &amp; they do say you must give it 9 months as it took a long time to develop the cataract &amp; will take time to get rid of it.  I will buy the product since I did see quite a few good reviews on animals but not enough on people but will write my review after giving it ample time.  I gave it 3 stars since I don&#x27;t know yet.  I had cataract surgery with a toric lens in my left eye which was to correct my astigmatism.  I had 20/20 vision for 4 weeks &amp; then it blurred.  The day after surgery I could see a dark arc in my peripherol vision which is called &amp;#34;negative dysphotopsias&amp;#34;.  It has been 5 months &amp; it is still there.  I&#x27;m told it should go away in 6 to 12 months at least for most people.  Then again the toric lens surgery works for most people but so far I&#x27;m not in the &amp;#34;most&#x27; catagory.  I also see many light beams shooting out from car lights when night driving.  I also have blepharitis &amp; dry eye which got worse after the surgery.  I&#x27;m assuming it got worse since I could not treat it with warm compresses for a month. My point is, I will try anything safe to avoid surgery in my other eye.  I should add that the so called specialist was ready to put a toric lens in my right eye 3 weeks after the 1st surgery even though there is no astigmatism in that eye.  The cost of a toric lens is $1,100 for each eye.  The doc makes lot of $ on this surgery.  My optometrist wondered why I needed cataract surgery yet &amp; thought it was too soon.  So I&#x27;m hoping these eye drops will help.  I needed to vent.</li>
            <li> bought this for my chihuahua. it worked! after a week, his eye was significantly clearer! so pleased as there wasn&#x27;t much traditional western medicine could do for my dog.  the daily lubrication also helped with his &amp;#34;cherry eye&amp;#34;. so pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> They worked a little i guess. But i must admit i was expecting a lkittle more than the very slight change i saw.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice much change in cataracts in my dog. He was at the end of life so maybe it works better on younger dogs. It was a desperate attempt to help an old friend see better.</li>
            <li> My dog has had tear stains for a long time. When I took him to the vet for a free health exam, after adopting him from a shelter, the vet didn&#x27;t see anything wrong with my dog&#x27;s eyes. His eyes water, a lot, and I continually clip the hair away from his eyes and wash the tear stains off. Over time, his eye sight seems to be getting poor and he squints a lot in the sun. I was going to take him back to the vet but I thought I&#x27;d research eye drops, first. Based on recommendations from people who used these drops in their own eyes and said there was no burning or irritation, I decided to try it with my dog. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week, twice a day, on both eyes and the tear discharge has stopped. His eyes are brighter and he no longer squints. He doesn&#x27;t mind the drops and actually cuddles with me after I apply them. I just ordered another bottle. I am thrilled at how quickly it has improved my dog&#x27;s eyes. It&#x27;s so nice to see the hair around his eyes stay clean and no more tear stains. I still will have his eyes checked with my new vet but these drops are really amazing.</li>
            <li> I did some research online and there were a lot of postings on how Cineraria will help or even cure cataract in dogs. Unfortunately, those are just claims. I bought the item for my dog as his eyes have deteriorated recently due to cataracts in both eyes. The drops did nothing to help or relieve the symptoms. If you are buying this eye drop for your dog, I would recommend that you don&#x27;t and just take your dog to the vet or let nature take it&#x27;s course. Dogs can live happily blind.</li>
            <li> It works on my dog, cleared up her eyes</li>
            <li> Works great ,received in 4 days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since last spring.. I&#x27;ve noticed his eyes are brighter and he&#x27;s seeing is still good..&lt;br /&gt;I had one of my yorkies 15 became blind.. I felt so bad started looking for something that may help.. I feel this product is helping..</li>
            <li> I actually didnt mean to buy theese drops cause i saw the reviews. i wanted to get theese others which had very good reviews called pet vision. so i ordered them and then cancelled them an hour later and the seller still sent them to me. but for free :)so i decided to try them out before i bought the others. it has been a few weeks of putting them in his eyes. i think they are help a little bit. he kinda sees the trash can and the walls a bit better when i put him outside. time will tell i guess. when theese drops run out i am buying the other ones.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Seems to be working. I like it.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s another update - it&#x27;s now been 5 months with Bailey rcvg. his eye drops 3x a day...and the nearly opaque white cataract is nearly GONE. Increasingly, the brown color has been returning, and it&#x27;s just like there&#x27;s a slight film (almost like a dull Saran Wrap covering) on that eye now -- so the sheen doesn&#x27;t match the high gloss in his good eye, but it&#x27;s getting there and I&#x27;d classify this as a 85% recovery at present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, his other eye was developing a cataract too (as indicated in my earlier review, this condition developed SO quickly)....and I was minimally hoping I could keep him from going totally blind. That eye looks perfect plus I&#x27;ve tested his bad eye and can tell he has vision whereas the vet had pronounced him blind in that eye. I am Sooooooooooo grateful for this product!!! And, he continues to so demonstrably ENJOY having the drops administered which is a double blessing. So that&#x27;s one woman&#x27;s report from the trenches and I will faithfully keep him on this wonderful product, likely indefinitely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* * *&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ckg. back in with an update as I&#x27;ve been administering this to my doggie (5 yr. old toy poodle with \\&quot;juvenile cataracts\\&quot;) for nearly 2.5 mos. now. Whereas his bad eye was quite white in color due to the cataract which came on SO suddenly, the color has changed significantly and is now more of a light blue depending under direct light -- in fact, his dark brown eyes actually look normal depending on the angle/lighting. And I&#x27;m using the drops in his good eye as well as the vet said that eye was developing one too. AT the time of diagnosis, she said he&#x27;d lost sight in the bad eye, but I test him from time to time and it&#x27;s obvious he CAN see out of his bad eye. So he appears to be improving steadily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Astonishingly, he actually seems to LIKE these drops. I say, \\&quot;Bailey, time for your medicine\\&quot; and he comes at a near gallop, tail wagging. So that&#x27;s made life easy. I give him one drop in each eye 3x a day. The directions instead call for 2 drops but maybe because he&#x27;s so tiny (8 lbs.), anything more than 1 drop just ends up dribbling down his lil&#x27; face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERY pleased overall and delivery times have been really good as well, will continue to re-order &amp; pray!</li>
            <li> THIS PROCUCT IS REALLY GOOD FOR THE EYES.  IT IS ALSO A NATURAL PRODUCT. IT TRULY HELP YOUR EYES. I AM GLAD I FOUND THIS.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and received it on December 23, 2013. I put this in my 15 year old dog&#x27;s eyes (a Shih-Tzu) and immediately they became bright and shiny. I pray that this product will work on the cataract. Let me know if you found this review helpful and I will provide updates to it as I continue to use it in my dog&#x27;s eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick Tip: One technique I use is to put it in his eyes while he is sleeping.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for my dog as well as other products I&#x27;ve bought</li>
            <li> This product really works for my 12 yr old German Shepherd girl. When I first received Natural Ophthalmis drops I gave her only one drop in each eye everyday for about 2 weeks and by the end of two weeks her eyes where crystal clear and beautiful. In fact I believe in one week there were significant changes. That was a yr ago, at this time I notice if I don&#x27;t give her once a day drops at least 3 times a week her eyes will start to cloud up. I know by experience if she goes without drops for two weeks, her eyes will go back to how they were  before taking these drops.&lt;br /&gt;Again, for cloudy eyes or cataract prevention this is your all natural pet product!</li>
            <li> the drops are wonderful after two weeks i have noticed an improvement  colors appear brighter  not a hazy as they had been thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> Bought for my dog, Tobie, who has cataracts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used one bottle and currently using second bottle. Tobie has had marked clearing in the most efffected eye, and seems to be seeing a lot better.</li>
            <li> I took these faithfully for 200 days in a row.  Didn&#x27;t notice an improvement.  I had to discontinue these drops, because they irritated my eyes too much.  At the same time, I took the cineraria pellets.  I&#x27;m equally unimpressed with them.</li>
            <li> I find the drops to be very helpful. Thanks.</li>
            <li> My pets seem to like it, but I am not sure if it is helping their pre-cataract stage. I need to use it a bit longer, and I am hopeful that it will work.</li>
            <li> With moderate cataracts, it helps.  After about 4 weeks, you can see a difference.  My doxie is 9, This is his 3rd bottle, it seems to slowly reverse the cataracts, but if you stop, they progress again. So, I&#x27;ll keep at it for him.  I will use it on me if I get them too!  I give it to him 2x a day, 1 drop.  Love this product!</li>
            <li> I cannot say much about this product yet because I am still waiting to see more results, but over a period of time it does help with small (newly developed) cataract. Of course, this product is being used in conjunction with raw honey drops. I need a little more time and I give a better review.</li>
            <li> After about 2 months of use,my eyes no longer burn or feel dry. I recommend them to my highly to my friends</li>
            <li> Got this for my dog, it did not work at all.</li>
            <li> If your dog has the start of glaucoma these drops along with the cataract pills have stopped and cleared up 90% of his eyes.  Don&#x27;t wait get them and use them for you pet.</li>
            <li> It seems a lot of people have been helped with these eye drops, but unfortunately, I&#x27;m not one of them.  I used one drop in each eye for three days.  The first day my vision seemed clearer, the second day I didn&#x27;t notice anything, but the third day my left eye&#x27;s vision broke up into dozens of light fractals (like broken mirror pieces) to the degree I couldn&#x27;t focus my vision which lasted about 20-30 seconds and scared me.  To be fair, I&#x27;m a very sensitive type of person and things do effect me differently than most, but experiencing this sudden and scary change in my vision was enough for me to stop using the drops.</li>
            <li> These eyedrops are my furry baby boy Peanuts wish come true. Less than a week after putting the first application into his eyes I noticed a huge difference. The color in his eyes are beginning to come back. He is walking better with hardly any accidents. But what convinced my husband and I that this little bottle actually worked. Today when it was time to feed him and his sisters, that was when we knew he was regaining some of his sight back. Each one of our dogs have their own personal dish in different sizes and colors. So before when it was feeding time he would always to the wrong dishor go awsy grom his feeding area. But today for the first time when I called him to eat he walk straight to his bowl. I recommend the anyone who has a furry little baby and he or she has cataracts to purchase these eye drops. They really do work. Give your furry companion some of his sight back. My husband, myself &amp; especially Mr. Peanuts want to thank you for this product. It&#x27;s a big blessing thank you.</li>
            <li> I  have been using this for about three weeks now. It does help a little, better than expected, but not near as well as I hoped. I don&#x27;t think I would buy this product again. If it would have worked even half as well as it was described, I would gladly pay the price and re-order as needed.</li>
            <li> she has been using it and says it gives her relief. as long as she is happy , I can&#x27;t be more happy with product.</li>
            <li> This may sound crazy but I suffer with blurry vision in one eye due to medication/steroids prescribed by my doctors.&lt;br /&gt;I received my first bottle of these drops and applied two drops in one eye.&lt;br /&gt;My eye surgeon wanted to operate on my eyes but I now see very clearly..with the first application.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what the science is behind it but hope it continues.</li>
            <li> Like the incurable cancer victim in desperate search of some miracle, I decided what the heck, I&#x27;ll gamble the &amp;#60;$20--I was certainly not about to shell out $3k+ for cataract surgery (sorry, Haley!).  That&#x27;s my 13 year old 17 pound Holy Wire Terrier mix, and as she began slowly losing her vision, I watched her go from being a 1) lifelong posessed off leash ball chaser to 2) a frustrated, &amp;#34;where is it, where did it go, lemme at it&amp;#34; trooper to 3) a resigned, depressed shell of her old self only casually interested in much anything.  Enter the eye drops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In about 3 to 4 weeks time, I began to notice something distinctly different.  Whereas previously If the ball wandered more than 10 degrees off axis from where she was headed, she would lose sight of it, then lose interest; but now she not only tracks the ball with 90% accuracy, she also chases it further, longer, and exhausts herself in a way I haven&#x27;t seen in over a year--she&#x27;s happy again!!  And I swear, her eyes appear less foggy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are these eye drops a miracle cure?  Let&#x27;s be real, they are not--her vision is far from 100%.  But they do at least help?  Absolutely.  The difference they have made in my dog&#x27;s life is remarkable.  And that may just be miracle enough.</li>
            <li> The eye drops are very soothing when I use them.  They have not taken away the redness in the morning, but it&#x27;s only 27 days of use and I believe I read that it may take six months to show some effect.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  Our 15 yo lab has cataracts to bad her eyes were white.  We have used one bottle usually giving the drops twice per day.  Her right eye we can now see her pupil.  She was biting our fingers when we hand fed her--she is no longer biting us.  The left eye is also clearing, but it was worse.  I had read that the earlier the drops are started when cataracts start to develop the better the results.  I am so pleased that she has regained some of her vision.  I have also send a bottle to my 85 yo mother who has developing cataracts.  This is good stuff!</li>
            <li> I read online that these can be used for dogs, well, they burned my dogs cornea. Now he has an ulcer in his eye and is being treated.</li>
            <li> Recommended by vet; I forget 2x a day so unable to accurately evaluate.Trust homeopathic vet, however.</li>
            <li> So far, My vision hasn&#x27;t improved, However, My eyes often burn &amp; this relieves the burning..so it&#x27;s worth it. I will order again..perhaps I haven&#x27;t used it long enough...I do have cataracts, it may take a few bottles.....</li>
            <li> My vision is clearer. I was a poll worker in the recent election and I could see all the little letters and numbers, unlike last time. Also, I went to a new eye doctor. He said I had early cataracts that may or may not get worse. The last eye doctor said I needed surgery. So I&#x27;d say it works, although it took a couple of years.</li>
            <li> I desperately hoped this would help my 13 old Maltese but her cataract has only gotten worse.  At least it&#x27;s only one eye. Any suggestions?</li>
            <li> Seems to be accomplishing its purpose over time.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my dog who I noticed was getting clouded eyes.  I have only been using a month and really can&#x27;t tell if its working, but will continue because something is better than nothing at all.  Since there are a few people stating it is working for them and their pets, that&#x27;s good enough for me.  If she can see better/clearer, its worth it.  I put it in her eyes every day and she doesn&#x27;t mind at all.  No problems or issues and will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I am going to have to order the pills as this is next to impossible to get into my rottweilers eyes. Im very optimistic about it helping her cataracts though.</li>
            <li> Three bottles and it cured my dogs cataracts&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend it completely</li>
            <li> These are wonderful and no chemicals! I use in my eyes and both of my dogs eyes as well. Buy some!</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell. The description says it takes 9 months for improvement. My diabetic dog has cataracts and her vision is all but gone. I hope I can return in 8 months with a review of good news/improvement.</li>
            <li> The drops did not live up to my expectations.&lt;br /&gt; The drops weren&#x27;t soothing and seemed to dry my eyes even further&lt;br /&gt;than before using them.</li>
            <li> Our dog recently became diabetic and lost his vision very quickly. We hoped these eye drops would help clear up his cataracts but nothing happened. Who knows, maybe this product works differently with different dogs. It&#x27;s definitely worth a try if your pet has recently developed cataracts.</li>
            <li> Saw lots of glowing testimonials so I purchased eye drops. Seemed to irritate my dogs eyes briefly but other than that saw no reduction in the cataract.</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with Native Remedies CataractClear for an eye flare up and when you can&#x27;t get to the ophthalmlogist right away. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The eyedrops caused severe eye irritation in my  dog&#x27;s eyes. His eyes also started to bulge. I stopped using them and  fortunately the bulging and super red irritation stopped about a week after discontinued use.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for the treatment of cataracts that had developed in a cat and a dog.  After only a week, the cataract in my cat&#x27;s eye is almost gone! The cataract in my dog&#x27;s eye is much improved.  Can&#x27;t say anything negative about this product; no apparent side effects in either pet. Will repurchase if necessary.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen a lot of change either way.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t work.....I see no difference.</li>
            <li> I bought them for my 8 yo Jack Russell. Been using since mid-January. I don&#x27;t know if they are really helping him. He doesn&#x27;t fuss at all about them. I get them in his eyes at least once a day, but try for twice.</li>
            <li> This product worked on my dog if you have any questions you can email at  fcovine@ bellsouth.net</li>
            <li> unbelievable !!! I had  floaters,cloudy vision as well as yellowing in the middle of my vision on the left eye, it was so scary to think this could have just kept me from reading books,watching TV. etc  After having Lasik surgery 10 years ago, I was not excited to have another surgery on my eyes, I saw the reviews and took a chance. After only 3 weeks the yellow is all gone and my vision is now slightly cloudy once in while and fading day by day. You can hardly tell the spot in my vision was there! Today I saw an Ophthalmologist my eye doctor recommended. he examined my eyes and I showed him the bottle-he said nothing but after the exam he said yes you have cataracts but they are so mild you don&#x27;t need to see me for 2 years! I also started taking a vision formula pill with lutein just as an extra precaution. After I told my mother she said they had drops to rid cataracts that worked 75 years ago her aunt used.  PS I also bought MSM drops for the eyes since my eyes tire more easily at night, great for dry eyes and it is natural to the body. will keep using to maintain good eye health</li>
            <li> Thanks for inventing such miracle product. My eyes are getting clear and clear every day. And my floaters are getting smaller with only first drop. Thanks again for saving my life. I don&#x27;t need cataract surgery after using the eye drops. I believe in nature healing...</li>
            <li> Thank you for a natural solution for cataracts, which I have a start of it.  I  am pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> it works my dogs eyes have improved they look much better and darker than before no more ghost looking eyes .</li>
            <li> Have not noticed a lot of improvement</li>
            <li> It work well with my dog&#x27;s eyes</li>
            <li> I have the beginnings of cataracts and my aunt used this for a long time for the same purpose and highly recommended them for me. Easy to use and I feel like my vision has more clarity.</li>
            <li> My eyes were getting progressively more cloudy in the AM. This product stopped the cloudiness and presumably reduced the cataracts. Amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed that I can see so clearly.  I had lasik surgery and subsequently have been getting worse and worse cataracts.  I was at the point where I knew I had to have surgery or quit driving.  Now I can see!  Woohoo!!!!!!!!!!  Unbelievable, I just keep looking at things and reading distant signs.  Wow.</li>
            <li> The best treatment I can find</li>
            <li> This product works great and makes my eyes feel a lot better</li>
            <li> I have been using these eyedrops daily for nearly a year.  They have not eliminated my cataracts, but I am told that the kind that I have are fast growing.  They don&#x27;t seem to be getting worse, so perhaps they are helping.  I&#x27;m not sure.  They are very soothing and I will continue to use them.</li>
            <li> My 15 year old golden has started getting cataract, I have been using this and really see the difference in her eyes! Worth it and I would recommend to anyone who needs something for cataract .</li>
            <li> I used a similar product to help clear a cataract on one of my pugs. It didn&#x27;t do much for the cataract however I noticed it was very beneficial for healing and cleansing the cornea. My  2-year-old pug, does not have a cataract, but does have very mild pigmentary keratitis that appeared in an area where he had a corneal ulcer about a year ago. There were a couple of grey areas on the cornea as well. This product was highly recommended and a little cheaper, so I decided to give it a try. I saw an improvement in 24 hours. After a week and a half, the grey area is gone and the pigment is fading as well. I have been applying the drops twice daily. Am now cutting back to once daily. (Less is better with homeopathic remedies).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are the owner of one of our flat-faced friends, I would definitely look at this product as an option.</li>
            <li> 1005 Satisfied met my expectations.</li>
            <li> I like it but it is expensive</li>
            <li> Thanks arrived on time.couldn&#x27;t tell if they worked because my dog passed and i bought them for her. Thanks thou</li>
            <li> Seems to  have helped the discomfort.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product long enough to see a god response.</li>
            <li> I love these drops.  They make my eyes feel better immediately and seems to be doing their job. I also use the pellets and many  nutritional products and foods to support eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an excellent product. I really enjoyed. Arrived on time, well packaged and delivered directly to my door. Congratulations and thank you.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s working but very slowly and I don&#x27;t always use it as often as the instructions  have listed. So maybe after another month and another bottle I will be able to tell if it worked. And maybe it&#x27;s not made to work on all types of cataracts.</li>
            <li> These help my eyes and my dog&#x27;s eyes1</li>
            <li> Hoping this will help my dog in the fight to stop cataracts.</li>
            <li> Better than I expected. Works great.</li>
            <li> Very soothing for me and my dog. Don&#x27;t know if it is working yet but  I remain hopeful. My dogs eyes have started to clear but we have a long ways to go.</li>
            <li> These are for my dog, so hard for me to rate.  Good price though, compared to prescription quality.</li>
            <li> Healing my dogs eyes!</li>
            <li> my  mother  use  it  one month .  she  felt it  good  for  her eyes.</li>
            <li> It has actually cleared up most of the cloudiness in my eyes.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help with my cataract. I finally had a cataract operation</li>
            <li> This has improved my vision, as I have to wait to get my cataracts removed due to diabetes in the eyes.  I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months and also bought the pellets.  My doctor is very pleased with my progress and so am I</li>
            <li> Worked right away for me.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping,using 3-4 times daily on 10 y.o. shepherd.time will tell how effective it is</li>
            <li> I began using the Natural Ophthalmics drops with Cineraria about a month ago. When I began, the cataract in my right eye was very opaque. I could only see a very small circle in my peripheral vision. The center of my field of vision was so cloudy I couldn&#x27;t make out anything, including colors, shapes, words, etc. I began using the drops three times a day and now, only a month later, the cataract in my right eye is so much better, I can make out just about every kind of shape. I am only left with a slight amount of clouding that I am sure will disappear with continued use. Needless to say, I am thrilled!</li>
            <li> His eyes seem clearer.  I tried them in mine and they don&#x27;t burn.</li>
