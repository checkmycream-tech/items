            <li> Not as good as it once was. What is?</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness. The scent that I have missed. My husband recognized it right away as the perfume that I used to wear. 100 stars. The compliments rolled in within minutes of putting it on. I wish this bottle could last forever.</li>
            <li> I truly like this cologne, however it can be very pricy.  Not a bad price from amazon.</li>
            <li> I have been buying Tova from QVC for over many  many years . I know the original smell.. I can honestly say there is a difference in this smell of Tova. It does not stay on longer then the original Tova. Who ever thought it was a good idea to change the original formula of &amp;#34;Tova&amp;#34; fragrance should be fired!&lt;br /&gt;I love the original Tova . Yes I am still buying it but it is not the same.</li>
            <li> A few years ago I paid $38.00 for this very cologne/parfume.&lt;br /&gt;Now you cannot hardly find it at all rarely.&lt;br /&gt;I had to pay $175.00/bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I am not happy someone has gotten so greedy.&lt;br /&gt;I hope I have made them happy.&lt;br /&gt;Tova never meant for her product to be used this way.</li>
            <li> i really don&#x27;t know why the price for this perfume is too high. i remembered that i bought this perfume few years back and it was less than $100.  i know its smells good and clean,but still too expensive. i want to buy this perfume again, but i will never buy it in this price.</li>
            <li> Did not meet my expectations. . Did not smell like my other tova that i had before .. smell totally  diferent .. was very disappointed. .</li>
            <li> The Tova I purchased was delivered on time. But It doesn&#x27;t smell like Tova it has a weird sent.</li>
            <li> I have a few of these bottles from years ago when they were still being made. The new formula is NOT the same, only resembles the original slightly.  I am sooooo sorry about the loss of the real deal.  EVERYONE loved that. I even wore it in my classroom, and I swear, the children were calmer with a pleasant, mild, delicate scent wafting through the room.</li>
            <li> This is it! The TOVA that I purchased from TOVA Beverly Hills and for a short while, QVC!  The good stuff where the scent lasts but is so clean smelling!  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I used to wear this stuff years ago.  I don&#x27;t know what they did to change the formula, but this stuff stinks to high heaven!! I was at a friend&#x27;s house a couple of nights ago.  When I left, we embraced.  He asked me what I was wearing and I told him Tova.  I could tell by the look on his face that he didn&#x27;t like the way it smelled.  I asked him point blank if the smell was unpleasant and he said yes.  Far cry from years ago when complete strangers would stop me and tell me how good I smelled!  Now, this is just my opinion on Tova!  Some people still love the way it smells.  I have only used this bottle a few times, so I am planning on selling this fragrance at a greatly discounted price.  Somebody will be happy to purchase this bottle for $125.00.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this perfume.  Its difficult to get this fragrance in its original form from QVC.  Is it a discontinued scent?</li>
            <li> Ladies. do not buy this the Original Tova bottle would have Tova Signiture on it. This bottle does not. I&#x27;m 60 and used too buy Tova and Tova nights  and all her cactine line from her factory years ago way be for QVC And shame on Tova for going on QVC and presenting her product like the original when it is not / She aloud her formula to be changed. I like a lot of old Tova  gals use too get some many compliments and when id wear  Tova nights  it was wonder ful compliments all day long. Now when I where the stuff Days go by and not one remark about how wonderful I smell. Tova needs to get with her people and start marketing the Tova and Tova night the way they where.</li>
            <li> This smells lovely. It wasn&#x27;t the exact scent I was looking for but it&#x27;s still really nice.</li>
            <li> Best smelling perfume ever!</li>
            <li> 10 years ago, I wore this, back then, it was 70 a bottle now you can&#x27;t hardly find it, Why?</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t ever want this stuff again... I like Tova signature they knew what they were doing putting that Beverly hill crap up there...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a soft  fragrance and doesn&#x27;t  over power you.</li>
            <li> Love this clean feeling this perfume gives me.</li>
            <li> I love the clean, fresh smell of Tova. I didn&#x27;t think it was available anymore.So happy I found it at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I wore Tova and only Tova for years. People would  stop me on the street, asking me what I was wearing. Well, I wanted to believe that Tova was back. It&#x27;s not! This stinks to high heaven. I&#x27;m going to send it back. And scrub my arm where I sprayed it! I wish there was a NEGATIVE ZERO rating..</li>
            <li> It does not smell the same as the original.  I was impressed with the delivery of the product - it was fast!</li>
            <li> this is the fourth time in this year that i bougth this perfume, i love it and every time that i weare it some one ask me what perfume i´m using it.</li>
            <li> Did not smell right at all, maybe expired? I used to love Tova  and cannot seem to find the original scent.</li>
            <li> I have been using Tova for years!  It has a beautiful scent that is light and fresh and sensual !</li>
            <li> The fragrance is not. the original. TOVA</li>
            <li> This is not the original Tova Signature.  I used the original for over 10 years.  The scent lasted all day, and people would stop me in a store and ask me what I was wearing.  When you apply this fake Tova, it doesn&#x27;t last long enough to go from your bedroom to your kitchen.  I was suckered into buying a Tova presented to be original once before and swore I would never do it again.  Well guess what.  I got suckered in to this one believing it was the real thing.  Don&#x27;t buy it.  It&#x27;s fake.  If Tova were really making the original scent, it would be offered through Tova Borgnines&#x27;s company on their website.</li>
            <li> False advertising...this is not the original Tova fragrance...it smells awful...it smells like perfume that&#x27;s gone bad agter years of being in the sun...it&#x27;s totally unwearable....there&#x27;s no return or refund option...a waste of my money...i threw that crap out...I&#x27;m done with Tova...she needs to bring back her original fragrance that everyone keeps asking for....makes no sense to me...</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this fragrance for a long time.  when I wear it I get compliments from both men and women. the women want to know what I am wearing. Don&#x27;t want to tell but I do anyway.</li>
