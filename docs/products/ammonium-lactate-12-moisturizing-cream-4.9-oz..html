            <li>An excellent product for dry skin when used as directed.  </li>
            <li>Glad that it&#x27;s now available over the counter.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are other brands of Lactate cream but believe me - go with the best and</li>
            <li>/&gt;However MFG product does work great based on the CREAM version I got local for $30</li>

            <li>This works great for my dry feet &amp; elbows!  </li>

            <li>It is only available by prescription in my state.</li>
            <li>very embarrassed about how it looks</li>
            <li>And much cheaper than I can find at any store near me!</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this cream a while ago, this is my 4th refill, instant repair for a cracked, dry skin.</li>

            <li>As a bonus it helps clear my acne!</li>
            <li>used to be carried in several stores but is not carried any more but in a more expensive branded fufu product.</li>

            <li>I just apply it to my face and neck every or every other night and it completely prevents any flaking and peeling that I normally experience in winter.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this to anyone with dry skin!</li>
            <li>This may be the other non-medicated ingredients, or just the impression I got from the much thicker creamy consistency.</li>
            <li>I have very dry diabetic feet and after using this for 4 nights, my feet are normal again.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended for use, especially in the winter when dry skin is a problem.</li>

            <li> /&gt;After just a few days of using the cream only once a day, and waiting just a min or two for it to soak in, it&#x27;s made my feet so very soft!</li>
            <li> It has made my skin so soft and has taken away the rough dry skin on my feet.</li>
            <li> but so is toilet paper.</li>
            <li> We had initially purchased this at a pharmacy on the recommendation of our doctor for leg skin discoloration due to edema.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I have tried several prescription and non-prescription lotions to keep my husband&#x27;s diabetic leg sores under control and this is the only one that works for us.  messages into the skin and leaves no greasey film.  Keeps my hands smooth and nice in the process.</li>
            <li> We had initially purchased this at a pharmacy on the recommendation of our doctor for leg skin discoloration due to edema. I found the same product on Amazon for quite a savings. It&#x27;s the same quality and just as effective. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This cream is the most effective way I have found to keep my skin hydrated in harsh winter weather.  As a bonus it helps clear my acne! I just apply it to my face and neck every or every other night and it completely prevents any flaking and peeling that I normally experience in winter. The thing I love most is that I can get this on Amazon! It is only available by prescription in my state.</li>
            <li> My daughter has been using this for years and the price kept going up so we decided to check out Amazon. We have just ordered one tube at half the price quoted by our local pharmacy. What I don&#x27;t like is that Amazon&#x27;s site shows the Perigo brand we are used to. Then when we click on the product to see details we see a picture of the Zilks brand. When we click to order, we again see the Perigo brand. So what did we order? We understand that this cream is a commodity but so is toilet paper. We like to know what we are ordering and the way the web site is set up we won&#x27;t know until it arrives. We are awarding two stars because of this confusing and misleading issue. This is not due to any evaluation of the product.</li>
            <li> Remarkable difference on my skin !! cleared up dry , flaky areas within a week!! highly recommend this to anyone with dry skin! throw away everything else!!!</li>
            <li> Have used tis product for years, was always RX and my insurance company stopped paying for it, so this is great for me. It does help my legs and arms.</li>
            <li> The product received was a thin lotion rather than a cream.  I bought AmLactin in the store, and found that it seems to be more effective. This may be the other non-medicated ingredients, or just the impression I got from the much thicker creamy consistency.</li>
            <li> Did not meet my expectations. Didn&#x27;t work at all for me. I will keep looking for a better medication for my skin issues. (KP)</li>
            <li> I have very dry diabetic feet and after using this for 4 nights, my feet are normal again.  Don&#x27;t even try anything else for dry skin, I&#x27;ve tried them all and they do not work.  This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> This turned out to be the same product I had been getting by Rx, until it went over-the-counter. So my feet are very happy to see it again!</li>
            <li> My podiatrist prescribed this for me but she forgot to put in an amount so the pharmacy could not fill it. I decided to check out Amazon since they sell just about everything. I was elated when I found it. It has made my skin so soft and has taken away the rough dry skin on my feet.</li>
            <li> This works great for my dry feet &amp; elbows!  And much cheaper than I can find at any store near me!</li>
            <li> Cutar emulsion was very helpful in getting the skin on my husband&#x27;s feet softer &amp; less leathery. This decreased his pain when walking.</li>
            <li> No luck. used to be carried in several stores but is not carried any more but in a more expensive branded fufu product. My men don&#x27;t want fufu, happy with what works. Makes me happy to know where to find it.</li>
            <li> I chose 5 star rating because this cream is awesome - especially for older people.  I have very tender, thin skin due to medication I take and this cream keeps my body moist and stops the flaking from dry skin.  A pharmacist at a nursing home told me this cream is a  favorite of many of those in nursing homes. It works and does not feel heavy onn your skin.  With that said, my husband, who is hale and healthy and not in a nursing home, has trouble with dry finger tips and cuticles.  As with many men, it took a while and I finally convinced him to use the Ammonium Lactate 12%.  Hooray!  He is a happy camper with fingers that feel good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other brands of Lactate cream but believe me - go with the best and that is Ammonium Lactate 12% Moisturizing Cream</li>
            <li> This product can not be review by me I placed an order for the CREAM and was shipped Lotion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon and the Vendor did take care of me giving me a refund credit on AMAZON.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However MFG product does work great based on the CREAM version I got local for $30 (I just didn&#x27;t like paying $30)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggest you talk to your DOCTOR and ask about the lotion costs less and is easy to get</li>
            <li> This cream softens calluses, and when used regularly, makes them go away.  The best product for this problem that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this cream a while ago, this is my 4th refill, instant repair for a cracked, dry skin. I put it overnight and next day my skin is glowing. Works just great on small wrinkles as well!</li>
            <li> I have had extremely dry cracked feet for years.. very embarrassed about how it looks and I often avoided exposing them  .&lt;br /&gt;When my dermatologist prescribed this lotion I was skeptical. I thought it wouldn&#x27;t work well because I don&#x27;t have the time to sit and wait for a lotion to sink into my feet before putting on my socks. Plus she said i should use it twice a day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just a few days of using the cream only once a day, and waiting just a min or two for it to soak in, it&#x27;s made my feet so very soft! Everything is healed up and my feet look normal :)  I&#x27;m also sensitive to smells and it has a nice mild aroma. It may be considered unscented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This only reason I have 4 stars is because my dr said it may cause sensitivity to sunlight. I am only using it on my feet, so I hope it won&#x27;t really be a problem.  I&#x27;m so grateful I tried this!</li>
            <li> Its the cream my husband needs and he says its working on him.  So therefore, its fantastic and the price was right.</li>
            <li> An excellent product for dry skin when used as directed.  Highly recommended for use, especially in the winter when dry skin is a problem.</li>
            <li> This is a good product for breaking down calluses on the feet and hands. Glad that it&#x27;s now available over the counter.</li>
            <li> My second purchase of this product from different supplier. Really works to keep feet and finger tips free&lt;br /&gt;of dryness and callus. Remember to apply twice daily. Don&#x27;t settle for the lotion...the cream is the best.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Vida Pharmacy for delivery sooner than promised and the FREE shipping!</li>
