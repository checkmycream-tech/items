            <li> Moisturizes but can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s making a difference in my appearance.</li>
            <li> This product does it&#x27;s job. It makes my skin feel moist and taught, and hopefully will be beneficial later down the line. Its predecessor was more of a cream, and this one is more of a serum. It has no SPF which is a bummer and its predecessor did have SPF. Recommend for a guy in his mid to late 20s or early 30s wanting to maintain young and fresh looking skin.</li>
            <li> Works really well with no reactions like I&#x27;ve had with other products. You notice the re-hydrogenation right away. Good price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Seems like old stock. Lotion clumpsat first each pump push.  Never had this before. It is annoying</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet. But it looks definately matched what the store is saying about and I &#x27;m pretty satisfied.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, it looks great and fit him very well, I would continue to buy it for my husband in the future~~~</li>
            <li> L&#x27;oreal Paris knocks this one out of the park with a wonderful, yet competitively priced moisturizer for men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it twice a day after a using a face wash lotion in both the morning and evenings (Nivea Moisturizer Face Wash) and despite it be only 50 ml (which is the usual amount for moisturizers in this price range), a pea drop twice a day will last you about 2-3 months. You will only ever need to use a pea drop size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product applies very well and after a few minutes, you won&#x27;t be able to feel it on your skin, but you&#x27;ll know its working. It does last quite awhile and has a very manly scent that&#x27;s not overpowering. It will make your skin quite moist and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It was good to use it in dry climate. It really made my skin moisture and shine, I will continue use this priduct.</li>
