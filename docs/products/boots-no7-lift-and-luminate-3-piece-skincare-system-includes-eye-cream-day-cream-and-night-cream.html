            <li>Feels so creamy and nice</li>
            <li>However, I have to say that I&#x27;m really loving this one.</li>
            <li>No. 7 has really done a great job in keeping my skin looking and feeling great.</li>
            <li>I just have not seen any kind of improvement.  </li>
            <li>It smells really nice.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re going in the right direction !!!</li>
            <li>I do think this product is the best I&#x27;ve tried so far.  </li>
            <li>this is by far the best face cream ive ever used</li>
            <li>Just started using but very happy with it so far.</li>
            <li>This is a good price for this set, Boots No7 is as smooth as satin going on your skin, I have problems with some creams breaking my face out</li>
            <li>love it...</li>
            <li>I absolutely love how these products make my skin feel.</li>

            <li>Amazon for once more delivering a topnotch product.</li>
            <li>I just love these creams.  </li>
            <li>Have used for years and love how it makes my skin look.  </li>
            <li>and I won&#x27;t spring for a more costly treatment which also has no assurance to work wonders.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it sparingly because I feel the need to wash the sweat off my face more often.</li>
            <li>maybe it will be better for your skin.</li>
            <li>so I do have some wrinkles around my mouth and neck mostly.</li>
            <li>I love the price too.</li>
            <li>Over all I really love this product and will be purchasing it again.</li>

            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>However, I do think my skin looked better than before I used them.</li>
            <li>I love the feel of  Boots No7.  </li>
            <li>I think it would be even more  beneficial if I had used it years ago.</li>
            <li>in fact, most days I don&#x27;t need a foundation anymore.  </li>
            <li>This product does not clog my pores like so many products have.</li>
            <li>Bought this as a gift but the person I gave it too seems to be completely satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>The moisturizers seem to be okay.</li>
            <li>Love this</li>
            <li>Have ordered it many many times and plan to keep on.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS..</li>
            <li>love this product would recommend</li>
            <li>It keeps skin moist and more youthful looking.</li>
            <li>so far i&#x27;m happy with the product, it was a better deal then in stores.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I persevered in my search to find this product available without going to the UK!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>I like this product because it&#x27;s easy to use</li>
            <li>It is easy and does seem to make a difference.</li>
            <li>Even tone skin and no baggy eyes or fine lines.</li>
            <li>I started with Boots No 7 facial cleansers and found they were great.  </li>
            <li>I chose this rating because it is truly a fantastic product from packaging to performance  Boots 7 L @L and</li>
            <li>It feels light and smooth going on.</li>
            <li>if it works as good as it says, I will post more later to let you know.</li>
            <li>Love getting my favorite skincare with luscious glow and care for a decent price.</li>
            <li>I love that there is only a very light refreshing smell and the cream is not greasy.</li>
            <li>Nothing special about this.. Save your money an buy Olay..</li>
            <li>No 7 proves you don&#x27;t have to spend a whole lot of money to get great results!</li>
            <li>I saw this on the The Talk and decided to try it, I absolutely love it, my skin looks so much brighter and firmer...</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much, non greasy, I apply it to my face, neck and chest and I&#x27;ve noticed the difference, my skin looks and feels so much better.  </li>
            <li>In that time, several people have commented that my skin looks good.  </li>
            <li>Quickly absorbs and works wonders on my combination skin.  </li>
            <li>I have tried other pricey brands but this product is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Not as good as I had hoped for dry skin</li>
            <li>i love these skincare creams, your skin feels really soft</li>
            <li>No real results yet but feels good</li>
            <li>and so far I love it.  </li>
            <li>No 7 is great and am anxiously awaiting for my Boots 7 primer and foundation to arrive</li>
            <li>It does smell nice and makes your skin soft, but so do so many other products.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 65 years old, and don&#x27;t really have a&lt;br /&gt;lot of wrinkles, more like a loss of tone.</li>
            <li>Great set, I have maintained a daily regiment am and pm and definitely notice an improvement in my skin texture  and apperance.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;the price was also very reasonable</li>
            <li>I use a very minimal amount and am very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>They eye cream is very nice, but I have used it only a short time and haven&#x27;t seen any changes.</li>
            <li>I like the product very much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is not what comes first in your skin care .</li>
            <li>love the entire line of products.</li>
            <li>These creams are nourishing and hydrating, and they leave your skin feeling smooth, soft, and supple.</li>
            <li>skin is better the second night!  </li>
            <li>depends on how consistent you are.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Having worked for many cosmetics companies in the past, this is an outstanding (non-retinol) moisturizer program.</li>
            <li>Perhaps better to purchase the moisturizers without the extra expense for the eye cream.</li>
            <li>I chose this rating because this system did exactly what it said.</li>
            <li>I am in my early 70s and it isn&#x27;t easy to see what time wants me to look like.</li>
            <li>I certainly don&#x27;t feel like&lt;</li>
            <li>In just a few days, my skin feels and looks better!</li>
            <li>Thanks Dr. Oz for letting me know about this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this brand!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>and she really didn&#x27;t think it made a difference.</li>
            <li>I really like but the eye cream doesn&#x27;t do anything for me</li>
            <li>Recommend it to any gal who wants slowing skin...</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that it really made a difference on my skin</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The seller was really fast with shipping though, so I would buy from this seller.</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t found a skin  product that is and have spent a lot more money.</li>
            <li>i have used almost every expensive makeup brand out there, from channel to mac and by far this is the best !!</li>
            <li>This works better than any other brand I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Goes on very smoothly and does not feel heavy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only using the eye cream right now and am not seeing a difference with that either.</li>
            <li>it is my new face cream....</li>
            <li>but this helps the little fine lines.</li>
            <li>it makes your skin feel tight and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have paid twice this much for other products that didn&#x27;t work as well and only had about half the amount  in the jar, so I&#x27;m thrilled with the product and the price.</li>
            <li>We went to a birthday party  3 people ask her how young she looks.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft.</li>
            <li>and I have been getting lots of compliments from my lady friends and looks from men (I know they are all old but</li>
            <li>I would not waste my money buying anymore of it.  </li>
            <li>( I have Rosacea and it&#x27;s completely under control)</li>
            <li>So far I like this.</li>
            <li>It make y skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>my skin was younger looking , my skin tone was is  more even  I would recommend this product for every one who is having trouble with their skin aging</li>
            <li>These creams are good but a bit heavy and heavily fragranced.  </li>
            <li>With age I have noticed some changes and due to my sensitive skin am very apprehensive about spending a ton of money on products.  </li>
            <li>They have such a soft fragrance, and I have been using them long enough to really tell the softness in my skin.  </li>
            <li>Just received the product , I have only tried it so far for 3 days , too soon for me to know for&lt;</li>
            <li>I am old and have very dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>But I think I am missing a step first.</li>
            <li>I think I could buy a new home and upgrade my car for what I have spent on drug and department store products over the years</li>

            <li> in fact, most days I don&#x27;t need a foundation anymore.  </li>
            <li> This product does not clog my pores like so many products have.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift but the person I gave it too seems to be completely satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> The moisturizers seem to be okay.</li>
            <li> Love this</li>
            <li> Have ordered it many many times and plan to keep on.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS..</li>
            <li> love this product would recommend</li>
            <li> It keeps skin moist and more youthful looking.</li>
            <li> so far i&#x27;m happy with the product, it was a better deal then in stores.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I persevered in my search to find this product available without going to the UK!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I like this product because it&#x27;s easy to use</li>
            <li> It is easy and does seem to make a difference.</li>
            <li> Even tone skin and no baggy eyes or fine lines.</li>
            <li> I started with Boots No 7 facial cleansers and found they were great.  </li>
            <li> I chose this rating because it is truly a fantastic product from packaging to performance  Boots 7 L @L and</li>
            <li> It feels light and smooth going on.</li>
            <li> if it works as good as it says, I will post more later to let you know.</li>
            <li> Love getting my favorite skincare with luscious glow and care for a decent price.</li>
            <li> I love that there is only a very light refreshing smell and the cream is not greasy.</li>
            <li> Nothing special about this.. Save your money an buy Olay..</li>
            <li> No 7 proves you don&#x27;t have to spend a whole lot of money to get great results!</li>
            <li> I saw this on the The Talk and decided to try it, I absolutely love it, my skin looks so much brighter and firmer...</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much, non greasy, I apply it to my face, neck and chest and I&#x27;ve noticed the difference, my skin looks and feels so much better.  </li>
            <li> In that time, several people have commented that my skin looks good.  </li>
            <li> Quickly absorbs and works wonders on my combination skin.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other pricey brands but this product is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Not as good as I had hoped for dry skin</li>
            <li> i love these skincare creams, your skin feels really soft</li>
            <li> No real results yet but feels good</li>
            <li> and so far I love it.  </li>
            <li> No 7 is great and am anxiously awaiting for my Boots 7 primer and foundation to arrive</li>
            <li> It does smell nice and makes your skin soft, but so do so many other products.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 65 years old, and don&#x27;t really have a&lt;br /&gt;lot of wrinkles, more like a loss of tone.</li>
            <li> Great set, I have maintained a daily regiment am and pm and definitely notice an improvement in my skin texture  and apperance.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;the price was also very reasonable</li>
            <li> I use a very minimal amount and am very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> They eye cream is very nice, but I have used it only a short time and haven&#x27;t seen any changes.</li>
            <li> I like the product very much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is not what comes first in your skin care .</li>
            <li> love the entire line of products.</li>
            <li> These creams are nourishing and hydrating, and they leave your skin feeling smooth, soft, and supple.</li>
            <li> skin is better the second night!  </li>
            <li> depends on how consistent you are.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Having worked for many cosmetics companies in the past, this is an outstanding (non-retinol) moisturizer program.</li>
            <li> Perhaps better to purchase the moisturizers without the extra expense for the eye cream.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because this system did exactly what it said.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 70s and it isn&#x27;t easy to see what time wants me to look like.</li>
            <li> I certainly don&#x27;t feel like&lt;</li>
            <li> In just a few days, my skin feels and looks better!</li>
            <li> Thanks Dr. Oz for letting me know about this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this brand!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> and she really didn&#x27;t think it made a difference.</li>
            <li> I really like but the eye cream doesn&#x27;t do anything for me</li>
            <li> Recommend it to any gal who wants slowing skin...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that it really made a difference on my skin</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The seller was really fast with shipping though, so I would buy from this seller.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t found a skin  product that is and have spent a lot more money.</li>
            <li> i have used almost every expensive makeup brand out there, from channel to mac and by far this is the best !!</li>
            <li> This works better than any other brand I have tried.  </li>
            <li> Goes on very smoothly and does not feel heavy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only using the eye cream right now and am not seeing a difference with that either.</li>
            <li> it is my new face cream....</li>
            <li> but this helps the little fine lines.</li>
            <li> it makes your skin feel tight and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have paid twice this much for other products that didn&#x27;t work as well and only had about half the amount  in the jar, so I&#x27;m thrilled with the product and the price.</li>
            <li> We went to a birthday party  3 people ask her how young she looks.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft.</li>
            <li> and I have been getting lots of compliments from my lady friends and looks from men (I know they are all old but</li>
            <li> I would not waste my money buying anymore of it.  </li>
            <li> ( I have Rosacea and it&#x27;s completely under control)</li>
            <li> So far I like this.</li>
            <li> It make y skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> my skin was younger looking , my skin tone was is  more even  I would recommend this product for every one who is having trouble with their skin aging</li>
            <li> These creams are good but a bit heavy and heavily fragranced.  </li>
            <li> With age I have noticed some changes and due to my sensitive skin am very apprehensive about spending a ton of money on products.  </li>
            <li> They have such a soft fragrance, and I have been using them long enough to really tell the softness in my skin.  </li>
            <li> Just received the product , I have only tried it so far for 3 days , too soon for me to know for&lt;</li>
            <li> I am old and have very dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> But I think I am missing a step first.</li>
            <li> I think I could buy a new home and upgrade my car for what I have spent on drug and department store products over the years</li>
            <li> At least right now.  </li>
            <li> When I started this program six weeks ago my face was red and had a lot of dark spots they have faded and my redness/red dots are completely gone.</li>
            <li> My skin usually takes a real beating.  </li>
            <li> I last a long time too.</li>
            <li> I had heard how great it was on TV, but since I am using it am a little disappointed in it.  </li>
            <li> will be on my A list for a long,  long time.  </li>
            <li> I must say the wrinkle reduction is only minimal</li>
            <li> I have using Boot&#x27;s No. 7 for a long time.</li>
            <li> Since switching to this product, my face has stayed soft and moist without the usual itching or redness.  </li>
            <li> Not heavy  and hard to spread,</li>
            <li> and I did see some improvement especially around the eyes I am 70 Years 0ld with quite a few wrinkles</li>
            <li> Exactly as I expected it to be</li>
            <li> the cream is working but not very dramatically.</li>
            <li> not even the slightest hint of a diminished wrinkle and am feeling extremely discouraged.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i use the other N°7 products with them&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried other moisturizers, etc.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products and it doesn&#x27;t compare to Boots No7 products.</li>
            <li> I used this faithfully and was not impressed, Ponds works ten times better and is less expensive</li>
            <li> had to return because the containers were not sealed and the indenture in the center of the cream yelled previously used.</li>
            <li> The eye cream component is helping with my under eye dark circles.</li>
            <li> It beats any other name brand on the market n my book !</li>
            <li> The wrinkles are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> -I did have a slight reaction</li>
            <li> I was not familiar with this brand until a friend brought it to my attention.</li>
            <li> I like the eye cream and have seen a little bit of results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would put some on and then get a little bit of water to spread it out</li>
            <li> But would buy again even if I am missing something .</li>
            <li> I GOT WHAT I ORDERED AND HAVE BEEN USING IT EVERYDAY, BUT HAVE NOT NOTICED ANY IMPROVEMENT.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for uneven skin tone and Rosacea</li>
            <li> /&gt;The day and night cream I found to be too heavy for my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Previously I had to be in England to get it!</li>
            <li> I live in Idaho where we have very cold, dry winters.  </li>
            <li> The day cream is applied to the rest of my face as usual and is NOT greasy.  </li>
            <li> (like some I have used in the past).</li>
            <li> Not satisfied with the product it made my face break out.</li>
            <li> But I think I see some small changes in my skin already.</li>
            <li> For my age I&#x27;ll just say I&#x27;m in my late 30&#x27;s and</li>
            <li> Living in Maine during the cold and dry winter is hard on aging skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin got worse using this product.</li>
            <li> I will never spend another dime on expensive creams.</li>
            <li> was not impressed</li>
            <li> I am always skeptical with wrinkle products.</li>
            <li> and I like it in a cold climate.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my face breaks out every time I put it on. :(</li>
            <li> and I still hated to look in the mirror.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> people always ask what type of lotion I use on my face&lt;br /&gt;Have been using it for a year</li>
            <li> Not quite as good as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> love it...looking forward to buying more!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love how these products make my skin feel. I&#x27;ve been using this Trio for about 5 weeks now,&lt;br /&gt;and I do think I see an overall improvement of skin tone and texture. I&#x27;m 65 years old, and don&#x27;t really have a&lt;br /&gt;lot of wrinkles, more like a loss of tone. Which I do believe the Boots #7 is helping. I certainly don&#x27;t feel like&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m losing any more tone, since I&#x27;ve started it. We&#x27;re going in the right direction !!!</li>
            <li> Good been using it on my face feel good and I can see a difference in my skin</li>
            <li> did not see any changes or results in 14 days</li>
            <li> Excellent Product, I will buy again</li>
            <li> AWESOME product.  Not only does it work, but, it&#x27;s affordable!</li>
            <li> 2nd time I ordered this , nothing changed .</li>
            <li> so far i&#x27;m happy with the product, it was a better deal then in stores.</li>
            <li> Happy with this line of product as always.  Do what they say.</li>
            <li> Wife loves product.We went to a birthday party  3 people ask her how young she looks.Product does work.Will by again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t ever spend a fortune on skin care again. I have tried other pricey brands but this product is by far the best. I have seen results in just a week! I cannot tell you the obvious difference. My eyes are lighter and fresher. The wrinkles are less noticeable. The saggy skin on my neck is firming. I will never spend another dime on expensive creams. This line of products by No 7 is the best and can be ordered on line or purchased at Target. Start with the eye serum, day cream, night cream and cleansing cloths.</li>
            <li> Works well, good value also.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s making a big difference in my appearance.</li>
            <li> was not impressed...eye cream burned my eyes... go figure</li>
            <li> LOVE this product!!!!</li>
            <li> Seems to work the way it was advertized. Good buy.</li>
            <li> I used this faithfully and was not impressed, Ponds works ten times better and is less expensive</li>
            <li> I am old and have very dry sensitive skin.I use this every day and night and I just love it.</li>
            <li> At least right now.  Have been using since 12/23/14 (yes, I am marking on the calendar) with confidence based on reviews raving about how well it works.  It is 1/24/15 and I have seen no change whatsoever...not even the slightest hint of a diminished wrinkle and am feeling extremely discouraged. Still using and hoping.  It does smell nice and makes your skin soft, but so do so many other products.  I&#x27;ll update this if I see any change.  If there is no update, then there has been no change..except the change in my bank account balance for the purchase.</li>
            <li> Just yesterday after  using the product for two to three weeks , I  noticed a big change in my skin my skin was younger looking , my skin tone was is  more even  I would recommend this product for every one who is having trouble with their skin aging</li>
            <li> I like the boots number 7 left and I did see some improvement especially around the eyes I am 70 Years 0ld with quite a few wrinkles so yes I will be buying boots number 7 lift again.</li>
            <li> Love all #7 products. My skin feels so soft. I am 46 and most think I am in my 30&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I got a great deal ordering through you. I love these products.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my face breaks out every time I put it on. :( The search continues for a good wrinkle cream.</li>
            <li> No 7 is the best!!! Affordable and has great results!!! I have used No 7 for many years and will not try anything else!!!</li>
            <li> I know that everyone has different types of problems with their skincare.These No 7 seem to work for  me. I think I could buy a new home and upgrade my car for what I have spent on drug and department store products over the years and I still hated to look in the mirror. I am in my early 70s and it isn&#x27;t easy to see what time wants me to look like. UGH  However I have been using these products for about a month now and I have been getting lots of compliments from my lady friends and looks from men (I know they are all old but what the heck)  I love that there is only a very light refreshing smell and the cream is not greasy. I will be continuing to reorder these and more No &amp; products .</li>
            <li> I have been using these for four days now and I can actually tell a difference. Thanks Dr. Oz for letting me know about this product.</li>
            <li> Have been using for months.  The best I have found.</li>
            <li> i love these skincare creams, your skin feels really soft&lt;br /&gt;i use the other N°7 products with them&lt;br /&gt;the price was also very reasonable</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed anything yet but it does make my face break out when I use it every day.</li>
            <li> With age I have noticed some changes and due to my sensitive skin am very apprehensive about spending a ton of money on products.  I started with Boots No 7 facial cleansers and found they were great.  So, I made the leap and purchased this set.  Quickly absorbs and works wonders on my combination skin.  I tend to break out on my nose if I use any SPF-I did have a slight reaction so I use the night cream at night and only on my nose during the day.  The day cream is applied to the rest of my face as usual and is NOT greasy.  I use a very minimal amount and am very satisfied.  The eye cream has softened the wrinkles by my eyes and I do use a primer over the creams without issues.  I think Boots No 7 is great and am anxiously awaiting for my Boots 7 primer and foundation to arrive so I can switch all my makeup to Boots.</li>
            <li> I love these products!  I have tried other moisturizers, etc. and have gone back to Boots No. 7.  They work great!  I would highly recommend this brand!</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because it is truly a fantastic product from packaging to performance  Boots 7 L @L and the Serum  will be on my A list for a long,  long time.  It is already making me look younger and healthier.  I am so glad I persevered in my search to find this product available without going to the UK!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon for once more delivering a topnotch product.</li>
            <li> Boots No. 7 is an excellent brand.  However, I think the Lift and Luminate is somewhat drying.  Next time I will reorder the &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; version.</li>
            <li> havent seen any difference in day or night cream and not seeing a difference in my complection..</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I live in Idaho where we have very cold, dry winters.  My skin usually takes a real beating.  Since switching to this product, my face has stayed soft and moist without the usual itching or redness.  I&#x27;d highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I just love these creams.  They have such a soft fragrance, and I have been using them long enough to really tell the softness in my skin.  They eye cream is very nice, but I have used it only a short time and haven&#x27;t seen any changes.</li>
            <li> I do think this product is the best I&#x27;ve tried so far.  There is no miracle cure but this helps the little fine lines. I&#x27;m making this my daily routine. Laura age 52</li>
            <li> Have used for years and love how it makes my skin look.  Great for the price too!</li>
            <li> Used this for years and I like it in a cold climate. Feels so creamy and nice going on and then disappears. I must say the wrinkle reduction is only minimal but that is enough for me at 64 yrs and I won&#x27;t spring for a more costly treatment which also has no assurance to work wonders.&lt;br /&gt;It is definitely moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;I find when I am in Florida in the heat and humidity I use it sparingly because I feel the need to wash the sweat off my face more often.</li>
            <li> My wife just loves this!</li>
            <li> No real results yet but feels good</li>
            <li> I had heard how great it was on TV, but since I am using it am a little disappointed in it.  I will continue using it until it is all gone but will go back to what I was using before.  Good luck maybe it will be better for your skin.</li>
            <li> I am always skeptical with wrinkle products. I&#x27;m always thinking &amp;#34;yeah right&amp;#34;, yet I still try them. lol However, I have to say that I&#x27;m really loving this one. I am in my 50&#x27;s so I do have some wrinkles around my mouth and neck mostly. I do like that my skin appeared brighter and healthier looking in the mornings after using it. It feels great applying it. Not heavy  and hard to spread, (like some I have used in the past). It feels light and smooth going on. It moisturized my skin without leaving it feeling greasy. I love the price too. I have paid twice this much for other products that didn&#x27;t work as well and only had about half the amount  in the jar, so I&#x27;m thrilled with the product and the price. I last a long time too. Over all I really love this product and will be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> Alright I bought this product after seeing some one on a talk show talking about it. I like it. But I think I am missing a step first. Unsure what I should have bought to use with it. So research product .&lt;br /&gt;This is not what comes first in your skin care . But would buy again even if I am missing something .</li>
            <li> I HAD SEEN THIS ON THE DOCTORS SHOW, SO I ORDERED IT.  I GOT WHAT I ORDERED AND HAVE BEEN USING IT EVERYDAY, BUT HAVE NOT NOTICED ANY IMPROVEMENT.</li>
            <li> love boots number 7 does the best job out of any facial lotion I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Not as good as I had hoped for dry skin</li>
            <li> this is by far the best face cream ive ever used</li>
            <li> This product is actually the only product that works for me. It came on time and I would recommend this product to family and friends. I have tried other products and it doesn&#x27;t compare to Boots No7 products.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for some time and am quite pleased</li>
            <li> Love it! Great product! Time to order more!</li>
            <li> Great set, I have maintained a daily regiment am and pm and definitely notice an improvement in my skin texture  and apperance.  A great product and a fantastic price.</li>
            <li> In all fairness, I only used this for a couple of days, but it didn&#x27;t work well with my skin.  The day cream looked greasy and made me break out - even though I used it sparingly.  And it genuinely seemed that the wrinkles around my eyes got worse when I used the eye cream.  My mom swears by this stuff, so I&#x27;ll be passing it along to her.</li>
            <li> Notice a difference within a week.  Even tone skin and no baggy eyes or fine lines. Love this product. A must try.</li>
            <li> Just started using but very happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been using this item daily and so far I love it.  It doesn&#x27;t  make my face oily or break out.  Give it a try I think you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> Living in Maine during the cold and dry winter is hard on aging skin.  No. 7 has really done a great job in keeping my skin looking and feeling great.</li>
            <li> This is a good price for this set, Boots No7 is as smooth as satin going on your skin, I have problems with some creams breaking my face out but I have no problems with any of the Boots products, I feel that it works well at keeping the wrinkles away!!</li>
            <li> THE BEST FOR THE PRICE</li>
            <li> Exactly as I expected it to be</li>
            <li> love these products...can already tell a difference!</li>
            <li> I saw this on the The Talk and decided to try it, I absolutely love it, my skin looks so much brighter and firmer...it is my new face cream....</li>
            <li> i have used almost every expensive makeup brand out there, from channel to mac and by far this is the best !! love the entire line of products.</li>
            <li> compared to six weeks ago, something is making a difference.  My complexion is not as &amp;#34;gray&amp;#34; as it was.  I&#x27;m also using the 3 piece Lift and Luminate, and Protect and Perfect Serum, as well as this Anti-Ageing Gycolic Peel (posting the same review and rating under each of those), so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a change in diet, these skin treatments, or a combination of all, but SOMETHING is working.  Yay!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mother and she really didn&#x27;t think it made a difference. Thank you on the expediency of this order!</li>
            <li> I just have not seen any kind of improvement.  Seems like a waste of money if you want something fast acting, I did am&#x3D;nd got discouraged.</li>
            <li> Nothing special about this.. Save your money an buy Olay..</li>
            <li> Boots No 7 proves you don&#x27;t have to spend a whole lot of money to get great results! These creams are nourishing and hydrating, and they leave your skin feeling smooth, soft, and supple. A great way to start and end the day!!!</li>
            <li> The night and day cream I really like but the eye cream doesn&#x27;t do anything for me been using all 3 for a month I will give it another month.</li>
            <li> These creams are good but a bit heavy and heavily fragranced.  I would not buy again because I like something lighter.  However, I do think my skin looked better than before I used them.</li>
            <li> In just a few days, my skin feels and looks better! I definitely will buy this product again!</li>
            <li> I love the feel of  Boots No7.  I have already noticed a difference after only 3 weeks of use.  I will definitely buy it again.  I think it would be even more  beneficial if I had used it years ago.</li>
            <li> awesome product.  skin is better the second night!  Amazon always great!</li>
            <li> The difference in my skin is wonderful.  I had purchased Boots No 7 at Target a year or so.  Our town got a ULTA store and had their version of it for about 1/2 the price.  I got is and is was NOT the same.  Recommend it to any gal who wants slowing skin...in fact, most days I don&#x27;t need a foundation anymore.  The Night Cream is my favorite!</li>
            <li> Great value. This skin care has received rave reviews from several magazines and publications. It doesn&#x27;t hurt that it is affordable either.</li>
            <li> Love getting my favorite skincare with luscious glow and care for a decent price.</li>
            <li> I like the product very much. Goes on very smoothly and does not feel heavy. No fragrance! This product does not clog my pores like so many products have.</li>
            <li> For my daughter-in-law for last Christmas.  She requested it and I had never heard of Boots before.  She just loved it!</li>
            <li> Feels so good and it Works!!!! I will re-order when I run out. No7 is wonderful. The&lt;br /&gt;amazing thing is that you see results after only about a week.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift but the person I gave it too seems to be completely satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> Just received the product , I have only tried it so far for 3 days , too soon for me to know for&lt;br /&gt;sure if it works as good as it says, I will post more later to let you know.</li>
            <li> great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. I can&#x27;t say that it really made a difference on my skin but we are not all the same.</li>
            <li> my second order my wife loves it  do not stop making it please</li>
            <li> Saw this product on a talk show, gave it a try.  It&#x27;s my second time ordering.  Much better than the expensive day and night creams on the shelves.  You don&#x27;t need much, non greasy, I apply it to my face, neck and chest and I&#x27;ve noticed the difference, my skin looks and feels so much better.  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> see a difference in a week or two. depends on how consistent you are. good buy price wise.</li>
            <li> Finally found a face cream that works for me. The best part of using this cream is that it does not make my skin feel greasy.</li>
            <li> Having been using Boots No7 for about a month.  In that time, several people have commented that my skin looks good.  That tells me that Boots No 7 is working.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years &amp; LOVE THIS STUFF !!! It beats any other name brand on the market n my book !</li>
            <li> I saw the advertisement about this cream on the news.  the cream is working but not very dramatically. I wonder if I should have gotten the serum instead?  It smells really nice.</li>
            <li> I purchased the system as a gift and the recipient loves the results.  I am very pleased and happy for her!</li>
            <li> Having worked for many cosmetics companies in the past, this is an outstanding (non-retinol) moisturizer program.</li>
            <li> Great starter kit to try the products which are all wonderful. I was not familiar with this brand until a friend brought it to my attention.</li>
            <li> this is wonderful day and night cream.  it makes your skin feel tight and smooth. the price is great too</li>
            <li> I faithfully used this product for 5 days, day and night until it broke my forehead out with acne. Use with caution</li>
            <li> Worked well, recommended it to my mom too</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I see a difference in my skin clarity after only two weeks.  The eye cream component is helping with my under eye dark circles.</li>
            <li> I did not see any different using this for 3 week s versus using neutrogena products. I wasted my money. My skin got worse using this product.</li>
            <li> This product does not work as stated.  I would not waste my money buying anymore of it.  I have used it for a month and I see no difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> The moisturizers seem to be okay. The eye cream does not work at all. Perhaps better to purchase the moisturizers without the extra expense for the eye cream.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied with the product it made my face break out. I&#x27;m only using the eye cream right now and am not seeing a difference with that either.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because this system did exactly what it said. I like this product because it&#x27;s easy to use goes on well under my makeup. In six weeks my skin looks great my blotchy face is looking much better. When I started this program six weeks ago my face was red and had a lot of dark spots they have faded and my redness/red dots are completely gone. My dermatologist kit was 385 dollars versus 60 dollars and did the same job. I still have product left after two months. I recommend this product for uneven skin tone and Rosacea ( I have Rosacea and it&#x27;s completely under control)</li>
            <li> I have using Boot&#x27;s No. 7 for a long time. It is a wonderful product. I&#x27;m happy to be able to purchase it from Amazon. Previously I had to be in England to get it!</li>
            <li> So far I like this. Have only had it a week and it says you should try it for 4 weeks to see changes. But I think I see some small changes in my skin already. Feels like silk when applying</li>
            <li> Great value. Great product!</li>
            <li> I may be a convert. It is easy and does seem to make a difference. I&#x27;m still the same person and still wish my skin were 20 years younger, but it has been helpful.</li>
            <li> like this product but it is alittle oily</li>
            <li> Love this and it is all I use.  Have ordered it many many times and plan to keep on.</li>
            <li> I have never used a product that actually takes away the signs of ageing.  This product is awsome, It started working in a matter of weeks.  I tried Olay products for years and I never ever seen results.  Boots No7 will be the only product I use again.  For my age I&#x27;ll just say I&#x27;m in my late 30&#x27;s and this stuff works!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for almost 2 years now and I really like it.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel really good.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS..but dang. had no idea I could get the same thing at Target..I like everything in it though.</li>
            <li> I like the eye cream and have seen a little bit of results.&lt;br /&gt;The day and night cream I found to be too heavy for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would put some on and then get a little bit of water to spread it out further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I would purchase this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller was really fast with shipping though, so I would buy from this seller.</li>
            <li> love this product would recommend</li>
            <li> This works better than any other brand I have tried.  It keeps skin moist and more youthful looking.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me..</li>
            <li> had to return because the containers were not sealed and the indenture in the center of the cream yelled previously used.</li>
            <li> On a scale of 1 to 10.  10</li>
            <li> I use the day cream, and the eye cream in the morning. At night I use the eye cream and the night cream.  It make y skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> This is a good value and a very nice product for the price. Nothing miraculous but I haven&#x27;t found a skin  product that is and have spent a lot more money.</li>
