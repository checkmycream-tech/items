            <li>I am so satisfied with the results!</li>
            <li>but it looks so much better !</li>
            <li>If not, it sure looks and feels like it!</li>
            <li>Were they amazing?</li>
            <li>Good luck and be \\&quot;PATIENCE\\&quot;:-)</li>
            <li>I honestly have no knowledge of the product as I cancelled immediately after receiving email confirmation of the &amp;#34;free trial&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I really liked the tingly feeling after applying.  </li>
            <li>Procellix proved to be more effective.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll let you know at the end of 3months what the verdict is :).</li>
            <li>and with that said , thought that the results should have been more noticable.</li>
            <li>it is most of the time genetic,my mom has it,awful ones.</li>
            <li>&quot; at the shower will be even better.</li>
            <li>and I have been dealing with cellulite most of my life.</li>
            <li>I think I would rather throw my money on more jeans.</li>
            <li>and i fell in love with this product.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;Anyone that has stubborn cellulite will love this gel.</li>
            <li>and my diet is beyond healthy and</li>
            <li>and I will move on to more radical solutions (lipomax ultra-sound treatment).</li>
            <li>To be able to truly see results from a product in a tube were amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>To begin with, Procellix gel has a wonderful cool ,clear gel consistency.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny!!</li>
            <li>This gel didn&#x27;t really do much but give me a really good rash....</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is so easy to use</li>
            <li>I hope my summer can be salvaged even though I tried playing it cheap with this stuff.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and absorbs quickly,</li>
            <li>I saw visible results within the first 3 days of use, and recommend using it longer for optimal results!</li>
            <li>&quot; procellix, I didn&#x27;t see much of a change at all!!</li>
            <li>Nothing can replace good self esteem and acceptance of your body, but this certainly helps in the short term.</li>
            <li>IT WORKS WONDERS after a few weeks i started seeing great results</li>
            <li>I figured it was worth buying.  </li>
            <li>Worth the try.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li>I have found it very comparable to, or better than VelaShape, a very costly spa treatment that requires alot of time and $$$$.</li>
            <li>Today I went to the Procellix site and placed an order for what I know will be the right product.</li>
            <li>use morning and evening  sometimes used even 3 times!!!&lt;br /&gt;Smoother and softer.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended very much.</li>
            <li>First off, one of the ingredients advertised in Procellix is caffeine.</li>
            <li>Not quite sure about the product, came in a different packaging than advertised.</li>
            <li>This is the only cream (more like an odorless gel) that makes my legs noticably smoother and firmer.</li>
            <li>I only use it once a day most of the time because that is all I can afford.  </li>
            <li>but I did not see any results within the first 10 days like the bottle said.</li>
            <li>I used it all to make sure I did it properly and nothing but acne.</li>
            <li>my friend saw me undressed for the first time in months and yelled out your cellulite is gone!!&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li>This was my first time using a product like this.  </li>
            <li>Like all beauty creams/gels/lotions, Procellix works when you consistently use it.</li>
            <li>, there may not be, but this is pretty close!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Obviously it doesn&#x27;t work like magic but it does help.</li>
            <li>Have tried every other cream, this one has definitely proven to be the most effective.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product led by the positive results of research on amilophyline.</li>
            <li>This product really works if you use it consistently and are patient.  </li>
            <li>I also use it with another firming cream, I think on it&#x27;s own, the results would be even less noticeable.</li>
            <li>I thought I got scammed when I bought it from this seller but after searching online and seeing large pictures of the tube it really is \\&quot;caffine\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I really had no idea if this product would even work.  </li>
            <li>Their customer service is non-existent basically and they just ignore you so the days pass by and they are legally allowed to take your money .  </li>
            <li>Had cellulite to resolve and to smooth out, tried all different products in the market</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 4 weeks and do not see much of a change in my cellulite.</li>
            <li>And my legs look much thiner</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li>This product has really helped with cellulite and I will continue using</li>
            <li>your average 36yr old woman with cellulite on the butt &amp; thighs and to be honest, I really do see a difference.</li>
            <li>I stopped using it on a vacation and within a day, my legs immediately rippled back to their original state.</li>
            <li>I have tried other products that work much better and didn&#x27;t bother my skin the way Procellix has.</li>
            <li>I had a hiccup with the delivery of my package and when I reached out to them, not only did they reply very promptly, but made a true effort to ensure my satisfaction with the product and their service.</li>
            <li>the label is full of misspelled ingredient names, such as \\&quot;caffine\\&quot; instead of caffeine.  </li>
            <li>I only chose this product because Dr. Oz said it would work, however it might be a good idea to invest in the more expensive products.</li>
            <li>You will help to release the \\&quot;toxins\\&quot; and hard \\&quot;fat\\&quot;, that holds the \\&quot;water\\&quot; under the skin,causing that uneven aparience(Cellulite).It is a great product!</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a month and a half, and although the cellulite appears to be better, don&#x27;t buy into the hype that it&#x27;s a miracle worker.</li>
            <li>Procellix is a clear gel, practically scentless and dries quite fast on the skin.</li>
            <li>I would suggest using a cellulite brush after applying gel (Bliss has a great one) and massaging troubled area as the gel penetrates the skin.</li>
            <li>More waste of money.  </li>
            <li>The email included a paragraph stating that if I kept the product and did nothing I would be charged for the &amp;#34;free trial&amp;#34; $69.95 and place on autoship for a new bottle to arrive every 30 days with charges to my credit card on file.  </li>
            <li>It seems its comming back since I used the whole bottle!</li>
            <li>I was 9 years old!).</li>
            <li>It is non irritating and absorbs quickly, leaving my skin feeling hydrated and smooth.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find a picture large enough of the procellix label anywhere (except Amazon of course) to compare to the one I received.  </li>
            <li>It looks like a tube of clear gel with a stick on label.</li>
            <li>but I will be watching my credit card statement even more carefully for unknown charges.</li>
            <li>Wow, i can&#x27;t believe this</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to wear shorts and a bikini this summer without feeling self conscious.  </li>
            <li>I have used so many different kinds of anti-cellulite creams, some much more expensive than this, and Procellix was the ONLY product that produced any results.</li>
            <li>So far I don&#x27;t see a difference.  </li>
            <li>The label was the same, but when I used the real procellix, I was noticing a difference in my cellulite.</li>
            <li>I am 22 years old.</li>
            <li>I do workout daily and eat 99% of the time really well.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I saw some subtle differences, but would like to see more.</li>
            <li>I even had to use it only every other day because I was losing too much weight !</li>
            <li>then I have ever paid before (other brands Ive used are much cheaper)</li>
            <li>of course I ordered it from Amazon because it was allegedly much cheaper than on other sites.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also much easier to apply than other creams I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>The changes won&#x27;t happen overnight, but if you use it consistently for a few weeks you will see a difference in cellulite.</li>

            <li> Now I only use it a once a day to maintain my results and my bottle can last as long as two months!</li>
            <li> also my butt had flat spots on the bottom(I</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Hello everybody!  I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about three weeks and I can say It is works.  Easy to apply and absorbs quickly, but of course don&#x27;t expect miracles.</li>
            <li> After searching online for the \\&quot;best\\&quot; cellulite cream, Procellix seemed to be the best choice. At $45...I figured it was worth buying.  Do not buy it from their site as its double the price!.  First off, one of the ingredients advertised in Procellix is caffeine. Im not sure about that as the ingredients on the tube say \\&quot;caffine\\&quot;.  I thought I got scammed when I bought it from this seller but after searching online and seeing large pictures of the tube it really is \\&quot;caffine\\&quot;.  So...Ive now been using Procellix for 2wks religiously...morning and night before going to bed. Im your average 36yr old woman with cellulite on the butt &amp; thighs and to be honest, I really do see a difference. Skin is smoother and somewhat toned.  My cellulite hasnt disappeared but I do see difference. I also have a few stretch marks on my inner thighs and I find Procellix is smoothing them out, they&#x27;re less visible. Im not expecting miracles at $45 but I definitely see a difference. I will give this product a 3month trial. 1 tube per month.  I will buy another 2 tubes from the same seller. Procellix is a clear gel, practically scentless and dries quite fast on the skin. Leaves no residue. Overall I personally give this product a 4/5 star...but I&#x27;ll let you know at the end of 3months what the verdict is :).</li>
            <li> I used this product twice a day on my thighs, strictly following the directions. After six weeks, along with a good diet (no weight gain) and 5 hours of moderate exercise a week, I saw no discernable improvement :(. I am not even overweight and am in decent shape, so I was really hoping this would help that annoyingly stubborn cellulite I&#x27;ve had since my early 30&#x27;s...but this product did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this product!  I saw visible results within the first 3 days of use, and recommend using it longer for optimal results!</li>
            <li> This definitely helps but the results are not miraculous as they appear to be on the company&#x27;s website. I have been using it for a month and a half, and although the cellulite appears to be better, don&#x27;t buy into the hype that it&#x27;s a miracle worker. I also use it with another firming cream, I think on it&#x27;s own, the results would be even less noticeable.</li>
            <li> from the moment i attempted to try this product the experience was horrible.  i tried the 4.99 trial with option to purchase 90 days after checking for a any reaction of product.  i received the product after the trial period.  when i tried to speak with customer service i only reached the call center  who could not help me.  i emailed and was basically told i should have cancelled with in the dates given.  i explained i did not receive the product in the time they had given on their website (obviously didn&#x27;t matter).  i will never do business with this company again.</li>
            <li> I used Procellix gel for the first time and was not impressed. The gel was much more expensive then I have ever paid before (other brands Ive used are much cheaper) and with that said , thought that the results should have been more noticable. I contacted customer services website and sent an e-mail. Hmmmmmm, no response at all to an unhappy customer! I&#x27;m still waiting! Would I reccomend Procellix to anyone? SURE, IF YOU WANT TO PAY A LOT FOR A PRODUCT AND NEVER SEE RESULTS AND HAVE NO ONE CARE TO RESPOND TO YOUR DISSATISFACTION!!</li>
            <li> Dont waist your money in this product, no result at all, just drink lots of water and go to the gym</li>
            <li> Wow, i can&#x27;t believe this but i am only three days into using Procellix and i am already seeing results!! What!! I am so shocked.  I really had no idea if this product would even work.  I am so satisfied with the results! I can&#x27;t wait to wear shorts and a bikini this summer without feeling self conscious.  I recommend this product to anyone seriously looking to finally get rid of their cellulite! Do not be afraid to try this product.  It is worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> Not quite sure about the product, came in a different packaging than advertised. States that the product is a cream but mine is a gel.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 weeks, twice a day, and I have yet to see visible results. For the price, I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this product so of course I ordered it from Amazon because it was allegedly much cheaper than on other sites.  I just received the product and the label is full of misspelled ingredient names, such as \\&quot;caffine\\&quot; instead of caffeine.  I can&#x27;t find a picture large enough of the procellix label anywhere (except Amazon of course) to compare to the one I received.  I don&#x27;t want to use whatever I received if in fact it&#x27;s not the product I thought I was ordering.</li>
            <li> I am a 38yrs old woman with cellulite,since I were 15.I tried almost all cellulite creams,mesotherapy,endermology,body wraps,and body detox pills,tea,.. and my cellulite still hard to remove.Hate it:-(  I have been using \\&quot;PROCELLIX\\&quot; for the past 2 1/2 weeks.I start to see some improvemet on my problems areas(1-10%&#x3D; 1/2% improve).Cellulite it is most of the time genetic,my mom has it,awful ones.Poor circulation it is tha main cause of it.Lack of B-12,iron and vitamins that regulate the proper oxygen on ur blood. Consuming caffeine and alcohol can cause dehydratation and that is something that should be avoid it.I am not over weight and I exercise 2 times per week. Well??\\&quot;PROCELLIX\\&quot; it is working,very slowly,but it is working.Be patience,keep rubbing,avoid all that can cause your cellulite getting worst.If you can use a \\&quot;Cellulite massage brush\\&quot; at the shower will be even better.You will help to release the \\&quot;toxins\\&quot; and hard \\&quot;fat\\&quot;, that holds the \\&quot;water\\&quot; under the skin,causing that uneven aparience(Cellulite).It is a great product! I will post my improvements in 4 weeks to see how it goes! The product I recieved from Amazon it is the same I recieved on the \\&quot;PROCELLIX\\&quot; website!Here it is shipper! Good luck and be \\&quot;PATIENCE\\&quot;:-)</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT DO WHAT IT SAYS IT DOES.  IT DOES NOT SMOOTH OR GET RID OF THE DIMPLES IN YOUR LEGS OR BUTT THIS PRODUCT IS A WASTE OF MONEY DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for two months and am about to reorder &#x3D; time for a review. Procellix actually works!!! I have used so many different kinds of anti-cellulite creams, some much more expensive than this, and Procellix was the ONLY product that produced any results. A little background: I am only 105lbs and I have been dealing with cellulite most of my life. Despite strict diets and rigorous workouts, my legs have always been like cottage cheese :( This is the only cream (more like an odorless gel) that makes my legs noticably smoother and firmer. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. That being said, I must also add that it does not permanently remove cellulite. It tones the thighs temporarily, which is why you MUST apply it twice a day. I stopped using it on a vacation and within a day, my legs immediately rippled back to their original state. Nothing can replace good self esteem and acceptance of your body, but this certainly helps in the short term.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product diligently for 1 month.  I do see a small decrease in dimpling on my thighs.  I give everything a 3 month window before a solid yay or nay.  I&#x27;ll review again in 2 months.</li>
            <li> This gel didn&#x27;t really do much but give me a really good rash.... I have tried other products that work much better and didn&#x27;t bother my skin the way Procellix has.</li>
            <li> I went to the site and tried their \\&quot;Free\\&quot; thing, which is a total scam since they end up charging you $149 even if you return the bottles. Careful! They have their a&#x27;s covered with legal terms and buried clausules so even a complaint to the BBB didnt help. Even when bottles were returned , they didn&#x27;t \\&quot;get them\\&quot;  Their customer service is non-existent basically and they just ignore you so the days pass by and they are legally allowed to take your money .  Their Business Name is  \\&quot;Harvard Securities\\&quot; and they are in Canada.   I did tried the product and saw no improvement, plus it just feels like a watery gel. I think I would rather throw my money on more jeans.</li>
            <li> Had cellulite to resolve and to smooth out, tried all different products in the market but they didn&#x27;t work until i came upon this one and i must tell you, IT WORKS WONDERS after a few weeks i started seeing great results and i fell in love with this product.</li>
            <li> I saw some subtle differences, but would like to see more. I am on my second tube.  I only use it once a day most of the time because that is all I can afford.  I am hoping it continues to help get rid of these unsightly upper legs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 4 weeks and do not see much of a change in my cellulite. I think I&#x27;ve seen a small difference within the past 4 days but I did not see any results within the first 10 days like the bottle said. If there is a difference I&#x27;m feeling like it&#x27;s an illusion I&#x27;m creating to make myself feel like I didn&#x27;t make a bad investment. I only chose this product because Dr. Oz said it would work, however it might be a good idea to invest in the more expensive products. Very unhappy with the product, not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have searched for a long time for a product to use like this.&lt;br /&gt;It is so easy to use and it doesn&#x27;t dirt your clothes!!! Or sticks.&lt;br /&gt;After about 2 weeks I saw a difference in the texture on my body!!!&lt;br /&gt;Must use morning and evening  sometimes used even 3 times!!!&lt;br /&gt;Smoother and softer.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended very much.</li>
            <li> I have a cronic venous problem, and this stuff gives relief.  Very nice product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 weeks.  So far I don&#x27;t see a difference.  I guess, by the comments posted, it begins to be visible in 1 month. So I&#x27;ll be patient....</li>
            <li> Very impressive ! Never seen a product with so great results ! On cellulite and on weight loss also ! I even had to use it only every other day because I was losing too much weight ! Of course my cellulite is not completely gone but it looks so much better ! And my legs look much thiner I&#x27;m starting to get the &amp;#34;thight-gap&amp;#34; ! I am considering using it on my husband&#x27;s belly ^^&lt;br /&gt;I heartily recommend this product !</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed with this product. It&#x27;s too expensive for what it does or shall I say doesn&#x27;t do. I workout 6 days a week so if I was getting any results it&#x27;s from working out not this product.</li>
            <li> I think this product is a fake. I ordered Procellix before and the bottle was completely different. The label was the same, but when I used the real procellix, I was noticing a difference in my cellulite. when i used \\&quot;this\\&quot; procellix, I didn&#x27;t see much of a change at all!! It seems its comming back since I used the whole bottle! Today I went to the Procellix site and placed an order for what I know will be the right product. I hope my summer can be salvaged even though I tried playing it cheap with this stuff.</li>
            <li> The gel received from Dermal Meds doesn&#x27;t look like the picture at all. It looks like a tube of clear gel with a stick on label. It was not in a box, and not sealed except with a piece of packing tape over the lid to keep it from opening. It could be anything, and after two weeks of use, no change in my cellulite. Wonder if this is really PROCELLIX or just a fake?</li>
            <li> More waste of money.  This doesn&#x27;t work, neither does anything else for cellulite, which I believe is a curse on women.  If not, it sure looks and feels like it!</li>
            <li> This is my third tube of Procellix and I can definately tell a difference.  Tested another product using Procellix on one leg and other produce on opposite leg.  Procellix proved to be more effective.  It&#x27;s also much easier to apply than other creams I&#x27;ve tried.  Worth the try.</li>
            <li> I honestly have no knowledge of the product as I cancelled immediately after receiving email confirmation of the &amp;#34;free trial&amp;#34; order.  The email included a paragraph stating that if I kept the product and did nothing I would be charged for the &amp;#34;free trial&amp;#34; $69.95 and place on autoship for a new bottle to arrive every 30 days with charges to my credit card on file.  There was no mention of these charges when I placed the order for &amp;#34;free trial&amp;#34;.  There is no link to contact them and cancel the order or make adjustments to your autoship status, only a phone number.  I was on hold for 15 min before talking to a call center employee that did not address anything I said simple kept reading the script in front of her.  I believe it has cancelled but I will be watching my credit card statement even more carefully for unknown charges.</li>
            <li> I broke out in such bad acne after starting this product!!! This was the only change in my diet, so I know it was the cause. It didn&#x27;t do anything it said it would. I used it all to make sure I did it properly and nothing but acne. When I stopped, the acne slowly healed and I haven&#x27;t had any since. Use Raspberry Ketones instead! Much better results!!!!</li>
            <li> This product really works if you use it consistently and are patient.  It takes several weeks to see results, and you have to continue to use it to maintain those results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely impressed with the customer service provided by Dermal Meds. I had a hiccup with the delivery of my package and when I reached out to them, not only did they reply very promptly, but made a true effort to ensure my satisfaction with the product and their service. I will without a doubt continue ordering from them!</li>
            <li> did not live up to it&#x27;s claim.  too pricey for what it promised, but did not accomplish.</li>
            <li> I am 22 years old. I have had a problem with my butt for years. Not only do i have cellulite on my thighs and butt also my butt had flat spots on the bottom(I assume because my job makes me sit for 66 hours a week) and was not at all shaply and round. I have been using procellix for a little lett then a month and i have seen a different in my over all shape. No more dimples on my bottom and the flat spots are almost gone. My bottom is finally round the way it should be.</li>
            <li> I believe this product works great on reducing cellulite bc my friend saw me undressed for the first time in months and yelled out your cellulite is gone!!&lt;br /&gt;She had no idea I was on the gel. I do workout daily and eat 99% of the time really well.&lt;br /&gt;This gel takes months to notice a difference!</li>
            <li> no. don&#x27;t waste your money, it doesn&#x27;t work at all, and it is expensive for nothing. garbage garbage garbage!!! !!!</li>
            <li> I use once a day, some times tuice, I used different product before, but I think this one will help me a lot</li>
            <li> I am half way to finish the tube and seeing some results already. I will try for another couple weeks.</li>
            <li> I used to use a different product for cellulite removal and that product was about $20 more expensive and did not work as well as the Procellix does so I am very satisfied with this. I have only used it for about a month or so and it already has really good results so it&#x27;s definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li> This has been the best solution for cellulite that I found.  Would highly recommend it to everyone! I only use it once a day after a shower.</li>
            <li> This product has really helped with cellulite and I will continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;Anyone that has stubborn cellulite will love this gel.</li>
            <li> I will never order this product again. It is a waste of money and I would not recommend anyone to buy this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product led by the positive results of research on amilophyline. Unfortunately, after 3 weeks of religious use on my 3-degree cellulite on thighs and butt, I see no improvement. I am not fat, exercise 4x week and my diet is beyond healthy and the fact I have this stubborn cellulite is due to bad nutrition when I was a child (I&#x27;ve had this very cellulite sine I was 9 years old!). I lost all hope that anything can be done about it topically and I will move on to more radical solutions (lipomax ultra-sound treatment).</li>
            <li> To begin with, Procellix gel has a wonderful cool ,clear gel consistency. It is non irritating and absorbs quickly, leaving my skin feeling hydrated and smooth. As the key adjunct to my anti-cellulite exercise/diet program, I am obtaining results I never could have without it. This is my second  order and I continue to see progress in the way my skin looks.  I have found it very comparable to, or better than VelaShape, a very costly spa treatment that requires alot of time and $$$$.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using a product like this.  I really liked the tingly feeling after applying.  I would purchase this product again.  Actually I already have.</li>
            <li> Like all beauty creams/gels/lotions, Procellix works when you consistently use it. The changes won&#x27;t happen overnight, but if you use it consistently for a few weeks you will see a difference in cellulite. Of course, combine using Procellix with a healthy diet and exercise regime, then the results will be even more amazing!! Procellix helps even out the dimply texture that we all hate!! Good luck everyone!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the past year and it has gotten rid of my cellulite completely. I used to have cellulite on the tops of the back of my thighs and a little on the front. By using Procellix in the morning and at night for three months it went away. Now I only use it a once a day to maintain my results and my bottle can last as long as two months! If you have cellulite, this is your solution!</li>
            <li> I really thought I &#x27;fell for&#x27; a line when I ordered this, late one night. I felt silly the next day, thinking I really got took. There just is no miracle in a tube!&lt;br /&gt;Well, there may not be, but this is pretty close!&lt;br /&gt;I did use it, religiously, and saw results. Were they amazing? I thought so. To be able to truly see results from a product in a tube were amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I am over 50 and my body has seen a lot over the years. I am very pleased to say that this product did help to improve things for me!</li>
            <li> Obviously it doesn&#x27;t work like magic but it does help. I would suggest using a cellulite brush after applying gel (Bliss has a great one) and massaging troubled area as the gel penetrates the skin. Drink lots of water to help flesh the fat cells. Best on the market!</li>
            <li> Saw a significant cellulite reduction, great product! Have tried every other cream, this one has definitely proven to be the most effective.</li>
