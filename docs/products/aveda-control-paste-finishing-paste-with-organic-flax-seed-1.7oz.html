            <li>It is an OK product.  </li>
            <li>A much better (similar) product, with more hold, more control and an EXCELLENT smell, that, while seems overpowering from the container, is not overpowering in the hair (and is appealing after applied), would be [[ASIN:B000TZJVBK</li>

            <li>I love this product, it is not greasy and brings a shine to your hair.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for years and love the feel and hold it gives my hair.</li>
            <li>The product&#x27;s best feature is its ability to give a sexy, tousled \\&quot;bed head\\&quot; style that looks natural, not artificial.</li>
            <li>I get my hair colored, but the grays love to stick up along my part and hair line, and this does an excellent job of smoothing them down and keeping them there all</li>
            <li>is easy on the hair and scalp and most importantly-</li>
            <li>Many times I get up the next morning to my hair still looking great.</li>
            <li>Although the product washed out easily, the smell stays on your hair and your hands.  </li>
            <li>easy to wash out.  </li>
            <li>8 - washes out easy.  </li>
            <li>THE CONTROL PASTE HAS A CLEAN SMELL AND HELPS TO MAKE HAIR MORE MANAGEABLE.</li>
            <li>The smell is too strong and overpowering.  </li>
            <li>It smelled so strong, that my eyes started to itch and water.</li>
            <li>The hold was okay, but nothing special.</li>
            <li>The best smoothing cream hands down.</li>
            <li>Also it smells really good, but not too strong and washes out completely.</li>
            <li>I usually warm it to emulsify it in the palm of my hands then add 3 - 4 drops of pure jojoba oil.</li>
            <li>I have short fine hair and this delivers great control and no greasy residue.  </li>
            <li>Control Paste gives hair a high-textured, low-sheen look that&#x27;s smooth, not sticky.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>and this goes on smoothly yet leaves hair feeling (and looking) like hair.</li>
            <li>it allows fine hair to be managed and styled, but nothing special.  </li>
            <li>Control Paste strikes the perfect balance: it offers just the right proportions of shine, hold, and definition to make the style look natural.</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic and works into a warm paste in my hands, then I scrunch my curls and direct my hair the way I want it to go.</li>
            <li>Nothing special - overpowering smell, not suited for hair.  </li>
            <li>The product itself is mushy and soft, kind of like the consistency of Alterna Hemp styling mud.  </li>
            <li>cant say enough GOOD things bout this product..........</li>
            <li>I use this to add a little texture to the ends of my hair and smooth out any fly away pieces.</li>
            <li>I have short, piece-y blonde hair, and I swear by Aveda products (plus it smells AWESOME).  </li>
            <li>My order came so quickly as well.</li>
            <li>thing I do really like about this is that it&#x27;s great for keeping those pesky gray hairs flat.  </li>
            <li>This is my new favorite hair paste.</li>
            <li>gives off a bit of a shine but lasts pretty much a full day.</li>
            <li>Have fun with it..</li>
            <li>IT IS SOOOO WORTH</li>
            <li>This is by far the best product I&#x27;ve used in the past two years and</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take very much for each application.</li>
            <li>While I love the smell and the texture of it, I&#x27;ve found that it just doesn&#x27;t hold my layers in place in a lasting way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I love the idea of using an organic product on my hair, but this just doesn&#x27;t provide the lasting hold I need to bring out my hair&#x27;s texture and layers, even though it&#x27;s designed to do just that.</li>
            <li>On top of it, it&#x27;s perhaps the best-smelling personal grooming product I&#x27;ve ever smelled!</li>
            <li>Like most of the Aveda products through Amazon and its third party sellers, you&#x27;re going to get hit with a hefty mark-up for the privilege of buying online.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely will reorder and tell more people about this product....</li>
            <li>This is great for short hair and long hair.</li>
            <li>it goes on clear smells GREAT and doesn&#x27;t make your hair look stiff and wind blown...</li>
            <li>I love Aveda products, and I wanted to change my hair style from having it long, and got it cut</li>
            <li>Good product, but Amazon artificially inflates the retail cost to make it seem like a good deal when it is cheaper to buy from a store or from Aveda directly.</li>
            <li>And most products are either too shiny or too dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of this product and have been using it since it first became available.  </li>
            <li>Now I won&#x27;t be able to live without it until my hair grows back.</li>
            <li>If you have so much hair that you need to glob the stuff on it will not work well.  </li>
            <li>It makes your hair stick straight up.</li>
            <li>Seems to hold my hair into place without too much goop.  </li>
            <li>I rub it between my hands w/ Aveda&#x27;s Light Elements fluid (after blow-dry) and bam - I&#x27;m out the door.  </li>
            <li>I really like the hold without the hair feeling stuck in place.</li>
            <li>I had so much hope for this product...</li>
            <li>even though it&#x27;s a little more than I would normally pay - listen, it&#x27;s truly worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even tried zapping my hair with hairspray, and have tried layering other products on top of the Control Paste, but nothing seems to keep those layers standing out.  </li>
            <li>I agree with the other reviewer that your hair looks better as the day goes on.</li>
            <li>and I still have my edges and a little bit goes a long way, plus it smells great too</li>
            <li>My hair is normal wavy and curly, and I need to straighten it, this does not work well if you do not have naturally straight</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down like most of them.</li>
            <li>BUT, but I have to say, the prices I&#x27;ve seen on Amazon are way too high for this stuff..</li>
            <li>However the cost of shipping are much to high.</li>
            <li>Most products are too heavy, causing the hair to clump together in spiky pieces.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve also experimented with various methods for applying it, and it seems to work best if you emulsify it between your fingertips (not in your palms) for a few seconds, and then use your fingertips to go down individual chunks or sections of that hair that you want to piece</li>
            <li>It is a little too greasy for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>As an african-american women, they are certain products that are must-haves and this is definitely one of them.  </li>
            <li>This holds my hair up fine without it feeling stiff like gel.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>This control paste laid them down, added sheen without looking greasy and keep them in place all day long without applying more.  </li>
            <li>When I first apply it, the layers in my hair really stand out, but they disappear in less than an hour.</li>
            <li>My hair is currently cut into a layered bob that reaches about two inches past my ears, and I&#x27;m trying to grow it out a bit more.  </li>
            <li>My hair stylist introduced me to this product, when she did my hair a few weeks back as I refuse to perm my hair; and I swear this control paste left my edges looking better than if I did have a perm.  </li>
            <li>so I could try something new, like trying a quiff and the spiky look that is coming back.</li>
            <li>I’m very sensitive to scents in products and this is the only one I’ve tried that hasn’t bothered me.</li>
            <li>If you have short hair and want that separated yet natural look that movie, music, tv stars often have than this is the product to do it.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve barely made a dent.</li>
            <li>I just dab my finger in it and smooth it on my edges then brush it down, and i also just place a little on the ends of my bangs to keep them place and not flying everywhere.</li>
            <li>If you use more than a small amount it does make your hair heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li>You should use just a little right after a shower while your hair is damp (not soaked, but not yet dry).  </li>
            <li>This stuf (used very sparingly daily on damp or dry hair restores moisture and allows minimal damage from hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;P.S.</li>
            <li>If you have little girls and don&#x27;t want to get into using a bunch of chemicals on their hair or your natural - this is the product for you!!!  </li>

            <li> However the cost of shipping are much to high.</li>
            <li> Most products are too heavy, causing the hair to clump together in spiky pieces.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also experimented with various methods for applying it, and it seems to work best if you emulsify it between your fingertips (not in your palms) for a few seconds, and then use your fingertips to go down individual chunks or sections of that hair that you want to piece</li>
            <li> It is a little too greasy for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> As an african-american women, they are certain products that are must-haves and this is definitely one of them.  </li>
            <li> This holds my hair up fine without it feeling stiff like gel.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> This control paste laid them down, added sheen without looking greasy and keep them in place all day long without applying more.  </li>
            <li> When I first apply it, the layers in my hair really stand out, but they disappear in less than an hour.</li>
            <li> My hair is currently cut into a layered bob that reaches about two inches past my ears, and I&#x27;m trying to grow it out a bit more.  </li>
            <li> My hair stylist introduced me to this product, when she did my hair a few weeks back as I refuse to perm my hair; and I swear this control paste left my edges looking better than if I did have a perm.  </li>
            <li> so I could try something new, like trying a quiff and the spiky look that is coming back.</li>
            <li> I’m very sensitive to scents in products and this is the only one I’ve tried that hasn’t bothered me.</li>
            <li> If you have short hair and want that separated yet natural look that movie, music, tv stars often have than this is the product to do it.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve barely made a dent.</li>
            <li> I just dab my finger in it and smooth it on my edges then brush it down, and i also just place a little on the ends of my bangs to keep them place and not flying everywhere.</li>
            <li> If you use more than a small amount it does make your hair heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li> You should use just a little right after a shower while your hair is damp (not soaked, but not yet dry).  </li>
            <li> This stuf (used very sparingly daily on damp or dry hair restores moisture and allows minimal damage from hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;P.S.</li>
            <li> If you have little girls and don&#x27;t want to get into using a bunch of chemicals on their hair or your natural - this is the product for you!!!  </li>
            <li> I figured Aveda products wouldn&#x27;t smell so harsh since it&#x27;s supposed to be made with natural ingredients, NOT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands, and even other Aveda lines, but nothing works nearly as well for my frizzy hair.      </li>
            <li> I occasionally try a different paste, thinking I can save a few bucks... and always come back to Aveda.</li>
            <li> I let my hair air dry after I wash it, and put this in when either still a bit damp or totally dry.</li>
            <li> I left it open one night and the paste dried up quite a bit.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Loose and piece-y, or stand-up and messy-new</li>
            <li> only down side is ...</li>
            <li> only need a small amount to work and last all day....</li>
            <li> The other review here was from a girl with long hair that didn&#x27;t like this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid to use this if you have fine hair - it actually gives your hair a LOT of body and you can use less hairspray.  </li>
            <li> No real hold at all, and no real texture.  </li>
            <li> Does not really &amp;#34;control&amp;#34; my edges the way I was hoping.</li>
            <li> I have thin straight hair.</li>
            <li> Perhaps my hair is too thick, but the layers just sink back into the rest of my hair a short while after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I am a woman with just below the jaw length, heavy thick hair with a natural wave.</li>
            <li> The consistency is a a little oily, although it doe snot make the hair oily.  </li>
            <li> IT HAS A LITTLE STIFFNESS TO CONTROL YOUR HAIR.</li>
            <li> It helps with volume and control without being too heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like anything too heavy or greasy</li>
            <li> I recommend this product as I ahve used it before but it came partially dried out.</li>
            <li> Has very little hold strength.</li>
            <li> I usually check amazon before purchasing at the store because often it is cheaper here,  </li>
            <li> Did not give it a 10 since the smell is hard to get rid of, even after washing.  </li>
            <li> Your hair won&#x27;t be hard and start falling out because of this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even remember when I bought this stuff, but it&#x27;s been at least six months</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy with thick hair (a lot of it)</li>
            <li> Cons: SMELL - which remains even after washing out product, hardly any hold, too thin a consistency.  </li>
            <li> It is not good for my hair texture...</li>
            <li> Horrible for natural unprocessed hair!!!!</li>
            <li> It allows one to style their hair with precision and ease without being too expensive or having any negative side effects that I&#x27;ve noticed.</li>
            <li> Smell: 0 - zero points for smell - worst aspect of this product, although the smell is typical Aveda.  </li>
            <li> Drove my GF crazy</li>
            <li> It can recover you from a bad haircut.  </li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Retuning it, and very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> As an african-american women, they are certain products that are must-haves and this is definitely one of them.  My hair stylist introduced me to this product, when she did my hair a few weeks back as I refuse to perm my hair; and I swear this control paste left my edges looking better than if I did have a perm.  This control paste laid them down, added sheen without looking greasy and keep them in place all day long without applying more.  If you have little girls and don&#x27;t want to get into using a bunch of chemicals on their hair or your natural - this is the product for you!!!  You&#x27;ll love it and the good thing is - you don&#x27;t need a lot.  So it will last.</li>
            <li> This product works well for longer hair as well, you should not be using more than a nickel sized amount otherwise it will be overwhelmingly sticky and gunky. I just dab my finger in it and smooth it on my edges then brush it down, and i also just place a little on the ends of my bangs to keep them place and not flying everywhere. The great thing is that this product doesn&#x27;t build up.</li>
            <li> My hair is currently cut into a layered bob that reaches about two inches past my ears, and I&#x27;m trying to grow it out a bit more.  This product was recommended to me on a beauty forum as a great product to \\&quot;piece out\\&quot; the layers.  While I love the smell and the texture of it, I&#x27;ve found that it just doesn&#x27;t hold my layers in place in a lasting way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the product description, Control Paste is meant to help create texture:  \\&quot;Loose and piece-y, or stand-up and messy-new Control Paste gives hair a high-textured, low-sheen look that&#x27;s smooth, not sticky.\\&quot;  When I first apply it, the layers in my hair really stand out, but they disappear in less than an hour. I&#x27;ve even tried zapping my hair with hairspray, and have tried layering other products on top of the Control Paste, but nothing seems to keep those layers standing out.  Perhaps my hair is too thick, but the layers just sink back into the rest of my hair a short while after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also experimented with various methods for applying it, and it seems to work best if you emulsify it between your fingertips (not in your palms) for a few seconds, and then use your fingertips to go down individual chunks or sections of that hair that you want to piece out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I do really like about this is that it&#x27;s great for keeping those pesky gray hairs flat.  I get my hair colored, but the grays love to stick up along my part and hair line, and this does an excellent job of smoothing them down and keeping them there all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love the idea of using an organic product on my hair, but this just doesn&#x27;t provide the lasting hold I need to bring out my hair&#x27;s texture and layers, even though it&#x27;s designed to do just that. For that reason, I would give it 3 1/2 stars.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years and love it</li>
            <li> gives off a bit of a shine but lasts pretty much a full day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product for permed hair .... Horrible for natural unprocessed hair!!!!</li>
            <li> The other review here was from a girl with long hair that didn&#x27;t like this stuff.  I am a guy with short hair.  I think that&#x27;s what makes all the difference.  If you have short hair and want that separated yet natural look that movie, music, tv stars often have than this is the product to do it.  It can recover you from a bad haircut.  They say to use an amount the size of a pea or a dime or something like that.  If you have so much hair that you need to glob the stuff on it will not work well.  You should use just a little right after a shower while your hair is damp (not soaked, but not yet dry).  Give it a good toweling then apply immediately.  Have fun with it.. it can shape your hair anyways you want yet when it dries it looks like it was supposed to be shaped that way.  Not like some pomades that leave you looking like a greased weasel.  Also it smells really good, but not too strong and washes out completely.</li>
            <li> I am a woman with just below the jaw length, heavy thick hair with a natural wave. I let my hair air dry after I wash it, and put this in when either still a bit damp or totally dry. It&#x27;s fantastic! It smells great and makes your hair look wonderful. I agree with the other reviewer that your hair looks better as the day goes on. Many times I get up the next morning to my hair still looking great. I can&#x27;t live without this.</li>
            <li> Aveda Control Paste smells like massage oil. The smell is too strong and overpowering.  It would be an excellent smell for a massage oil, but it is not suited for hair.  Although the product washed out easily, the smell stays on your hair and your hands.  Drove my GF crazy; I myself could not sleep even after showering - I stopped using it after one use.  The product seems to be a hardened, cake-paste, like Jonathan Dirt, which is what I prefer.  However, once you scoop some out, it seems the hard-paste consistency is only one-layer deep.  The product itself is mushy and soft, kind of like the consistency of Alterna Hemp styling mud.  The consistency is a a little oily, although it doe snot make the hair oily.  When running hands through the hair, it feels like if there was sand in your hair.  PROS: Ease of use.  easy to wash out.  Cons: SMELL - which remains even after washing out product, hardly any hold, too thin a consistency.  Hold: 2 - next to having no product. About the hold of a leave-in conditioner.  Control: 5 - it allows fine hair to be managed and styled, but nothing special.  Smell: 0 - zero points for smell - worst aspect of this product, although the smell is typical Aveda.  Washing Out: 8 - washes out easy.  Did not give it a 10 since the smell is hard to get rid of, even after washing.  Ease of Use: 10 - no science, just scoop, rub palms together, and apply.  Feel  in the hair: 9 - feels like there is no product in the hair.  Humidity Resistance: 2 - will eventually get puffy in humid weather.  Bottom line: No real hold at all, and no real texture.  It is an OK product.  Nothing special - overpowering smell, not suited for hair.  A much better (similar) product, with more hold, more control and an EXCELLENT smell, that, while seems overpowering from the container, is not overpowering in the hair (and is appealing after applied), would be [[ASIN:B000TZJVBK Jonathan Product Dirt Texturizing Paste - 1.7 oz.]].</li>
            <li> Great product,  but overpriced.  I usually check amazon before purchasing at the store because often it is cheaper here,  not so with this product.  Retails at $24 at the salon, so I will buy locally. I&#x27;ve used this on my pixie cut for years.  It smells wonderful and is not sticky.  Gives me just enough shine and texture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy with thick hair (a lot of it) and I have always struggled to find a good hair product to help me shape it. This is by far the best product I&#x27;ve used in the past two years and the price on Amazon.com is the lowest out there.</li>
            <li> I occasionally try a different paste, thinking I can save a few bucks... and always come back to Aveda. This stuff is absolutely the best!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid to use this if you have fine hair - it actually gives your hair a LOT of body and you can use less hairspray.  Jar lasts 2-3 months depending on how often you wash your hair.</li>
            <li> I have short fine hair and this delivers great control and no greasy residue.  It smells really good, too.  Buy it now!</li>
            <li> Does not really &amp;#34;control&amp;#34; my edges the way I was hoping. Has very little hold strength. It is softening and smells great but works more like a moisturizer than a finishing paste.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It helps with volume and control without being too heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> I love Aveda products, and I wanted to change my hair style from having it long, and got it cut so I could try something new, like trying a quiff and the spiky look that is coming back. It makes your hair stick straight up. My hair is normal wavy and curly, and I need to straighten it, this does not work well if you do not have naturally straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retuning it, and very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Good product, but Amazon artificially inflates the retail cost to make it seem like a good deal when it is cheaper to buy from a store or from Aveda directly.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has been using this product for several years now. He&#x27;s experimented with just about every pomade, wax, paste or clay at every price level, but keeps returning to Aveda Control Paste as his default styling medium.     The product&#x27;s best feature is its ability to give a sexy, tousled \\&quot;bed head\\&quot; style that looks natural, not artificial. Most products are too heavy, causing the hair to clump together in spiky pieces. And most products are either too shiny or too dry. Control Paste strikes the perfect balance: it offers just the right proportions of shine, hold, and definition to make the style look natural. On top of it, it&#x27;s perhaps the best-smelling personal grooming product I&#x27;ve ever smelled!</li>
            <li> It is not good for my hair texture... And I don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> I cut my hair very short and then bleached it nearly white…kind of feel like I&#x27;m channeling Billy Idol or Andy Warhol. My hair is now damaged and breaking. This stuf (used very sparingly daily on damp or dry hair restores moisture and allows minimal damage from hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I usually warm it to emulsify it in the palm of my hands then add 3 - 4 drops of pure jojoba oil. Works great. Now I won&#x27;t be able to live without it until my hair grows back.</li>
            <li> perfect for adding texture to short hair.</li>
            <li> works great for curly hair</li>
            <li> My hairstylist uses this after my cut and style.  Seems to hold my hair into place without too much goop.  Love the way is smells too.</li>
            <li> I have short, piece-y blonde hair, and I swear by Aveda products (plus it smells AWESOME).  I rub it between my hands w/ Aveda&#x27;s Light Elements fluid (after blow-dry) and bam - I&#x27;m out the door.  BUT, but I have to say, the prices I&#x27;ve seen on Amazon are way too high for this stuff..</li>
            <li> Excellent for managing curls and waves and the scent is terrific.</li>
            <li> I use this daily with my coarse, curly hair.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always concerned with whether any paste / gel will break my edges, but this one seems to work great and I still have my edges and a little bit goes a long way, plus it smells great too</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of this product and have been using it since it first became available.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands, and even other Aveda lines, but nothing works nearly as well for my frizzy hair.      But if you have an Aveda salon nearby, don&#x27;t bother buying it here.  Like most of the Aveda products through Amazon and its third party sellers, you&#x27;re going to get hit with a hefty mark-up for the privilege of buying online.  Support your local salon and get it from them!</li>
            <li> My favorite hair product period</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and was glad to find a great price on it. My order came so quickly as well. Exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even remember when I bought this stuff, but it&#x27;s been at least six months and I&#x27;ve barely made a dent. It&#x27;s great for putting on the ends of hair to flip up the ends or to give that tousled look, but use sparingly. If you use more than a small amount it does make your hair heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite hair paste. It smells good, and doesn&#x27;t leave any residues.</li>
            <li> Been using it for years. I really like the hold without the hair feeling stuck in place. I’m very sensitive to scents in products and this is the only one I’ve tried that hasn’t bothered me.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR SEVERAL YEARS. MY HAIR DRESSER INTRODUCED ME TO AVEDA PRODUCTS YEARS AGO. THE CONTROL PASTE HAS A CLEAN SMELL AND HELPS TO MAKE HAIR MORE MANAGEABLE. ITS NOT GREASY IT HAS A LITTLE STIFFNESS TO CONTROL YOUR HAIR. GREAT PRODUCT INSTEAD OF USING HAIR SPRAY OR GEL.</li>
            <li> cant say enough GOOD things bout this product..........it goes on clear smells GREAT and doesn&#x27;t make your hair look stiff and wind blown...only need a small amount to work and last all day....I would recommend this product to EVERYBODY....I will definitely will reorder and tell more people about this product....only down side is ...I think its a bit costly</li>
            <li> This is the &amp;#34;BEST&amp;#34; control paste &amp;#34;EVER&amp;#34;!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. It smells fantastic and works into a warm paste in my hands, then I scrunch my curls and direct my hair the way I want it to go. It doesn&#x27;t take very much for each application. Yes, this is a regular on my list, even though it&#x27;s a little more than I would normally pay - listen, it&#x27;s truly worth it.</li>
            <li> I love this hair product. I don&#x27;t like anything too heavy or greasy and this goes on smoothly yet leaves hair feeling (and looking) like hair. It also smells divine, like all Aveda botanical products.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for then 6 years and I love it. This holds my hair up fine without it feeling stiff like gel.</li>
            <li> This is great for short hair and long hair. I have thin straight hair. I use this to add a little texture to the ends of my hair and smooth out any fly away pieces. a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I recommend this product as I ahve used it before but it came partially dried out. Will not orded it online again.</li>
            <li> This stuff. Wow. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year now and it smells great, is easy on the hair and scalp and most importantly- does the job. Your hair won&#x27;t be hard and start falling out because of this. It allows one to style their hair with precision and ease without being too expensive or having any negative side effects that I&#x27;ve noticed. I&#x27;ll buy this until it&#x27;s discontinued.</li>
            <li> Good stuff- easy to use and a great price.</li>
            <li> The best smoothing cream hands down. Doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down like most of them. I have natural(AA) hair and have used this product on my edges for a week with no wash and still doesn&#x27;t feel gunky! IT IS SOOOO WORTH THE PRICE!</li>
            <li> Works well, don&#x27;t forget to always close it up. I left it open one night and the paste dried up quite a bit.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it is not greasy and brings a shine to your hair. However the cost of shipping are much to high.</li>
            <li> great product. use it everday.</li>
            <li> It is a little too greasy for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for years and love the feel and hold it gives my hair. I like the smell, too.</li>
            <li> I had so much hope for this product... I figured Aveda products wouldn&#x27;t smell so harsh since it&#x27;s supposed to be made with natural ingredients, NOT! It smelled so strong, that my eyes started to itch and water. I had to return it. The hold was okay, but nothing special. Too bad.</li>
