    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Excellent results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned Oral-B brushes forever, and this is the best one yet.  </li>
            <li>Whether it&#x27;s the best thing on the market, I have no idea.  </li>
            <li>This Oral B electric toothbrush is wonderful.</li>
            <li>The Oral-B ProfessionalCare series is the top-of-the-line offering, and arguably the best in the industry.  </li>
            <li>But, we are very happy.</li>
            <li>My teeth and gums are very happy with the change...  </li>
            <li>-&gt;  :D</li>
            <li>All in all, I am very happy I switch to the Oral-B.</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>A++ Best price found.</li>
            <li>Very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li>Yes, I think it is a wonderful toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The OralCare System does an excellent job of cleaning both the teeth and the gums.</li>
            <li>I am very impressed with all the attachments and have used all of them.  </li>
            <li>The Oral-B 8850 DLX Electric Toothbrush works great!  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush is great!  </li>
            <li>but I am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>I was especially pleased when she told me that she noticed her teeth getting whiter and her mouth feeling fresher.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush is the best electric we have owned.</li>
            <li>I was so impressed with it that I bought my daughter one for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>i ordered the best.  </li>
            <li>Great!</li>
            <li>Both do an excellent job.</li>
            <li>I am truly, truly impressed.</li>
            <li>Very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>A great brush at a great value!</li>
            <li>This toothbrush does a great job at a great price!  </li>
            <li>I am very glad we switched!</li>
            <li>I was happy for those 2 weeks,</li>
            <li>the cleaning outcome is really great.     </li>
            <li>The 2 minute timer is great</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush.     </li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>This is a great system -  </li>
            <li>this is a great toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>A great oral care tool.</li>
            <li>I bought this item &amp; it works great.</li>
            <li>This has been a great toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>but it probably doesn&#x27;t hurt, and the two-year warranty on the 8850 is a win.</li>
            <li>30 seconds per mouth quadrant works great for me.</li>
            <li>Great for coffee and tea drinkers.</li>
            <li>and it works great.</li>
            <li>My dentist says its a great toothbrush too.</li>
            <li>The unit is great.  </li>
            <li>I had been happily using Sonicare for about seven years.  </li>
            <li>Great toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>It works great; it comes with lots of accessories too.  </li>
            <li>battery life is great, seems quite durable and well built.  </li>
            <li>The variety of brushes was nice to try and pick which one works best for me.</li>
            <li>From a performance standpoint, it is still a great toothbrush</li>
            <li>The battery life is great, still works like I just bought it...</li>
            <li>That wasn&#x27;t very good, but I like the way it works, and my checkups have been good since using it - much better than when I was using a manual brush, and that&#x27;s the bottom line for me.</li>
            <li>and I feel like I&#x27;m doing good things for my teeth.</li>
            <li>This product is superior, IMO, to both.</li>
            <li>The speed is good without being punishing.  </li>
            <li>I had problems with my gums receeding and was told that they were in good shape now.</li>
            <li>These were the 2 areas I bought the 8850 for and seems to be doing a good job.</li>
            <li>, I switched to this system and am delighted with it.</li>
            <li>I loved that one</li>
            <li>You spend more but the results are incredible.</li>
            <li>This has been a good buy.</li>
            <li>Good toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;i will continue to use it , for one, i dont feel like returning it, for another, it&#x27;s suppose to be good for my teeth ..</li>
            <li>and I wanted a good toothbrush that would help with this problem.  </li>
            <li>expectation: a good rapid substitute for flossing.</li>
            <li>She has been very pleased.  </li>
            <li>Admittedly, some will find the Triumph handles slightly more attractive.  </li>
            <li>but I am very pleased by my purchase.  </li>
            <li>Although I have a couple of friends who purchased the Oral B and love it, I&#x27;ll admit that I had some reservations up front as to whether I would be happy with it.   </li>
            <li>Easy to use, good quality, and does a great job.  </li>
            <li>Oral B seems like the best product out there right now to me.  </li>
            <li>Oral-B is the one that is the most effective and a great value.</li>
            <li>I have always liked oral-b and they have an exceptional toothbrush with this electric one.</li>
            <li>But a more functional item!</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product for keeping those cavities at bay.  </li>
            <li>Just amazing.</li>
            <li>The duel head is amazing.</li>
            <li>am also thrilled that this one has a wall</li>
            <li>More technology is not always good.</li>
            <li>A slimmer shaft would be nice like the newer Sonicare.</li>
            <li>carrying case would have also been nice and the charging indicator is like having a airport landing beacon in your bathroom.</li>
            <li>The bonus to the deluxe model is that there is a compartment that holds (and keeps covered) 4 toothbrush heads.  </li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>The dentist always says how nice my teeth look.</li>
            <li>Bob and Brenda Loving</li>
            <li>spend most of my time in undeveloped countries and do not have access to good dental care.</li>
            <li>Seems well made, nice timing features</li>
            <li>Absolutely, one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made.</li>
            <li>and I would never have bought the unit with that kind warranty.  </li>
            <li>When this was on a special deal I ordered it and am once again happy with my toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>It works wonderfully, leaving your teeth feeling squeeky clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>I really liked this toothbrush until I discovered that it didn&#x27;t hold a charge for more than 2 brushings.  </li>
            <li>timer feature might be useful, but that depends greatly on how you brush.</li>
            <li>In my experience, the Sonicaire is a much more effective product for the money.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best toothbrush i&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li>Good to clean the tongue and gingival at lower speed.</li>
            <li>If you have never used an electric toothbrush before you may want to buy something VERY cheap just to see if your teeth/gums can handle it.</li>
            <li>This item is ideal for the application of whitening agents and the overall results are phenomenal!  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>just a bit more effort.    </li>
            <li>buy this sytem, and enjoy!</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this purchase and look forward to showing my dentist my much improved smile.</li>
            <li>There is really no reason not to own an excellent product like this.</li>
            <li>but it is slimmer and allows a better grip and more control over the thicker Triumph series units.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;an oral irrigator with innovative micro-bubble technology\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, I suspect there is an increase in battery capacity as you move up from the 7000 series through 8000 and up to the 9000&#x27;s, but I have not been able to verify through documentation.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with my choice.</li>
            <li>Simply put: this is an excellent product.</li>
            <li>We love it.</li>
            <li>I would like to have a better idea of the sweet-spot, as it were, for pressure.  </li>
            <li>The one before this lasted for many years.  </li>
            <li>It cleaned my teeth much better then Sonicare.</li>
            <li>I am glad for the switch.</li>
            <li>I love the pushing/vibrating feel against my teeth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly more waterproof (I had problems with water getting into the housing of the others).</li>
            <li>Most of my family has gum problems: my husband, my step-mother, my step-sister...</li>
            <li>If your looking for a great electric toothbrush I would highly recommend this one!  </li>
            <li>A couple of years ago I bought a battery-operated toothbrush (Crest) and it did a much better job of cleaning my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love it</li>
            <li>My Periodontist recommended the Oral B line of motorized toothbrushes, so I picked this and love it.</li>
            <li>If this toothbrush came with a smaller travel charger, it would indeed be absolutely perfect.</li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with this product and purchased it to leave with my wife in China until she clears immigration.</li>
            <li>and the product seems to be OK--</li>
            <li>My wife and I have been using this for about a month now and both of us really love the job it does.  </li>
            <li>and I knew I needed to do MORE to take better care of my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>I believe this is one of the better ways for me to take the best care of my teeth as is possible</li>
            <li>Head has already lasted longer than most Cheapos&#x27;</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>so many years of going through brushes and trying to protect gums and hit all the corners  </li>
            <li>My dentist says my teeth have never been cleaner -- better placque removal than during all the years I used successive Sonicares.  </li>
            <li>I love the Oral B - Dentist was amazed and reduced plaque and cleaning    </li>
            <li>Could an electric toothbrush do that much better?    </li>
            <li>This is so much better.</li>
            <li>Make sure you read the directions</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of my \\&quot;favorite things.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>The FlexiSoft are better ones.</li>
            <li>If two or more people use the brush, then you will need to switch out the heads.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m still very happy for purchasing this product.</li>
            <li>A cheapie Walgreens manual tongue scraper does a much better job.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was my first time using &amp; purchasing an electric toothbrush, I chose Oral B because of the many good reviews.     </li>
            <li>My teeth feel nice and clean;</li>
            <li>It does a great job, has different options to customize it to your needs, easy to grip, &amp; it does a good job.  </li>
            <li>The battery has never been very good at holding a charge for more than one or two days so it was not possible to take along on a trip without taking the charger.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been so excited about brushing my teeth!  </li>
            <li>I had been using a Sonicaire Elite for over 5 years with great results, but that unit died and it was time for something new.</li>
            <li>It gives two quick pauses while you are brushing to let you know to switch to another section of your mouth, which is handy.</li>
            <li>that the Sonicare ones making this brush more economical to own.  </li>
            <li>the brush and handle are easy to keep clean, which is nice considering that this is a tool that you put in your mouth.</li>
            <li>I persisted with my new routine, the bleeding stopped, my breath was much improved and my latest annual checkup got me a perfect score.</li>
            <li>They just didn&#x27;t work for me (more accurately, I should say the one I tried didn&#x27;t work).</li>
            <li>Also wipe the drive shaft to be sure it is free of any moisture.  </li>
            <li>It keeps them dust free and out of site... and that&#x27;s two things I love in a toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the \\&quot;dual action\\&quot; head, and the polisher in conjunction with Arm &amp; Hammer Advance White Brilliant Sparkle Baking Soda toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been great so far.</li>
            <li>and there are many others available.     </li>
            <li>It really feels like your getting a good cleaning.</li>
            <li>The brushes detach/attach easily, but never feel like they will fall off.</li>
            <li>I love the squeaky clean feeling on my teeth.</li>
            <li>Its easy &amp; does its job.</li>
            <li>The size fits my hand well, and it seems just as easy to use as their others.</li>
            <li>I have had it for a month and have found it easy to use and maintain.</li>
            <li>recharge easily, allowing me to \\&quot;top-off\\&quot; the batteries after each use.</li>
            <li>I have been very lucky with Amazon and prices.</li>
            <li>expectation: To clean better.</li>
            <li>expectation: To clean my tongue better.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#8220;charging&amp;#8221; light is annoyingly bright on the Oral-B (so much so that you&amp;#8217;ll need to close the door from the bedroom to bathroom if you want to sleep).  </li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend buying this item to anyone who is in the market for an electric toothbrush -</li>
            <li>Strong edge to Oral-B.</li>
            <li>Strong edge to Oral-B.</li>
            <li>My teeth are looking pretty nice.    </li>
            <li>The 2 minute timer is pretty nice even though I don&#x27;t pay attention to it at all.  </li>
            <li>Loved it since the first time i used it you feel your teeth totelly clean, it is quick and effective, the battery lasts almost a week, it is made in germany and you definitely feel it is good quality</li>
            <li>/&gt;In conclusion the toothbrush is fine</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for multiple users and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean and you can get replacement brush heads inexpensively on eBay.  </li>
            <li>suggestion: may be the can provide sound alert instead of a shout pause.</li>
            <li>The charging light goes off after fully charged.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ve used and like the cheap Oral-Bs and want something that will last for more than a month, the 8850 would be a good alternative.</li>
            <li>Short story is I have returned the Oral B to the manufacturer under their great 60 Day Challenge policy.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the brush and the timer it has with it.</li>
            <li>Light weight, compact.  </li>
            <li>But overall the brushing experience is great and my teeth feel cleaner than I could ever get them with a manual brush.</li>
            <li>and I had a cheap version of Oral B.</li>
            <li>Also, the Oral-B heads come with nice color-coded rings so you can keep them straight.</li>
            <li>It feels cheap.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;In fairness, this toothbrush probably merits a 3.5, and if I get a great bill-of-health from my dentist at my next checkup, I&#x27;ll revise this review to a 4.  </li>
            <li>Figured it was somehow &#x27;better&#x27; since it was &#x27;professional&#x27; and &#x27;deluxe.&#x27;</li>
            <li>it&#x27;ll probably need cleaning more often, and it&#x27;s pretty easy to knock over.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not convinced that electric brushes in general are more effective than a properly-used manual.</li>
            <li>A great addition to my vanity full of stuff the last week of December 2006.  </li>
            <li>Not much can be said about a product that is pretty perfect in every respect.</li>
            <li>Good to control if you clean more time or less time than appropriate.</li>
            <li>I actually enjoy brushing for the full 2-minutes, which is made easier by the 30-second timer built into the handle.</li>
            <li>Triumph models add an actualLCD display into the brush handle so you can see exactly how many seconds you&#x27;ve been brushing.  </li>
            <li>The high-end Triumph series is for those willing to pay more for gadgetry and aesthetics.</li>
            <li>exactly how many seconds you&#x27;ve been brushing.  </li>
            <li>The high-end Triumph series is for those willing to pay more for gadgetry and aesthetics.</li>
            <li>There is definately a significant difference in the texture as well as the shade of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the first one based on the reviews in here and glad I took the time to do some research.</li>
            <li>I find no problem in keeping it clean.  </li>
            <li>This is a totally different product - much more effective.  </li>
            <li>With the Sonicare toothbrush, I had to unscrew the head from the handle once a week and using a Q-tip, wipe the inside clean from the buildup.  </li>
            <li>My teeth never felt so clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But how does the Oral B clean?  </li>
            <li>There is also a device to attach to clean your tongue which seems to work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several eletric toothbrushes over the years and this one is the best by far.  </li>
            <li>I bought this toothbrush a week ago and I can already feel the difference in how my gums feel and how clean my teeth feel.</li>
            <li>I bought this professional care deluxe toothbrush because it was considered one of the higher end Oral B toothbrushes and it came with many attachments.  </li>
            <li>my teeth feel much cleaner afterward - very smooth like after you visit the dentist.  </li>
            <li>I have not really tried all of the features, but it does a great job with just brushing.</li>
            <li>The gadgets that ship with the deluxe kit are pretty much a joke in my opinion.</li>
            <li>My husband and I have had Sonicare brushes for years, but decided to switch to these because brush head refills were cheaper, and we liked the \\&quot;spin\\&quot; action.  </li>
            <li>I could never use anything else after being introduced to such an incredibly superior product.  </li>
            <li>My point is that there *are* differences, and you may very well find one electric works better than another.</li>
            <li>really works any better than their others...</li>
            <li>I love the polisher brush it really does wonders if you have any stains on your teeth.</li>
            <li>Thank you Oral-B for such a superior and well-made product.</li>
            <li>Yes.  Amazingly better in a much shorter amount of time.  </li>
            <li>Both my daughter and my friend love it as much as I do.  </li>
            <li>Manual flossing is just as fast and seems much more thorough.  </li>
            <li>I used a regular toothbrush for many many years but never felt that I ever got my teeth really clean.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush works fine, but I paid extra for the deluxe</li>
            <li>It really seems to have made a difference in cleaning up the plaque and keeping my teeth very clean.</li>
            <li>My hygenist mentioned that some people greatly prefer the Sonicare brushes, and they can&#x27;t be that bad all around because many people are successfully using them.</li>
            <li>It charges quickly and lasts around a week.  </li>
            <li>The round head is best for me as it reaches around all the teeth very well.  </li>
            <li>this toothbrush has helped me improve me regimen tremendously.</li>
            <li>The Oral-B just requires a quick rinse.</li>
            <li>lasted several years and was very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost done ordering from Amazon at this point--they are becoming VERY unreliable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy not to use those bleaching chemicals anymore, and it&#x27;s great to now be free of the painful sensitivity they caused.  </li>
            <li>I just received what was supposed to be the Deluxe 8850 DLX Oral-B, but like another reviewer, received just the Professional Care 8850, which seems like the Deluxe version without the attachments (I hope that is the only difference).</li>
            <li>Therefore even though I was in the warranty period they would not be able to service my unit nor give me a new one to replace the one I had.</li>
            <li>The new toothbrush seamed to be a perfect choice, especially for the new features</li>
            <li>the first of using this brush.. left me a good impression.     </li>
            <li>The 30 second quadrant time signal kept me honest, so I put in a full two minute brushing.</li>
            <li>indeedy.everything is real compact and easy to maintain.</li>
            <li>All this with a single brushing every morning followed by a rinse with a good plaque fighting mouthwash.</li>
            <li>I never did receive the first one sent, don&#x27;t know what happened!</li>
            <li>I know someone who doesn&#x27;t clean theirs after each use and the brush appeared to be wielded on the first time it needed to be replaced.</li>
            <li>(The general advice is that stiffer brushes don&#x27;t clean any better anyway.)</li>
            <li>/&gt;i think someone mention this already, the whole things feels cheap.</li>
            <li>brush heads sent with it are nice, especially for those who have not used any of them before.  </li>
            <li>The bottom line is that with using this toothbrush and flossing well, I rarely have cavities.  </li>
            <li>but I prefer the action of the Oral-B better.  </li>
            <li>I wrote DiscountsJungle but more than a month had passed so they refused to take any action and told me to contact the maker.</li>
            <li>Overall, I have been very happy with the results in the short time period that I have used the toothbrush, and hope to have better results next time</li>
            <li>I also like the powerful battery</li>
            <li>so I figured it was worth a try</li>
            <li>8850 is built quite a bit better than the cheap Oral-B brushes and it should definitely last longer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth taking that into account when looking at prices, because they&#x27;re a substantial investment.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t help but think this attitude proves that this is a bait-and-switch situation.  </li>
            <li>This is the second Oral-B Pro Care Deluxe Electric that I&#x27;ve purchased.  </li>
            <li>and I can face my mirror and my dentist with a smile.</li>
            <li>It leaves your gums and mouth feeling stimulated and fresh.  </li>
            <li>This is advertised as a &#x27;deluxe&#x27; (DLX) version of this model with extra attachments.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>ALL the Sonicares (and their replacement brushheads) come with a simple, effective plastic cover.  </li>
            <li>My expectation was pretty high when I first saw the commercial...but the actual power of product isn&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li>This brush will clean your teeth MUCH better than a regular toothbrush, both in preventing buildup and whitening...</li>
            <li>9900 \\&quot;Triumph Smart Guide\\&quot;, and 9950 \\&quot;Triumph Special Edition\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>right after dental implant surgery which requires scrupulous cleaning 3x a day.  </li>
            <li>so instead of sending me the right one, they cancelled my order.  </li>
            <li>right ?</li>
            <li>When I bought it here on amazon, like others I didn&#x27;t get the right item, and it didn&#x27;t come with the tongue freshener and the interdental cleaner.  </li>
            <li>contrast, the Oral B is much easier to clean.  </li>
            <li>I always put too much force to clean my teeth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had an Oral-B toothbrush in the past but for the price of this one it does a great job.  </li>
            <li>Oral B electric toothbrushes are the best according to my research with the internet,as well as the opinions of my dentist and periodontist(also accepted is the fact electric brushes clean the best).I prefer the more expensive Triumph models because of the extra features,but the company representative says this model cleans as well as the Triumph models.</li>
            <li>Money-back guarantees are important here, because some people seem to really dislike certain types of brushes.</li>
            <li>The items arrived as expected in a very timely fashion and with good packaging.  </li>
            <li>The speed control let me use a slower more comfortable speed for a couple of months until my gums adjusted to the more serious routine - now I use maximum speed all the time.</li>
            <li>This is a powerful aid to healthy gums if used daily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more powerful than my last electric toothbrush and the NiMH batteries</li>
            <li>I was really upset, to put it mildly.</li>
            <li>this one not as good as the previous tooth brush</li>
            <li>The bonus is the blue LED light, which doubles as a night light by the sink.  </li>
            <li>The teeth look and feel clean, the timer helps brushing everywhere for the right time, it&#x27;s just a pleasure cleaning the teeth with this professional care brush.</li>
            <li>This thing is really noisy!</li>
            <li>After only using it for one month my teeth look better and my dentist noticed a difference in the health of my gums.</li>
            <li>Just used this toothbrush for the first time.  </li>
            <li>The 8000 models I used personally have plenty of charge for two people to brush in the morning - and probably more, though I never tested.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was going to return it and exchange it for another one but found out that evidently others also had problems with it, so Amazon stopped selling it.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s better than the Sonicare I tried, but which you prefer is going to be an individual choice.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used manual toothbrushes for most of my life, but about nine months ago my dental hygenist prompted me to try an electric as a potential time-saver.  </li>
            <li>first went with an inexpensive Oral-B which ran on AA batteries, and found it was a bit easier to use than a manual.</li>
            <li>I love all the different heads.</li>
            <li>However, in a nutshell, I could tell the first time I used it that this was the toothbrush for me.  </li>
            <li>And the larger brush-heads don&#x27;t offer me anything more than I need.</li>
            <li>this is my first eletronic toothbrush</li>
            <li>Still recommend, just be aware that the tongue thing and the inter dental thing are no longer included as of Dec 07.</li>
            <li>The Sonicare shuts off after 2 minutes but the Oral B signals that 2 minutes are up but keeps going in case you want to go for extra credit by brushing more than 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m glad I switched from Sonicare and wouldn&#x27;t go back.  </li>
            <li>and I only wish I would have bought it many years ago.</li>
            <li>negatives are pretty trivial.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used an \\&quot;electric\\&quot; toothbrush in about 30 years.</li>
            <li>It improved the cleanliness of my teeth and the healthiness of my gums so much!  </li>
            <li>so you know exactly when to switch areas of your mouth and when to stop brushing.  </li>
            <li>So check with them first.</li>
            <li>Alright, so that may seem obvious to some (that this is better than a manual toothbrush).  </li>
            <li>I bought mine first.  </li>
            <li>Like most things German and Braun</li>
            <li>Much more power and a different 3D brushing should improve cleaning.</li>
            <li>If you still use a manual brush, you&#x27;ll be amazed when you first try one of these.</li>
            <li>I find that it works a lot better with gel toothpaste than regular.</li>
            <li>The polishing brush does seem to do a pretty thorough job.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was just me until I switched back to manual brushing and found my teeth to be far more clean.  </li>
            <li>also am happy that this product arrived 3 days earlier than expected.  </li>
            <li>My teeth have never felt this clean before except immediately after professional cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I read positive reviews about Oral B and decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, this thing is great, my gums and teeth feel cleaner after  only a couple of uses.</li>
            <li>And I love the way the brush gives you little alerts every 30 seconds (and a special one at 2 min)</li>
            <li>So far, the brush seems to clean very well.  </li>
            <li>The round head is much better than that of Sonicares \\&quot;traditional\\&quot; head, AND it&#x27;s much easier to keep clean...</li>
            <li>I was a loyal Sonicare customer until I purchased the Oral-B Professional.</li>
            <li>I was puzzled by all the complaints about the short life of the Oral-B 800 Series toothbrushes because my five-year-old Oral-B was still going strong.</li>
            <li>The higher-end Triumph Models, specifically the 9900 and 9950, include a separate \\&quot;Smart Guide\\&quot; displaying your brushing time on the sink counter.  </li>
            <li>The higher-end Triumph Models, specifically the 9900 and 9950, include a separate \\&quot;Smart Guide\\&quot; displaying your brushing time on the sink counter.  </li>
            <li>If you want to spend $50-$100 a year replacing toothbrushes, that&#x27;s certainly one way to do it.</li>
            <li>This new one brushes and cleans my teeth even better than the last one.  </li>
            <li>I found it very awkward to use, and I don&#x27;t think it was doing a very good job of cleaning because I noticed substantially more gunk from flossing than before I started using it.  </li>
            <li>I did order an Oral B Professional Care 1000, which is slightly less \\&quot;deluxe\\&quot;, and, so far, am happy with it.</li>
            <li>My teeth, and mouth feel cleaner, my tongue less furry (for lack of a better scientific term - more technically, if using a \\&quot;tongue scraper,\\</li>
            <li>Generally, she does not like gadgets and new technology, but this toothbrush is easy to operate.  </li>
            <li>I really like Amazon.</li>
            <li>Very well designed and constructed.</li>
            <li>My teeth are much cleaner and gums are healthier.</li>
            <li>I like the 2 minute warning but every 30 seconds is too much.</li>
            <li>this brush does all the work for me in a gentle way.</li>
            <li>I really like this electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Very durable for this road warrior.</li>
            <li>These really get in between teeth.  </li>
            <li>A red light comes on to help determine when charging is needed.</li>
            <li>The brush head size  is comfortable to reach the back teeth.  </li>
            <li>I really like having a choice of brush heads and the gum stimulators.  </li>
            <li>The upkeep is much easer as the head of the brush is removable not allowing gunk and mildew to build up inside the handle.  </li>
            <li>I like the front light that tells me its charging &amp; the multiple heads for cleaning.</li>
            <li>Charging the toothbrush has not been too much of an issue.     </li>
            <li>For the last couple of years I was using a cheap ($25)electric toothbrush I bought at a supermarket.</li>
            <li>Some people prefer using a vibrating tongue scraper because they don&#x27;t stimulate the gag reflex as much.</li>
            <li>For Christmas 2007, I bought another one for my husband, which he really loves.</li>
            <li>In the end it doesn&#x27;t really matter, it isn&#x27;t what it seems.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d much rather get what I paid for.</li>
            <li>If you really want it-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never owned an electric toothbrush before and was hesitant to spend so much money on a toothbrush.</li>
            <li>gums are bleeding, but my understanding is that this is normal in the first week or so of using this toothbrush (my gums were bleeding before). &lt;br</li>
            <li>What really amazes me is when I have it turned on</li>
            <li>Oral B has plenty of power, can really feel it doing its job.  </li>
            <li>The Flexisoft Oral-B brushhead (included in the package) fits well into all crevices and corners, and seems to cup each tooth for a very thorough cleaning.  </li>
            <li>and I am really liking it.</li>
            <li>also much improved GUM (gingivitis)</li>
            <li>All the reviews on amazon.com were very helpful.  </li>
            <li>This electric toobrush works really well and comes with 4 brush heads.  </li>
            <li>Very goods.  </li>
            <li>They absolutely refused to honor the two year warranty that comes with all their toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>how well it&#x27;s really been working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is very powerful and my wife and I both use it (with different brushes).</li>
            <li>The same is true for the spin stuttering models, so it&#x27;s really a matter of choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The same is true for the spin stuttering models, so it&#x27;s really a matter of choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>stopped using my Sonicare some time ago because my teeth just did not feel that clean after I finished - particularly in back.  </li>
            <li>The hygenist would always get these areas squeaky clean during my regular 6-month checkups/cleanings, but the buildup would eventually start in again.  </li>
            <li>A key reason I decided to try the Oral B is that I had to unscrew the brush head of the Sonicare once a week and clean the gunk out of it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After 2 minutes, the Oral B leaves my teeth -- front and back -- squeaky clean and</li>
            <li>Completely different level of clean.</li>
            <li>This basically makes it a total pain to cleanly transport this brush to work or on a trip or anywhere else.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and my teeth are still yellow, but it definitely feels like I&#x27;m washing them much more effectively.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s 18 hour full charges which only happened 2x in my possession.     </li>
            <li>I bought this as a direct replacement of the first one, which was recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li>First, Oral-B offers three lines of power toothbrushes: CrossAction, Sonic, and ProfessionalCare.  </li>
            <li>I do run the battery down from time to time to make sure the battery life is maxed out.</li>
            <li>I was ready for a new system and my dentist recommended the 8800 series.  </li>
            <li>&quot; there is less to scrape), my gums look better, and my teeth do appear whiter.  </li>
            <li>the box itself says that it only includes the Precision head, the Dual Clean head, the Sensitive Clean head and the Pro White head (which still was not in my box).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>teeth get extra clean and breath is feeling extra fresh</li>
            <li>This was delivered quickly, $25 less costly than anywhere else, and the OralB performs much better than the lower end models.</li>
            <li>And dental floss is about half a penny per &#x27;serving&#x27;, whereas the replacement Oral-B things are much more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I did, and I like the documentation, which is in English, Spanish, and French.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve retired the older one--which still works--to our vacation home.</li>
            <li>The main brush (whatever it&#x27;s called) also seems rather decent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My package also came with the hummingbird flosser (not my favorite and I can do the same thing with a normal flosser than turning this one on) and some different heads for the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>in all, I&#x27;d recommend this highly.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This is not the highest end model, but it does everything the high end</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for everyone, though.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>After using it for 6 months, when I went to get my teeth cleaned, it took twice as long to clean my teeth as they were all stained in between the teeth.</li>
            <li>The Sonicare heads need to be screwed on, which takes a little more time.</li>
            <li>I am an extremely consciences brusher with a strong desire to never have any dental work done.  </li>
            <li>Hygienist said I had more stain on my teeth and gums were more raw than my previous checkup just 4 months before.</li>
            <li>The Oral-B Professional works very well.</li>
            <li>This unit has 3 speed settings which provide flexibility when having sensitive gums or fast speed to do a thorough job of cleaning.</li>
            <li>This system with its soft brush attachment worked very well</li>
            <li>Cons:   -My wife and were both unpleasantly surprised at how much the units vibrated our heads while brushing.</li>
            <li>So far, I really like it.</li>
            <li>Since my dental hygiene before switching was \\&quot;near-perfect\\&quot; (I get checkups every three months and only rarely does my hygenist have to do anything at all)</li>
            <li>Also we don&#x27;t think the extra speed settings are that useful.    </li>
            <li>Well, the Braun has been a revelation; the plaque is pretty much gone, and the \\&quot;fuzz,\\&quot; especially on the sides of the molars, is gone too.  </li>
            <li>Many times you should stop the power, and in this case, the timer (it is not a sound, but a vibration instead) goes to zero.</li>
            <li>well, I did and they gave me 3 different complimentary brush heads.  </li>
            <li>Right out of the box I noticed that it did NOT come with the tongue brush or the inter dental attachment, it was not even listed as an option on the box, it only came with the brush heads listed in the description.</li>
            <li>Having said that, the one I got looks pretty much like an updated version of my old Oral-B brush that I am replacing (battery finally died after around 7-8 years)--and</li>
            <li>a final conclusion, the power tooth bush continuous to be good, but the extra accessories and functions are not much useful.</li>
            <li>, supposedly it was new, it was in the 2 yr warranty period.     </li>
            <li>But, the unit itself and all the components were new as described.</li>
            <li>However, its batter was dying and I was trying to decide whether or not to buy a new sonicare or go a difference route and get the professionalcare.  </li>
            <li>Just received my new one from Amazon yesterday.    </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t live without my electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My dentist specifically liked the feature that would stop the brushing action if I press too hard.</li>
            <li>And really why do we need a green light?</li>
            <li>The Sonicare takes much longer to clean and the process is less pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With the Oral-B, this is not possible because the thin brush head is removed every time after use and stored within the self contained holder making the clean up very easy.  </li>
            <li>Thus the 30 second timer doesn&#x27;t help me very much, and I could never quite figure out what the 2-minute timer was for--what happens when the two minutes are up</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been having problems with my gums and I have very, very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>My first Oral-B ProfessionalCare toothbrush finally started to wear out after ten years, so I certainly got my money&#x27;s worth - especially if you count my dentist crediting my improved tooth and gum condition to my improved brushing.  </li>
            <li>I, for one, am happy to have a lighter toothbrush do a better job than the heavy one (I admit, I had a really OLD Sonicare--the charger must have been over 10 years old at the least, maybe 15, and I was on my second handle--they could be different now).</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Wow, what a difference in performance!</li>
            <li>I have used the Sonicare for the past 4 years and I enjoyed that toothbrush as well.  </li>
            <li>you haven&#x27;t used an electric (or an Oral-B) before, I&#x27;d suggest trying one of the cheap/disposable electric brushes first... and you may want to try two or three different brands so you can get a feel for which style you prefer.</li>
            <li>It takes less time to clean my teeth than the old fashioned manual method and my teeth are much cleaner.</li>
            <li>this package comes with a bunch of other gizmos, most of which qualify as \\&quot;clutter\\&quot;; we would just get the basic unit if we had to do it over again.</li>
            <li>This is easy to do for the Oral-B, as the heads slide on and off with little effort.</li>
            <li>The smaller brush head of the Oral B makes it easier to clean my back teeth</li>
            <li>9950 Special Edition of the Triumph model includes a second handle so that two people can brush at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other times you should keep cleaning one side for more than 30 seconds, but when you move to the other side, you lose the control of how much time you should stay in the new side.</li>
            <li>It was much louder than expected when I first began using it</li>
            <li>The tongue cleaner does nothing and the smaller head I found did not hold enough toothpaste to clean the entire mouth very well.  </li>
            <li>Many people damage their gums with these types of brushes by pushing too hard, but these let you know if you are.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush, but it doesn&#x27;t stop when you push to hard.</li>
            <li>cheap Oral-B brushes are... really cheap, and I think they&#x27;re overpriced given how often they fail.</li>
            <li>It takes less than a minute and the toothbrush is always clean.  </li>
            <li>Standard brushes can be had much cheaper by shopping on ebay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this a 4 only because you will still need to floss if you want to really take care of your teeth.  </li>
            <li>As far as brushing goes, it does a 5-star job and it has already (after 2 months) improved my gums.</li>
            <li>I have used the Oral-B Professional Care electronic toothbrush 1-2 times a day since I received it.</li>
            <li>Bought 1 for me and 1 for my son-we both like the feel, the action, and the ease of use.  </li>
            <li>The Oral-B Professional electric tooth brush makes my teeth and mouth feel and taste cleaner.  </li>
            <li>Oral B S-320 Sonic Complete Rechargeable Power Toothbrush]]    </li>
            <li>I find I replace the brush head about twice as frequently (about 6 weeks) as recommended by Oral B.</li>
            <li>OVERVIEW &#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon currently offers the 7400, 7850, 8850 DLX, 8900 \\&quot;OxyJet\\&quot;, 9400 \\&quot;Triumph\\&quot;,</li>
            <li>The slower speed and softer bristles are beneficial too for a sensitive mouth and teeth.  </li>
            <li>I even took it on a week-long vacation, without the charger and had no trouble with it.</li>
            <li>I get my teeth professionally cleaned every 6 months and the dental hygienist always says that I am her easiest patient.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not convinced the uber-3D cleaning action (or whatever they&#x27;re calling it this week)</li>
            <li>Purchased the Oral B Professional Care 3000 after reading reviews and their advertising that dentists recommend it.</li>
            <li>It was really old</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>My old Sonicare stopped after two minutes.    </li>
            <li>br /&gt;1. 3D Excel Brushing Action with 40,000 pulsations and 8,800 oscillations:  &lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a must have for anyone with sensitive gums who is using Sensodine toothpaste to mask the pain.</li>
            <li>It completely eliminated the sensitivity of my gums and has changed my dentist&#x27;s assessment from \\&quot;disaster area\\&quot; to \\&quot;wish mine</li>
            <li>You will feel like you just came from a professional cleaning (without someone digging around your mouth).  </li>
            <li>As far as how the unit operated during the year I had it</li>
            <li>It seems most people think it extravagant to purchase an expensive toothbrush, but it is so worth it.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical because I loved my Sonicare.</li>
            <li>; it&#x27;s skinny, has a non-skid rubber base, and is superbly weighted - it is not tippy at all.</li>
            <li>Buy the basic one, they all use the same brush heads, so you get the same clean.</li>
            <li>I have been using the included whitening brush (never used one with the older model) and can definitely tell the difference.     </li>
            <li>The 2nd brush was for my wife and she had exactly the same experience as me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would encourage anyone thinking of spending the $$$ to do some research regarding the effectiveness of these products to develop a realistic expectation of their advantages over regular brushing.</li>
            <li>Will hold off on a final recommendation until this next tooth cleaning.  ;-)</li>
            <li>In fact, I usually brush my teeth for 2 minutes with a regular head and then two minutes more with the polisher head.</li>
            <li>/&gt;My conclusion: No better, not worst, than a regular tongue cleaner.  </li>
            <li>almost inconsequential feature was a major differentiator that set Oral-B power toothbrushes apart from their competitors in early reviews by dental professionals.  </li>
            <li>This apparently happened to other people too, so if the attachments are important to you, you may want to buy this elsewhere or risk several cycles of buy/return.    </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never needed to use anything other than the ultrasoft heads, and since I usually brush 4-5 times a day I prefer using the most gentle brush I can find.</li>
            <li>Also note that the tongue cleaner or vibrating pick attachment don&#x27;t quite fit in the attachment holder; it&#x27;s apparently meant for brushes only, which could be a minor irritation if you use them regularly.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone that wants to maintain a high level of cleaning of their teeth without pain  or waste of time.</li>
            <li>The head and body design was the same as my old one, but the gasket has been eliminated!!</li>
            <li>I used some previous Oral-b electric toothbrushes in the past, and I was always very satisfied with them.</li>
            <li>A tall base with storage is a good fit for couples, such as the 7850 or 8850 DLX.  </li>
            <li>A tall base with storage is a good fit for couples, such as the 7850 or 8850 DLX.  </li>
            <li>I purchased a new, but already opened box, which concerned me when I saw the condition of the outside of the box.  </li>
            <li>but a brand new product should last longer than 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>I have used an Oral-B toothbrush for 5+ years now and it finally died on me, so I decided to do some research and see what was new in the world of electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>The only thing they offered was a coupon for $10 off a new toothbrush.</li>
            <li>, this thing is thoughtfully designed (e.g., a little rubber stopper prevents the unit from rolling around, should you lay it down on a flat surface) and of top quality, not junky at all like those other units imported from elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used the Sensitive brush on the sensitive setting</li>
            <li>I brushed multiple times a day and brushed for a long time before going to bed ensuring that each tooth was clean.  </li>
            <li>However, I spent almost as much money on batteries during that period that what it cost me to buy my new Oral B.  I finally decided to bite the bullet and purchase a \\&quot;real\\&quot; electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>You have to press a unique button for a long time to reach the lower velocity, and if you stop the power, for example, to move the brush from one side to another (up to down), and want to resume it again at the lower velocity, you must press the button again until you reach the lower velocity.</li>
            <li>The other attachments (tongue scraper, vibrating pick) seem OK, but I prefer using floss, a manual gum stimulator, and a plain tongue scraper instead.  </li>
            <li>Oral-b, you should put another switch where you can select the proper velocity in which the power will work: low, medium or high.</li>
            <li>GENERAL RECOMMENDATION &#x3D;</li>
            <li>GENERAL RECOMMENDATION &#x3D;</li>
            <li>I read some reviews that said this might happen, but stupidly didn&#x27;t think that it would happen to me because I&#x27;ve had pretty good luck with Amazon until now.</li>
            <li>Without this feedback, which the documentation indicates should be obvious, I am unsure as to the effectiveness or functioning of the pulsating action.  </li>
            <li>I bought one for myself last year when my old one which was an Oral B stopped working.</li>
            <li>There is such a marked difference between this and hand-brushing that you can literally feel.</li>
            <li>I had a old Braun toothbrush that finally died.  </li>
            <li>and it is in my mouth, I can barely feel it.</li>
            <li>and I have no regrets.  </li>
            <li>Recent studies suggest, however, that the Sonicare does no more for cleaning than a standard toothbrush and only those using a rotating action actually remove more plaque - albeit a marginal difference.</li>
            <li>Generally speaking, the cheapest model (7400) is a good fit for single users because there is no need to store extra brush heads in the charger base.  </li>
            <li>Generally speaking, the cheapest model (7400) is a good fit for single users because there is no need to store extra brush heads in the charger base.  </li>
            <li>I guess brand new toothbrushes malfunction in a short time in a blue moon.   </li>
            <li>so i cant really compare to the other brands.  </li>
            <li>They should spend the money they spent on making it light up GREEN when fully charged to give you the option of shutting off or changing that.</li>
            <li>Though I used these brushed around 1 year back, my teeth are still sensitive ever since I used them.</li>
            <li>Get your children using these when they are old enough to use them properly.  </li>
            <li>Buying a more expensive model does not affect the cleaning action on your teeth.  </li>
            <li>The basic timer interrupts the brush spinning action three times in rapid succession after two minutes of brushing, so you hear a brief \\&quot;stuttering\\&quot; as your signal.  </li>
            <li>Now, I use all the different heads, the three that came with the toothbrush and an extra soft head.</li>
            <li>I wish that Amazon would carry the 8800 model as the flossing tool and tongue cleaner a pretty much a waste of time in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It was the older style and the head was a bit large and it was hard to get the back teeth.</li>
            <li>I have used an electric toothbrush for years, and it has really cut down on my dental visits and the cleaning time in the chair.  </li>
            <li>The first one only worked a few times before the button wouldn&#x27;t turn it on.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tested this, but only got it to stop spinning after pressing harder than anyone would in a normal situation.</li>
            <li>Really holds its charge, but when it runs down it does take a while to bring it back to \\&quot;full.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>The small round brusheads are easier to fit behind my back teeth, and electric toothbrushes in general seem to stimulate the gums a bit more.</li>
            <li>She tried one of the included small brush heads, but she really prefers the larger double action brush head.  </li>

            <li> This Oral B electric toothbrush is wonderful.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B ProfessionalCare series is the top-of-the-line offering, and arguably the best in the industry.  </li>
            <li> But, we are very happy.</li>
            <li> My teeth and gums are very happy with the change...  </li>
            <li> -&gt;  :D</li>
            <li> All in all, I am very happy I switch to the Oral-B.</li>

            <li> I am very impressed with all the attachments and have used all of them.  </li>
            <li> The Oral-B 8850 DLX Electric Toothbrush works great!  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush is great!  </li>
            <li> but I am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> I was especially pleased when she told me that she noticed her teeth getting whiter and her mouth feeling fresher.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush is the best electric we have owned.</li>
            <li> I was so impressed with it that I bought my daughter one for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> i ordered the best.  </li>
            <li> Great!</li>
            <li> Both do an excellent job.</li>
            <li> I am truly, truly impressed.</li>

            <li> This toothbrush does a great job at a great price!  </li>
            <li> I am very glad we switched!</li>
            <li> I was happy for those 2 weeks,</li>
            <li> the cleaning outcome is really great.     </li>
            <li> The 2 minute timer is great</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush.     </li>
            <li> Great product.  </li>
            <li> This is a great system -  </li>
            <li> this is a great toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> A great oral care tool.</li>
            <li> I bought this item &amp; it works great.</li>
            <li> This has been a great toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> but it probably doesn&#x27;t hurt, and the two-year warranty on the 8850 is a win.</li>
            <li> 30 seconds per mouth quadrant works great for me.</li>
            <li> Great for coffee and tea drinkers.</li>
            <li> and it works great.</li>
            <li> My dentist says its a great toothbrush too.</li>
            <li> The unit is great.  </li>
            <li> I had been happily using Sonicare for about seven years.  </li>
            <li> Great toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It works great; it comes with lots of accessories too.  </li>
            <li> battery life is great, seems quite durable and well built.  </li>
            <li> The variety of brushes was nice to try and pick which one works best for me.</li>
            <li> From a performance standpoint, it is still a great toothbrush</li>
            <li> The battery life is great, still works like I just bought it...</li>
            <li> That wasn&#x27;t very good, but I like the way it works, and my checkups have been good since using it - much better than when I was using a manual brush, and that&#x27;s the bottom line for me.</li>
            <li> and I feel like I&#x27;m doing good things for my teeth.</li>
            <li> This product is superior, IMO, to both.</li>
            <li> The speed is good without being punishing.  </li>
            <li> I had problems with my gums receeding and was told that they were in good shape now.</li>
            <li> These were the 2 areas I bought the 8850 for and seems to be doing a good job.</li>
            <li> , I switched to this system and am delighted with it.</li>
            <li> I loved that one</li>
            <li> You spend more but the results are incredible.</li>
            <li> This has been a good buy.</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;i will continue to use it , for one, i dont feel like returning it, for another, it&#x27;s suppose to be good for my teeth ..</li>
            <li> and I wanted a good toothbrush that would help with this problem.  </li>
            <li> expectation: a good rapid substitute for flossing.</li>
            <li> She has been very pleased.  </li>
            <li> Admittedly, some will find the Triumph handles slightly more attractive.  </li>
            <li> but I am very pleased by my purchase.  </li>
            <li> Although I have a couple of friends who purchased the Oral B and love it, I&#x27;ll admit that I had some reservations up front as to whether I would be happy with it.   </li>
            <li> Easy to use, good quality, and does a great job.  </li>
            <li> Oral B seems like the best product out there right now to me.  </li>
            <li> Oral-B is the one that is the most effective and a great value.</li>
            <li> I have always liked oral-b and they have an exceptional toothbrush with this electric one.</li>
            <li> But a more functional item!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product for keeping those cavities at bay.  </li>
            <li> Just amazing.</li>
            <li> The duel head is amazing.</li>
            <li> am also thrilled that this one has a wall</li>
            <li> More technology is not always good.</li>
            <li> A slimmer shaft would be nice like the newer Sonicare.</li>
            <li> carrying case would have also been nice and the charging indicator is like having a airport landing beacon in your bathroom.</li>
            <li> The bonus to the deluxe model is that there is a compartment that holds (and keeps covered) 4 toothbrush heads.  </li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> The dentist always says how nice my teeth look.</li>
            <li> Bob and Brenda Loving</li>
            <li> spend most of my time in undeveloped countries and do not have access to good dental care.</li>
            <li> Seems well made, nice timing features</li>
            <li> Absolutely, one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made.</li>
            <li> and I would never have bought the unit with that kind warranty.  </li>
            <li> When this was on a special deal I ordered it and am once again happy with my toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It works wonderfully, leaving your teeth feeling squeeky clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> I really liked this toothbrush until I discovered that it didn&#x27;t hold a charge for more than 2 brushings.  </li>
            <li> timer feature might be useful, but that depends greatly on how you brush.</li>
            <li> In my experience, the Sonicaire is a much more effective product for the money.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best toothbrush i&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li> Good to clean the tongue and gingival at lower speed.</li>
            <li> If you have never used an electric toothbrush before you may want to buy something VERY cheap just to see if your teeth/gums can handle it.</li>
            <li> This item is ideal for the application of whitening agents and the overall results are phenomenal!  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> just a bit more effort.    </li>
            <li> buy this sytem, and enjoy!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this purchase and look forward to showing my dentist my much improved smile.</li>
            <li> There is really no reason not to own an excellent product like this.</li>
            <li> but it is slimmer and allows a better grip and more control over the thicker Triumph series units.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;an oral irrigator with innovative micro-bubble technology\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, I suspect there is an increase in battery capacity as you move up from the 7000 series through 8000 and up to the 9000&#x27;s, but I have not been able to verify through documentation.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased with my choice.</li>
            <li> Simply put: this is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> We love it.</li>
            <li> I would like to have a better idea of the sweet-spot, as it were, for pressure.  </li>
            <li> The one before this lasted for many years.  </li>
            <li> It cleaned my teeth much better then Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I am glad for the switch.</li>
            <li> I love the pushing/vibrating feel against my teeth.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly more waterproof (I had problems with water getting into the housing of the others).</li>
            <li> Most of my family has gum problems: my husband, my step-mother, my step-sister...</li>
            <li> If your looking for a great electric toothbrush I would highly recommend this one!  </li>
            <li> A couple of years ago I bought a battery-operated toothbrush (Crest) and it did a much better job of cleaning my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love it</li>
            <li> My Periodontist recommended the Oral B line of motorized toothbrushes, so I picked this and love it.</li>
            <li> If this toothbrush came with a smaller travel charger, it would indeed be absolutely perfect.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with this product and purchased it to leave with my wife in China until she clears immigration.</li>
            <li> and the product seems to be OK--</li>
            <li> My wife and I have been using this for about a month now and both of us really love the job it does.  </li>
            <li> and I knew I needed to do MORE to take better care of my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> I believe this is one of the better ways for me to take the best care of my teeth as is possible</li>
            <li> Head has already lasted longer than most Cheapos&#x27;</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> so many years of going through brushes and trying to protect gums and hit all the corners  </li>
            <li> My dentist says my teeth have never been cleaner -- better placque removal than during all the years I used successive Sonicares.  </li>
            <li> I love the Oral B - Dentist was amazed and reduced plaque and cleaning    </li>
            <li> Could an electric toothbrush do that much better?    </li>
            <li> This is so much better.</li>
            <li> Make sure you read the directions</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of my \\&quot;favorite things.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The FlexiSoft are better ones.</li>
            <li> If two or more people use the brush, then you will need to switch out the heads.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m still very happy for purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> A cheapie Walgreens manual tongue scraper does a much better job.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was my first time using &amp; purchasing an electric toothbrush, I chose Oral B because of the many good reviews.     </li>
            <li> My teeth feel nice and clean;</li>
            <li> It does a great job, has different options to customize it to your needs, easy to grip, &amp; it does a good job.  </li>
            <li> The battery has never been very good at holding a charge for more than one or two days so it was not possible to take along on a trip without taking the charger.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been so excited about brushing my teeth!  </li>
            <li> I had been using a Sonicaire Elite for over 5 years with great results, but that unit died and it was time for something new.</li>
            <li> It gives two quick pauses while you are brushing to let you know to switch to another section of your mouth, which is handy.</li>
            <li> that the Sonicare ones making this brush more economical to own.  </li>
            <li> the brush and handle are easy to keep clean, which is nice considering that this is a tool that you put in your mouth.</li>
            <li> I persisted with my new routine, the bleeding stopped, my breath was much improved and my latest annual checkup got me a perfect score.</li>
            <li> They just didn&#x27;t work for me (more accurately, I should say the one I tried didn&#x27;t work).</li>
            <li> Also wipe the drive shaft to be sure it is free of any moisture.  </li>
            <li> It keeps them dust free and out of site... and that&#x27;s two things I love in a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the \\&quot;dual action\\&quot; head, and the polisher in conjunction with Arm &amp; Hammer Advance White Brilliant Sparkle Baking Soda toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been great so far.</li>
            <li> and there are many others available.     </li>
            <li> It really feels like your getting a good cleaning.</li>
            <li> The brushes detach/attach easily, but never feel like they will fall off.</li>
            <li> I love the squeaky clean feeling on my teeth.</li>
            <li> Its easy &amp; does its job.</li>
            <li> The size fits my hand well, and it seems just as easy to use as their others.</li>
            <li> I have had it for a month and have found it easy to use and maintain.</li>
            <li> recharge easily, allowing me to \\&quot;top-off\\&quot; the batteries after each use.</li>
            <li> I have been very lucky with Amazon and prices.</li>
            <li> expectation: To clean better.</li>
            <li> expectation: To clean my tongue better.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#8220;charging&amp;#8221; light is annoyingly bright on the Oral-B (so much so that you&amp;#8217;ll need to close the door from the bedroom to bathroom if you want to sleep).  </li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend buying this item to anyone who is in the market for an electric toothbrush -</li>
            <li> Strong edge to Oral-B.</li>
            <li> Strong edge to Oral-B.</li>
            <li> My teeth are looking pretty nice.    </li>
            <li> The 2 minute timer is pretty nice even though I don&#x27;t pay attention to it at all.  </li>
            <li> Loved it since the first time i used it you feel your teeth totelly clean, it is quick and effective, the battery lasts almost a week, it is made in germany and you definitely feel it is good quality</li>
            <li> /&gt;In conclusion the toothbrush is fine</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for multiple users and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean and you can get replacement brush heads inexpensively on eBay.  </li>
            <li> suggestion: may be the can provide sound alert instead of a shout pause.</li>
            <li> The charging light goes off after fully charged.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve used and like the cheap Oral-Bs and want something that will last for more than a month, the 8850 would be a good alternative.</li>
            <li> Short story is I have returned the Oral B to the manufacturer under their great 60 Day Challenge policy.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the brush and the timer it has with it.</li>
            <li> Light weight, compact.  </li>
            <li> But overall the brushing experience is great and my teeth feel cleaner than I could ever get them with a manual brush.</li>
            <li> and I had a cheap version of Oral B.</li>
            <li> Also, the Oral-B heads come with nice color-coded rings so you can keep them straight.</li>
            <li> It feels cheap.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In fairness, this toothbrush probably merits a 3.5, and if I get a great bill-of-health from my dentist at my next checkup, I&#x27;ll revise this review to a 4.  </li>
            <li> Figured it was somehow &#x27;better&#x27; since it was &#x27;professional&#x27; and &#x27;deluxe.&#x27;</li>
            <li> it&#x27;ll probably need cleaning more often, and it&#x27;s pretty easy to knock over.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not convinced that electric brushes in general are more effective than a properly-used manual.</li>
            <li> A great addition to my vanity full of stuff the last week of December 2006.  </li>
            <li> Not much can be said about a product that is pretty perfect in every respect.</li>
            <li> Good to control if you clean more time or less time than appropriate.</li>
            <li> I actually enjoy brushing for the full 2-minutes, which is made easier by the 30-second timer built into the handle.</li>
            <li> Triumph models add an actualLCD display into the brush handle so you can see exactly how many seconds you&#x27;ve been brushing.  </li>
            <li> The high-end Triumph series is for those willing to pay more for gadgetry and aesthetics.</li>
            <li> exactly how many seconds you&#x27;ve been brushing.  </li>
            <li> The high-end Triumph series is for those willing to pay more for gadgetry and aesthetics.</li>
            <li> There is definately a significant difference in the texture as well as the shade of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the first one based on the reviews in here and glad I took the time to do some research.</li>
            <li> I find no problem in keeping it clean.  </li>
            <li> This is a totally different product - much more effective.  </li>
            <li> With the Sonicare toothbrush, I had to unscrew the head from the handle once a week and using a Q-tip, wipe the inside clean from the buildup.  </li>
            <li> My teeth never felt so clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But how does the Oral B clean?  </li>
            <li> There is also a device to attach to clean your tongue which seems to work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several eletric toothbrushes over the years and this one is the best by far.  </li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush a week ago and I can already feel the difference in how my gums feel and how clean my teeth feel.</li>
            <li> I bought this professional care deluxe toothbrush because it was considered one of the higher end Oral B toothbrushes and it came with many attachments.  </li>
            <li> my teeth feel much cleaner afterward - very smooth like after you visit the dentist.  </li>
            <li> I have not really tried all of the features, but it does a great job with just brushing.</li>
            <li> The gadgets that ship with the deluxe kit are pretty much a joke in my opinion.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have had Sonicare brushes for years, but decided to switch to these because brush head refills were cheaper, and we liked the \\&quot;spin\\&quot; action.  </li>
            <li> I could never use anything else after being introduced to such an incredibly superior product.  </li>
            <li> My point is that there *are* differences, and you may very well find one electric works better than another.</li>
            <li> really works any better than their others...</li>
            <li> I love the polisher brush it really does wonders if you have any stains on your teeth.</li>
            <li> Thank you Oral-B for such a superior and well-made product.</li>
            <li> Yes.  Amazingly better in a much shorter amount of time.  </li>
            <li> Both my daughter and my friend love it as much as I do.  </li>
            <li> Manual flossing is just as fast and seems much more thorough.  </li>
            <li> I used a regular toothbrush for many many years but never felt that I ever got my teeth really clean.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush works fine, but I paid extra for the deluxe</li>
            <li> It really seems to have made a difference in cleaning up the plaque and keeping my teeth very clean.</li>
            <li> My hygenist mentioned that some people greatly prefer the Sonicare brushes, and they can&#x27;t be that bad all around because many people are successfully using them.</li>
            <li> It charges quickly and lasts around a week.  </li>
            <li> The round head is best for me as it reaches around all the teeth very well.  </li>
            <li> this toothbrush has helped me improve me regimen tremendously.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B just requires a quick rinse.</li>
            <li> lasted several years and was very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost done ordering from Amazon at this point--they are becoming VERY unreliable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy not to use those bleaching chemicals anymore, and it&#x27;s great to now be free of the painful sensitivity they caused.  </li>
            <li> I just received what was supposed to be the Deluxe 8850 DLX Oral-B, but like another reviewer, received just the Professional Care 8850, which seems like the Deluxe version without the attachments (I hope that is the only difference).</li>
            <li> Therefore even though I was in the warranty period they would not be able to service my unit nor give me a new one to replace the one I had.</li>
            <li> The new toothbrush seamed to be a perfect choice, especially for the new features</li>
            <li> the first of using this brush.. left me a good impression.     </li>
            <li> The 30 second quadrant time signal kept me honest, so I put in a full two minute brushing.</li>
            <li> indeedy.everything is real compact and easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> All this with a single brushing every morning followed by a rinse with a good plaque fighting mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I never did receive the first one sent, don&#x27;t know what happened!</li>
            <li> I know someone who doesn&#x27;t clean theirs after each use and the brush appeared to be wielded on the first time it needed to be replaced.</li>
            <li> (The general advice is that stiffer brushes don&#x27;t clean any better anyway.)</li>
            <li> /&gt;i think someone mention this already, the whole things feels cheap.</li>
            <li> brush heads sent with it are nice, especially for those who have not used any of them before.  </li>
            <li> The bottom line is that with using this toothbrush and flossing well, I rarely have cavities.  </li>
            <li> but I prefer the action of the Oral-B better.  </li>
            <li> I wrote DiscountsJungle but more than a month had passed so they refused to take any action and told me to contact the maker.</li>
            <li> Overall, I have been very happy with the results in the short time period that I have used the toothbrush, and hope to have better results next time</li>
            <li> I also like the powerful battery</li>
            <li> so I figured it was worth a try</li>
            <li> 8850 is built quite a bit better than the cheap Oral-B brushes and it should definitely last longer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth taking that into account when looking at prices, because they&#x27;re a substantial investment.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t help but think this attitude proves that this is a bait-and-switch situation.  </li>
            <li> This is the second Oral-B Pro Care Deluxe Electric that I&#x27;ve purchased.  </li>
            <li> and I can face my mirror and my dentist with a smile.</li>
            <li> It leaves your gums and mouth feeling stimulated and fresh.  </li>
            <li> This is advertised as a &#x27;deluxe&#x27; (DLX) version of this model with extra attachments.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> ALL the Sonicares (and their replacement brushheads) come with a simple, effective plastic cover.  </li>
            <li> My expectation was pretty high when I first saw the commercial...but the actual power of product isn&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li> This brush will clean your teeth MUCH better than a regular toothbrush, both in preventing buildup and whitening...</li>
            <li> 9900 \\&quot;Triumph Smart Guide\\&quot;, and 9950 \\&quot;Triumph Special Edition\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> right after dental implant surgery which requires scrupulous cleaning 3x a day.  </li>
            <li> so instead of sending me the right one, they cancelled my order.  </li>
            <li> right ?</li>
            <li> When I bought it here on amazon, like others I didn&#x27;t get the right item, and it didn&#x27;t come with the tongue freshener and the interdental cleaner.  </li>
            <li> contrast, the Oral B is much easier to clean.  </li>
            <li> I always put too much force to clean my teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had an Oral-B toothbrush in the past but for the price of this one it does a great job.  </li>
            <li> Oral B electric toothbrushes are the best according to my research with the internet,as well as the opinions of my dentist and periodontist(also accepted is the fact electric brushes clean the best).I prefer the more expensive Triumph models because of the extra features,but the company representative says this model cleans as well as the Triumph models.</li>
            <li> Money-back guarantees are important here, because some people seem to really dislike certain types of brushes.</li>
            <li> The items arrived as expected in a very timely fashion and with good packaging.  </li>
            <li> The speed control let me use a slower more comfortable speed for a couple of months until my gums adjusted to the more serious routine - now I use maximum speed all the time.</li>
            <li> This is a powerful aid to healthy gums if used daily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more powerful than my last electric toothbrush and the NiMH batteries</li>
            <li> I was really upset, to put it mildly.</li>
            <li> this one not as good as the previous tooth brush</li>
            <li> The bonus is the blue LED light, which doubles as a night light by the sink.  </li>
            <li> The teeth look and feel clean, the timer helps brushing everywhere for the right time, it&#x27;s just a pleasure cleaning the teeth with this professional care brush.</li>
            <li> This thing is really noisy!</li>
            <li> After only using it for one month my teeth look better and my dentist noticed a difference in the health of my gums.</li>
            <li> Just used this toothbrush for the first time.  </li>
            <li> The 8000 models I used personally have plenty of charge for two people to brush in the morning - and probably more, though I never tested.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was going to return it and exchange it for another one but found out that evidently others also had problems with it, so Amazon stopped selling it.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s better than the Sonicare I tried, but which you prefer is going to be an individual choice.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used manual toothbrushes for most of my life, but about nine months ago my dental hygenist prompted me to try an electric as a potential time-saver.  </li>
            <li> first went with an inexpensive Oral-B which ran on AA batteries, and found it was a bit easier to use than a manual.</li>
            <li> I love all the different heads.</li>
            <li> However, in a nutshell, I could tell the first time I used it that this was the toothbrush for me.  </li>
            <li> And the larger brush-heads don&#x27;t offer me anything more than I need.</li>
            <li> this is my first eletronic toothbrush</li>
            <li> Still recommend, just be aware that the tongue thing and the inter dental thing are no longer included as of Dec 07.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare shuts off after 2 minutes but the Oral B signals that 2 minutes are up but keeps going in case you want to go for extra credit by brushing more than 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I switched from Sonicare and wouldn&#x27;t go back.  </li>
            <li> and I only wish I would have bought it many years ago.</li>
            <li> negatives are pretty trivial.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used an \\&quot;electric\\&quot; toothbrush in about 30 years.</li>
            <li> It improved the cleanliness of my teeth and the healthiness of my gums so much!  </li>
            <li> so you know exactly when to switch areas of your mouth and when to stop brushing.  </li>
            <li> So check with them first.</li>
            <li> Alright, so that may seem obvious to some (that this is better than a manual toothbrush).  </li>
            <li> I bought mine first.  </li>
            <li> Like most things German and Braun</li>
            <li> Much more power and a different 3D brushing should improve cleaning.</li>
            <li> If you still use a manual brush, you&#x27;ll be amazed when you first try one of these.</li>
            <li> I find that it works a lot better with gel toothpaste than regular.</li>
            <li> The polishing brush does seem to do a pretty thorough job.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was just me until I switched back to manual brushing and found my teeth to be far more clean.  </li>
            <li> also am happy that this product arrived 3 days earlier than expected.  </li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt this clean before except immediately after professional cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I read positive reviews about Oral B and decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, this thing is great, my gums and teeth feel cleaner after  only a couple of uses.</li>
            <li> And I love the way the brush gives you little alerts every 30 seconds (and a special one at 2 min)</li>
            <li> So far, the brush seems to clean very well.  </li>
            <li> The round head is much better than that of Sonicares \\&quot;traditional\\&quot; head, AND it&#x27;s much easier to keep clean...</li>
            <li> I was a loyal Sonicare customer until I purchased the Oral-B Professional.</li>
            <li> I was puzzled by all the complaints about the short life of the Oral-B 800 Series toothbrushes because my five-year-old Oral-B was still going strong.</li>
            <li> The higher-end Triumph Models, specifically the 9900 and 9950, include a separate \\&quot;Smart Guide\\&quot; displaying your brushing time on the sink counter.  </li>
            <li> The higher-end Triumph Models, specifically the 9900 and 9950, include a separate \\&quot;Smart Guide\\&quot; displaying your brushing time on the sink counter.  </li>
            <li> If you want to spend $50-$100 a year replacing toothbrushes, that&#x27;s certainly one way to do it.</li>
            <li> This new one brushes and cleans my teeth even better than the last one.  </li>
            <li> I found it very awkward to use, and I don&#x27;t think it was doing a very good job of cleaning because I noticed substantially more gunk from flossing than before I started using it.  </li>
            <li> I did order an Oral B Professional Care 1000, which is slightly less \\&quot;deluxe\\&quot;, and, so far, am happy with it.</li>
            <li> My teeth, and mouth feel cleaner, my tongue less furry (for lack of a better scientific term - more technically, if using a \\&quot;tongue scraper,\\</li>
            <li> Generally, she does not like gadgets and new technology, but this toothbrush is easy to operate.  </li>
            <li> I really like Amazon.</li>
            <li> Very well designed and constructed.</li>
            <li> My teeth are much cleaner and gums are healthier.</li>
            <li> I like the 2 minute warning but every 30 seconds is too much.</li>
            <li> this brush does all the work for me in a gentle way.</li>
            <li> I really like this electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Very durable for this road warrior.</li>
            <li> These really get in between teeth.  </li>
            <li> A red light comes on to help determine when charging is needed.</li>
            <li> The brush head size  is comfortable to reach the back teeth.  </li>
            <li> I really like having a choice of brush heads and the gum stimulators.  </li>
            <li> The upkeep is much easer as the head of the brush is removable not allowing gunk and mildew to build up inside the handle.  </li>
            <li> I like the front light that tells me its charging &amp; the multiple heads for cleaning.</li>
            <li> Charging the toothbrush has not been too much of an issue.     </li>
            <li> For the last couple of years I was using a cheap ($25)electric toothbrush I bought at a supermarket.</li>
            <li> Some people prefer using a vibrating tongue scraper because they don&#x27;t stimulate the gag reflex as much.</li>
            <li> For Christmas 2007, I bought another one for my husband, which he really loves.</li>
            <li> In the end it doesn&#x27;t really matter, it isn&#x27;t what it seems.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d much rather get what I paid for.</li>
            <li> If you really want it-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never owned an electric toothbrush before and was hesitant to spend so much money on a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> gums are bleeding, but my understanding is that this is normal in the first week or so of using this toothbrush (my gums were bleeding before). &lt;br</li>
            <li> What really amazes me is when I have it turned on</li>
            <li> Oral B has plenty of power, can really feel it doing its job.  </li>
            <li> The Flexisoft Oral-B brushhead (included in the package) fits well into all crevices and corners, and seems to cup each tooth for a very thorough cleaning.  </li>
            <li> and I am really liking it.</li>
            <li> also much improved GUM (gingivitis)</li>
            <li> All the reviews on amazon.com were very helpful.  </li>
            <li> This electric toobrush works really well and comes with 4 brush heads.  </li>
            <li> Very goods.  </li>
            <li> They absolutely refused to honor the two year warranty that comes with all their toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> how well it&#x27;s really been working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is very powerful and my wife and I both use it (with different brushes).</li>
            <li> The same is true for the spin stuttering models, so it&#x27;s really a matter of choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The same is true for the spin stuttering models, so it&#x27;s really a matter of choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> stopped using my Sonicare some time ago because my teeth just did not feel that clean after I finished - particularly in back.  </li>
            <li> The hygenist would always get these areas squeaky clean during my regular 6-month checkups/cleanings, but the buildup would eventually start in again.  </li>
            <li> A key reason I decided to try the Oral B is that I had to unscrew the brush head of the Sonicare once a week and clean the gunk out of it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After 2 minutes, the Oral B leaves my teeth -- front and back -- squeaky clean and</li>
            <li> Completely different level of clean.</li>
            <li> This basically makes it a total pain to cleanly transport this brush to work or on a trip or anywhere else.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and my teeth are still yellow, but it definitely feels like I&#x27;m washing them much more effectively.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s 18 hour full charges which only happened 2x in my possession.     </li>
            <li> I bought this as a direct replacement of the first one, which was recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li> First, Oral-B offers three lines of power toothbrushes: CrossAction, Sonic, and ProfessionalCare.  </li>
            <li> I do run the battery down from time to time to make sure the battery life is maxed out.</li>
            <li> I was ready for a new system and my dentist recommended the 8800 series.  </li>
            <li> &quot; there is less to scrape), my gums look better, and my teeth do appear whiter.  </li>
            <li> the box itself says that it only includes the Precision head, the Dual Clean head, the Sensitive Clean head and the Pro White head (which still was not in my box).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> teeth get extra clean and breath is feeling extra fresh</li>
            <li> This was delivered quickly, $25 less costly than anywhere else, and the OralB performs much better than the lower end models.</li>
            <li> And dental floss is about half a penny per &#x27;serving&#x27;, whereas the replacement Oral-B things are much more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I did, and I like the documentation, which is in English, Spanish, and French.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve retired the older one--which still works--to our vacation home.</li>
            <li> The main brush (whatever it&#x27;s called) also seems rather decent.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My package also came with the hummingbird flosser (not my favorite and I can do the same thing with a normal flosser than turning this one on) and some different heads for the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> in all, I&#x27;d recommend this highly.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is not the highest end model, but it does everything the high end</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for everyone, though.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> After using it for 6 months, when I went to get my teeth cleaned, it took twice as long to clean my teeth as they were all stained in between the teeth.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare heads need to be screwed on, which takes a little more time.</li>
            <li> I am an extremely consciences brusher with a strong desire to never have any dental work done.  </li>
            <li> Hygienist said I had more stain on my teeth and gums were more raw than my previous checkup just 4 months before.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Professional works very well.</li>
            <li> This unit has 3 speed settings which provide flexibility when having sensitive gums or fast speed to do a thorough job of cleaning.</li>
            <li> This system with its soft brush attachment worked very well</li>
            <li> Cons:   -My wife and were both unpleasantly surprised at how much the units vibrated our heads while brushing.</li>
            <li> So far, I really like it.</li>
            <li> Since my dental hygiene before switching was \\&quot;near-perfect\\&quot; (I get checkups every three months and only rarely does my hygenist have to do anything at all)</li>
            <li> Also we don&#x27;t think the extra speed settings are that useful.    </li>
            <li> Well, the Braun has been a revelation; the plaque is pretty much gone, and the \\&quot;fuzz,\\&quot; especially on the sides of the molars, is gone too.  </li>
            <li> Many times you should stop the power, and in this case, the timer (it is not a sound, but a vibration instead) goes to zero.</li>
            <li> well, I did and they gave me 3 different complimentary brush heads.  </li>
            <li> Right out of the box I noticed that it did NOT come with the tongue brush or the inter dental attachment, it was not even listed as an option on the box, it only came with the brush heads listed in the description.</li>
            <li> Having said that, the one I got looks pretty much like an updated version of my old Oral-B brush that I am replacing (battery finally died after around 7-8 years)--and</li>
            <li> a final conclusion, the power tooth bush continuous to be good, but the extra accessories and functions are not much useful.</li>
            <li> , supposedly it was new, it was in the 2 yr warranty period.     </li>
            <li> But, the unit itself and all the components were new as described.</li>
            <li> However, its batter was dying and I was trying to decide whether or not to buy a new sonicare or go a difference route and get the professionalcare.  </li>
            <li> Just received my new one from Amazon yesterday.    </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t live without my electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My dentist specifically liked the feature that would stop the brushing action if I press too hard.</li>
            <li> And really why do we need a green light?</li>
            <li> The Sonicare takes much longer to clean and the process is less pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With the Oral-B, this is not possible because the thin brush head is removed every time after use and stored within the self contained holder making the clean up very easy.  </li>
            <li> Thus the 30 second timer doesn&#x27;t help me very much, and I could never quite figure out what the 2-minute timer was for--what happens when the two minutes are up</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having problems with my gums and I have very, very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> My first Oral-B ProfessionalCare toothbrush finally started to wear out after ten years, so I certainly got my money&#x27;s worth - especially if you count my dentist crediting my improved tooth and gum condition to my improved brushing.  </li>
            <li> I, for one, am happy to have a lighter toothbrush do a better job than the heavy one (I admit, I had a really OLD Sonicare--the charger must have been over 10 years old at the least, maybe 15, and I was on my second handle--they could be different now).</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> Wow, what a difference in performance!</li>
            <li> I have used the Sonicare for the past 4 years and I enjoyed that toothbrush as well.  </li>
            <li> you haven&#x27;t used an electric (or an Oral-B) before, I&#x27;d suggest trying one of the cheap/disposable electric brushes first... and you may want to try two or three different brands so you can get a feel for which style you prefer.</li>
            <li> It takes less time to clean my teeth than the old fashioned manual method and my teeth are much cleaner.</li>
            <li> this package comes with a bunch of other gizmos, most of which qualify as \\&quot;clutter\\&quot;; we would just get the basic unit if we had to do it over again.</li>
            <li> This is easy to do for the Oral-B, as the heads slide on and off with little effort.</li>
            <li> The smaller brush head of the Oral B makes it easier to clean my back teeth</li>
            <li> 9950 Special Edition of the Triumph model includes a second handle so that two people can brush at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other times you should keep cleaning one side for more than 30 seconds, but when you move to the other side, you lose the control of how much time you should stay in the new side.</li>
            <li> It was much louder than expected when I first began using it</li>
            <li> The tongue cleaner does nothing and the smaller head I found did not hold enough toothpaste to clean the entire mouth very well.  </li>
            <li> Many people damage their gums with these types of brushes by pushing too hard, but these let you know if you are.  </li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush, but it doesn&#x27;t stop when you push to hard.</li>
            <li> cheap Oral-B brushes are... really cheap, and I think they&#x27;re overpriced given how often they fail.</li>
            <li> It takes less than a minute and the toothbrush is always clean.  </li>
            <li> Standard brushes can be had much cheaper by shopping on ebay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this a 4 only because you will still need to floss if you want to really take care of your teeth.  </li>
            <li> As far as brushing goes, it does a 5-star job and it has already (after 2 months) improved my gums.</li>
            <li> I have used the Oral-B Professional Care electronic toothbrush 1-2 times a day since I received it.</li>
            <li> Bought 1 for me and 1 for my son-we both like the feel, the action, and the ease of use.  </li>
            <li> The Oral-B Professional electric tooth brush makes my teeth and mouth feel and taste cleaner.  </li>
            <li> Oral B S-320 Sonic Complete Rechargeable Power Toothbrush]]    </li>
            <li> I find I replace the brush head about twice as frequently (about 6 weeks) as recommended by Oral B.</li>
            <li> OVERVIEW &#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon currently offers the 7400, 7850, 8850 DLX, 8900 \\&quot;OxyJet\\&quot;, 9400 \\&quot;Triumph\\&quot;,</li>
            <li> The slower speed and softer bristles are beneficial too for a sensitive mouth and teeth.  </li>
            <li> I even took it on a week-long vacation, without the charger and had no trouble with it.</li>
            <li> I get my teeth professionally cleaned every 6 months and the dental hygienist always says that I am her easiest patient.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not convinced the uber-3D cleaning action (or whatever they&#x27;re calling it this week)</li>
            <li> Purchased the Oral B Professional Care 3000 after reading reviews and their advertising that dentists recommend it.</li>
            <li> It was really old</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> My old Sonicare stopped after two minutes.    </li>
            <li> br /&gt;1. 3D Excel Brushing Action with 40,000 pulsations and 8,800 oscillations:  &lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a must have for anyone with sensitive gums who is using Sensodine toothpaste to mask the pain.</li>
            <li> It completely eliminated the sensitivity of my gums and has changed my dentist&#x27;s assessment from \\&quot;disaster area\\&quot; to \\&quot;wish mine</li>
            <li> You will feel like you just came from a professional cleaning (without someone digging around your mouth).  </li>
            <li> As far as how the unit operated during the year I had it</li>
            <li> It seems most people think it extravagant to purchase an expensive toothbrush, but it is so worth it.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical because I loved my Sonicare.</li>
            <li> ; it&#x27;s skinny, has a non-skid rubber base, and is superbly weighted - it is not tippy at all.</li>
            <li> Buy the basic one, they all use the same brush heads, so you get the same clean.</li>
            <li> I have been using the included whitening brush (never used one with the older model) and can definitely tell the difference.     </li>
            <li> The 2nd brush was for my wife and she had exactly the same experience as me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would encourage anyone thinking of spending the $$$ to do some research regarding the effectiveness of these products to develop a realistic expectation of their advantages over regular brushing.</li>
            <li> Will hold off on a final recommendation until this next tooth cleaning.  ;-)</li>
            <li> In fact, I usually brush my teeth for 2 minutes with a regular head and then two minutes more with the polisher head.</li>
            <li> /&gt;My conclusion: No better, not worst, than a regular tongue cleaner.  </li>
            <li> almost inconsequential feature was a major differentiator that set Oral-B power toothbrushes apart from their competitors in early reviews by dental professionals.  </li>
            <li> This apparently happened to other people too, so if the attachments are important to you, you may want to buy this elsewhere or risk several cycles of buy/return.    </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never needed to use anything other than the ultrasoft heads, and since I usually brush 4-5 times a day I prefer using the most gentle brush I can find.</li>
            <li> Also note that the tongue cleaner or vibrating pick attachment don&#x27;t quite fit in the attachment holder; it&#x27;s apparently meant for brushes only, which could be a minor irritation if you use them regularly.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone that wants to maintain a high level of cleaning of their teeth without pain  or waste of time.</li>
            <li> The head and body design was the same as my old one, but the gasket has been eliminated!!</li>
            <li> I used some previous Oral-b electric toothbrushes in the past, and I was always very satisfied with them.</li>
            <li> A tall base with storage is a good fit for couples, such as the 7850 or 8850 DLX.  </li>
            <li> A tall base with storage is a good fit for couples, such as the 7850 or 8850 DLX.  </li>
            <li> I purchased a new, but already opened box, which concerned me when I saw the condition of the outside of the box.  </li>
            <li> but a brand new product should last longer than 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have used an Oral-B toothbrush for 5+ years now and it finally died on me, so I decided to do some research and see what was new in the world of electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> The only thing they offered was a coupon for $10 off a new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> , this thing is thoughtfully designed (e.g., a little rubber stopper prevents the unit from rolling around, should you lay it down on a flat surface) and of top quality, not junky at all like those other units imported from elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the Sensitive brush on the sensitive setting</li>
            <li> I brushed multiple times a day and brushed for a long time before going to bed ensuring that each tooth was clean.  </li>
            <li> However, I spent almost as much money on batteries during that period that what it cost me to buy my new Oral B.  I finally decided to bite the bullet and purchase a \\&quot;real\\&quot; electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> You have to press a unique button for a long time to reach the lower velocity, and if you stop the power, for example, to move the brush from one side to another (up to down), and want to resume it again at the lower velocity, you must press the button again until you reach the lower velocity.</li>
            <li> The other attachments (tongue scraper, vibrating pick) seem OK, but I prefer using floss, a manual gum stimulator, and a plain tongue scraper instead.  </li>
            <li> Oral-b, you should put another switch where you can select the proper velocity in which the power will work: low, medium or high.</li>
            <li> GENERAL RECOMMENDATION &#x3D;</li>
            <li> GENERAL RECOMMENDATION &#x3D;</li>
            <li> I read some reviews that said this might happen, but stupidly didn&#x27;t think that it would happen to me because I&#x27;ve had pretty good luck with Amazon until now.</li>
            <li> Without this feedback, which the documentation indicates should be obvious, I am unsure as to the effectiveness or functioning of the pulsating action.  </li>
            <li> I bought one for myself last year when my old one which was an Oral B stopped working.</li>
            <li> There is such a marked difference between this and hand-brushing that you can literally feel.</li>
            <li> I had a old Braun toothbrush that finally died.  </li>
            <li> and it is in my mouth, I can barely feel it.</li>
            <li> and I have no regrets.  </li>
            <li> Recent studies suggest, however, that the Sonicare does no more for cleaning than a standard toothbrush and only those using a rotating action actually remove more plaque - albeit a marginal difference.</li>
            <li> Generally speaking, the cheapest model (7400) is a good fit for single users because there is no need to store extra brush heads in the charger base.  </li>
            <li> Generally speaking, the cheapest model (7400) is a good fit for single users because there is no need to store extra brush heads in the charger base.  </li>
            <li> I guess brand new toothbrushes malfunction in a short time in a blue moon.   </li>
            <li> so i cant really compare to the other brands.  </li>
            <li> They should spend the money they spent on making it light up GREEN when fully charged to give you the option of shutting off or changing that.</li>
            <li> Though I used these brushed around 1 year back, my teeth are still sensitive ever since I used them.</li>
            <li> Get your children using these when they are old enough to use them properly.  </li>
            <li> Buying a more expensive model does not affect the cleaning action on your teeth.  </li>
            <li> The basic timer interrupts the brush spinning action three times in rapid succession after two minutes of brushing, so you hear a brief \\&quot;stuttering\\&quot; as your signal.  </li>
            <li> Now, I use all the different heads, the three that came with the toothbrush and an extra soft head.</li>
            <li> I wish that Amazon would carry the 8800 model as the flossing tool and tongue cleaner a pretty much a waste of time in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It was the older style and the head was a bit large and it was hard to get the back teeth.</li>
            <li> I have used an electric toothbrush for years, and it has really cut down on my dental visits and the cleaning time in the chair.  </li>
            <li> The first one only worked a few times before the button wouldn&#x27;t turn it on.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tested this, but only got it to stop spinning after pressing harder than anyone would in a normal situation.</li>
            <li> Really holds its charge, but when it runs down it does take a while to bring it back to \\&quot;full.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> The small round brusheads are easier to fit behind my back teeth, and electric toothbrushes in general seem to stimulate the gums a bit more.</li>
            <li> She tried one of the included small brush heads, but she really prefers the larger double action brush head.  </li>
            <li> Then my oral hygienist casually mentioned that her patients with the healthiest gums all seemed to use the Braun toothbrush, and interestingly,</li>
            <li> The round Oral B brush heads (I sugguest you avoid the oval style) let me get into the tight spaces way back in my mouth and clean every inch of my gumline.  </li>
            <li> All Triumph models have Oral-B&#x27;s newer \\&quot;attractive design\\&quot; for both brush handle and base, but still use the same brush heads and cleaning action as all other ProfessionalCare models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just by having one less cavity on one visit, you&#x27;ve paid for your new toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> so you&#x27;ll know that you&#x27;ve brushed your teeth long enough.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I see much value in this feature, but it is the one that convinced me to buy this model over the others.</li>
            <li> It really removes stubborn plaque and improves gum health for which I have had issues with it the past.</li>
            <li> I expect this one will last just as long.    </li>
            <li> The flashing blue charger light seems silly, but I&#x27;ve learned to ignore it.  </li>
            <li> I have a hard time spending that much money on something that seems so trivial...</li>
            <li> I had an older model of the professional and tried a lesser expensive Oral-B, and I found out they are not all equal.</li>
            <li> I could always feel just a little of the plaque or the slightly gritty coating in a few spots - especially on my back teeth where it&#x27;s always been hard for me to brush adequately with a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> For those who are less careful about brushing I would imagine the difference would be even more dramatic.      </li>
            <li> /&gt;I am a repeat buyer and user of Oral B products and plan to be for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hope it lives as long as the Sonicare brushes lived.</li>
            <li> It took a long time to purchase an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is not a sensitive toothbrush, you can feel the bristles go to work on your teeth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s loud and the handle gets heavy after awhile.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m am hopeful the gift will continue to work for her for a long time.</li>
            <li> (definitely need to have the bathroom door closed if your spouse is sleeping).</li>
            <li> It took me a long time to pick an electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Ultimately the choice between models comes down to individual preferences.  </li>
            <li> Ultimately the choice between models comes down to individual preferences.  </li>
            <li> First, it seemed as though the bristles were too stiff, but I got used to that in just a few days.     </li>
            <li> I previously had a more expensive system but after two of them wore out quicker than they should have</li>
            <li> I probably will try a different brand next time or look for one with less \\&quot;features\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I usually do not return any item, least a personal item.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I actually look forward to brushing my teeth, 2, even 3 times a day!</li>
            <li> Like some of the other reviewers provide, all the attachments probably aren&#x27;t necessary and may not be used.  </li>
            <li> I wish I would have bought this a long time ago!</li>
            <li> I always separated the head from the brush so both can dry.     </li>
            <li> After each use, remove the head, rinse and let stand by itself to dry.  </li>
            <li> We were worried we would have to purchase additional heads since there&#x27;s going to be two of us using it, but it comes with 4 heads: a standard round one, a softer round one, a big double one, and one that looks like the dentists professional toothbrush with a little thing for toothpaste in it.</li>
            <li> For a single user, this cheaper model is the one to get as you will just keep your brush head on the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All of today&#x27;s models do this, along with a single spin interruption every 30 seconds</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;i had to open my mouth real wide</li>
            <li> so much I was desperate to get this new one when it died!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The Oral-B head replacements in general are expensive, and they really do need replacement every three months</li>
            <li> (It is slightly noisier but certainly not enough to annoy.)</li>
            <li> expectation: To be the same as previous ones.</li>
            <li> They are the same as previous ones.</li>
            <li> I chose this toothbrush after my basic Oral B electric toothbrush finally wore down after a few years.</li>
            <li> I am sure at my next dentist appointment it will be less painful.</li>
            <li> You can find most of these on Oral-B&#x27;s web site, but it is hard to use and difficult to compare.  </li>
            <li> Money well spent.  </li>
            <li> Personally, I pack a manual toothbrush for trips and leave the Oral-B at home for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes, it was probably built well... and heavy, and the handle was immense compared to the Oral-B.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; head, which feels like it has a rubberized cap in the center, between the bristles, which you can use to sit on your tooth like a ball-socket joint, allopermittingwing rotation.</li>
            <li> Turns out not much has changed including pricing.</li>
            <li> I had a few years ago, but I think they may have made a smaller head for that by now.</li>
            <li> My gums had been receding at an alarming rate, and the exposed tooth roots were being grooved by aggressive brushing.  </li>
            <li> I was supposed to get the DELUXE model but received the base model instead (no tongue freshener or pick).</li>
            <li> only complaint in the product&#x27;s operation is that I cannot feel or hear the difference when the pulsating action stops due to excessive pressure.  </li>
            <li> I ordered a new 8850 DLX anyway, because the gasket between the body and replaceable head that prevents liquid from leaking into the interior of the body had finally deteriorated and I figured that it was just a matter of time till the moisture caused the motor and electronics to fail.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my daughter, whose other toothbrush had stopped functioning for her.</li>
            <li> I decided to start using an electrice toothbrush again because I am a cancer survivor who has dental problems in part due to the radiation treatments.  </li>
            <li> After doing some searching and reading the other Oral B reviews, I bought this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used any other electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> Prior to this we had an older less expensive Braun</li>
            <li> So, too, does the interdental-stimulator / toothpick thingy seem pretty useless.  </li>
            <li> The high rotary speed of this toothbrush makes a noticeable difference in plaque removal compared to the less expensive low speed units.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, the toothbrush still seems to work fine, but as you can guess, I finally wised up and screwed the base to the wall.  </li>
            <li> As for the product design, I was afraid the stand wouldn&#x27;t fit on the narrow ledge of my ceramic sink.</li>
            <li> And shop around, occasionally they can be found for much less than the usual retail prices.</li>
            <li> I am hard pressed to add any technical information to what others have already provided.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;My conclusion:  not much useful.</li>
            <li> Not useful.</li>
            <li> I believe you should run the battery all the way down once a year.</li>
            <li> running down the handle as I brush)</li>
            <li> /&gt;The positives boil down to just one.</li>
            <li> and I had the previous version of this brush for years before the battery quit.  </li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s price on sale was about 25% less than Target or Walmart.</li>
            <li> Oral B&#x27;s do, at half the cost.</li>
            <li> My only complaint about this brush is that when it&#x27;s time to turn it off, we have to press the buttons a few times to get it to turn off.</li>
            <li> Another point I would like to make, is the brush heads cost much less</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It seems to be slightly messier than my sonicare (toothpaste, etc.</li>
            <li> only negative I see is that I bought this one in the U.S. (where I&#x27;m staying for a few weeks) without paying attention to the voltage when I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> I purchased mine for about half of the price listed here.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t note any difference comparing to the previous ones.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B has a slight advantage, because the head is a bit wider, and you can cover each tooth without moving it around.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean...just run under water after use, detach brush and wipe down the base.</li>
            <li> That was a mess.</li>
            <li> I found the toothbrush only worked well with the dual-action brushhead (very hard to find replacements), and all the other accessories are a waste of time and money.  </li>
            <li> Additional brushes are rather expensive, but I don&#x27;t know yet how long they will last.</li>
            <li> What it does is give you two little bursts of reduced speed.</li>
            <li> There was little plaque buildup.</li>
            <li> Takes a little getting used to, never had a tooth power scrubber before.  </li>
            <li> the flashing blue light would be very annoying.</li>
            <li> I did notice a difference in just a few days.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it is a bit messy to travel with as it has no case</li>
            <li> The encounter left me feeling as if they were doing me an unnecessary favor not making up for a problem they created.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have trouble with plaque even though I floss</li>
            <li> However, for brushing everyday I use the round head attachment.</li>
            <li> After a few days I threw them away.</li>
            <li> I had used a Sonicare tooth brush for quite a few years.</li>
            <li> My final comment is I will never buy another Oral B toothbrush again based on how it cleaned my teeth and the poor customer service when it stopped working under warranty.  </li>
            <li> here are a few observations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> is it false advertising or a simple product mix up?  </li>
            <li> It seems like expensive overkill to me personally, but at least you don&#x27;t have to stop brushing to see how long it&#x27;s been.  </li>
            <li> It seems like expensive overkill to me personally, but at least you don&#x27;t have to stop brushing to see how long it&#x27;s been.  </li>
            <li> Cleaning is not easy, because the gunk gets in hard-to-reach places, and you need a cue-tip to get it out.</li>
            <li> The 9950 Special Edition also includes a travel charging base.  </li>
            <li> While I used to have pretty bad dental hygiene habits</li>
            <li> My stains were so bad my dentist told me he&#x27;d have to charge me double next time.  </li>
            <li> That was the reason that I got the more expensive one, so I am a little disappointed...</li>
            <li> I do agree it is difficult to do the back teeth, but don&#x27;t give up.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to know when 30 seconds has past.  </li>
            <li> You simply cannot go wrong with one of these models.</li>
            <li> I tried two of them, and both of them failed in different ways within 3 months.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly not magic.</li>
            <li> Certainly not inspiring us to brush more/longer.  </li>
            <li> When I emailed to ask them once again to give me the DLX model, they emailed me back and said sorry for the mix-up, but it would just happen again,</li>
            <li> A waste of money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using other less expensive (slow speed) Oral-B tooth brushes for years at the recommendation of my dentist after he noticed substantial enamel erosion along my gum line from aggressive brushing with a manual firm bristle toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Basically its 0 up-keep as where the Sonicare requires attention due to a poor design.  </li>
            <li> When I returned it, and asked for the model I had actually ordered, it took 6 weeks for them to replace it - with the SAME base model.  </li>
            <li> At any rate, I suppose the only shortcoming of this toothbrush lies in the problems encountered when traveling a lot: The base station is simply too bulky to conveniently pack away and take with you.</li>
            <li> I hated doing this and often needed a cotton swab to clean the gunk out of the inside of the brush</li>
            <li> I have been using electric toothbrushes for years, and my dental hygenist has always told me that I have hardly any plack on my teeth.</li>
            <li> b/c I&#x27;m generally a hard brusher and the dentist recommended an electric.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t note any difference, even when I tested it, didn&#x27;t note that pulsations stop when you brush too hard.</li>
            <li> The pressure censor doesn&#x27;t seem to work because no matter how hard I press, nothing happens.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for about 6 weeks, and haven&#x27;t had a dental checkup in the meantime, so it&#x27;s a bit hard to know</li>
            <li> at least that has been my experience.</li>
            <li> It sucks.</li>
            <li> I complained to amazon, who then told me to take my complaint to the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> The vibration of the cheaper model was annoying, where as this one is much smoother and easier to use.</li>
            <li> -Bit less expensive than some Sonicaire models.  </li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> He was quite serious.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s no good for anywhere using 220/240V power.</li>
            <li> Triumph models have a mid-height base with storage under a clear plastic lid.  </li>
            <li> the problem resided in the base unit which they said could not be opened and fixed.</li>
            <li> This should be noted on the product detail - and no excuse Braun for not having a multi-voltage charger :(</li>
            <li> In the past,  going to the dentist was a dreaded event because it seemed like the dentist would go on scraping at my poor teeth and gums forever!  </li>
            <li> I contacted them through the Live Chat which was, sorry, worthless.  </li>
            <li> I also found the charging very slow and</li>
            <li> And the every 30 second notification of time is annoying.  </li>
            <li> OxyJet has a dual base for charging the irrigator at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We never considered an electric toothbrush, thinking it would be just another unnecessary gadget cluttering up the house.  </li>
            <li> Little disappointed that the product description was not accurate, but after reading the reviews it sounds like those two attachments were useless anyway</li>
            <li> Due to family heredity and some bad habits I have the start of gingivitis.</li>
            <li> 7400 has a short squat base that charges the toothbrush like any other base.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m at the dentist (a less painful cleaning, and hopefully no cavities).  </li>
            <li> Also the base and toothbrush would get very dirty if you did not clean it regularly.  </li>
            <li> My dentist has hated me forever and my teeth are solidly yellow.</li>
            <li> The tongue cleaner is worse than useless.  </li>
            <li> I did try a lower version of Oral B&#x27;s power toothbrushes and was not impressed</li>
            <li> Useless.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B comes with a bunch of accessories (flosser, tongue cleaner), but they are useless.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t mean to complain about the Sonicare or claim it&#x27;s a bad product.</li>
            <li> so stop so my mouth and lips wouldnt get numb by the vibration.  </li>
            <li> pick replacements are very expensive and, in my opinion, just aren&#x27;t a viable alternative to floss.</li>
            <li> For years I got failing grades from my hygienist and lived with greyish teeth, bleeding gums, and bad breath that made my wife turn away in the morning.</li>
            <li> conclusion: The control is too bad.</li>
            <li> disappointed that I must return to the manual now.   </li>
            <li> But in the meantime, I&#x27;m certainly disappointed that Oral-B has given a bargain-bin treatment to a premium-priced product.</li>
            <li> The base holds 4 heads.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D; BASE &#x3D;&lt;</li>
            <li> /&gt;The 7850 and 8850 have a taller base that includes storage for up to four brush heads under a lid that provides protection from dust - and from sink area sprays.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, the base is the storage unit for the heads when not in use.</li>
            <li> This was quite an annoying task and consumed 15 to 20 minutes each time.  </li>
            <li> on securing the base to a wall.</li>
            <li> They sent me the base model, even though I bought it as a deal of the day advertising the DLX model.  </li>
            <li> The base is so top-heavy</li>
            <li> Literally, I couldn&#x27;t go three weeks after a dentist appointment without having to scrape my teeth myself, which is a very bad thing to do.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Comes with an assortment of brush heads to experiment with.  The base holds 4 heads.  It charges quickly and lasts around a week.  A lot quieter than the last model I owned.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I noticed a difference in my teeth within a week of use.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Due to family heredity and some bad habits I have the start of gingivitis. My dentist recommended Oral B and I had the previous version of this brush for years before the battery quit.  Because that version did not have the option to remove and replace the battery I had to upgrade. I have actually healed some of the damage to my teeth and gums with these products.  I did try a lower version of Oral B&#x27;s power toothbrushes and was not impressed, that went to someone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I did, and I like the documentation, which is in English, Spanish, and French.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush heads sent with it are nice, especially for those who have not used any of them before.  I do agree it is difficult to do the back teeth, but don&#x27;t give up.  Electric brushes take a bit of a learning curve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also thrilled that this one has a wall mount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a repeat buyer and user of Oral B products and plan to be for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also am happy that this product arrived 3 days earlier than expected.  I really like Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 6 months now. Excellent results. I owned an Oral-B before this one....lasted several years and was very pleased with it. I expect this one will last just as long.    This brush will clean your teeth MUCH better than a regular toothbrush, both in preventing buildup and whitening...at least that has been my experience. I have been using the included whitening brush (never used one with the older model) and can definitely tell the difference.     The brushes detach/attach easily, but never feel like they will fall off. Very well designed and constructed. Easy to clean...just run under water after use, detach brush and wipe down the base. I know someone who doesn&#x27;t clean theirs after each use and the brush appeared to be wielded on the first time it needed to be replaced. But if you are a pig you&#x27;ll still get the brush off....just a bit more effort.    If you have never used an electric toothbrush before you may want to buy something VERY cheap just to see if your teeth/gums can handle it. I know people who can&#x27;t use electric brushes at all because of sensitivity.    Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned Oral-B brushes forever, and this is the best one yet.  Really holds its charge, but when it runs down it does take a while to bring it back to \\&quot;full.\\&quot;  Money well spent.  Standard brushes can be had much cheaper by shopping on ebay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using other less expensive (slow speed) Oral-B tooth brushes for years at the recommendation of my dentist after he noticed substantial enamel erosion along my gum line from aggressive brushing with a manual firm bristle toothbrush. The high rotary speed of this toothbrush makes a noticeable difference in plaque removal compared to the less expensive low speed units. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this a 4 only because you will still need to floss if you want to really take care of your teeth.  As far as brushing goes, it does a 5-star job and it has already (after 2 months) improved my gums. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Someone said it felt too unsubstantial after having had a Sonicare.  I, for one, am happy to have a lighter toothbrush do a better job than the heavy one (I admit, I had a really OLD Sonicare--the charger must have been over 10 years old at the least, maybe 15, and I was on my second handle--they could be different now). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;d recommend this highly.  Hope it lives as long as the Sonicare brushes lived.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe anyone would rate this system lower than 5 stars!  The round head is much better than that of Sonicares \\&quot;traditional\\&quot; head, AND it&#x27;s much easier to keep clean...Basically its 0 up-keep as where the Sonicare requires attention due to a poor design.  Go ahead.... buy this sytem, and enjoy!</li>
            <li> It works as advertised.  Not all products can do that.  Teeth feel cleaner and look whiter after several weeks of use.  It works.  Additional brushes are rather expensive, but I don&#x27;t know yet how long they will last.</li>
            <li> I have used the Oral-B Professional Care electronic toothbrush 1-2 times a day since I received it. My teeth are much cleaner and gums are healthier. I love the squeaky clean feeling on my teeth. It comes with several different heads but I have only used the \\&quot;dual cleaning\\&quot; brush. I am very happy with this purchase and look forward to showing my dentist my much improved smile.</li>
            <li> I bought a 2 pack of Braun electric brushes for me and my wife. After using it for a month I returned it. I usually do not return any item, least a personal item. But within 3 weeks I noticed that my teeth were more sensitive to cold water, etc. I did not want to use or pay for something that actually ruined my teeth. Looks like these brushes erode the enamel. Once eroded the enamel does not build back. Though I used these brushed around 1 year back, my teeth are still sensitive ever since I used them. The 2nd brush was for my wife and she had exactly the same experience as me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I would advise stick to your traditional brush. More technology is not always good.</li>
            <li> The first one only worked a few times before the button wouldn&#x27;t turn it on.  But amazon did a very swift return and this one is still working after a few weeks.  This thing is really noisy! And the every 30 second notification of time is annoying.  I don&#x27;t need to know when 30 seconds has past.  I like the 2 minute warning but every 30 seconds is too much. What it does is give you two little bursts of reduced speed. They should spend the money they spent on making it light up GREEN when fully charged to give you the option of shutting off or changing that. And really why do we need a green light? I brush then put back in the charger each time so its not like I need to know it is charged. I probably will try a different brand next time or look for one with less \\&quot;features\\&quot;. It brushes well and has two brush speeds.</li>
            <li> The bottom line is that with using this toothbrush and flossing well, I rarely have cavities.  Just by having one less cavity on one visit, you&#x27;ve paid for your new toothbrush.  It&#x27;s easy to clean and you can get replacement brush heads inexpensively on eBay.  There is really no reason not to own an excellent product like this.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm.  Bought 1 for me and 1 for my son-we both like the feel, the action, and the ease of use.  My wife has the Sonicare and likes it but I prefer the action of the Oral-B better.  (It is slightly noisier but certainly not enough to annoy.)</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Professional electric tooth brush makes my teeth and mouth feel and taste cleaner.  I recommend this tooth brush.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0002M50Z6 Oral B S-320 Sonic Complete Rechargeable Power Toothbrush]]    I bought this item for my daughter, whose other toothbrush had stopped functioning for her. She has been very pleased.  I have used an electric toothbrush for years, and it has really cut down on my dental visits and the cleaning time in the chair.  I would recommend any of the Oral B products or the Sonicare.  Get your children using these when they are old enough to use them properly.  I assure you that you will save money on dental visits!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush does quite a thorough job of tooth cleaning and breath freshening.  I like it.  Whether it&#x27;s the best thing on the market, I have no idea.  But, it does the job and I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Professional works very well. I had an older model of the professional and tried a lesser expensive Oral-B, and I found out they are not all equal. The vibration of the cheaper model was annoying, where as this one is much smoother and easier to use. I actually enjoy brushing for the full 2-minutes, which is made easier by the 30-second timer built into the handle. I recommend this.</li>
            <li> This Oral B electric toothbrush is wonderful. Instead of manually scrubbing my gums away (not quite, but ...) this brush does all the work for me in a gentle way. The teeth look and feel clean, the timer helps brushing everywhere for the right time, it&#x27;s just a pleasure cleaning the teeth with this professional care brush. Highly recommended. Noise level is low.</li>
            <li> This is not Amazon&#x27;s fault I think but the toothbrush died after 2 weeks.  I started using it on 9/4/2010 and it stopped working on 09/18/2010. I only used it 1x a day. It was my first time using &amp; purchasing an electric toothbrush, I chose Oral B because of the many good reviews.     I never kept the charger plugged in, it was only plugged in for it&#x27;s 18 hour full charges which only happened 2x in my possession.     I always separated the head from the brush so both can dry.     I don&#x27;t know what happened, supposedly it was new, it was in the 2 yr warranty period.     I called Oral B customer service to ask what can be done, since I bought it from Amazon, they wanted me to return it, get my refund and that&#x27;s it. How helpful?     I was happy for those 2 weeks, disappointed that I must return to the manual now.   I guess brand new toothbrushes malfunction in a short time in a blue moon.   Now off to find another toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I really like this electric toothbrush.  After only using it for one month my teeth look better and my dentist noticed a difference in the health of my gums.</li>
            <li> Very durable for this road warrior. The SonicCare I used to have would break off at the stem and the current model my boyfriend has looks just as fragile. Both appear to brush well, though.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a direct replacement of the first one, which was recommended by my dentist. It lasted two years before the battery would no longer hold a charge. That wasn&#x27;t very good, but I like the way it works, and my checkups have been good since using it - much better than when I was using a manual brush, and that&#x27;s the bottom line for me. We&#x27;ll see if this one lasts longer. Amazon&#x27;s price on sale was about 25% less than Target or Walmart. I find I replace the brush head about twice as frequently (about 6 weeks) as recommended by Oral B. It pays to buy them in bulk at a wholesale club.</li>
            <li> This is not the highest end model, but it does everything the high end Oral B&#x27;s do, at half the cost. Not only that, but it is slimmer and allows a better grip and more control over the thicker Triumph series units. You simply cannot go wrong with one of these models.</li>
            <li> I had an Oral B for years, it finally died, and I replaced it with a Sonic,  that I had been told was \\&quot;better\\&quot; than the Oral B.  Well, I tried to get used to the Sonic, which is what I was also told I&#x27;d have to do........but I never did.  When this was on a special deal I ordered it and am once again happy with my toothbrush.  Having tried both I can recommend the Oral B, the Sonic is something else again..............</li>
            <li> Just used this toothbrush for the first time.  My husband and I have had Sonicare brushes for years, but decided to switch to these because brush head refills were cheaper, and we liked the \\&quot;spin\\&quot; action.  Wow!  My teeth feel like I just left the dentist!  These really get in between teeth.  Many people damage their gums with these types of brushes by pushing too hard, but these let you know if you are.  I am very glad we switched!</li>
            <li> First, Oral-B offers three lines of power toothbrushes: CrossAction, Sonic, and ProfessionalCare.  The Oral-B ProfessionalCare series is the top-of-the-line offering, and arguably the best in the industry.  My first Oral-B ProfessionalCare toothbrush finally started to wear out after ten years, so I certainly got my money&#x27;s worth - especially if you count my dentist crediting my improved tooth and gum condition to my improved brushing.  All toothbrushes, chargers, and brush heads within the ProfessionalCare line are interchangeable.  They all perform the same cleaning action on your teeth, yet there is a wide disparity in price range between models.  This review helps guide the choice within Oral-B&#x27;s ProfessionalCare line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D; OVERVIEW &#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon currently offers the 7400, 7850, 8850 DLX, 8900 \\&quot;OxyJet\\&quot;, 9400 \\&quot;Triumph\\&quot;, 9900 \\&quot;Triumph Smart Guide\\&quot;, and 9950 \\&quot;Triumph Special Edition\\&quot;.  You can find most of these on Oral-B&#x27;s web site, but it is hard to use and difficult to compare.  Here&#x27;s the summary:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- 7400 is a short-base fully functional basic model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- 7850 and 8850 DLX are tall-base models storing extra brush heads under the lid.  The 8850 DLX includes extra brush heads in the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- 8900 \\&quot;OxyJet\\&quot; is a 7850 plus a second appliance (NOT another toothbrush): \\&quot;an oral irrigator with innovative micro-bubble technology\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- All Triumph models have Oral-B&#x27;s newer \\&quot;attractive design\\&quot; for both brush handle and base, but still use the same brush heads and cleaning action as all other ProfessionalCare models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D; BASE &#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;The 7400 has a short squat base that charges the toothbrush like any other base.  For a single user, this cheaper model is the one to get as you will just keep your brush head on the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 7850 and 8850 have a taller base that includes storage for up to four brush heads under a lid that provides protection from dust - and from sink area sprays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 8900 OxyJet has a dual base for charging the irrigator at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All Triumph models have a mid-height base with storage under a clear plastic lid.  The 9950 Special Edition also includes a travel charging base.  Personally, I pack a manual toothbrush for trips and leave the Oral-B at home for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D; HANDLE &#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;All the handles are the same to me.  Admittedly, some will find the Triumph handles slightly more attractive.  Also, I suspect there is an increase in battery capacity as you move up from the 7000 series through 8000 and up to the 9000&#x27;s, but I have not been able to verify through documentation.  The 8000 models I used personally have plenty of charge for two people to brush in the morning - and probably more, though I never tested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 9950 Special Edition of the Triumph model includes a second handle so that two people can brush at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D; BRUSHES &#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;As noted in the introduction above, all brush heads are interchangeable.  Buying a more expensive model does not affect the cleaning action on your teeth.  The 8850 DLX bundles one of each type of brush head into the package.  See my uploaded photos for details.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D; TIMERS &#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;This almost inconsequential feature was a major differentiator that set Oral-B power toothbrushes apart from their competitors in early reviews by dental professionals.  All ProfessionalCare models have some degree of timer built-in so you&#x27;ll know that you&#x27;ve brushed your teeth long enough.  The basic timer interrupts the brush spinning action three times in rapid succession after two minutes of brushing, so you hear a brief \\&quot;stuttering\\&quot; as your signal.  All of today&#x27;s models do this, along with a single spin interruption every 30 seconds so you can perceive progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Triumph models add an actualLCD display into the brush handle so you can see exactly how many seconds you&#x27;ve been brushing.  But who can look at the handle while brushing?  The higher-end Triumph Models, specifically the 9900 and 9950, include a separate \\&quot;Smart Guide\\&quot; displaying your brushing time on the sink counter.  It seems like expensive overkill to me personally, but at least you don&#x27;t have to stop brushing to see how long it&#x27;s been.  The same is true for the spin stuttering models, so it&#x27;s really a matter of choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D; GENERAL RECOMMENDATION &#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;From years of experience I can recommend the Oral-B ProfessionalCare line with confidence.  Ultimately the choice between models comes down to individual preferences.  Generally speaking, the cheapest model (7400) is a good fit for single users because there is no need to store extra brush heads in the charger base.  A tall base with storage is a good fit for couples, such as the 7850 or 8850 DLX.  The high-end Triumph series is for those willing to pay more for gadgetry and aesthetics.LCD display into the brush handle so you can see exactly how many seconds you&#x27;ve been brushing.

            <li> the first of using this brush.. left me a good impression.     the cleaning outcome is really great.     suggestion: may be the can provide sound alert instead of a shout pause.</li>
            <li> This unit has 3 speed settings which provide flexibility when having sensitive gums or fast speed to do a thorough job of cleaning. I have not  used the polishing setting. The 30 second timer is helpful in providing a signal when to move on to another quadrant. The charging light goes off after fully charged. I do run the battery down from time to time to make sure the battery life is maxed out. A red light comes on to help determine when charging is needed. I believe you should run the battery all the way down once a year.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised - but this was purchased for use at home and travel and the charger is only 110V so it&#x27;s no good for anywhere using 220/240V power. This should be noted on the product detail - and no excuse Braun for not having a multi-voltage charger :(</li>
            <li> I really liked this toothbrush until I discovered that it didn&#x27;t hold a charge for more than 2 brushings.  I was going to return it and exchange it for another one but found out that evidently others also had problems with it, so Amazon stopped selling it.  I did order an Oral B Professional Care 1000, which is slightly less \\&quot;deluxe\\&quot;, and, so far, am happy with it.</li>
            <li> I decided to start using an electrice toothbrush again because I am a cancer survivor who has dental problems in part due to the radiation treatments.  The round head is best for me as it reaches around all the teeth very well.  The slower speed and softer bristles are beneficial too for a sensitive mouth and teeth.  I find no problem in keeping it clean.  After each use, remove the head, rinse and let stand by itself to dry.  Also wipe the drive shaft to be sure it is free of any moisture.  I am pleased with my choice.</li>
            <li> It took a long time to purchase an electric toothbrush. I have a hard time spending that much money on something that seems so trivial... But, we are very happy. The brush heads come with different color bands so the toothbrush can be shared. Also, the base is the storage unit for the heads when not in use. I like that it pulses every 30 seconds to let you know when 2 minutes are up. My only complaint about this brush is that when it&#x27;s time to turn it off, we have to press the buttons a few times to get it to turn off. Other than that, I actually look forward to brushing my teeth, 2, even 3 times a day!</li>
            <li> Loved it since the first time i used it you feel your teeth totelly clean, it is quick and effective, the battery lasts almost a week, it is made in germany and you definitely feel it is good quality</li>
            <li> Simply put: this is an excellent product. It&#x27;s faster than the version we bought 5-6 years ago. We love it. We&#x27;ve retired the older one--which still works--to our vacation home.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after my dentist suggested it to me. I purchased a new, but already opened box, which concerned me when I saw the condition of the outside of the box.  But, the unit itself and all the components were new as described. The battery took about 24 hours to fully charge, and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since.  I even took it on a week-long vacation, without the charger and had no trouble with it. The brush worked as well on day 7 as on day 1.    I&#x27;ve only used the Sensitive brush on the sensitive setting and I feel like I&#x27;m doing good things for my teeth. I would recommend this product. My dentist specifically liked the feature that would stop the brushing action if I press too hard. I&#x27;ve tested this, but only got it to stop spinning after pressing harder than anyone would in a normal situation. I&#x27;m not sure I see much value in this feature, but it is the one that convinced me to buy this model over the others.</li>
            <li> I have owned earlier Oral B&#x27;s and a Sonicare.  This product is superior, IMO, to both. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I stopped using my Sonicare some time ago because my teeth just did not feel that clean after I finished - particularly in back.  I thought it was just me until I switched back to manual brushing and found my teeth to be far more clean.  At that time I assumed that I was not using the Sonicare correctly, which may have been the case.  Recent studies suggest, however, that the Sonicare does no more for cleaning than a standard toothbrush and only those using a rotating action actually remove more plaque - albeit a marginal difference. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This sold me on the Oral B.  So far, the brush seems to clean very well.  The speed is good without being punishing.  The brush head size  is comfortable to reach the back teeth.  A slimmer shaft would be nice like the newer Sonicare. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My only complaint in the product&#x27;s operation is that I cannot feel or hear the difference when the pulsating action stops due to excessive pressure.  I would like to have a better idea of the sweet-spot, as it were, for pressure.  Without this feedback, which the documentation indicates should be obvious, I am unsure as to the effectiveness or functioning of the pulsating action.  The 2 minute timer is great and I like that it does not shut off after the 2 minutes has been reached.  I always felt like I was racing against the clock with the Sonicare. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A carrying case would have also been nice and the charging indicator is like having a airport landing beacon in your bathroom. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Oral B seems like the best product out there right now to me.  I would encourage anyone thinking of spending the $$$ to do some research regarding the effectiveness of these products to develop a realistic expectation of their advantages over regular brushing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been so excited about brushing my teeth!  I could never use anything else after being introduced to such an incredibly superior product.  There is definately a significant difference in the texture as well as the shade of my teeth.  This item is ideal for the application of whitening agents and the overall results are phenomenal!  Don&#x27;t pass it up if you are at all concerned about your oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> Just got back from the dentist and the toothbrush lived up to its billing. I had problems with my gums receeding and was told that they were in good shape now. There was little plaque buildup. These were the 2 areas I bought the 8850 for and seems to be doing a good job.</li>
            <li> I chose this toothbrush after my basic Oral B electric toothbrush finally wore down after a few years. Figured it was somehow &#x27;better&#x27; since it was &#x27;professional&#x27; and &#x27;deluxe.&#x27; This toothbrush short-circuited after about 4 months. Water somehow gets into the battery (from the top or bottom, who knows), rendering it useless...until it dries, then it becomes schizophrenic and turns on at random times. It finally lost all ability to recharge....waste of money. Buy the basic one, they all use the same brush heads, so you get the same clean.</li>
            <li> This system with its soft brush attachment worked very well right after dental implant surgery which requires scrupulous cleaning 3x a day.  There are several brush attachments, one for every need.  I previously had a more expensive system but after two of them wore out quicker than they should have, I switched to this system and am delighted with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m replacing the toothbrush that I&#x27;ve had for 5 years.  Great toothbrush.     I want to add though that I never received the order.  I contacted them through the Live Chat which was, sorry, worthless.  When I called Amazon, they resent the order and I received it the next day.  I never did receive the first one sent, don&#x27;t know what happened!</li>
            <li> In the past,  going to the dentist was a dreaded event because it seemed like the dentist would go on scraping at my poor teeth and gums forever!  However, since I started using the Oral B electric toothbrush I am in and out of the dentist in no time!!!!  This is an amazing product for keeping those cavities at bay.  I will never go back to using a standard toothbrush again.  My teeth and gums are very happy with the change...  -&gt;  :D see?  The bonus to the deluxe model is that there is a compartment that holds (and keeps covered) 4 toothbrush heads.  It keeps them dust free and out of site... and that&#x27;s two things I love in a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I bought this via Amazon from DiscountsJungle. I used it for 3 weeks and it quit holding a charge. I wrote DiscountsJungle but more than a month had passed so they refused to take any action and told me to contact the maker. I haven&#x27;t done that yet but a brand new product should last longer than 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I had not used an electric toothbrush since the 70s.  This is a totally different product - much more effective.  The level of cleaning is noticeable.  Bet my dental hygienist notices too.</li>
            <li> Great product.  This is the 2nd or 3rd Oral B toothbrush that I&#x27;ve owned.  The one before this lasted for many years.  Finally the rechargeable battery gave up the ghost!  This new one brushes and cleans my teeth even better than the last one.  I get my teeth professionally cleaned every 6 months and the dental hygienist always says that I am her easiest patient.</li>
            <li> I was ready for a new system and my dentist recommended the 8800 series.  I was skeptical because I loved my Sonicare. This is a great system -  I did notice a difference in just a few days.  I really like having a choice of brush heads and the gum stimulators.  (It doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars because it&#x27;s noisier during use.)</li>
            <li> this is a great toothbrush.  I have not really tried all of the features, but it does a great job with just brushing. A great oral care tool.</li>
            <li> I had been using a Sonicare Power Toothbrush for 5 years before switching over to the Oral-B.  This switch was based on the suggestion of my dentist.  He feels that the Sonicare just does not work as well as the Oral-B and the upkeep with the Oral-B would be easer.  After using the Oral-B for three months, I have to agree with my dentist. The upkeep is much easer as the head of the brush is removable not allowing gunk and mildew to build up inside the handle.  With the Sonicare toothbrush, I had to unscrew the head from the handle once a week and using a Q-tip, wipe the inside clean from the buildup.  This was quite an annoying task and consumed 15 to 20 minutes each time.  With the Oral-B, this is not possible because the thin brush head is removed every time after use and stored within the self contained holder making the clean up very easy.  Another point I would like to make, is the brush heads cost much less that the Sonicare ones making this brush more economical to own.  All in all, I am very happy I switch to the Oral-B.</li>
            <li> I bought this item &amp; it works great. I like the front light that tells me its charging &amp; the multiple heads for cleaning. Its easy &amp; does its job. I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have always liked oral-b and they have an exceptional toothbrush with this electric one. I needed one who helped all my problems and it does.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended that I buy an electric toothbrush.  After doing some searching and reading the other Oral B reviews, I bought this toothbrush.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about one month now, and I can feel and see a noticeable difference.  My teeth, and mouth feel cleaner, my tongue less furry (for lack of a better scientific term - more technically, if using a \\&quot;tongue scraper,\\&quot; there is less to scrape), my gums look better, and my teeth do appear whiter.  I&#x27;ve used the \\&quot;dual action\\&quot; head, and the polisher in conjunction with Arm &amp; Hammer Advance White Brilliant Sparkle Baking Soda toothpaste.  Like some of the other reviewers provide, all the attachments probably aren&#x27;t necessary and may not be used.  Charging the toothbrush has not been too much of an issue.     Overall, I have been very happy with the results in the short time period that I have used the toothbrush, and hope to have better results next time I&#x27;m at the dentist (a less painful cleaning, and hopefully no cavities).  I would strongly recommend buying this item to anyone who is in the market for an electric toothbrush - I didn&#x27;t know it could make such a difference, and wish I had purchased it sooner.</li>
            <li> I was a loyal Sonicare customer until I purchased the Oral-B Professional. Wow, what a difference in performance! It cleaned my teeth much better then Sonicare. It delivers what it promises. I am sure at my next dentist appointment it will be less painful. It really removes stubborn plaque and improves gum health for which I have had issues with it the past. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I just received what was supposed to be the Deluxe 8850 DLX Oral-B, but like another reviewer, received just the Professional Care 8850, which seems like the Deluxe version without the attachments (I hope that is the only difference). This apparently happened to other people too, so if the attachments are important to you, you may want to buy this elsewhere or risk several cycles of buy/return.    Having said that, the one I got looks pretty much like an updated version of my old Oral-B brush that I am replacing (battery finally died after around 7-8 years)--and I loved that one so much I was desperate to get this new one when it died!</li>
            <li> For the last couple of years I was using a cheap ($25)electric toothbrush I bought at a supermarket. It&#x27;s like night and day. You spend more but the results are incredible. I also like the powerful battery so when you are out of town you don&#x27;t need the charger. The 2 minute timer is also a plus. Great product!</li>
            <li> I have been using electric toothbrushes for years, and my dental hygenist has always told me that I have hardly any plack on my teeth. So I guess my Oral_b is doing the trick.</li>
            <li> This has been a great toothbrush.  I have used the Sonicare for the past 4 years and I enjoyed that toothbrush as well.  However, its batter was dying and I was trying to decide whether or not to buy a new sonicare or go a difference route and get the professionalcare.  I am glad for the switch. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My dentist recommended the change (though he does like the sonicare as well, but he thought I might want to try something different) and I will not go back.  I love the pushing/vibrating feel against my teeth.  This is not a sensitive toothbrush, you can feel the bristles go to work on your teeth.  It really seems to have made a difference in cleaning up the plaque and keeping my teeth very clean. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It seems to be slightly messier than my sonicare (toothpaste, etc. running down the handle as I brush) but I am very pleased by my purchase.  My package also came with the hummingbird flosser (not my favorite and I can do the same thing with a normal flosser than turning this one on) and some different heads for the toothbrush.  This has been a good buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about four months. I think it&#x27;s better than the Sonicare I tried, but which you prefer is going to be an individual choice. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used manual toothbrushes for most of my life, but about nine months ago my dental hygenist prompted me to try an electric as a potential time-saver.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I first went with an inexpensive Oral-B which ran on AA batteries, and found it was a bit easier to use than a manual. The small round brusheads are easier to fit behind my back teeth, and electric toothbrushes in general seem to stimulate the gums a bit more. The big advantage for me is that it&#x27;s faster; I used to brush for 3-4 minutes with a manual, and I find 2 minutes with an Oral-B seems to work just as well. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t find it was earth-shakingly different, though. Since my dental hygiene before switching was \\&quot;near-perfect\\&quot; (I get checkups every three months and only rarely does my hygenist have to do anything at all) neither I nor my dentist have noticed any differences. I&#x27;m not convinced that electric brushes in general are more effective than a properly-used manual. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The cheap Oral-B brushes are... really cheap, and I think they&#x27;re overpriced given how often they fail. If you want to spend $50-$100 a year replacing toothbrushes, that&#x27;s certainly one way to do it. I tried two of them, and both of them failed in different ways within 3 months. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I next tried a top-of-the-line Sonicare; a local store offered a 30-day money-back guarantee so I figured it was worth a try (they don&#x27;t sell any non-cheap Oral-B products or I would&#x27;ve done that instead). Yes, it was probably built well... and heavy, and the handle was immense compared to the Oral-B. I found it very awkward to use, and I don&#x27;t think it was doing a very good job of cleaning because I noticed substantially more gunk from flossing than before I started using it.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mean to complain about the Sonicare or claim it&#x27;s a bad product. My point is that there *are* differences, and you may very well find one electric works better than another. My hygenist mentioned that some people greatly prefer the Sonicare brushes, and they can&#x27;t be that bad all around because many people are successfully using them. They just didn&#x27;t work for me (more accurately, I should say the one I tried didn&#x27;t work). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The 8850 is built quite a bit better than the cheap Oral-B brushes and it should definitely last longer. It&#x27;s certainly more waterproof (I had problems with water getting into the housing of the others). The size fits my hand well, and it seems just as easy to use as their others. I also like the variable-speed feature, though I wish there were a way to set it once rather than having to reset it every time I use it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Plan on securing the base to a wall. If it&#x27;s sitting on a sink or shelf it&#x27;ll probably need cleaning more often, and it&#x27;s pretty easy to knock over. Also note that the tongue cleaner or vibrating pick attachment don&#x27;t quite fit in the attachment holder; it&#x27;s apparently meant for brushes only, which could be a minor irritation if you use them regularly. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The timer feature might be useful, but that depends greatly on how you brush. I don&#x27;t use quadrants, instead I brush my lower teeth (doing the fronts, then the tops, then the backs), then the uppers. Thus the 30 second timer doesn&#x27;t help me very much, and I could never quite figure out what the 2-minute timer was for--what happens when the two minutes are up and I haven&#x27;t finished the backs of my upper teeth yet? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never needed to use anything other than the ultrasoft heads, and since I usually brush 4-5 times a day I prefer using the most gentle brush I can find. (The general advice is that stiffer brushes don&#x27;t clean any better anyway.) The other attachments (tongue scraper, vibrating pick) seem OK, but I prefer using floss, a manual gum stimulator, and a plain tongue scraper instead.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pick replacements are very expensive and, in my opinion, just aren&#x27;t a viable alternative to floss. Some people prefer using a vibrating tongue scraper because they don&#x27;t stimulate the gag reflex as much. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Oral-B head replacements in general are expensive, and they really do need replacement every three months (mine start visibly fraying around that time). It&#x27;s worth taking that into account when looking at prices, because they&#x27;re a substantial investment. And shop around, occasionally they can be found for much less than the usual retail prices. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t used an electric (or an Oral-B) before, I&#x27;d suggest trying one of the cheap/disposable electric brushes first... and you may want to try two or three different brands so you can get a feel for which style you prefer. Money-back guarantees are important here, because some people seem to really dislike certain types of brushes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve used and like the cheap Oral-Bs and want something that will last for more than a month, the 8850 would be a good alternative. I&#x27;m not convinced the uber-3D cleaning action (or whatever they&#x27;re calling it this week) really works any better than their others... but it probably doesn&#x27;t hurt, and the two-year warranty on the 8850 is a win.</li>
            <li> My expectation was pretty high when I first saw the commercial...but the actual power of product isn&#x27;t that great. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> My dentist has hated me forever and my teeth are solidly yellow. I finally decided to try an electric toothbrush, and I decided to give this one a shot.    There&#x27;s a lot of reviews on various electric toothbrushes that suggest that it takes some time before your mouth accepts the vibrations (i.e. it can hurt a bit for a while), but I didn&#x27;t experience this at all.    It&#x27;s certainly not magic. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and my teeth are still yellow, but it definitely feels like I&#x27;m washing them much more effectively. I&#x27;ve been using the \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; head, which feels like it has a rubberized cap in the center, between the bristles, which you can use to sit on your tooth like a ball-socket joint, allopermittingwing rotation.</li>
            <li> Purchased the Oral B Professional Care 3000 after reading reviews and their advertising that dentists recommend it. I had been using a Sonicaire Elite for over 5 years with great results, but that unit died and it was time for something new. Short story is I have returned the Oral B to the manufacturer under their great 60 Day Challenge policy. In my experience, the Sonicaire is a much more effective product for the money. Just received my new one from Amazon yesterday.    Pros:   -Bit less expensive than some Sonicaire models.  -60 Day Challenge which enabled me to try and return it.    Cons:   -My wife and were both unpleasantly surprised at how much the units vibrated our heads while brushing. Certainly not inspiring us to brush more/longer.  -Used the unit for about a month and had a dental cleaning. Hygienist said I had more stain on my teeth and gums were more raw than my previous checkup just 4 months before. Only change in habit was the Oral B toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love all the different heads. I change them out every day. My teeth never felt so clean. Plus I got the %50 discount. Just amazing.</li>
            <li> Nice product. We were worried we would have to purchase additional heads since there&#x27;s going to be two of us using it, but it comes with 4 heads: a standard round one, a softer round one, a big double one, and one that looks like the dentists professional toothbrush with a little thing for toothpaste in it. It gives two quick pauses while you are brushing to let you know to switch to another section of your mouth, which is handy.</li>
            <li> A++ Best price found. The dentist always says how nice my teeth look. It&#x27;s great for multiple users and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the brush and the timer it has with it. 30 seconds per mouth quadrant works great for me. I got this to help with receding gums b/c I&#x27;m generally a hard brusher and the dentist recommended an electric. I did my research and found this one on Amazon and decided to get it. It&#x27;s been great so far.</li>
            <li> Most of my family has gum problems: my husband, my step-mother, my step-sister...Anyway, my husband and I purchased an Oral B toothbrush 4 years ago and my husband&#x27;s gum problems have disappeared.  So I purchased one for my sister 2 years ago for Christmas, since she was going to the dentist for cleanings every 3 months.  Her problems disappeared and she is now only seeing the dentist twice a year.  This year I bought one for my step-mother and father, and my step-mother says that she can already see and feel a difference in the health of her gums.  I highly recommend this product for everyone, though. Your teeth feel like you just got your teeth cleaned at the dentist!!</li>
            <li> If your looking for a great electric toothbrush I would highly recommend this one!  I bought one for myself last year when my old one which was an Oral B stopped working. It was really old and I needed to upgrade.  For Christmas 2007, I bought another one for my husband, which he really loves. I purchased the first one based on the reviews in here and glad I took the time to do some research. I love the polisher brush it really does wonders if you have any stains on your teeth. Great for coffee and tea drinkers. It really feels like your getting a good cleaning. Very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I ordered this item back in May - it&#x27;s a couple days before July now, and I still don&#x27;t have it.  They sent me the base model, even though I bought it as a deal of the day advertising the DLX model.  When I returned it, and asked for the model I had actually ordered, it took 6 weeks for them to replace it - with the SAME base model.  Seriously. I just got it 2 days ago.  When I emailed to ask them once again to give me the DLX model, they emailed me back and said sorry for the mix-up, but it would just happen again, so instead of sending me the right one, they cancelled my order.  I can&#x27;t help but think this attitude proves that this is a bait-and-switch situation.  I&#x27;m not saying that the base model isn&#x27;t a great toothbrush - it might be - but if I buy the DLX model, I WANT the DLX model!  Be warned that you might not get it if you order it - I read some reviews that said this might happen, but stupidly didn&#x27;t think that it would happen to me because I&#x27;ve had pretty good luck with Amazon until now.</li>
            <li> I used a regular toothbrush for many many years but never felt that I ever got my teeth really clean.  I could always feel just a little of the plaque or the slightly gritty coating in a few spots - especially on my back teeth where it&#x27;s always been hard for me to brush adequately with a regular toothbrush.  The hygenist would always get these areas squeaky clean during my regular 6-month checkups/cleanings, but the buildup would eventually start in again.  A couple of years ago I bought a battery-operated toothbrush (Crest) and it did a much better job of cleaning my teeth.  However, I spent almost as much money on batteries during that period that what it cost me to buy my new Oral B.  I finally decided to bite the bullet and purchase a \\&quot;real\\&quot; electric toothbrush.  I did a lot of research and settled on the Oral B.  Although I have a couple of friends who purchased the Oral B and love it, I&#x27;ll admit that I had some reservations up front as to whether I would be happy with it.   However, in a nutshell, I could tell the first time I used it that this was the toothbrush for me.  I was totally amazed at how well it cleaned my teeth - especially the hard-to-reach spots in the back.  My teeth have never felt this clean before except immediately after professional cleaning.  I absolutely love it and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> My Periodontist recommended the Oral B line of motorized toothbrushes, so I picked this and love it. I have had it for a month and have found it easy to use and maintain. I will say that it comes with a number of attachments that I don&#x27;t use. In the case of the tongue scraper and gum stimulators, I prefer my hand-held versions. And the larger brush-heads don&#x27;t offer me anything more than I need. I get all the cleaning power and reach I need with the standard brush. And I love the way the brush gives you little alerts every 30 seconds (and a special one at 2 min) so you can pace yourself.</li>
            <li> I have used an Oral-B toothbrush for 5+ years now and it finally died on me, so I decided to do some research and see what was new in the world of electric toothbrushes. Turns out not much has changed including pricing. This was about $95 and it works great. Both my husband and I use it twice a day and the battery last 3-4 days before we have to recharge it. My dentist says its a great toothbrush too.</li>
            <li> This is our third brush of this type in fifteen years not.  I think the warnings are a bothersome the two minute was all that was needed. Also we don&#x27;t think the extra speed settings are that useful.    Bob and Brenda Loving</li>
            <li> The unit is great.  Comes with a lot of accessories - I have not even used any of them yet.  Light weight, compact.  Much smaller than the sonic care I had a few years ago, but I think they may have made a smaller head for that by now.</li>
            <li> A great addition to my vanity full of stuff the last week of December 2006.  But a more functional item! Does what it said, cleans your teeth.  Takes a little getting used to, never had a tooth power scrubber before.  Will hold off on a final recommendation until this next tooth cleaning.  ;-)</li>
            <li> Not much can be said about a product that is pretty perfect in every respect. I have been using this toothbrush for almost two years now and cannot imagine ever going back to hand brushing. There is such a marked difference between this and hand-brushing that you can literally feel. My teeth have never felt cleaner and my gums have never been healthier. While I used to have pretty bad dental hygiene habits (I used to brush only about two times a day) this toothbrush has helped me improve me regimen tremendously. The results have been nothing short of miraculous. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I take this toothbrush everywhere I can and the charge tends to last several days before recharging is needed. At any rate, I suppose the only shortcoming of this toothbrush lies in the problems encountered when traveling a lot: The base station is simply too bulky to conveniently pack away and take with you. While this is not an issue on shorter trips, travelling in excess of a week will make you scramble for an alternative travel toothbrush. If this toothbrush came with a smaller travel charger, it would indeed be absolutely perfect.</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush.  Easy to use, good quality, and does a great job.  My teeth feel cleaner after using this toothbrush than they do using a regular one.</li>
            <li> I had a old Braun toothbrush that finally died.  I got this as a replacement and it works well.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush, but it doesn&#x27;t stop when you push to hard. That was the reason that I got the more expensive one, so I am a little disappointed...But overall the brushing experience is great and my teeth feel cleaner than I could ever get them with a manual brush.</li>
            <li> This is the second Oral-B Pro Care Deluxe Electric that I&#x27;ve purchased.  I am extremely pleased with this product and purchased it to leave with my wife in China until she clears immigration.</li>
            <li> this is my first eletronic toothbrush so i cant really compare to the other brands.  &lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s loud and the handle gets heavy after awhile. &lt;br /&gt;i think someone mention this already, the whole things feels cheap. there are even glitters on the handle..not what i was looking for. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;i had to open my mouth real wide so stop so my mouth and lips wouldnt get numb by the vibration.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;i will continue to use it , for one, i dont feel like returning it, for another, it&#x27;s suppose to be good for my teeth ..right ?</li>
            <li> Right out of the box I noticed that it did NOT come with the tongue brush or the inter dental attachment, it was not even listed as an option on the box, it only came with the brush heads listed in the description. Little disappointed that the product description was not accurate, but after reading the reviews it sounds like those two attachments were useless anyway so they probably updated the product to not include those anymore. No biggie. Other than that, this thing is great, my gums and teeth feel cleaner after  only a couple of uses. Still recommend, just be aware that the tongue thing and the inter dental thing are no longer included as of Dec 07.</li>
            <li> I am hard pressed to add any technical information to what others have already provided.  Yes, I think it is a wonderful toothbrush.  Yes, it is a bit messy to travel with as it has no case but I find that a ziplock baggie works just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My issue is that it is not quite what it seems.  It does not come with the Tongue Freshener (nor will it as this product is now discontinued), it doesn&#x27;t come with the Flosser and chances are it won&#x27;t come with the Pro White head.  Why you ask?  The product description says it includes all of these heads, the instructions included in the box indicate that all of the heads are included but the box itself says that it only includes the Precision head, the Dual Clean head, the Sensitive Clean head and the Pro White head (which still was not in my box).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So is it false advertising or a simple product mix up?  Is it Target&#x27;s fault or Oral-B&#x27;s.  In the end it doesn&#x27;t really matter, it isn&#x27;t what it seems.  When I contacted Oral-B to settle the issue I got no result from the e-mail customer service and was left feeling unsatisfied when I phoned customer service.  In all fairness they did agree to send me a Flosser and a Senstive head as well as add me to a list of potential candidates for focus groups. The encounter left me feeling as if they were doing me an unnecessary favor not making up for a problem they created.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion the toothbrush is fine, just don&#x27;t expect the extras because there is a chance they won&#x27;t be included in your box either.</li>
            <li> I already owned one of these but wanted to give to my Mom as a gift.  The items arrived as expected in a very timely fashion and with good packaging.  I&#x27;m am hopeful the gift will continue to work for her for a long time.</li>
            <li> I was supposed to get the DELUXE model but received the base model instead (no tongue freshener or pick). The toothbrush works fine, but I paid extra for the deluxe and I&#x27;d much rather get what I paid for. I&#x27;m almost done ordering from Amazon at this point--they are becoming VERY unreliable. PLEASE do not order this product from this site!!! If you really want it- and the product seems to be OK-- order from another online site and GET WHAT YOU PAID FOR!!!! ****Read the reviews for this item, Amazon seems not to know the difference between item models for some reason.****  Ughhh....</li>
            <li> I had been happily using Sonicare for about seven years.  I read positive reviews about Oral B and decided to try it.  A key reason I decided to try the Oral B is that I had to unscrew the brush head of the Sonicare once a week and clean the gunk out of it.  I hated doing this and often needed a cotton swab to clean the gunk out of the inside of the brush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In contrast, the Oral B is much easier to clean.  After each brushing I just pull the bush head off and rinse it off and wipe everything off with a towel.  It takes less than a minute and the toothbrush is always clean.  The Sonicare takes much longer to clean and the process is less pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But how does the Oral B clean?  The smaller brush head of the Oral B makes it easier to clean my back teeth and they are cleaner than they were with the Sonicare.  For my front teeth the two products are comparable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to take the charger with you when you travel the Sonicare charger is smaller than the Oral B charger.  But for trips of a week or two taking the charger just isn&#x27;t necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They both have 2 minute timers that prompt you to switch to different quadrant of your mouth every 30 seconds.  The Sonicare shuts off after 2 minutes but the Oral B signals that 2 minutes are up but keeps going in case you want to go for extra credit by brushing more than 2 minutes.  I just shut it off after 2 minutes.  I prefer the Sonicare approach on the timer but it&#x27;s not a big issue for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 minutes, the Oral B leaves my teeth -- front and back -- squeaky clean and the brush and handle are easy to keep clean, which is nice considering that this is a tool that you put in your mouth. There is also a device to attach to clean your tongue which seems to work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I switched from Sonicare and wouldn&#x27;t go back.  The Oral B leaves my mouth cleaner and is easier to maintain.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have been using this for about a month now and both of us really love the job it does.  I&#x27;ve used several eletric toothbrushes over the years and this one is the best by far.  I wish that Amazon would carry the 8800 model as the flossing tool and tongue cleaner a pretty much a waste of time in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never owned an electric toothbrush before and was hesitant to spend so much money on a toothbrush. I&#x27;ve been having problems with my gums and I have very, very sensitive teeth and I knew I needed to do MORE to take better care of my teeth and gums. I bought this toothbrush a week ago and I can already feel the difference in how my gums feel and how clean my teeth feel. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My gums are bleeding, but my understanding is that this is normal in the first week or so of using this toothbrush (my gums were bleeding before). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I spend most of my time in undeveloped countries and do not have access to good dental care. I believe this is one of the better ways for me to take the best care of my teeth as is possible and I only wish I would have bought it many years ago. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only negative I see is that I bought this one in the U.S. (where I&#x27;m staying for a few weeks) without paying attention to the voltage when I made the purchase. I don&#x27;t think I can use this same one outside of 110v countries.</li>
            <li> The OralCare System does an excellent job of cleaning both the teeth and the gums. I have trouble with plaque even though I floss and I wanted a good toothbrush that would help with this problem.  I am very impressed with all the attachments and have used all of them.  However, for brushing everyday I use the round head attachment.</li>
            <li> I was a dental nightmare. For years I got failing grades from my hygienist and lived with greyish teeth, bleeding gums, and bad breath that made my wife turn away in the morning. One day about a year ago I decided it was time to make a change in my life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I switched to the 8850 DLX machine from a low-end $20 power brush and started using various Rembrandt whitening toothpastes and finishing with Dr Ken&#x27;s mouthwash. I also began using Johnson and Johnson Stim-U-Dent Plaque Removers before the mouthwash.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For several weeks, my gums bled moderately and hurt after cleaning. I persisted with my new routine, the bleeding stopped, my breath was much improved and my latest annual checkup got me a perfect score. All this with a single brushing every morning followed by a rinse with a good plaque fighting mouthwash. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The 8850 did a lot to help me get where I am today. The 30 second quadrant time signal kept me honest, so I put in a full two minute brushing. The speed control let me use a slower more comfortable speed for a couple of months until my gums adjusted to the more serious routine - now I use maximum speed all the time. The round Oral B brush heads (I sugguest you avoid the oval style) let me get into the tight spaces way back in my mouth and clean every inch of my gumline.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The negatives are pretty trivial. The gadgets that ship with the deluxe kit are pretty much a joke in my opinion. After a few days I threw them away. The flashing blue charger light seems silly, but I&#x27;ve learned to ignore it.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The positives boil down to just one. This is a powerful aid to healthy gums if used daily. It took some getting used to, but it&#x27;s now changed my life - my wife no longer turns away in the morning and I can face my mirror and my dentist with a smile.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used an \\&quot;electric\\&quot; toothbrush in about 30 years. I had no idea what I was in for. I bought this on the recommendation of my dentist. Wow. It takes less time to clean my teeth than the old fashioned manual method and my teeth are much cleaner. What really amazes me is when I have it turned on and it is in my mouth, I can barely feel it. It is almost like brushing a feather up against my teeth. I totally recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush.  Been buying cheapos&#x27; for years all with inadequate power and brushheads last about a week.  Oral B has plenty of power, can really feel it doing its job.  Head has already lasted longer than most Cheapos&#x27; I used to buy.  Oral B more expensive, but this is a case of getting what you pay for.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B 8850 DLX Electric Toothbrush works great!  It&#x27;s more powerful than my last electric toothbrush and the NiMH batteries recharge easily, allowing me to \\&quot;top-off\\&quot; the batteries after each use.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush. However, check with your dentist. I purchased mine for about half of the price listed here.</li>
            <li> The brand is reliable.  I bought this three years ago.  It sill works.</li>
            <li> so many years of going through brushes and trying to protect gums and hit all the corners  Oral-B is the one that is the most effective and a great value. teeth get extra clean and breath is feeling extra fresh yes indeedy.everything is real compact and easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> I actually look forward to using this toothbrush each time.  It leaves your gums and mouth feeling stimulated and fresh.  My dentist says my teeth have never been cleaner -- better placque removal than during all the years I used successive Sonicares.  The Flexisoft Oral-B brushhead (included in the package) fits well into all crevices and corners, and seems to cup each tooth for a very thorough cleaning.  The Polishing brushhead, also included, whitens my teeth as well as any bleaching product I ever tried.  I&#x27;m happy not to use those bleaching chemicals anymore, and it&#x27;s great to now be free of the painful sensitivity they caused.  Thank you Oral-B for such a superior and well-made product.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is great!  It works great; it comes with lots of accessories too.  It improved the cleanliness of my teeth and the healthiness of my gums so much!  It has a timer so you know exactly when to switch areas of your mouth and when to stop brushing.  I wish I would have bought this a long time ago! &lt;br /&gt;Oh, and - I bought it from my dentist \\&quot;at cost\\&quot; for only $65!!  So check with them first. &lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended toothbrush! &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I have used this brush for a couple of months now. So far, I really like it. First, it seemed as though the bristles were too stiff, but I got used to that in just a few days.     Now, I use all the different heads, the three that came with the toothbrush and an extra soft head. In fact, I usually brush my teeth for 2 minutes with a regular head and then two minutes more with the polisher head. My teeth are looking pretty nice.    I like the way the brush alerts me when 30 seconds have passed, and then gives a longer alert when the two minutes are up. But, the brush doesn&#x27;t stop after two minutes...it just keeps going in case I want to brush longer. My old Sonicare stopped after two minutes.    I had used a Sonicare tooth brush for quite a few years. It was the older style and the head was a bit large and it was hard to get the back teeth. Then my dentist sold me a Rotadent power toothbrush. That was a mess. After using it for 6 months, when I went to get my teeth cleaned, it took twice as long to clean my teeth as they were all stained in between the teeth. I was really upset, to put it mildly. I don&#x27;t smoke and drink one cup of tea a day.    So I did some research and bought the Oral B 8850 DLX toothbrush and I am really liking it. Of course, the proof of how it works will be when I have my teeth cleaned next. I am hoping it will go well. If I can change this review, I will add that.</li>
            <li> I love the Oral B - Dentist was amazed and reduced plaque and cleaning    also much improved GUM (gingivitis)</li>
            <li> Alright, so that may seem obvious to some (that this is better than a manual toothbrush).  But I had to be convinced.  I am an extremely consciences brusher with a strong desire to never have any dental work done.  I brushed multiple times a day and brushed for a long time before going to bed ensuring that each tooth was clean.  Could an electric toothbrush do that much better?    Yes.  Amazingly better in a much shorter amount of time.  After using the Oral B my teeth feel much cleaner afterward - very smooth like after you visit the dentist.  For those who are less careful about brushing I would imagine the difference would be even more dramatic.      I haven&#x27;t used any other electric toothbrush so can&#x27;t compare this to anything else but I am very happy with it.  It was much louder than expected when I first began using it but I am use to that now (definitely need to have the bathroom door closed if your spouse is sleeping).</li>
            <li> This is advertised as a &#x27;deluxe&#x27; (DLX) version of this model with extra attachments.  I did not receive the DLX version after TWO attempts.  I have a feeling they don&#x27;t actually have it in the warehouse.</li>
            <li> Seems well made, nice timing features and my wife says her mouth feels &#x27;fresher&#x27; after using this product instead of a regular toothbrush.  This came recommended by our dentist.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is very powerful and my wife and I both use it (with different brushes). Prior to this we had an older less expensive Braun and I had a cheap version of Oral B. This is so much better.</li>
            <li> I have been very lucky with Amazon and prices. This was delivered quickly, $25 less costly than anywhere else, and the OralB performs much better than the lower end models.</li>
            <li> It took me a long time to pick an electric toothbrush.  All the reviews on amazon.com were very helpful.  I bought this version and I have no regrets.  This electric toobrush works really well and comes with 4 brush heads.  My teeth feel nice and clean; the same feeling I have when I leave the dentist after a cleaning.  Make sure you read the directions so you know all the features that this toothbrush has.</li>
            <li> battery life is great, seems quite durable and well built.  The variety of brushes was nice to try and pick which one works best for me.</li>
            <li> I bought Oral-B 3000 for my mother and she likes it.  Generally, she does not like gadgets and new technology, but this toothbrush is easy to operate.  I recommended that she does not charge it after every brushing but rather only when the low battery indicator turns on, and she&#x27;s been following this suggestion.  She tried one of the included small brush heads, but she really prefers the larger double action brush head.  I was especially pleased when she told me that she noticed her teeth getting whiter and her mouth feeling fresher.  That&#x27;s all I need to recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is the best electric we have owned. The duel head is amazing. I would purchase it again in a nano-second.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush after a recommendation by a friend.  I&#x27;ve been using for three months now and I can see the difference in my teeth.  My teeth are whiter, brighter, and feel cleaner after using this brush.  My dentist even commented last week when I had my semi-annual visit.  This brush will reduce the time you spend in the dentist&#x27;s chair, believe me.    I have only used the standard brush head, but it comes with four and there are many others available.     I bought this brush as a lightning deal on Amazon for $60.  A great brush at a great value!</li>
            <li> I bought mine first.  I was so impressed with it that I bought my daughter one for Christmas.  Then I bought my friend one for her birthday.  It seems most people think it extravagant to purchase an expensive toothbrush, but it is so worth it.  Both my daughter and my friend love it as much as I do.  It&#x27;s one of my \\&quot;favorite things.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This is by far the best toothbrush i&#x27;ve ever owned.  It works wonderfully, leaving your teeth feeling squeeky clean and fresh.  It comes with various tips to use, which can be stored in the charging device.  Definitely a must have!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely, one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made.</li>
            <li> i ordered the best.  this one not as good as the previous tooth brush</li>
            <li> We never considered an electric toothbrush, thinking it would be just another unnecessary gadget cluttering up the house.  Then my oral hygienist casually mentioned that her patients with the healthiest gums all seemed to use the Braun toothbrush, and interestingly, \\&quot;not Sonicare.\\&quot;  My gums had been receding at an alarming rate, and the exposed tooth roots were being grooved by aggressive brushing.  Yikes.  Well, the Braun has been a revelation; the plaque is pretty much gone, and the \\&quot;fuzz,\\&quot; especially on the sides of the molars, is gone too.  So the functioning is 100%.  As for the product design, I was afraid the stand wouldn&#x27;t fit on the narrow ledge of my ceramic sink. Not a problem here; it&#x27;s skinny, has a non-skid rubber base, and is superbly weighted - it is not tippy at all. The bonus is the blue LED light, which doubles as a night light by the sink.  Like most things German and Braun, this thing is thoughtfully designed (e.g., a little rubber stopper prevents the unit from rolling around, should you lay it down on a flat surface) and of top quality, not junky at all like those other units imported from elsewhere.  Worth every penny.  Note: this package comes with a bunch of other gizmos, most of which qualify as \\&quot;clutter\\&quot;; we would just get the basic unit if we had to do it over again.</li>
            <li> I used some previous Oral-b electric toothbrushes in the past, and I was always very satisfied with them. The new toothbrush seamed to be a perfect choice, especially for the new features I didn&#x27;t have before: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1. 3D Excel Brushing Action with 40,000 pulsations and 8,800 oscillations:  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My expectation: Much more power and a different 3D brushing should improve cleaning. &lt;br /&gt;My conclusion: Didn&#x27;t note any difference comparing to the previous ones. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2.  Speed Control: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My expectation:  Good to clean the tongue and gingival at lower speed. &lt;br /&gt;My conclusion: The control is too bad. You have to press a unique button for a long time to reach the lower velocity, and if you stop the power, for example, to move the brush from one side to another (up to down), and want to resume it again at the lower velocity, you must press the button again until you reach the lower velocity. It sucks. After an initial period I ended using always the standard velocity. Oral-b, you should put another switch where you can select the proper velocity in which the power will work: low, medium or high. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;3. Pressure Sensor: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My expectation: Great! I always put too much force to clean my teeth. &lt;br /&gt;My conclusion: Didn&#x27;t note any difference, even when I tested it, didn&#x27;t note that pulsations stop when you brush too hard. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;4. A 2-minute-total and 30-second-for-each-side Timer: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My expectation: Good to control if you clean more time or less time than appropriate. &lt;br /&gt;My conclusion:  not much useful. Many times you should stop the power, and in this case, the timer (it is not a sound, but a vibration instead) goes to zero. Other times you should keep cleaning one side for more than 30 seconds, but when you move to the other side, you lose the control of how much time you should stay in the new side. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;5. FlexiSoft brushhead: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My expectation: To be the same as previous ones. &lt;br /&gt;My conclusion: They are the same as previous ones. Very goods.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;6. PowerPolisher brushhead: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sorry. I cannot use it, until I finish my orthodontic treatment. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;7. DualAction brushhead: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My expectation: To clean better. &lt;br /&gt;My conclusion:  Not useful. The FlexiSoft are better ones. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;8. Tongue Freshener: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My expectation: To clean my tongue better. Maybe it has some mint or freshener liquid or something. &lt;br /&gt;My conclusion: No better, not worst, than a regular tongue cleaner.  No mint, no freshener liquid, no nothing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;9. Interdental Cleaner: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My expectation: a good rapid substitute for flossing. &lt;br /&gt;My conclusion: KIDDING! Useless. No substitute for flossing AT ALL! A waste of money! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As a final conclusion, the power tooth bush continuous to be good, but the extra accessories and functions are not much useful. As written in the title, I recommend you buy the Oral-b 7850 DLX instead. It is cheaper, and you would not need the extra brushheads (you can buy the PowerPolisher brushhead separately).   &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I have been using a Sonicare Elite 7500 for 2 years and have had the Oral-B 8850 for about 4 months. Here&#x27;s a point-by-point comparison. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cleaning: Too close to call. Both do an excellent job. If you still use a manual brush, you&#x27;ll be amazed when you first try one of these. Completely different level of clean. The Oral-B has a slight advantage, because the head is a bit wider, and you can cover each tooth without moving it around. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Durability: Strong edge to Oral-B. The Sonicare has battery problems (ours died after 18 months). Sonicare replaced it, but only because we were within the 2-year warranty. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Maintenance: Strong edge to Oral-B. The Sonicare needs to be cleaned regularly, because gunk builds up where the head attaches to the body. Cleaning is not easy, because the gunk gets in hard-to-reach places, and you need a cue-tip to get it out. The Oral-B just requires a quick rinse. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Multi-person use: Edge to Oral-B. If two or more people use the brush, then you will need to switch out the heads. This is easy to do for the Oral-B, as the heads slide on and off with little effort. The Sonicare heads need to be screwed on, which takes a little more time. Also, the Oral-B heads come with nice color-coded rings so you can keep them straight. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Price: The Oral-B is cheaper. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Replacement heads: Oral-B replacement heads are cheaper. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Accessories: The Sonicare doesn&amp;#8217;t come with any accessories. The Oral-B comes with a bunch of accessories (flosser, tongue cleaner), but they are useless.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Other stuff. The Oral-B is noisier (sounds like a Dentist&amp;#8217;s cleaner) but not obnoxiously so. The &amp;#8220;charging&amp;#8221; light is annoyingly bright on the Oral-B (so much so that you&amp;#8217;ll need to close the door from the bedroom to bathroom if you want to sleep).  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: go with the Oral-B. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> My stains were so bad my dentist told me he&#x27;d have to charge me double next time.  He was quite serious.  Literally, I couldn&#x27;t go three weeks after a dentist appointment without having to scrape my teeth myself, which is a very bad thing to do.  I&#x27;ve had this Oral B for three months now, and NO scraping!  I am truly, truly impressed.</li>
            <li> I JUST DON&#x27;T USE THIS AS I PURCHASED A ELECTRIC ORAL B TOOTH BRUSH</li>
            <li> I was puzzled by all the complaints about the short life of the Oral-B 800 Series toothbrushes because my five-year-old Oral-B was still going strong. I ordered a new 8850 DLX anyway, because the gasket between the body and replaceable head that prevents liquid from leaking into the interior of the body had finally deteriorated and I figured that it was just a matter of time till the moisture caused the motor and electronics to fail. When the 8850 DLX  arrived, the reason for the short life span was obvious. The head and body design was the same as my old one, but the gasket has been eliminated!! I guess it makes sense from a business standpoint as they have probably doubled their business by decreasing the replacement time from 5 years to 2 years.   From a performance standpoint, it is still a great toothbrush and I would not use anything else. It&#x27;s a must have for anyone with sensitive gums who is using Sensodine toothpaste to mask the pain. It completely eliminated the sensitivity of my gums and has changed my dentist&#x27;s assessment from \\&quot;disaster area\\&quot; to \\&quot;wish mine were that healthy\\&quot;. I find that it works a lot better with gel toothpaste than regular.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific system.  I have an earlier model and it blows it away.  You will feel like you just came from a professional cleaning (without someone digging around your mouth).  I would highly recommend this to anyone that wants to maintain a high level of cleaning of their teeth without pain  or waste of time.</li>
            <li> I bought this professional care deluxe toothbrush because it was considered one of the higher end Oral B toothbrushes and it came with many attachments.  What I didn&#x27;t expect was that the unit did not hold up well at all.  After 1 year the metal piece where you attach the cleaning heads became stuck and stopped working. When I called the customer service representative I was told that my unit could not be serviced because the problem resided in the base unit which they said could not be opened and fixed. Therefore even though I was in the warranty period they would not be able to service my unit nor give me a new one to replace the one I had. They absolutely refused to honor the two year warranty that comes with all their toothbrushes. The only thing they offered was a coupon for $10 off a new toothbrush. I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s misleading and I would never have bought the unit with that kind warranty.  As far as how the unit operated during the year I had it I found the toothbrush only worked well with the dual-action brushhead (very hard to find replacements), and all the other accessories are a waste of time and money.  The tongue cleaner does nothing and the smaller head I found did not hold enough toothpaste to clean the entire mouth very well.  I also found the charging very slow and the flashing blue light would be very annoying. Also the base and toothbrush would get very dirty if you did not clean it regularly.  My final comment is I will never buy another Oral B toothbrush again based on how it cleaned my teeth and the poor customer service when it stopped working under warranty.  I&#x27;m back to spending another $80 on another brand which I&#x27;ll review after I&#x27;ve tried it for some time.</li>
            <li> I have been using Oral B electric toothbrushes for about 15 or 20 years and am totally sold on them.  However, this one has not been one of my favorites.  The battery has never been very good at holding a charge for more than one or two days so it was not possible to take along on a trip without taking the charger.  Additionally, the battery has now just died and I only bought this toothbrush 3 years ago in November.</li>
            <li> I like this toothbrush for various reasons.  It does a great job, has different options to customize it to your needs, easy to grip, &amp; it does a good job.  I&#x27;ve always had an Oral-B toothbrush in the past but for the price of this one it does a great job.  Very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush does a great job at a great price!  Highly recommend</li>
            <li> ... and I&#x27;m still using it.  When I bought it here on amazon, like others I didn&#x27;t get the right item, and it didn&#x27;t come with the tongue freshener and the interdental cleaner.  I complained to amazon, who then told me to take my complaint to the manufacturer.  well, I did and they gave me 3 different complimentary brush heads.  They also told me that they don&#x27;t carry the tongue freshener anymore.  Oh well, I have a regular tongue cleaner anyway.  The 2 minute timer is pretty nice even though I don&#x27;t pay attention to it at all.  The pressure censor doesn&#x27;t seem to work because no matter how hard I press, nothing happens.  The battery life is great, still works like I just bought it... I only have to charge it once every 2-3 weeks.  Overall, I&#x27;m still very happy for purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for about 6 weeks, and haven&#x27;t had a dental checkup in the meantime, so it&#x27;s a bit hard to know how well it&#x27;s really been working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But here are a few observations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It feels cheap.  Maybe it&#x27;s just that I&#x27;m used to the solid heft of my trusty Sonicare toothbrush, but this Oral-B toothbrush feels like something you&#x27;d get at Safeway for $49.95, not $99.95.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The polishing brush does seem to do a pretty thorough job.  The main brush (whatever it&#x27;s called) also seems rather decent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The tongue cleaner is worse than useless.  A cheapie Walgreens manual tongue scraper does a much better job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- So, too, does the interdental-stimulator / toothpick thingy seem pretty useless.  Manual flossing is just as fast and seems much more thorough.  And dental floss is about half a penny per &#x27;serving&#x27;, whereas the replacement Oral-B things are much more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The base is so top-heavy, I&#x27;ve accidentally knocked it over twice, hurling the toothbrush to the floor (ouch!).  Thankfully, the toothbrush still seems to work fine, but as you can guess, I finally wised up and screwed the base to the wall.  I never had such a problem with the Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- No carrying case?  Not even any friggin&#x27; cap for the toothbrush?  This basically makes it a total pain to cleanly transport this brush to work or on a trip or anywhere else.  ALL the Sonicares (and their replacement brushheads) come with a simple, effective plastic cover.  What was Oral-B thinking?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fairness, this toothbrush probably merits a 3.5, and if I get a great bill-of-health from my dentist at my next checkup, I&#x27;ll revise this review to a 4.  But in the meantime, I&#x27;m certainly disappointed that Oral-B has given a bargain-bin treatment to a premium-priced product.</li>
            <li> Oral B electric toothbrushes are the best according to my research with the internet,as well as the opinions of my dentist and periodontist(also accepted is the fact electric brushes clean the best).I prefer the more expensive Triumph models because of the extra features,but the company representative says this model cleans as well as the Triumph models.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t live without my electric toothbrush.</li>
