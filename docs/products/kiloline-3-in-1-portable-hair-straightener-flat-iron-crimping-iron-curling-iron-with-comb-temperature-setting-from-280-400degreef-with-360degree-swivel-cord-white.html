            <li>All in all this 3 in 1 styler tool is the best deal out there.  </li>
            <li>using the best (Goldwell) products I have found to this point.</li>
            <li>Not so happy, it works great as a straightener yet</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it works good.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Also, the crimping function as an additional feature is so nice.</li>
            <li>Very useful and great hair styling iron.</li>
            <li>I did not like this tool, but I have very fine hair, so that may make a difference.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that you can select the temperature you want</li>
            <li>Will sure try some hair do on my daughter hair too :-)</li>
            <li>I love this 3-in-1 hair straightener.</li>
            <li>The curls were mostly at the bottom of her hair giving it a bouncy look.  </li>
            <li>The crimper and straightener work way better than I thought they would.</li>
            <li>So, all you short haired lovelies, this is a wonderful iron to add to your routine...</li>
            <li>My hair is now looking soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li>I was pulling the curling iron from my hair and if I continue using this it would definitely ruin my beautiful hair.</li>
            <li>It is an amazing product having all features in a single machine.too good..</li>
            <li>The dual voltages and portable size is great for international travel.  </li>
            <li>the laugh I had about it made the purchase worthwhile.</li>
            <li>Despite this tiny problem, the product has a great performance as a hair straightener.</li>
            <li>and I give it a light finishing spray (MorraccanOil)...</li>
            <li>Overall, really nice product with an affordable price!</li>
            <li>Delivery is quick.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and I can chose the temperature setting.  </li>
            <li>Hair is smooth and full and ready to be sprayed...</li>
            <li>Not at all worth it.</li>
            <li>cause I don&#x27;t like super hot iron which will damage my hair.  </li>
            <li>This works great on my fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li>For my daughter she liked the crimping iron it made small tight crimping lines, she liked this fun cute style.</li>
            <li>Not easy to manage, good quality though.</li>
            <li>Too light did not get hot enough to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li>It save me so much time to make my hair.</li>
            <li>I bought this product just a week ago, and I really like it.</li>
            <li>The straighter works really well.</li>
            <li>The curler, not so much...</li>
            <li>When I stand back up, I look like I&#x27;ve stuck my finger in a light socket...</li>
            <li>As for the straightener, it didn&#x27;t do much for my hair either.</li>
            <li>The only way to remove it from your hair is to unwind it, or reverse from the way you originally rolled the hair.</li>
            <li>It arrived on date promised and would highly recommend both the company and the product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since all the other reviews were from women with long, lovely locks, I decided a hair-impoverished woman should review it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Nirvana!&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;Taco&amp;#34; setting (crimper) didn&#x27;t really show crimps in my hair, but it gave it just enough of a texture to help with the fullness.</li>
            <li>Only problem is that its plastic parts get really hot, if you don&#x27;t use it highly careful, you can hurt yourself.</li>
            <li>Only complaint is that it is easy to hit the temperature control button when curling and turning the iron.</li>
            <li>where I cannot retrieve my hair from a tangled mess around a hot iron.</li>
            <li>I have thin and fine hair and always want to find some tool to give them some volumn.  </li>
            <li>have short, fine, thin hair that doesn&#x27;t like to keep it&#x27;s volume...</li>

            <li> I have thin and fine hair and always want to find some tool to give them some volumn.  This one fulfill my goal.  Love the fact that you can select the temperature you want cause I don&#x27;t like super hot iron which will damage my hair.  The dual voltages and portable size is great for international travel.  Will sure try some hair do on my daughter hair too :-)</li>
            <li> The only thing this does is turn on and heat up. The clip used to hold part of it up is useless when trying to flat iron. And the crimping iron doesn&#x27;t work either. i don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s my hair texture or the item, but all it does is frustrate me and take up space in my draw.</li>
            <li> One of the buttons to control a function is named, &amp;#34;taco&amp;#34;. I almost lost it when I saw this and the laugh I had about it made the purchase worthwhile.</li>
            <li> Terrible product.  Doesn&#x27;t deliver what was promised.</li>
            <li> Functioned as required.</li>
            <li> The bristles around the barrel tangled my hair while I was using the curling iron. It was impossible to achieve smooth curls with this tool by just following the instructions included in the package. It made some sort of curls and it was so frizzy. I was pulling the curling iron from my hair and if I continue using this it would definitely ruin my beautiful hair.</li>
            <li> Not so happy, it works great as a straightener yet it is a hassle to work with curler. Not easy to manage, good quality though.</li>
            <li> Not at all worth it. No grip for the hair to hold.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t grab hair like I thought it would, I now only use it if I really need to, I find it hard to use without burning a finger to hold my hair around it... its not my all go to iron.....</li>
            <li> Very useful and great hair styling iron.</li>
            <li> This product does not perform as I had hoped.  I have very thick hair which may have been the problem. It might work on thin hair.</li>
            <li> I love this 3-in-1 hair straightener. It save me so much time to make my hair. Delivery is quick.</li>
            <li> It is an amazing product having all features in a single machine.too good..</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that it is easy to hit the temperature control button when curling and turning the iron. Otherwise it works good.</li>
            <li> I bought this product just a week ago, and I really like it. The straighter works really well. Only problem is that its plastic parts get really hot, if you don&#x27;t use it highly careful, you can hurt yourself. Despite this tiny problem, the product has a great performance as a hair straightener. Also, the crimping function as an additional feature is so nice. It requires a bit strength to make your hair crimped. Overall, really nice product with an affordable price!</li>
            <li> I did not like this tool, but I have very fine hair, so that may make a difference.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It heats up quickly and I can chose the temperature setting.  For me I needed my hair straightened. I pulled it through my thick wavy hair with one pass. My hair is now looking soft and beautiful. For my daughter she liked the crimping iron it made small tight crimping lines, she liked this fun cute style. She also likes to curl her hair. The curls were mostly at the bottom of her hair giving it a bouncy look.  All in all this 3 in 1 styler tool is the best deal out there.  It’s the lowest price and has everything that my family needs.</li>
            <li> The crimper and straightener work way better than I thought they would. The curler, not so much... the black spikey things (whatever they&#x27;re called 😂) make it impossible to curl my hair. My hair gets stuck and frizzes up because of them. It&#x27;s impossible to wrap my hair around it and unwrap it. 2 out of 3 of the functions work well.👍</li>
            <li> Too light did not get hot enough to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> This works great on my fine, thin hair. It arrived on date promised and would highly recommend both the company and the product.</li>
            <li> Well, I asked, and received no reply about how well this iron worked on short hair. Since I didn&#x27;t hear, I decided to buy the iron myself.&lt;br /&gt;Since all the other reviews were from women with long, lovely locks, I decided a hair-impoverished woman should review it.&lt;br /&gt;I have short, fine, thin hair that doesn&#x27;t like to keep it&#x27;s volume...I am at gravity war with my mop of blonde, turning silver/grey coiffure.&lt;br /&gt;I blow dry my hair with my head hanging upside down...using the best (Goldwell) products I have found to this point. I mousse and gel to try to gain some lift and fullness. The Kiloline has been a blessing to my regimen. The tines are textured just enough that my hair doesn&#x27;t just slip through and not receive a curl...as well it is not TOO textured where I cannot retrieve my hair from a tangled mess around a hot iron. Nirvana!&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;Taco&amp;#34; setting (crimper) didn&#x27;t really show crimps in my hair, but it gave it just enough of a texture to help with the fullness. What I love is I can use the straightener as well as the crimper and then curl around into the tines and there is never a weird, unruly single crimp that looks like a cat&#x27;s tail that haphazardly got slammed in a door! Hair is smooth and full and ready to be sprayed...yes, I still have to use spray to try to keep my locks locked in! I, again, hang my head upside down and spray it on the underside. When I stand back up, I look like I&#x27;ve stuck my finger in a light socket...but that soon relaxes (and I use a brush if it decides to stay up there!) and I give it a light finishing spray (MorraccanOil)...So, all you short haired lovelies, this is a wonderful iron to add to your routine...in fact, you can throw out the two or three other appliances you&#x27;ve been using and keep this one...you won&#x27;t be sorry. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Theoretically, this is a neat little styling tool. However, I caution you against using the curling brush feature if your hair is: 1) layered 2) thick 3) coarse My hair is all three of these things, so my attempts to curl it were not very successful. The brush got caught in my hair, with my different layered lengths it was difficult to position the hair correctly in the clip, because you can&#x27;t release the tension on the clip at all while your hair is wrapped around it. The only way to remove it from your hair is to unwind it, or reverse from the way you originally rolled the hair. You cannot press the clip and loosen the hair (which is what I usually do with a regular curling iron). It may work beautifully on thin or fine hair types, but it was not good for me. As for the straightener, it didn&#x27;t do much for my hair either. Probably because my hair is so thick, and it would have taken entirely too long. I&#x27;ll hang onto it and use the crimper for the occasional &amp;#34;80s&amp;#34; event.</li>
