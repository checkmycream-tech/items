            <li>It is not thick like how most lotions are.</li>
            <li>Fast and easy</li>
            <li>makes skin very soft and she loves it also i love the way she smells with this lotion and feels</li>
            <li>A fresh scent.</li>
            <li>Oh I just love this light blue by Dolce Gabana.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good compared with its price, the fragance does not last enough on you though it was not a bad deal.</li>
            <li>The jury is still out on this as i&#x27;m just trying this suggestion today for the first time.  </li>
            <li>Such a great fragrance coming out of the heavy winter.  </li>
            <li>So no matter how much you put on its not to aggressive.</li>
            <li>thanks so much dolce and gab  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So i apply the Light Blue lotion and then spritz the Light Blue fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I wish it was available in a larger size.</li>
            <li>The smell is long lasting and stays with you all day so elegant !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m enjoying the fragrance and so other people</li>
            <li>The only reason i bought this is because the Light Blue EDT i have doesn&#x27;t hold a scent on my body for more than ten minutes.</li>
            <li>The scent does not stay with you for long and the cream is so light it does not do anything for your skin.</li>
            <li>It goes on the skin so smooth and lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>It is classic, modern, soft and always get compliments when worn.  </li>
            <li>Secondly, if you leave the tube standing the amount of lotion in the tube hits right below the word Dolce &amp; Gabbana.  </li>
            <li>23$ dollars is not a small money for a 3.3 oz lotion.</li>
            <li>wow what are you wearing........</li>
            <li>I thought the tube was going to be larger as much as I paid  </li>
            <li>So far it is working well for my wife.  </li>
            <li>When layered it really lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>First, the tube is much smaller than what I had expected for a 3.3Fl oz.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I think this is not original.</li>
            <li> it moisterizes and saves the trouble of having perfume that may break.</li>
            <li> I have finally found the scent I will never get tired of.  </li>
            <li> My wife just loves this stuff and the smell is not strong at all compared to perfume sprays.</li>
            <li> , I thought the lotion would last like the perfume, but I am very disappointed in this purchase.</li>
            <li> Few things which I am very disappointed.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I have had this perfume and now the body lotion for several days. Not once have I had them on together when I did not receive a compliment on how I smell. I had one young man chase me down in a store to ask what I was wearing, so he could buy some for his girlfriend. Fantastic.</li>
            <li> good scent like the blue one! really love this scent very cool! i wear this all the time ♥ ♥</li>

            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!! THe smell of this is so nice. The scent stays with you through out the day.</li>
            <li> I love the sent.  I&#x27;ve been wearing it for a quite a long time.  Reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My order arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> I love this scent, but it fades quickly.  I would buy it again, and probably will.  Best smelling fragrance around now.</li>
            <li> makes skin very soft and she loves it also i love the way she smells with this lotion and feels</li>
            <li> I received this with in two days of purchase. This is my favorite scent but I had not tried the lotion before, but I love it now. It&#x27;s light and airy and does not have the sticky effect like most perfume lotions, I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Price was phenomenal &amp; service, impeccable!</li>
            <li> Few things which I am very disappointed.  First, the tube is much smaller than what I had expected for a 3.3Fl oz.  Secondly, if you leave the tube standing the amount of lotion in the tube hits right below the word Dolce &amp; Gabbana.  Third is what disappointed me the most, the lotion is very watery.  The scent does not last.  Dolce and Gabbana is my favorite scent and I love it so much, I thought the lotion would last like the perfume, but I am very disappointed in this purchase. Definitely would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Oh I just love this light blue by Dolce Gabana.  I wish i could order once a month that is how much I love this product.  If there is ever a combination set please advertise.  LOL</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this on me. :)</li>
            <li> Sometimes I get fooled when I order on line: the product looks like something that it isn&#x27;t...but this was the real deal at a great price!</li>
            <li> The only reason i bought this is because the Light Blue EDT i have doesn&#x27;t hold a scent on my body for more than ten minutes. No lie! I was told that layering might be my solution.  So i apply the Light Blue lotion and then spritz the Light Blue fragrance.  The jury is still out on this as i&#x27;m just trying this suggestion today for the first time.  But the lotion has a oily, sticky texture to it, which i&#x27;m not that crazy about. So i only gave it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> I loved the light fragrance in cream form to layer with the fragrance.  I would have liked a&lt;br /&gt;thicker cream, but since it was supposed to be &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; and refreshing it works fine! s Definitely would recommend it for summer.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent! When layered it really lasts a long time. I wish it was available in a larger size. So I don&#x27;t need to keep ordering it.</li>
            <li> Good product.  So far it is working well for my wife.  We both like the scent.  We ca recommend it.</li>
            <li> Pretty good compared with its price, the fragance does not last enough on you though it was not a bad deal. I think iwould try another fragance. I think this is not original.</li>
            <li> Bought it to gift someone and had good words about this product.</li>
            <li> Package arrived on time. The problem is its almost half emptied...its not new. I am very disappointed.  I want refund. 23$ dollars is not a small money for a 3.3 oz lotion.</li>
            <li> I love this body cream! It is not thick like how most lotions are. And it smells great. But the scent does not last too long</li>
            <li> Nice, soft fragrance.  Purchased 2 - one as a Christmas gift.</li>
