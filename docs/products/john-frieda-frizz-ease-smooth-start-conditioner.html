            <li>and it smells so good.  </li>

            <li>I am extraordinarily pleased with these products - love, love, love them !!!</li>
            <li>and this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair nice and squeaky.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair hydrated and glossy and has a nice, but not overpowering scent.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair fall more evenly and certainly flatter (which is a great thing in humid Florida!).</li>
            <li>I have tried many kinds of conditioner and this is BY FAR the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>My hairdresser says it&#x27;s making my hair softer and in better condition.</li>
            <li>Ordered again as part of the regimen :)</li>
            <li>/&gt; love the smell and was able to let my step daughter have these</li>
            <li>and she love them ..</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my hair feel all day</li>
            <li>This is definitely one of the best repairing conditioners out there if you have destroyed your hair like I have.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li>you get more of the product out</li>
            <li>Many conditioners don&#x27;t rinse clean, but this one does.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, my daughter loves it and does not even want to try other brands!</li>
            <li>This head of locks has been through a lot this year and when you feel like you&#x27;ve got fine cashmere on your head</li>
            <li>So, it took about a week of that for my hair to smooth itself out and stay in place.  </li>
            <li>Ease Smooth Start Shampoo, does wonders for my hair.</li>
            <li>You will not believe how smooth it makes your hair the moment you rinse it out.</li>
            <li>When I bought the product the heading said smooth start...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m all in love with John Frieda right now because my hair is freaking awesome for the first time in a long time.  </li>
            <li>i think the product is great for all hair types for not only is it good for regular hair but also for colored treated and damages.</li>
            <li>Once dry, maintains softness and smells great.</li>
            <li>This one helps my hair to stay healthy and straight.</li>
            <li>so I would recommend it for more straight hair</li>
            <li>Manages the Frizz and gives you a nice soft shine.  </li>
            <li>I was very upset to learn that my favorite conditioner &amp;#34;Smooth Start&amp;#34; by FrizzEase was being discontinued as I no longer saw it on the store shelves.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft and pretty and smells so good</li>
            <li>Together with the Smooth Start shampoo and hair serum, I&#x27;ve finally found the perfect combo of products for my fine, dry, and damaged hair!!</li>
            <li>I recently rediscovered this stuff and it goes a really nice job of keeping my hair smooth.</li>
            <li>she has smooth pretty hair</li>
            <li>It leaves my very frizzy, very fine, color treated hair smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Her hair gets very tangled and this conditioner takes them right out and makes her hair so easy to comb through.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t receive smooth start conditioner but flawlessly Straight.</li>
            <li>i love this product because it made my hair so soft and not frizzy at all .its</li>
            <li>I love it, as my hair is maturing, as is the rest of me, and it is becoming very dry.  </li>
            <li>so i was given a refund(( lov u Amazon) and turned around and ordered the right one for curls&lt;br</li>
            <li>I only wished it smelled better, but it&#x27;s not bad.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very please and will be back for more!</li>
            <li>I have straight, fine hair and this product eases the frizzy strands and has a very &#x27;weightless&#x27; quality after blow drying or even just towel drying.</li>
            <li>Pretty sure I ordered smooth start conditioner and not flawlessly straight.</li>
            <li>This really did seem to help my hair become straight and smooth without the need to straight iron it.  </li>
            <li>I could not believe how smooth and soft my hair felt out of the shower with this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different brands</li>
            <li>It is straight, now!</li>
            <li>best conditioner I have ever had, seriously my hair is extremely frizzy and curly and this conditioner really makes it much more manageable.</li>
            <li>Great regular conditioner to protect slightly dry and wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I think this product is a little bit more greasy than the smooth start</li>
            <li>Directions said for intense conditioning leave in for 5 minutes, I did and instantly felt a drastic change in smoothness. :)</li>
            <li>Works great on wet hair, dry hair etc.  </li>
            <li>I suspect it adds a little weight to it, but its working nicely for me.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really frustrating!&lt;br /&gt;Since</li>
            <li>have never felt such Silky smooth cushions on my buttocks in all my life</li>
            <li>I use this and the shampoo daily and it keeps my hair from looking like a stuck a finger in a light bulb.</li>
            <li>you should really buy it</li>
            <li>I used the whole bottle and saw no improvements.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, mostly straight and very frizzy, occasionally slightly wavy and very frizzy hair that normally fights me when I try to style it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as good as the super expensive ones, but at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I love how with a tiny amount I can cover my long hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually dried up my hair and made it more unmanageable.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite conditioner of all time, and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few.</li>
            <li>new couch.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can tell a real difference between when you use a regular (not the dream curls - which also creates and hold curls really well) and this straightening conditioner.</li>
            <li>So far I feel like John Frieda is the finest possible thing I can do for my hair right now.  </li>
            <li>It did untangle pretty well, but I didn&#x27;t like the extra weight.</li>
            <li>But again, I&#x27;m the complete opposite side of the spectrum, very very oily hair</li>
            <li>, I now need no leave in products, and when I blow dry style it, my hair comes out straight where I want it straight and waves where I want it to wave.</li>
            <li>I use very little of it, I have extremely oily hair, so I use much more shampoo and let that soak up all of the oil, but I literally only need about a thumb-nail&#x27;s size drop, maybe a tiny bit more, of the Frizz-ease for all of my hair because it works so well and still makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li>Weighed my fine, long hair down waaaaaaay too much and felt greasy.</li>
            <li>and even I love this product, I just use very little of it, and it still takes away the frizz and makes my hair super soft, and because I use so little</li>
            <li>Helps with making my hair soft</li>
            <li>Makes it much easier to air-dry my hair, but still get almost the same result as blow-drying!</li>
            <li>My 7 year old daughter loves it too.</li>
            <li>I am going to continue to buy this just to have soft and tamed hair.</li>
            <li>i have that dreaded natural curls</li>
            <li>and it makes my hair feel supper soft.</li>
            <li>I actually use as a leave-in conditioner to tame my very curly hair and leave my curls intact and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have long hair; about 3 inches past my shoulders and its very fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 34 and this year my normally straight long hair has changed!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s frizz land over here</li>
            <li>I use a leave-in conditioner roughly once a week also, but when combined with this product the fly-aways aren&#x27;t as obvious and overall my hair is smooth as advertised.</li>
            <li>I am usually a pantene girl, but I decided to get this just to make up my purchase for free shipping.</li>
            <li>Wow, after trying this conditioner I will not  go back to panten.</li>
            <li>like  my  beautician has done my hair ,,,no fly always , my hair is soft and smooth yet still holds the curl and volume</li>
            <li>Just have to say the first time I put it on my hair (about a week and half ago), I instantly saw and felt results.</li>
            <li>It started because I had some very serious breakage issues happening to my hair and the back was becoming increasingly frizzy.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think anyone would&#x27;t love this product, and everyone should at least try it, especially with how cheap it is, if you don&#x27;t like it for some crazy reason</li>

            <li> I&#x27;d previously used countless leave-in products and spent a ridiculous amount of time trying to get my hair to stay straight where I wanted it straight and wave where I wanted it to wave, only to have a so-so outcome.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and without this I can not barely brush them through.</li>
            <li> An additional trick I learned is to brush my hair straight after I wash it (while still wet) then blow dry on a low heat setting and brush straight down while I blow it dry (instead of lifting it up with a round brush - a really slow and tiring method).  </li>

            <li> It does cut down on my frizz but not 100%.</li>
            <li> I bought this Shampoo and Conditioner at Target since it was slightly cheaper.</li>
            <li> It works...even on my thick blonde hair, to make it less wavy!</li>
            <li> Now its just shampoo, conditioner, a little bit of styling gel</li>
            <li> I would totally recommend this product to anyone to try at least once!</li>
            <li> Just a very, very small amount goes a long way.  </li>

            <li> This may be great for thicker hair, but I had to throw away. Weighed my fine, long hair down waaaaaaay too much and felt greasy.</li>
            <li> This one helps my hair to stay healthy and straight. I have very long hair and without this I can not barely brush them through.</li>
            <li> Helps with making my hair soft</li>
            <li> best conditioner I have ever had, seriously my hair is extremely frizzy and curly and this conditioner really makes it much more manageable.</li>
            <li> Directions said for intense conditioning leave in for 5 minutes, I did and instantly felt a drastic change in smoothness. :)</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.  It&#x27;s my guilty addiction and it smells so good.  It started because I had some very serious breakage issues happening to my hair and the back was becoming increasingly frizzy.  So I started using the John Frieda Frizz Ease Conditioner and leaving it in my hair for 3 minutes after shampooing.  So, it took about a week of that for my hair to smooth itself out and stay in place.  It&#x27;s so soft and pretty and smells so good I hate to put it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So with the conditioner working so well I went to the shampoo and conditioner combo.  I&#x27;m all in love with John Frieda right now because my hair is freaking awesome for the first time in a long time.  This head of locks has been through a lot this year and when you feel like you&#x27;ve got fine cashmere on your head you wash it with the finest possible shampoo you can get.  So far I feel like John Frieda is the finest possible thing I can do for my hair right now.  I lost a lot of hair due to neurology medications and an accident.  Now that I&#x27;ve lost it and my hair is growing back in I want to keep the hair I have looking the finest it can.</li>
            <li> I am still using this product.  However, I do switch on and off between other products.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner.  Will make your hair feel like silk after and shampoo.</li>
            <li> Keeps the curl down and controlled, easier to straighten. My hairdresser says it&#x27;s making my hair softer and in better condition. I also use the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have kinky thick Asian hair that comes out stick straight from the roots then turns slightly wavy in some parts, thick and kinky and nest-like in others.  This really did seem to help my hair become straight and smooth without the need to straight iron it.  An additional trick I learned is to brush my hair straight after I wash it (while still wet) then blow dry on a low heat setting and brush straight down while I blow it dry (instead of lifting it up with a round brush - a really slow and tiring method).  I only wished it smelled better, but it&#x27;s not bad.  Just not a really pleasing smell that makes me want to sniff it.</li>
            <li> Definitely felt a difference in my hair after using this conditioner. My hair felt smoother and softer. I use this conditioner when I use a lot of products in my hair.</li>
            <li> I have long straight thin hair. I recently rediscovered this stuff and it goes a really nice job of keeping my hair smooth. I suspect it adds a little weight to it, but its working nicely for me.</li>
            <li> i think the product is great for all hair types for not only is it good for regular hair but also for colored treated and damages.</li>
            <li> Great product for curly and wavy hair.  I actually use as a leave-in conditioner to tame my very curly hair and leave my curls intact and smooth.</li>
            <li> Would defiantly recommend using this conditioner if you need to get some frizz under control- this plus the John Frieda Frizz Ease Smooth Start Shampoo, does wonders for my hair.</li>
            <li> I buy both this straightening conditioner and the &amp;#34;dream curls&amp;#34; by Frizz Ease because they both actually work quite well! You can tell a real difference between when you use a regular (not the dream curls - which also creates and hold curls really well) and this straightening conditioner. It makes my hair fall more evenly and certainly flatter (which is a great thing in humid Florida!). Makes it much easier to air-dry my hair, but still get almost the same result as blow-drying! Ordered again as part of the regimen :)</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair and this stuff is amazing. I will reorder this! I would recommend this product. It is a great buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 34 and this year my normally straight long hair has changed!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s frizz land over here and it&#x27;s really frustrating!&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve never in my life had this problem, I had no idea what to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have Morracan Oil, and it&#x27;s nice, but doesn&#x27;t do enough for the level of crazy my hair has taken on.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this conditioner and BOOM -- problem solved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very please and will be back for more!</li>
            <li> I have VERY thick, coarse, semi-wavy hair. I have tried many kinds of conditioner and this is BY FAR the best I&#x27;ve ever used. You will not believe how smooth it makes your hair the moment you rinse it out. It also smells amazing! My 7 year old daughter loves it too. Her hair gets very tangled and this conditioner takes them right out and makes her hair so easy to comb through. For around $5, you can&#x27;t beat it!!</li>
            <li> I could not believe how smooth and soft my hair felt out of the shower with this stuff. Together with the Smooth Start shampoo and hair serum, I&#x27;ve finally found the perfect combo of products for my fine, dry, and damaged hair!!</li>
            <li> Very nice hair product and great quality, makes my hair feel soft and manageable and the price is great so I would recommend it for more straight hair</li>
            <li> My kids poured it all over our brand new couch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never felt such Silky smooth cushions on my buttocks in all my life&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it&#x27;s good on hair too.</li>
            <li> I received this and was immediately relieved. I had recently bleached and fried my hair. Just after one use, I could already tell the difference. I am going to continue to buy this just to have soft and tamed hair.</li>
            <li> i ordered curly so i was given a refund(( lov u Amazon) and turned around and ordered the right one for curls&lt;br /&gt; love the smell and was able to let my step daughter have these and she love them .. she has smooth pretty hair&lt;br /&gt; i have that dreaded natural curls --that say ..oh yea ..&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;we curling on you no matter what &#x27;&#x27; bring on the humidity</li>
            <li> I love it, as my hair is maturing, as is the rest of me, and it is becoming very dry.  I use this and the shampoo daily and it keeps my hair from looking like a stuck a finger in a light bulb.</li>
            <li> Works great on wet hair, dry hair etc.  Manages the Frizz and gives you a nice soft shine.  Great Product.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair conditioner! I love how with a tiny amount I can cover my long hair and it makes my hair feel supper soft. It untangles my hair immediately.</li>
            <li> Seems to make my hair smoother.</li>
            <li> Just have to say the first time I put it on my hair (about a week and half ago), I instantly saw and felt results. My hair is usually frizzy and has quite a bit of fly-aways, but this product is unlike anything I&#x27;ve felt in a conditioner, and I&#x27;ve used a lot of salon products and store brands.  I use a leave-in conditioner roughly once a week also, but when combined with this product the fly-aways aren&#x27;t as obvious and overall my hair is smooth as advertised. I love the way it makes my hair feel all day and I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter has very very thick curly curly hair.  This product is the best I have found to condition her hair with.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s does what it say it will do ,,, my hair feels  like  my  beautician has done my hair ,,,no fly always , my hair is soft and smooth yet still holds the curl and volume</li>
            <li> Best Repair Conditioner on the market, IMO. Many conditioners don&#x27;t rinse clean, but this one does. Leaves my hair nice and squeaky. Once dry, maintains softness and smells great. I&#x27;ve bleached and manic panicked my hair a ridiculous amount of times. This is definitely one of the best repairing conditioners out there if you have destroyed your hair like I have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using nothing but Frizz-ease conditioner for the past 9+ years, except a small handful of attempts to save money, back when this stuff was quite a bit more expensive. I use very little of it, I have extremely oily hair, so I use much more shampoo and let that soak up all of the oil, but I literally only need about a thumb-nail&#x27;s size drop, maybe a tiny bit more, of the Frizz-ease for all of my hair because it works so well and still makes my hair soft. If you&#x27;re someone that has very very dry hair, and you need the oil and shine, oh my god if you soak your hair in this your problems will be solved, I promise. But again, I&#x27;m the complete opposite side of the spectrum, very very oily hair and even I love this product, I just use very little of it, and it still takes away the frizz and makes my hair super soft, and because I use so little I don&#x27;t get the oily feeling or greasy hair the next day. I don&#x27;t think anyone would&#x27;t love this product, and everyone should at least try it, especially with how cheap it is, if you don&#x27;t like it for some crazy reason I&#x27;m sure you know someone with frizzy or curly hair that hasn&#x27;t discovered this yet, please give this to them to try, because no one deserves to have frizzy hair without Frizz-ease!</li>
            <li> This is great for having silky hair. My dau. visited and failed to put on conditioner. I suggested she put a dot in her hand of the smoothing and run it through her wet hair. It worked for her. I do the same on wet or dry hair if it is humid even after shower use.</li>
            <li> i love this product because it made my hair so soft and not frizzy at all .its the best product I&#x27;ve ever used you should really buy it</li>
            <li> I was very upset to learn that my favorite conditioner &amp;#34;Smooth Start&amp;#34; by FrizzEase was being discontinued as I no longer saw it on the store shelves.  I went to the FrizzEase website and looked at this product and its ingredients and they were identical to &amp;#34;Smooth Start&amp;#34; so I thought they just re-marketed the same product.  Also, if you look on this page the ingredients are listed as identical.  Well I went and bought it and the ingredients are NOT the same and the product is NOT the same.  It is now too heavy and makes my hair limp.  The rave reviews for the OTHER product should not be on this page.  Frizz Ease also needs to change the ingredient list on their website.  Lame.</li>
            <li> I am usually a pantene girl, but I decided to get this just to make up my purchase for free shipping. Wow, after trying this conditioner I will not  go back to panten. It leaves my very frizzy, very fine, color treated hair smooth and soft. I could not believe my hair actually felt like it did before I started coloring (what 20 yrs ago). Usually I have to put leave-in conditioner after shampoo/conditioner in the shower. Than I follow up with various hair products just to style my hair. Now its just shampoo, conditioner, a little bit of styling gel and I am good to go.</li>
            <li> I have long hair; about 3 inches past my shoulders and its very fine. You cant tell unless you touch it. So any heat styling can definitely cause it to look abused. I try not to blow out my hair every day so that it doesnt get too damaged. I use this conditioner with the matching shampoo when I&#x27;m going to blow out my hair. I&#x27;ve tried so many different brands and I keep coming back to this one. It does cut down on my frizz but not 100%. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll ever find a product that gives me 100%. As soon as my hair even detects any moisture, BAM! it starts to frizz and curl! I have natural curls/waves which isn&#x27;t such a bad thing because I can have the option of wearing it straight or curly. I would totally recommend this product to anyone to try at least once!</li>
            <li> I bought this Shampoo and Conditioner at Target since it was slightly cheaper. I have a wavy hair that instantly frizz up in South FL weather. I used the whole bottle and saw no improvements. It&#x27;s actually dried up my hair and made it more unmanageable. So disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have thin curly hair. This conditioner is very heavy. It did untangle pretty well, but I didn&#x27;t like the extra weight.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, mostly straight and very frizzy, occasionally slightly wavy and very frizzy hair that normally fights me when I try to style it.  I&#x27;d previously used countless leave-in products and spent a ridiculous amount of time trying to get my hair to stay straight where I wanted it straight and wave where I wanted it to wave, only to have a so-so outcome. With the John Frieda Frizz Ease shampoo and conditioner, I now need no leave in products, and when I blow dry style it, my hair comes out straight where I want it straight and waves where I want it to wave. I am extraordinarily pleased with these products - love, love, love them !!!</li>
            <li> Just a very, very small amount goes a long way.  I can put just a little bit on my hair and it does wonders.  This should last forever.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite conditioner of all time, and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few. It leaves my hair hydrated and glossy and has a nice, but not overpowering scent. It&#x27;s as good as the super expensive ones, but at a reasonable price. I like the packaging too - you get more of the product out and it&#x27;s easier to use in the shower.</li>
            <li> Pretty sure I ordered smooth start conditioner and not flawlessly straight. Disappointing</li>
            <li> Great for overly processed hair.</li>
            <li> This is preferred by a family member with thick and wavy hair. Perhaps 2C.</li>
            <li> Great product, helps my hair hold it&#x27;s style, my barber gives it an A+.</li>
            <li> I have straight, fine hair and this product eases the frizzy strands and has a very &#x27;weightless&#x27; quality after blow drying or even just towel drying.</li>
            <li> Great regular conditioner to protect slightly dry and wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, my daughter loves it and does not even want to try other brands!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive smooth start conditioner but flawlessly Straight. When I bought the product the heading said smooth start... I think this product is a little bit more greasy than the smooth start</li>
            <li> I use the shampoo, too. If you need it, use both! It works...even on my thick blonde hair, to make it less wavy! It is straight, now! Try it!</li>
