            <li> Completely changed my hair texture; I haven&#x27;t used a flat iron in over 6 weeks - since I relaxed it.  </li>
            <li> My hair was left completely dry , straight with no body left to it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a bit challenging to apply on long hair-it is very thick cream, so it is hard to keep hair perfectly straight during application.</li>
            <li> I just wish I purchased this instead of my last relaxer, which was a no-lye box brand that dried my hair out yet did not loosen even half the curl pattern; so now, my roots are straight and shiny and the middle to ends are poofy, which means I need to flat iron because of the old relaxer.</li>
            <li> The difference between the newly relaxed hair and the previously relaxed hair is like night and day.</li>
            <li> I have dense, dry, coarse, and brittle hair.</li>
            <li> Last time came cap was loose and this was a concern.</li>
            <li> basic application is the same as with other relaxers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Washing all this relaxer out takes a long time.  </li>
            <li> I used only half the container and mixed in a separate bowl.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to other relaxers.</li>
            <li> wanted to love this relaxer, but sadly after 9 months of use it dried my hair out, im now</li>
            <li> Next time, I&#x27;ll do the 2 min shampoo and see if it cuts down on time.  </li>
            <li> I was only expecting less hair damage, but  got maximum results.</li>
            <li> After using it my hair sheds a lot less &amp; my hair is starting to become thicker again.</li>
            <li> It is too thick to comb thru after it is applied (which the instructions tell you not to do), so try to get it on hair that is nicely combed out; once applied to the hair it will be very difficult to straighten further.</li>
            <li> I saved the other half for 6 to 8 weeks later.  </li>
            <li> Follow instructions carefully.  </li>
            <li> With other relaxers I have to get a relaxer every three weeks with Phyto</li>
            <li> and I applied the instructions very carefully.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the other half is severely damaged and it is falling out.</li>
            <li> relaxed as usual every 8-10 weeks, the hair was soooo very dry that it shed continuously</li>
            <li> Oh, and little to no hair breakage since I started using this brand.  </li>
            <li> It has outlast other relaxers I,ve utilized in the past.</li>
            <li> Other relaxers have failed to straighten my hair, only loosening the curls a very minimal amount.</li>
            <li> very Hard to get hairs moisturized after several months of use</li>
            <li> but a little harsh on my scalp....</li>
            <li> its both of their faults but the hair that is lwft is burnt and broken and so dry....</li>
            <li> My goodness I had to cut off at least 6-8 inches of hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased index 2, for thick resistant hair.</li>
            <li> real negative is that it seems to turn gray hair lemon</li>
            <li> /&gt;He was unable to get any wave to stay in it.</li>
            <li> I applied it on my hair and the results were disastrous.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Last time came cap was loose and this was a concern. Otherwise would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Item is as described was delivered as stated in good condition. I have been using product for six months my hair is healthy and growing.</li>
            <li> Never ever use this product. I applied it on my hair and the results were disastrous. I lost more than half of my hair and I applied the instructions very carefully. Additionally, the other half is severely damaged and it is falling out. I went to the hair salon immediately after I saw the results and she told me that there is nothing to do. She also said that I should never use this product again. I should get a compensation to get my hair back and a full refund of the product price. There should not be any product for hair that result in becoming bald. Please be aware and never buy this product.</li>
            <li> Ladies be carefull of this product if your not African American.... my friend bought it and applied it.... it burned her scalp and pretty mich all of her hair fellout in massive clumps.  The sales woman at Sallys never told her it was for African American hair nor did ask I guess and apparently you cannot use it on hair with highlights......its both of their faults but the hair that is lwft is burnt and broken and so dry....like i said becareful..some times a bargain isnt worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Best Relaxer ever made. I been using this relaxer for 7 yrs now but this time I decided to relax my own hair instead of my stylist to save money. This was my moms 1st time ever using the relaxer and she loves it especially the non lye and it straighten our hair very straight that is</li>
            <li> wife loves this stuff</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after searching for the perfect relaxer that would not be as harsh on my hair as others. After reading all of the positive reviews, I decided to take the risk. The cost was my only concern, but was very well worth every penny. I purchased index 2, for thick resistant hair. Other relaxers have failed to straighten my hair, only loosening the curls a very minimal amount. This relaxer gave me the most straight hair possible, yet very shiny and healthy. The difference between the newly relaxed hair and the previously relaxed hair is like night and day. The hair I just relaxed now appears to resemble Asian/Caucasian hair texture and movement. It is also very shiny and healthy. I was in complete shock after rinsing the relaxer. I was only expecting less hair damage, but  got maximum results. Also, there is no odor to the relaxer. I just wish I purchased this instead of my last relaxer, which was a no-lye box brand that dried my hair out yet did not loosen even half the curl pattern; so now, my roots are straight and shiny and the middle to ends are poofy, which means I need to flat iron because of the old relaxer. I will definitely purchase again. I will never go back to other relaxers. It would make no sense to. If you are thinking about purchasing, don&#x27;t hesitate. Also, my scalp did not burn at all.</li>
            <li> I had this used on my hair first when I was on a cruise and I will never use anything else. It straightens and softens! It makes my hair look and feel healthier.</li>
            <li> I orignally loved this relaxer!&lt;br /&gt;So the pros:&lt;br /&gt;  No immediate shedding, this is huge!&lt;br /&gt;  Gently &amp;#34;texlaxes&amp;#34; the hair as opposed to getting it bone straight&lt;br /&gt;  Hair looks very healthy after use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Drying!!!! My goodness I had to cut off at least 6-8 inches of hair. very Hard to get hairs moisturized after several months of use&lt;br /&gt;I relaxed as usual every 8-10 weeks, the hair was soooo very dry that it shed continuously&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to love this relaxer, but sadly after 9 months of use it dried my hair out, im now back to Mizani Butter blend which is sooooooooooo much better for my hair but a little harsh on my scalp.... I just stretch out the relaxer and do my best to take care of my hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice product like what i wanted.</li>
            <li> It is the first time I use this product and is very good, I feel comfortable using it</li>
            <li> I ordered index 2 but got index 1 delivered and I didnt realize it till just now when I about to use it. What else can I say...</li>
            <li> My hair was left completely dry , straight with no body left to it.  It was applied with reat care by my hairdresser.&lt;br /&gt;He was unable to get any wave to stay in it.</li>
            <li> I have dense, dry, coarse, and brittle hair. Out of the many relaxers I&#x27;ve previously used. Phyto Specific PhytoRelaxer is the only relaxer that leaves my hair feeling naturally straight - like a straightening comb soft feel instead of the chemical dry feel that many relaxers usually leave.</li>
            <li> The product was not difficult to apply .&lt;br /&gt;the basic application is the same as with other relaxers.&lt;br /&gt;The feel of the cream is non-greasy and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;There is an ammonia odor when the shampoo is applied but&lt;br /&gt;once the cream is completely removed the odor completely dissipates.&lt;br /&gt;Only real negative is that it seems to turn gray hair lemon yellow.&lt;br /&gt;When all is said and done the product is the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Amazing!  I wish I discovered this years ago!  Completely changed my hair texture; I haven&#x27;t used a flat iron in over 6 weeks - since I relaxed it.  I used Index-2, which is very gentle yet surprisingly effective -- but you still have to buy a tub (yes TUB) of vaseline or petroleum jelly and make sure that every piece of scalp &amp; skin that&#x27;ll be in contact with the relaxer is coated with it!  Follow instructions carefully.  This is so gentle that I can apply it with my bare hands.  Did not mess up my manicure or hands.  However, I still take precautions with my scalp. I didn&#x27;t burn, but it did get a bit hot towards the end.  I used only half the container and mixed in a separate bowl. it was surprisingly enough for new growth only. I saved the other half for 6 to 8 weeks later.  What I missed in the instructions regarding washing it out - but they ARE there - is to leave the shampoo on for 2 minutes each time before rinsing.  Washing all this relaxer out takes a long time.  Next time, I&#x27;ll do the 2 min shampoo and see if it cuts down on time.  My hair is strong, healthy, straight, beautiful, flowing, and just gorgeous. A great cut helps!  I get lots of compliments on how healthy my hair looks.  ..Oh, and little to no hair breakage since I started using this brand.  It&#x27;s pricey - yikes - but completely worth it.  You&#x27;ll actually save a lot more money in the long run by investing in this top of the line product for your hair.</li>
            <li> this is a very good relaxer for thick hair it is also good on the scalp it really work and it keep your texture</li>
            <li> I have been using Phyto relaxer for vet 1 year and I must say I like the texture of my hair better now than I did when I used Mizani.</li>
            <li> I consider this product to be one of the very best for my African American Hair. It leaves my hair silky, shining and bouncy. It has outlast other relaxers I,ve utilized in the past. It&#x27;s natural ingredients does wonders for my hair. I would recommend that if you relax your hair to give this one a try. It may cost a little bit more but it&#x27;s worth every cent.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Should be labeled &amp;#34;handle with care&amp;#34;! Product was damaged during shipping! Relaxer took wonderfully even though I only had half of the cream part of the relaxer.</li>
            <li> Phyto Relaxer works wonderful. With other relaxers I have to get a relaxer every three weeks with Phyto it&#x27;s been six weeks and I still don&#x27;t need one.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is like blonde cotton candy (caucasian hair). Used this as per directions for 20 mins and the results are BEAUTIFUL. Smooth and shiny. Amazing. And no hair breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit challenging to apply on long hair-it is very thick cream, so it is hard to keep hair perfectly straight during application. It is too thick to comb thru after it is applied (which the instructions tell you not to do), so try to get it on hair that is nicely combed out; once applied to the hair it will be very difficult to straighten further. If you are going for stick straight hair that might be challenging.</li>
            <li> This relaxer is the BEST relaxer ever! After using it my hair sheds a lot less &amp; my hair is starting to become thicker again. The amazing thing about this product is that because its made from plants &amp; eggs it does not damage your hair the way other relaxers do! Highly recommend it despite the price because its worth it!</li>
