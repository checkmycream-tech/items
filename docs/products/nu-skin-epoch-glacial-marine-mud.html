            <li> If you use a Sponsor ID# from someone you don&#x27;t know, unbeknownst to you, you could get stuck with a business partner you hate for life.</li>
            <li> have acne prone skin, so when I&#x27;m breaking out real bad, I slather some on</li>

            <li> Please note that a Sponsor Distributor ID# is not a promo code and it should not be posted and used freely, it&#x27;s against Nu Skin&#x27;s policy for a good reason. Would you want someone unethical to be your business partner? What if you like using Nu Skin products so much that you want to become an active distributor? If you use a Sponsor ID# from someone you don&#x27;t know, unbeknownst to you, you could get stuck with a business partner you hate for life. I had bought Nu Skin products about 5 years ago from a beauty salon and I love it. Now, I&#x27;m a distributor and have a wonderful sponsor distributor to help and guide me to grow my Nu Skin business. This might be the business opportunity that you&#x27;ve been looking for and it may become your future and retirement income one day. Please don&#x27;t throw it away lightly by signing up with a wrong distributor who we already know is unethical.</li>

            <li> Nu skin I came across through a nail salon..The foot lotion is so great I tried this product. Nu skin definatly has it going on and speedy delivery. great packaging.  great mask.</li>
            <li> Product is efficient and tightening effect can be felt upon application. Not sure about the whitening effect although I do feel my skin becomes softer. Love this product.</li>
            <li> Skin is smoother and more beautiful! Love this mask</li>
            <li> It got damaged in the package, but the thing is good.</li>

            <li> Good product, but bad packaging</li>
            <li> Expensive, hyped up, MLM item. Didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried 2-3 bottles and gave up. It may have been fun playing with the mud, but when I don&#x27;t see the alleged claimed effects, I stopped using.</li>
            <li> good item...no issues</li>
            <li> This product really works well with oily/blemish skin.  I love this product.</li>
            <li> it is good and easy to wash .</li>

            <li> Excellent product! Although the texture was watery, I was still able to apply it on. Not sure if it&#x27;s manufactured that way or because it was diluted:/ either way, my skin felt smooth, softer and cleaner afterwards. My skin also looks brighter and more even tone.</li>

            <li> it reduces pores and clears up my very acne prone skin. leaves you with a smooth and clean feeling every time you use it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I says what it&#x27;s going to do and actually lives up to it.&lt;br /&gt;I have acne prone skin, so when I&#x27;m breaking out real bad, I slather some on (it&#x27;s very fun to play with!) and wait 20 minutes then wash it off and BAM! You can notice softness and your pimples will reduce in size and won&#x27;t be so red and irritated looking.&lt;br /&gt;I would reccomend to everyone! The price is a little iffy for only a small bit, but well worth it!</li>
            <li> First mud I received that is runny.  Too much has the to return.</li>
