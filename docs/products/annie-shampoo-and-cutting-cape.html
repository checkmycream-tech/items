    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li>LOL.</li>
            <li>GOOD FOR THE PRICE ... WOULD RECOMMEND ...</li>
            <li>BUT GOOD FOR WHAT I NEED FOR WHICH</li>
            <li>Item was in excellent shape and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for at home trims and self coloring, and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>For the price, I&#x27;m quite satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>has better  cheap  </li>
            <li>The cape is nice and large but the Velcro is very cheaply put together at the closure area.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s holding up just fine.</li>
            <li>I ordered this cape for when I cut hair for guys on my campus, and if it were actually black like the picture says it would be perfect.  </li>
            <li>but I just use a hair clip to keep it in place and it works fine.  </li>
            <li>collar broke the  very  first time i put it on a client.sally</li>
            <li>Actually the one that I got is brown, which I&#x27;m totally fine with.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very lightweight cape and inexpensive.</li>
            <li>This shampoo and cutting cape is perfect for giving my husband haircuts at home without getting hair all over his clothes!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great, but would be a little better if the neck could be made a little smaller.</li>
            <li>Kind of thin, but if you&#x27;re careful with it, it&#x27;s OK.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a very thin plastic material, not the highest quality, but it&#x27;s sort of what i expected for the price, it works, it does the job for Chemical services, very easy to clean with a damp cloth!</li>
            <li>Had to of the loop (soft side) on both sides of cape.</li>
            <li>maroon, not black, as shown.</li>
            <li>It not very tight around the neck and no way to adjust it to prevent hair from getting all over you without using paperclips or something.</li>
            <li>The color doesn&#x27;t change the way it catches hair, and it&#x27;s worked well enough so far, but I would have much preferred a black cape.</li>

            <li> Bought this because it was cheap and just needed a cape for cutting my son&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> I can always cut a piece of the hook to attach the neck but not worth it.</li>

            <li> very stiff plastic/vinyl.  poorly attached velcro. maroon, not black, as shown.</li>
            <li> The cape is nice and large but the Velcro is very cheaply put together at the closure area. The Velcro is ripping away from the cape already.</li>
            <li> I use this when I cut my husband&#x27;s hair.  It&#x27;s great, but would be a little better if the neck could be made a little smaller.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed for home haircuts.  Quality is acceptable, and the price can&#x27;t be beat.  Perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very lightweight cape and inexpensive. I thought I was going to get a black one according to the product picture. Actually the one that I got is brown, which I&#x27;m totally fine with. Just a little surprised. The neck closure part is a little tricky as the velcro is a little loose. I can see myself stitching it in future. LOL. For the price, I&#x27;m quite satisfied with the product. It does the job.</li>
            <li> The velcro is in my oppinion too short, which makes it less universal about circumf. of the neck. Only big circumf. sizes. Material is waterproof, which is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Kind of thin, but if you&#x27;re careful with it, it&#x27;s OK.  I&#x27;ve used it several times, it&#x27;s still in one piece, but I&#x27;m very careful with it to not rip it.</li>
            <li> Finally broke down and bought one. Protects clothes and towels. Wish I would have bought one years ago.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and cutting cape is perfect for giving my husband haircuts at home without getting hair all over his clothes!</li>
            <li> It not very tight around the neck and no way to adjust it to prevent hair from getting all over you without using paperclips or something.</li>
            <li> Material is thin but it does the job, keeps water away from clothing underneath. We&#x27;ve used it a few times and despite the fact that it is thin it&#x27;s holding up just fine. My mom is in a wheelchair and this helps keep her dry while we wash her hair.</li>

            <li> IT CAME AS TOLD .. GOOD FOR THE PRICE ... WOULD RECOMMEND ... IT COVERS ALL OVER .. THIN CAPE BUT GOOD FOR WHAT I NEED FOR WHICH IS FOR CUTTING HAIR ONLY</li>
            <li> Very thin. Velcro or hook and loop on neck was put on wrong. Had to of the loop (soft side) on both sides of cape. I can always cut a piece of the hook to attach the neck but not worth it. Would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> .cheap as the price it self..capes  collar broke the  very  first time i put it on a client.sally has better  cheap  shampoo capes</li>
            <li> This cutting cape was received really fast.  I was expecting a black cutting cape like the picture and received a maroon colored one but this wasn&#x27;t a big deal for me since I&#x27;m using it just to cut my husband&#x27;s hair at home.  I will order again if necessary in the future.</li>
            <li> Bought this because it was cheap and just needed a cape for cutting my son&#x27;s hair.  However he is only 5 so this is too big to use the velcro on it but I just use a hair clip to keep it in place and it works fine.  I&#x27;ve had it for about a year now with no rips or tears.  Works well for my purposes.</li>
