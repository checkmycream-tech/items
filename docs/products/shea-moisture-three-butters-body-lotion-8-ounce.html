            <li>The Butter Lotion fragrance smelled more like the Lotion Soap Bar.</li>

            <li>Their costumer service says nothing changed and I will strongly disagree.</li>
            <li>The scent was too strong for me.  </li>

            <li>Good enough!</li>

            <li>This product has a very nice, distinct sent which is why I have been buying it for so long.</li>
            <li>I should have heeded the other reviews that stated the lotion scent is not so great.  </li>
            <li>Everyone always comments on how fresh and clean he smells.  </li>
            <li>The original fragrance made me end my never-ending hunt for the right cologne.</li>
            <li>Soothing, healing, and very pleasant overall as an aftershave balm for those who like that sort of aftershave, and particularly recommended for the winter months for those who live in northern climes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Normally, I would not spend the time to comment about lotion; however, when I first discovered this product, I was amazed at how well it worked, how great it smelled and what it actually did for my skin.</li>
            <li>Worth the try.  </li>
            <li>I quickly ordered 2 more today in hopes that I get the same results.</li>
            <li>Mainly because of the smell, it is Strong,  I can&#x27;t apply after my shower if I plan to eat anytime within the next couple hours because my hands smell so strongly like cheap cologne than I can taste it if  my hands are near my mouth.  </li>
            <li>Target, Vitamin Shoppe Stores and most recently Amazon through Vitamin Shoppe.</li>
            <li>My feet - dearly in need of a pedicure - are notably softer the next day.</li>
            <li>My legs are so soft and smooth</li>
            <li>but I similar to a $10 bottle of Cologne and about as strong.</li>
            <li>Simply because the scents may clash or be too strong for those around you.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is more consistent with the Shower Scrub in the same line rather than the old Butter Lotion product.</li>
            <li>(the only thing you can find now) smells strongly of chemicals and cheap, low quality lotion.</li>
            <li>The seller was fast to ship.</li>
            <li>I asked them to Please revert back to the original</li>
            <li>I hope the original scent comes back.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is light and doesn&#x27;t hang around too long or interfere with your cologne if you choose to wear one.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>it was a far better product, do not know if they are producing this due to a shortage of ingredients or if it was a suggestion</li>
            <li>I bought this same lotion directly from the Shea Moisture website and the original scent and consistency is there.</li>
            <li>A lot of reviewers compare this to the old formula,  which I had never used, but I am absolutely returning this one.  </li>
            <li>I feel normal again.</li>
            <li>If you want to change fragrances launch a new product.</li>
            <li>new formula</li>
            <li>the smell &amp; texture was way off from what I was used to even though the ingredients are the exact same.  </li>
            <li>The previous formula had a fantastic scent that would get me compliments all the time.</li>
            <li>Imagine spraying enough  cologne to cover your whole body,  and then doing that again; that&#x27;s what you will smell like if you use this as a body lotion.</li>
            <li>Bought a bottle  from J&amp;B Professional Beauty.</li>
            <li>But I have a sensitive nose so who am I to judge.</li>
            <li>However, it seems without warning, the scent and consistency of the product has completely changed.</li>
            <li>This is seriously one of my favorite lotions.  </li>
            <li>This went from a thick, high quality lotion to a runny cheap hotel lotion, although the packaging looks the same.   </li>
            <li>I find it hard to enjoy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know who the genius was that thought it would be a good idea to change the formula into one that stinks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is light, clean, and has that very vaguely clay-y scent of shea.</li>
            <li>I totally agree with other comments and reviews related to this product begin different than the older one.</li>
            <li>I have been purchasing Perricone products for my sensitive and very dry skin...</li>
            <li>I know that lotions with smell are suppose to be bad but this one amells good and is helpful.</li>

            <li> Long lasting.  </li>
            <li> The scent resembles cheap hair salon shampoo and the quality is a mere shadow of its former self.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my 80 year old very active Dad.  </li>
            <li> Although this is technically a body lotion you can use it to heal and/or soften rough, dry, chapped or otherwise irritated skin.</li>
            <li> , scent lasts all day and the lotion helps with the dry patches.</li>
            <li> I typically order multiple tubes of it at a time I felt I was deceived.</li>
            <li> I have recently also purchased 3 Butters Lotion, it does not smell nor does it have the same consistency as the butter lotion I have been purchasing for the past 3 yrs now.</li>
            <li> I typically order multiple tubes of it at a time, because we all like using it.  </li>
            <li> This photo shows what I expected to receive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how this all happens, but if you&#x27;re one of those like me, disappointed to find the various Amazon versions inferior to the original product, buy directly from Shea Moisture</li>
            <li> Nothing but endless compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----------------&lt;br /&gt;Update (4/18): decided to roll the dice and try another vendor.</li>
            <li> I compared the packaging from the official Shea Moisture shop to versions I&#x27;ve purchased from a few retailers on Amazon and there are enough subtle differences that I&#x27;m starting to wonder if other retailers are selling inferior or knock-off versions.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pricing is the same, product is way worse...</li>
            <li> I know this is a small business</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve purchased the bodywash and the soap.  </li>
            <li> I noticed the change late last year when I purchased the body wash at Target and thought maybe it was just a bad bottle</li>
            <li> I may bite the bullet and purchase from the shea moisture website, but if I get the same result, I&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Tough to find in any store.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews about the scent, and thought maybe it  was a bad batch or a recall.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have meetings to go to and don&#x27;t have time to re-shower to get the stench off of me.  </li>
            <li> has changed, but it stinks like no tomorrow.  </li>
            <li> Afraid it might not mix to well with my colognes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an entirely unpleasant smell</li>
            <li> nothing on the tube has changed to reflect that this now has a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; smell.  :(</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love shea butter and have been looking for some shea butter lotion that has a scent made for a man.  A lot of reviewers compare this to the old formula,  which I had never used, but I am absolutely returning this one.  Mainly because of the smell, it is Strong,  I can&#x27;t apply after my shower if I plan to eat anytime within the next couple hours because my hands smell so strongly like cheap cologne than I can taste it if  my hands are near my mouth.  It&#x27;s not an entirely unpleasant smell but I similar to a $10 bottle of Cologne and about as strong. Imagine spraying enough  cologne to cover your whole body,  and then doing that again; that&#x27;s what you will smell like if you use this as a body lotion.</li>
            <li> I love Shea moisture awesome natural products and smells so good!!</li>
            <li> The gift recipients loved it!</li>
            <li> Definitely this product has been suffering drastic fragrance changes . It used to have a nice, STRONG smell but the last ones ...low-key. I typically order multiple tubes of it at a time I felt I was deceived. I&#x27;ve compared ingredient lists and nothing there has changed. I know this is a small business but you cannot change fragrances like that. If you want to change fragrances launch a new product.</li>
            <li> Although this is technically a body lotion you can use it to heal and/or soften rough, dry, chapped or otherwise irritated skin. It is organic and all-natural so it should not cause any irritation or discomfort.  I have been using Shea Moisture products for some time now and can honestly say that I am very pleased with the results I have experienced thus far.</li>
            <li> My son loves all of the SheaMoisture products.</li>
            <li> Works as it should.  Smells pleasant on the skin.  It tends to feel slightly oily, at first, but is perfect as it absorbs into your skin.  I would suggest keeping it off your neck, face or exposed arms IF you wear cologne.  Simply because the scents may clash or be too strong for those around you.</li>
            <li> Does not smell like the store brand at all. This product has a very nice, distinct sent which is why I have been buying it for so long. I ordered 2 bottles and they smell like industrial chemicals instead.</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling stuff out there.  I&#x27;m not a big lotion guy, but ever time  I use it I get compliments!!</li>
            <li> I have recently also purchased 3 Butters Lotion, it does not smell nor does it have the same consistency as the butter lotion I have been purchasing for the past 3 yrs now. Target, Vitamin Shoppe Stores and most recently Amazon through Vitamin Shoppe. Their costumer service says nothing changed and I will strongly disagree. The fragrance is more consistent with the Shower Scrub in the same line rather than the old Butter Lotion product. The Butter Lotion fragrance smelled more like the Lotion Soap Bar. Also it is more lotion rather than Butter. I asked them to Please revert back to the original it was a far better product, do not know if they are producing this due to a shortage of ingredients or if it was a suggestion but the product I have been using and now purchased is not the same. I totally agree with other comments and reviews related to this product begin different than the older one. Nothing like it used to be.</li>
            <li> The scent changed dramatically. I find it hard to enjoy. I read other reviews about the scent, and thought maybe it  was a bad batch or a recall. I hope the original scent comes back. I really liked this product</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve purchased the bodywash and the soap.  They both feel and smell great.  Not so with the lotion.  I should have heeded the other reviews that stated the lotion scent is not so great.  The seller was fast to ship.</li>
            <li> This lotion used to smell incredible, now it smells like old lady perfume. I don&#x27;t know who the genius was that thought it would be a good idea to change the formula into one that stinks. I won&#x27;t buy it anymore unless they switch it back.</li>
            <li> It helps reduce white scaly skin and redness. I feel normal again. It takes about a week to work if you use it 3 times a day.</li>
            <li> This is seriously one of my favorite lotions.  Or was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It used to have a nice, very natural smell to it that was not offensive, and low-key.  I typically order multiple tubes of it at a time, because we all like using it.  BUT, on my last order, the product changed.  It now smells super strong of honeysuckle.  I&#x27;ve compared ingredient lists and nothing there has changed, but it stinks like no tomorrow.  I&#x27;ll be throwing these out.  Unfortunately, I have meetings to go to and don&#x27;t have time to re-shower to get the stench off of me.  YUCK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW...  nothing on the tube has changed to reflect that this now has a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; smell.  :(</li>
            <li> I like the product,women love the scent.They ask whats the name of the colonge I have on.I tell them its lotion.No way they say. I say way.Its a great product .It works great on my hands ,feet and on my sunburned head and neck.Its body lotion,way.Cant forget,it last.</li>
            <li> Most incredible hand and face lotion for men. Tough to find in any store.</li>
            <li> Quality men&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li> This photo shows what I expected to receive. Instead, the lotion came in a tube and the scent has been taken out of the formula. I really liked the product that came in the bottle; I bought it for the scent.</li>
            <li> Great smell, which I always get compliments on.  Long lasting.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The previous formula had a fantastic scent that would get me compliments all the time. It was great stuff and worth it for the smell alone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new formula (the only thing you can find now) smells strongly of chemicals and cheap, low quality lotion. This is NOT the original, great smelling version you remember.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pricing is the same, product is way worse... save your $ for a better lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the same boat like a lot of the newer reviews. I bought it via Amazon (Vitamin Shoppe), and the smell &amp; texture was way off from what I was used to even though the ingredients are the exact same.  The current fragrance does stink and has the consistency of sunblock SPF 100. I may bite the bullet and purchase from the shea moisture website, but if I get the same result, I&#x27;ll be disappointed. The original fragrance made me end my never-ending hunt for the right cologne. Nothing but endless compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----------------&lt;br /&gt;Update (4/18): decided to roll the dice and try another vendor. Bought a bottle  from J&amp;B Professional Beauty. And what do you know, the lotion with the original scent was delivered. Prayers were answered. I quickly ordered 2 more today in hopes that I get the same results. Moving my rating to 3 stars as the lotion roulette wheel odds shift in my favor.  The consistency is still thin/runny however.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my 80 year old very active Dad.  He loves it and so do I.  It smells wonderful and it keeps his face and neck from drying out after shaving.  Everyone always comments on how fresh and clean he smells.  I will order again and again.</li>
            <li> The lotion applies nicely but I&#x27;m not too fond of the smell. But I have a sensitive nose so who am I to judge. Overall good product.</li>
            <li> Normally, I would not spend the time to comment about lotion; however, when I first discovered this product, I was amazed at how well it worked, how great it smelled and what it actually did for my skin. However, it seems without warning, the scent and consistency of the product has completely changed. This went from a thick, high quality lotion to a runny cheap hotel lotion, although the packaging looks the same.   UPDATE 052515 I bought this same lotion directly from the Shea Moisture website and the original scent and consistency is there. I compared the packaging from the official Shea Moisture shop to versions I&#x27;ve purchased from a few retailers on Amazon and there are enough subtle differences that I&#x27;m starting to wonder if other retailers are selling inferior or knock-off versions. I&#x27;m not sure how this all happens, but if you&#x27;re one of those like me, disappointed to find the various Amazon versions inferior to the original product, buy directly from Shea Moisture and you&#x27;ll find the good stuff again.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband after looking everywhere for it. It smells great and scent lasts. Great moisturizer for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Worth the try.  The scent took some time getting use to.  Definitely kept my skin moisturized all day.  The scent was too strong for me.  Afraid it might not mix to well with my colognes.</li>
            <li> I have psorasis and find this product to helpful. I know that lotions with smell are suppose to be bad but this one amells good and is helpful.</li>
            <li> I have dry, ashy, sometimes itchy skin, so I buy a lot of moisturizers in the hunt for that perfect combination of effectiveness and a pleasant scent. Until I tried three butters, I had not ever felt the effects of a moisturizer the next day. Whoa! This stuff is amazing! Magical! My feet - dearly in need of a pedicure - are notably softer the next day. My legs are so soft and smooth they are practically slippery. What is this magic stuff? I don&#x27;t care. Just slather it on me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is light, clean, and has that very vaguely clay-y scent of shea. Good enough!</li>
            <li> This WAS the best lotion I have ever used. The scent resembles cheap hair salon shampoo and the quality is a mere shadow of its former self. I noticed the change late last year when I purchased the body wash at Target and thought maybe it was just a bad bottle so I purchased another....same thing. I have emailed Shea Moisture customer service, not bashing them, but politely asking if this was a permanent change. After two emails I still have not received a reply.</li>
            <li> Nice smell to it coupled with the soap, scent lasts all day and the lotion helps with the dry patches.</li>
            <li> I use all of Shea Moistures products and they are fantastic. The fragrance is light and doesn&#x27;t hang around too long or interfere with your cologne if you choose to wear one.</li>
            <li> Soothing, healing, and very pleasant overall as an aftershave balm for those who like that sort of aftershave, and particularly recommended for the winter months for those who live in northern climes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I approach the product as a shaver and as the author of a book on shaving.</li>
            <li> This lotion is like \\&quot;Magic\\&quot;...I have been purchasing Perricone products for my sensitive and very dry skin...I tried these products on a suggestion from a friend.  I could never have been happier!!  It is wonderful, and my  skin feels so soft and moist...thank you!</li>
            <li> The sent is calming &amp; relaxing. My husband &amp; I both use the lotion. It&#x27;s not greasy, has a luxurious feel &amp; the moisture lasts all day. Its perfect for dry Wisconsin winters. I only wish I could find it in the stores &amp; not have to buy it on line. This lotion is also great for exema, scars &amp; severely dry skin. Love this product!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been bugging my husband to use moisturizer for years.  I put this in his stocking in hopes that he might use it.&lt;br /&gt;He left it sitting there for about a month and then all of the sudden he says, &amp;#34; hey, where did you get this stuff&amp;#34;. He loves it and I had to go but more online.  Now he uses it every day!</li>
            <li> this is great lotion! all of the products from this company have been great for me. I use all of the shave stuff and it is some of the best  stuff for shaving plus it is organic and smells great!</li>
