            <li>first i wasn&#x27;t sure what to think,  i kinda looked at it for a minute and thought how is this going to wash my face?</li>
            <li>At first I wasn’t sure if it works but nothing to lose to try it.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a significant improvement.</li>

            <li>If you have problem areas on your body where your pores just don’t seem to clean out, grab one of these.</li>
            <li>Compared to this Japanese sponge, it&#x27;s more cost effective to buy Boscia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used it on my face, I figured it would clean it</li>
            <li>but I just set it on a perforated soap dish to let it drain and stay clean.</li>

            <li>/&gt;Thanks guys at Japanese Konjac Sponge - it&#x27;s nice to know customers are valued and always come first :)</li>
            <li>this a 10/10!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I did receive the Japanese Konjac sponge free in exchange for an honest review.  </li>
            <li>Konjac sponges are an excellent way to cleanse and gently exfoliate naturally, and The Japanese Konjac Sponge has a variety of extract-infused sponges.</li>
            <li>I received a complimentary sample of this Konjac puff from The Japanese Konjac Sponge in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>I received a complimentary sample of this Konjac puff from The Japanese Konjac Sponge in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>really can’t say enough good things about these products.</li>
            <li>pH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: The Japanese Konjac Sponge Brand provided me a Bamboo Charcoal Konjac Sponge in exchange for a honest review.</li>
            <li>You can get your own Japanese Konjac sponge depending on your skin type and</li>
            <li>love how soft it is.</li>
            <li>You can compost it right out in your compost pile or even in your garden if you wish.e about this sponge</li>
            <li>You can compost it right out in your compost pile or even in your garden if you wish.</li>
            <li>It is easily remedied with any little suction cup hook from the dollar store or a command strip hook, but it would just be nice to have it</li>
            <li>It is easily remedied with any little suction cup hook from the dollar store or a command strip hook, but it would just be nice to have it</li>
            <li>It cleans my pores and has really made a difference on my nose where blackheads tend to be more noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;The 100% natural konjac cleans deeply, hydrating the skin instead of drying it, so my face feels great after cleansing, not tight and stripped of moisture.</li>
            <li>Listen, I know when you see nothing but positive ratings and comments, one is quick to purchase that product.</li>
            <li>When brand new, it&#x27;s fine...</li>
            <li>but that works great for cleaning the small areas of your face like between the nose and cheek.</li>
            <li>I expect this is slightly less exfoliating than a wet washcloth, but it&#x27;s that much more gentler too, which is perfect for sensitive skin types.</li>
            <li>Japanese Konjac Sponge is only $11.65; compared to pricier brands from Sephora, I would say this is a great deal.</li>
            <li>It is super gentle and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li>My teen has been using one and we are seeing great results without using any cleansers!&lt;br /&gt;The Konjac sponge gently exfoliates which leaves my skin soft, clear and clean.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a very gentle exfoliation.</li>
            <li>thing really works and works well!.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with any of the sponge products offered from Japanese Konjac - the sponges exfoliates</li>
            <li>You should always use a cleanser or soap when using a Konjac sponge; just rubbing the sponge across your face isn&#x27;t going to do anything, regardless of the &amp;#34;extracts&amp;#34; that it contains (more on this later).</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m pretty sure any extracts in the sponge would be washed out within the first several uses.</li>
            <li>It is also fragrance and preservative free, so it should work even on acne prone and sensitive</li>
            <li>I understand why so many women in the beauty group recommended a Konjac facial sponge</li>
            <li>You will love washing your face with a Japanese Konjac sponge!</li>
            <li>first removed from the box</li>
            <li>The benefits are helping you get those stubborn pores clean and clear!</li>
            <li>​It contains positive minerals and antioxidant ingredients that help nourish and smooth skin naturally.</li>
            <li>Japanese Konjac Sponge is surprisingly soft and nice to use on the face.</li>
            <li>For a long time I had been using an exfoliating brush on my face and neck, and it wasn&#x27;t the most gentle on my skin, so</li>
            <li>I carefully squeezed as much water out as I could and hung it in my room (not the bathroom, which is more humid) to air-dry, but it took more than 2 days to completely dry.</li>
            <li>So it really needs to soak up.</li>
            <li>I’m not really even sure how to describe it.</li>
            <li>thanks for nothing</li>
            <li>and they are gentle to the skin.  </li>
            <li>and I really like how it treats my skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend you give them a try!</li>
            <li>The packaging provides detailed information on proper use and benefits of using the product.</li>
            <li>Rinse and squeeze any excess water gently.</li>
            <li>Konjac Sponge makes my face feel fabulous, like I have just gotten a facial.</li>
            <li>After a few moments of holding it under warm running water, it softened and expanded.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that is normal, so I need to figure out a better way to dry these things so that they don&#x27;t harbor bacteria...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s large enough that you can keep it in your hand and clean your face without any issues.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice vibrant green color and swells in size when soaked in water.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However once the people over at Konjac Sponge realized that I was unhappy they reached out to me and offered to give me a full refund if I wasn&#x27;t happy with the product.</li>
            <li>Since the sponge is wet, washed with, then squeezed out upon every use, I&#x27;m pretty sure any extracts in the sponge would be washed out within the first several uses.</li>
            <li>After the first use it left my skin feeling super soft!</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty sensitive and has combination of all (oily+dry).</li>
            <li>It is kind of small</li>
            <li>It also more acceptable to him as he didn&#x27;t have to mess with lotions, special face soaps and such.</li>
            <li>particular sponge seems to absorb water quicker as well.</li>
            <li>I already have a exfoliating brush but cannot use it daily as it would be too harsh, the sponge is good for every day use.</li>
            <li>I would recommend them highly.</li>
            <li>I typically use it to rinse of my face masks or to just exfoliate in the morning and it makes my face super soft and clean.</li>
            <li>I felt this worked better on my body areas because my skin is a little bit tougher on my chest/arms than my face.</li>
            <li>I have baby skin and am uber sensitive haha.</li>
            <li>Round charcoal brush; seemed ok but went with another brand.</li>
            <li>Make sure you read and follow the instruction before you use it and avoid harsh rubbing on acne area.</li>
            <li>Japanese Konjac Sponge is well-known to remove dirt, oil, blackheads, dead cells while gently exfoliates skin leaving a healthy and radiant skin beneath.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this konjac sponge in the past and it used to be my favorite.</li>
            <li>It comes in the cutest little box with easy directions/instructions.  </li>
            <li>Japanese Konjac sponge arrives in this cute little box indicating the history and use of Konjac.</li>
            <li>, I have less blackheads around my nose and my pores look squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>My Boscia sponge lasted nearly 2 1/2 months using it twice a day...</li>
            <li>/&gt;my facial cleanser and gently scrubs</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel soft and exfoliates</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised by how soft the texture of the sponge was.</li>
            <li>The texture of my skin has shown some improvement (even in though this winter has been extremely harsh on my skin) and now I&#x27;m just worried about tackling scars and hyper-pigmentation (which it has helped smooth out as well).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give it another month before I&#x27;m completely sold.</li>
            <li>It simply has to be rinsed and gently pressed between your hands to squeeze out the excess water.</li>
            <li>I actually had never even heard of such a thing until recently, so I was excited to try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But if you have full intentions of using this on your face, be sure to know if your facial skin is tough enough.</li>
            <li>This sponge is much bigger than previous sponges I have tried, making it easy to hold.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I have used quite a few sponges (some charcoal, some original)</li>
            <li>and my first sponge (I bought 3) is already in the trash because the center of the sponge literally disintegrated and</li>
            <li>Never irritates my sensitive facial skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and can use the sponge daily without drying out my skin.</li>
            <li>only gripe is with Konjac sponges in general, not with this brand in particular; for some reason, they take FOREVER to dry!</li>
            <li>This Konjac sponge is larger and better than any other I have tried in the past.  </li>
            <li>I had first heard of this little gem in a beauty</li>
            <li>The sponge came small and dry but after I followed the instructions on the packaging, it turned into a soft sponge that is suitable for everyday use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is quite unique that when it is dry, it is hard, but once you add water, it becomes squeezable, and absorbent.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I also liked that the sponge is a natural bamboo and charcoal which has antibacterial and helps reduce/absorb toxins.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and soft when cleansing my skin</li>
            <li> Let me just say that his is not a bad product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thanks guys at Japanese Konjac Sponge - it&#x27;s nice to know customers are valued and always come first :)</li>
            <li> this a 10/10!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I did receive the Japanese Konjac sponge free in exchange for an honest review.  </li>
            <li> Konjac sponges are an excellent way to cleanse and gently exfoliate naturally, and The Japanese Konjac Sponge has a variety of extract-infused sponges.</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary sample of this Konjac puff from The Japanese Konjac Sponge in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary sample of this Konjac puff from The Japanese Konjac Sponge in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> really can’t say enough good things about these products.</li>
            <li> pH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: The Japanese Konjac Sponge Brand provided me a Bamboo Charcoal Konjac Sponge in exchange for a honest review.</li>
            <li> You can get your own Japanese Konjac sponge depending on your skin type and</li>
            <li> love how soft it is.</li>
            <li> You can compost it right out in your compost pile or even in your garden if you wish.e about this sponge</li>
            <li> You can compost it right out in your compost pile or even in your garden if you wish.</li>
            <li> It is easily remedied with any little suction cup hook from the dollar store or a command strip hook, but it would just be nice to have it</li>
            <li> It is easily remedied with any little suction cup hook from the dollar store or a command strip hook, but it would just be nice to have it</li>
            <li> It cleans my pores and has really made a difference on my nose where blackheads tend to be more noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;The 100% natural konjac cleans deeply, hydrating the skin instead of drying it, so my face feels great after cleansing, not tight and stripped of moisture.</li>
            <li> Listen, I know when you see nothing but positive ratings and comments, one is quick to purchase that product.</li>
            <li> When brand new, it&#x27;s fine...</li>
            <li> but that works great for cleaning the small areas of your face like between the nose and cheek.</li>
            <li> I expect this is slightly less exfoliating than a wet washcloth, but it&#x27;s that much more gentler too, which is perfect for sensitive skin types.</li>
            <li> Japanese Konjac Sponge is only $11.65; compared to pricier brands from Sephora, I would say this is a great deal.</li>
            <li> It is super gentle and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li> My teen has been using one and we are seeing great results without using any cleansers!&lt;br /&gt;The Konjac sponge gently exfoliates which leaves my skin soft, clear and clean.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a very gentle exfoliation.</li>
            <li> thing really works and works well!.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with any of the sponge products offered from Japanese Konjac - the sponges exfoliates</li>
            <li> You should always use a cleanser or soap when using a Konjac sponge; just rubbing the sponge across your face isn&#x27;t going to do anything, regardless of the &amp;#34;extracts&amp;#34; that it contains (more on this later).</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m pretty sure any extracts in the sponge would be washed out within the first several uses.</li>
            <li> It is also fragrance and preservative free, so it should work even on acne prone and sensitive</li>
            <li> I understand why so many women in the beauty group recommended a Konjac facial sponge</li>
            <li> You will love washing your face with a Japanese Konjac sponge!</li>
            <li> first removed from the box</li>
            <li> The benefits are helping you get those stubborn pores clean and clear!</li>
            <li> ​It contains positive minerals and antioxidant ingredients that help nourish and smooth skin naturally.</li>
            <li> Japanese Konjac Sponge is surprisingly soft and nice to use on the face.</li>
            <li> For a long time I had been using an exfoliating brush on my face and neck, and it wasn&#x27;t the most gentle on my skin, so</li>
            <li> I carefully squeezed as much water out as I could and hung it in my room (not the bathroom, which is more humid) to air-dry, but it took more than 2 days to completely dry.</li>
            <li> So it really needs to soak up.</li>
            <li> I’m not really even sure how to describe it.</li>
            <li> thanks for nothing</li>
            <li> and they are gentle to the skin.  </li>
            <li> and I really like how it treats my skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend you give them a try!</li>
            <li> The packaging provides detailed information on proper use and benefits of using the product.</li>
            <li> Rinse and squeeze any excess water gently.</li>
            <li> Konjac Sponge makes my face feel fabulous, like I have just gotten a facial.</li>
            <li> After a few moments of holding it under warm running water, it softened and expanded.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that is normal, so I need to figure out a better way to dry these things so that they don&#x27;t harbor bacteria...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s large enough that you can keep it in your hand and clean your face without any issues.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice vibrant green color and swells in size when soaked in water.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However once the people over at Konjac Sponge realized that I was unhappy they reached out to me and offered to give me a full refund if I wasn&#x27;t happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Since the sponge is wet, washed with, then squeezed out upon every use, I&#x27;m pretty sure any extracts in the sponge would be washed out within the first several uses.</li>
            <li> After the first use it left my skin feeling super soft!</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty sensitive and has combination of all (oily+dry).</li>
            <li> It is kind of small</li>
            <li> It also more acceptable to him as he didn&#x27;t have to mess with lotions, special face soaps and such.</li>
            <li> particular sponge seems to absorb water quicker as well.</li>
            <li> I already have a exfoliating brush but cannot use it daily as it would be too harsh, the sponge is good for every day use.</li>
            <li> I would recommend them highly.</li>
            <li> I typically use it to rinse of my face masks or to just exfoliate in the morning and it makes my face super soft and clean.</li>
            <li> I felt this worked better on my body areas because my skin is a little bit tougher on my chest/arms than my face.</li>
            <li> I have baby skin and am uber sensitive haha.</li>
            <li> Round charcoal brush; seemed ok but went with another brand.</li>
            <li> Make sure you read and follow the instruction before you use it and avoid harsh rubbing on acne area.</li>
            <li> Japanese Konjac Sponge is well-known to remove dirt, oil, blackheads, dead cells while gently exfoliates skin leaving a healthy and radiant skin beneath.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this konjac sponge in the past and it used to be my favorite.</li>
            <li> It comes in the cutest little box with easy directions/instructions.  </li>
            <li> Japanese Konjac sponge arrives in this cute little box indicating the history and use of Konjac.</li>
            <li> , I have less blackheads around my nose and my pores look squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> My Boscia sponge lasted nearly 2 1/2 months using it twice a day...</li>
            <li> /&gt;my facial cleanser and gently scrubs</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel soft and exfoliates</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised by how soft the texture of the sponge was.</li>
            <li> The texture of my skin has shown some improvement (even in though this winter has been extremely harsh on my skin) and now I&#x27;m just worried about tackling scars and hyper-pigmentation (which it has helped smooth out as well).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give it another month before I&#x27;m completely sold.</li>
            <li> It simply has to be rinsed and gently pressed between your hands to squeeze out the excess water.</li>
            <li> I actually had never even heard of such a thing until recently, so I was excited to try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But if you have full intentions of using this on your face, be sure to know if your facial skin is tough enough.</li>
            <li> This sponge is much bigger than previous sponges I have tried, making it easy to hold.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I have used quite a few sponges (some charcoal, some original)</li>
            <li> and my first sponge (I bought 3) is already in the trash because the center of the sponge literally disintegrated and</li>
            <li> Never irritates my sensitive facial skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and can use the sponge daily without drying out my skin.</li>
            <li> only gripe is with Konjac sponges in general, not with this brand in particular; for some reason, they take FOREVER to dry!</li>
            <li> This Konjac sponge is larger and better than any other I have tried in the past.  </li>
            <li> I had first heard of this little gem in a beauty</li>
            <li> The sponge came small and dry but after I followed the instructions on the packaging, it turned into a soft sponge that is suitable for everyday use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is quite unique that when it is dry, it is hard, but once you add water, it becomes squeezable, and absorbent.  </li>
            <li> Its fibres and bamboo charcoal combine with other natural products to form a facial cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I let it sit for a while just letting water soak into it because when it first comes out of the box, it feels like a hard piece of Styrofoam.</li>
            <li> At first the sponge appears hard and resembles a biscuit.</li>
            <li> The sponge itself has no cleansing properties and may irritate or dry out your skin if you don&#x27;t use a proper cleanser with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Simply hang it up by the attached string to dry between uses.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought that the sponge will be like any other sponges in the market: harsh and rough on the skin.</li>
            <li> I really like these little sponges!!  </li>
            <li> but I have spent the last hour online trying to even find somewhere to contact them about it.</li>
            <li> She uses the Green Tea puff and since my skin is sensitive, oily and have acne, she told me to try the Bamboo Charcoal sponge.</li>
            <li> Its contact with water transforms the sponge into a soft and fluffy shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> Glucomannan, which is the plant-based material that makes up the &amp;#34;sponge,&amp;#34; is extremely absorbant, so when dry, it is small, hard, and very light, but when wet, it&#x27;s larger and extremely</li>
            <li> It helped a bit around my nose because I have dry flakes always on my nose (and clogged pores..)</li>
            <li> Hang your sponge to dry</li>
            <li> Each sponge, when dried and stored properly, lasts 1-2 months, so it&#x27;s definitely something I would spend money on.</li>
            <li> The string did break loose after a week</li>
            <li> I just add a little facial cleanser soap to it, and rub it in circular motion on my skin, and it isn&#x27;t abrasive at all.  </li>
            <li> (it comes with a little rope to hang) until next use.</li>
            <li> is that it doesn&#x27;t include a little hook to hang it like I have seen with similar products.</li>
            <li> It went from rock hard to soft.</li>
            <li> I was neither paid nor sponsored for my opinions—positive or otherwise—and all thoughts reflected in this review are solely my own.s wet, washed with, then squeezed out upon every use</li>
            <li> You cannot twist or be too rough as the material may fall apart.</li>
            <li> The only negative thought I have about this sponge is that it doesn&#x27;t include a little hook to hang it like I have seen with similar products.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I will use any other type of sponges to cleanse my face after using the Konjac sponges.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a sufferer of extreme acne</li>
            <li> I like it, just be careful with the little rope tie mine tore out.</li>

            <li> it was a hard lump that looked and felt like a rough rock.</li>
            <li> You just need to replace it after few weeks.</li>
            <li> it was too harsh for my skin.</li>
            <li> I realized within a few days</li>
            <li> but that was it, after i washed my face and dried it</li>
            <li> I tried the green tea puff that targets oily and combination skin.</li>
            <li> While I appreciate the green tea addition, I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the biggest selling point.</li>
            <li> I like it - but it ripped apart in less than a month, so I am not sure if I want to continue using this.</li>
            <li> Over the past month this sponge has helped with reducing breakout.</li>
            <li> The activated bamboo charcoal helps absorb oil, removes dirt and reduces excessive sebum.</li>
            <li> I use this at least three times a week.</li>
            <li> I am guilty of it myself.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It feels very weird when you are using this.</li>
            <li> brought this bad boy into the shower with me</li>
            <li> so disappointed.</li>

            <li> Charcoal scrubs, face masks, and sponges have become all the rage in the beauty world. The benefits are helping you get those stubborn pores clean and clear! Recently I got the chance to try out one of these charcoal sponges. I actually had never even heard of such a thing until recently, so I was excited to try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent The Japanese Konjac Bamboo Charcoal Sponge, which retails for $11.65 USD. This sponge is suitable for more oily/acne prone skin and is 100% NATURAL, VEGAN, NO PARABEN / PRESERVATIVES, NON-GMO, BIODEGRADABLE and ECO-FRIENDLY! Now I am always on the look out for products that are vegan because it means it is also a cruelty free product! (SAY NO TO ANIMAL TESTING KIDS!) You can use this on both your face and body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I brought this bad boy into the shower with me and I let it sit for a while just letting water soak into it because when it first comes out of the box, it feels like a hard piece of Styrofoam. So it really needs to soak up. after a bit of absorption, I started on my chest and worked my way up to my face.&lt;br /&gt;“The Japanese Konjac Sponge is well-known to remove dirt, oil, blackheads, dead cells while gently exfoliates skin leaving a healthy and radiant skin beneath. ​It contains positive minerals and antioxidant ingredients that help nourish and smooth skin naturally.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels very weird when you are using this. I’m not really even sure how to describe it. But I did not like this on my face. It helped a bit around my nose because I have dry flakes always on my nose (and clogged pores..) but that’s it. I felt this worked better on my body areas because my skin is a little bit tougher on my chest/arms than my face. Now here’s the question- would I recommend this? If you have problem areas on your body where your pores just don’t seem to clean out, grab one of these. But if you have full intentions of using this on your face, be sure to know if your facial skin is tough enough. I have baby skin and am uber sensitive haha.</li>
            <li> I received this for a review and gave it to my son.  He is 16 and I noticed that the pores on his nose were becoming enlarged.  They&#x27;ve seemed to become less noticeable like before he started puberty.  I also liked that the sponge is a natural bamboo and charcoal which has antibacterial and helps reduce/absorb toxins. It also more acceptable to him as he didn&#x27;t have to mess with lotions, special face soaps and such.</li>
            <li> I like it, just be careful with the little rope tie mine tore out.</li>
            <li> Let me just say that his is not a bad product. When brand new, it&#x27;s fine...My reason for giving this review one star is that I purchased this product on June 6 and here it is June 29th and my first sponge (I bought 3) is already in the trash because the center of the sponge literally disintegrated and&lt;br /&gt;broke away from the rest of the sponge...sort of like the middle chunk fell out...leaving this looking like a donut, not a cupcake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been buying a konjac charcoal sponge on Sephora made by Boscia....It was $16 for one...plus I had to reach a $49 order in order not to pay&lt;br /&gt;for shipping.  Having Amazon Prime, I searched and decided this product could be similar... But it&#x27;s not....it&#x27;s inferior for the length of time it will hold&lt;br /&gt;up.  My Boscia sponge lasted nearly 2 1/2 months using it twice a day...Compared to this Japanese sponge, it&#x27;s more cost effective to buy Boscia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Live and learn...</li>
            <li> I never heard of a konjac sponge for washing your face where I&#x27;m from we eat konjac!&lt;br /&gt;I love this sponge and I will reorder for sure and get one for each of my daughters.This is an awesome sponge I love it, it stretches&lt;br /&gt;my facial cleanser and gently scrubs now I&#x27;m hooked on this sponge. I even have a that sonic facial cleaner I use that once a month&lt;br /&gt;now. Who knew someone would think it would make a facial cleansing sponge.</li>
            <li> The sponge fallen apart in one week !</li>
            <li> The sponge itself was very good, however the string fell off and the sponge fell apart much more quickly than any other Konjac brand I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought that the sponge will be like any other sponges in the market: harsh and rough on the skin. Japanese Konjac Sponge is surprisingly soft and nice to use on the face. Not only that, it is also very effective in removing dirt and oil on my skin after a tiring day at school. I use my favorite face wash together with the sponge and the result is awesome. The sponge came small and dry but after I followed the instructions on the packaging, it turned into a soft sponge that is suitable for everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love this sponge and would recommend it to my friends. Overall, I am really happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I really like these little sponges!!  This was also includes a little wall suction to hang it in the shower.  Makes my face feel soft and exfoliates but not it&#x27;s to abrasive.</li>
            <li> Product: The sponge disintegrated after 2 week of use ( 1x day). People should not use this on the shower, it will block the water evacuation when decompose.</li>
            <li> Great natural product! After cleaning my face just with this sponge and warm water, my skin feels so clean and silky. I don&#x27;t even need to use a cleanser or moisturizer after using this sponge. You just need to replace it after few weeks.</li>
            <li> So irritated! I have purchased this konjac sponge in the past and it used to be my favorite. I got this one in the mail and it literally fell apart on the second use. so disappointed. I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt and ask for a replacement but I have spent the last hour online trying to even find somewhere to contact them about it. My only option is return, which they say I am too late for. thanks for nothing</li>
            <li> I wanted something that would help keep my acne at bay, the sponge though effective it was too harsh for my skin. I realized within a few days my skin was getting flaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However once the people over at Konjac Sponge realized that I was unhappy they reached out to me and offered to give me a full refund if I wasn&#x27;t happy with the product. Pleasantly surprised with their great customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks guys at Japanese Konjac Sponge - it&#x27;s nice to know customers are valued and always come first :)</li>
            <li> I think this sponge does a great job cleaning my skin - but it is too much hassle to store and upkeep. I&#x27;d rather get wash cloths. I did not notice any improvement in my acne.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to start uing this fantastic gadget, is so smooth and you could feel your face so clean after use it.</li>
            <li> I use this at least three times a week. Never irritates my sensitive facial skin.</li>
            <li> Round charcoal brush; seemed ok but went with another brand.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this. I think everyone should get one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first i wasn&#x27;t sure what to think,  i kinda looked at it for a minute and thought how is this going to wash my face? I read the directions and thought i give it a try. I have to say oi was surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put the sponge in water and waited a short time. It went from rock hard to soft. I used it on my face, I figured it would clean it but that was it, after i washed my face and dried it , i felt it. Boy was it smooth!!! You can use it with cleaner or just on its own. I like using it by it self. The sponge does such a great job. Im glad i got this in exchange for my honest review, I dont know what i have done with out this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this thing really works and works well!. This sponge will last 2-3 months, what a great deal. I will be using this every day! I have ordered 2 more. One for my husband and another for our teenage daughter. I think this would be good for her because its chemical free.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with any of the sponge products offered from Japanese Konjac - the sponges exfoliates and they are gentle to the skin.  I would recommend them highly.</li>
            <li> This Konjac sponge is larger and better than any other I have tried in the past.  It comes in the cutest little box with easy directions/instructions.  I received the one with added bamboo charcoal and I really like how it treats my skin. I like they way it takes care of any inflammation or breakouts I may experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular sponge seems to absorb water quicker as well. It&#x27;s nice and soft when cleansing my skin and I absolutely love it! I don&#x27;t think I will use any other type of sponges to cleanse my face after using the Konjac sponges. I rate this a 10/10!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I did receive the Japanese Konjac sponge free in exchange for an honest review.  Regardless, this review is 100% my own honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> The sponge fell apart within a week. Did not like it at all. Very bad quality, it feels like if it&#x27;s made out of some type of plastic.</li>
            <li> Konjac sponges are an excellent way to cleanse and gently exfoliate naturally, and The Japanese Konjac Sponge has a variety of extract-infused sponges. I tried the green tea puff that targets oily and combination skin. It&#x27;s a nice vibrant green color and swells in size when soaked in water. Glucomannan, which is the plant-based material that makes up the &amp;#34;sponge,&amp;#34; is extremely absorbant, so when dry, it is small, hard, and very light, but when wet, it&#x27;s larger and extremely soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised by how soft the texture of the sponge was. I was expecting a coarser texture like an actual sea or synthetic sponge, but Konjac is so smooth—almost slimy!—that it&#x27;s a very gentle exfoliation. I expect this is slightly less exfoliating than a wet washcloth, but it&#x27;s that much more gentler too, which is perfect for sensitive skin types. You should always use a cleanser or soap when using a Konjac sponge; just rubbing the sponge across your face isn&#x27;t going to do anything, regardless of the &amp;#34;extracts&amp;#34; that it contains (more on this later). The sponge itself has no cleansing properties and may irritate or dry out your skin if you don&#x27;t use a proper cleanser with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is with Konjac sponges in general, not with this brand in particular; for some reason, they take FOREVER to dry! I carefully squeezed as much water out as I could and hung it in my room (not the bathroom, which is more humid) to air-dry, but it took more than 2 days to completely dry. I don&#x27;t think that is normal, so I need to figure out a better way to dry these things so that they don&#x27;t harbor bacteria...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Japanese Konjac Sponge is only $11.65; compared to pricier brands from Sephora, I would say this is a great deal. Each sponge, when dried and stored properly, lasts 1-2 months, so it&#x27;s definitely something I would spend money on. While I appreciate the green tea addition, I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the biggest selling point. Since the sponge is wet, washed with, then squeezed out upon every use, I&#x27;m pretty sure any extracts in the sponge would be washed out within the first several uses. However, since the puff itself lasts a several weeks, I&#x27;ll still be using this on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FTC Disclosure: I received a complimentary sample of this Konjac puff from The Japanese Konjac Sponge in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

            <li> Listen, I know when you see nothing but positive ratings and comments, one is quick to purchase that product. I am guilty of it myself. Honestly the sponge is great. I&#x27;m not a sufferer of extreme acne but I do I have breakouts here and there. Over the past month this sponge has helped with reducing breakout. The texture of my skin has shown some improvement (even in though this winter has been extremely harsh on my skin) and now I&#x27;m just worried about tackling scars and hyper-pigmentation (which it has helped smooth out as well). The sponge alone is not going to answer all of your prayers; you need a cleanser that works for YOU to see results as well as great moisturizer. For ME it’s been doing okay I&#x27;ll give it another month before I&#x27;m completely sold. It may work better for you than it did me, I&#x27;m just warning to keep your expectations at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; P.S remember to keep it sanitary, after all it is a sponge and can harbor bacteria which is a HUGE no no.</li>
            <li> I like it - but it ripped apart in less than a month, so I am not sure if I want to continue using this.</li>
            <li> My friend actually recommended me to try this Japanese Konjac sponge. She uses the Green Tea puff and since my skin is sensitive, oily and have acne, she told me to try the Bamboo Charcoal sponge. At first I wasn’t sure if it works but nothing to lose to try it. Make sure you read and follow the instruction before you use it and avoid harsh rubbing on acne area. And TADAA… 3 words to describe my face after first time use: smooth, clean and fresh! :D Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I bought 2 different brands of this type of sponge after reading reviews to see which I would prefer. Defiantly get this one. It works great and I can see a difference in skin texture and breakouts. It&#x27;s no miracle seems to be helping. The string did break loose after a week but I just set it on a perforated soap dish to let it drain and stay clean.</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty sensitive and has combination of all (oily+dry). :-( My skin has brightened and even I&#x27;ve been looking for something that does exfoliate but harmless. They removed dirt, makeup, etc, and exfoliated my skin PERFECTLY.  :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really can’t say enough good things about these products. I highly recommend you give them a try!</li>
            <li> After the first use it left my skin feeling super soft! I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have just about every konjac sponge you can have, the charcoal one was the last one I needed to get. Save the best for last they say, this one is amazing! To get the best from this sponge, you must let it get soft in warmer water. I like to get warm-hot water on my face to open the pores, for the best cleaning of the skin. It leaves my face feeling amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bamboo charcoal contains mineral contents such as potassium, calcium, iron and sodium.Excellent for oily and acne prone skin. Gently exfoliates skin and helps to remove dirt, oil, dead skin cells, and blackheads. Thoroughly cleanses skin pores. Helps the skin looking softer. Hydrates skin &amp; balances pH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: The Japanese Konjac Sponge Brand provided me a Bamboo Charcoal Konjac Sponge in exchange for a honest review.</li>
            <li> For a long time I had been using an exfoliating brush on my face and neck, and it wasn&#x27;t the most gentle on my skin, so I figured it was time to give something else a try.  I came across the Japanese Konjac Sponge, and thought it sounded perfect for what I was looking for (something that cleanses my skin, getting rid of dirt and blackheads, and leaves my skin feeling smooth).  I will say that this sponge does just that.  It is quite unique that when it is dry, it is hard, but once you add water, it becomes squeezable, and absorbent.  I just add a little facial cleanser soap to it, and rub it in circular motion on my skin, and it isn&#x27;t abrasive at all.  I am very happy with this product, and the way my skin feels after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product for review purposes, but my opinions are entirely honest (just check out my skin!).</li>

            <li> A Konjac sponge has been on my beauty radar for several months. I had first heard of this little gem in a beauty group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is a Konjac sponge? A Konjac sponge is a cleansing and exfoliating facial sponge made out of a plant root. Konjac is a potato-like plant grown in Japan. Its fibres and bamboo charcoal combine with other natural products to form a facial cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Japanese Konjac sponge arrives in this cute little box indicating the history and use of Konjac. The packaging provides detailed information on proper use and benefits of using the product. At first the sponge appears hard and resembles a biscuit. Its contact with water transforms the sponge into a soft and fluffy shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use your favorite cleanser with a Konjac sponge. I have sensitive skin and can use the sponge daily without drying out my skin. It is also fragrance and preservative free, so it should work even on acne prone and sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How well does it work? The proof is in my skin. I have noticed a significant improvement. I already have a exfoliating brush but cannot use it daily as it would be too harsh, the sponge is good for every day use. The Konjac sponge cleans my skin well, I have less blackheads around my nose and my pores look squeaky clean. I understand why so many women in the beauty group recommended a Konjac facial sponge - it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeping a Konjac sponge clean is easy. Rinse and squeeze any excess water gently. You cannot twist or be too rough as the material may fall apart. Hang your sponge to dry (it comes with a little rope to hang) until next use. You can get your own Japanese Konjac sponge depending on your skin type and need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product in exchange for an unbiased review.</li>
            <li> You will love washing your face with a Japanese Konjac sponge! I received a Bamboo Charcoal Sponge to review and it is one of the greatest breakthroughs I have recently heard of.&lt;br /&gt;With a Konjac sponge, you don&#x27;t have to use cleansers at all if you don&#x27;t want to. You can, you just don&#x27;t have too. If you do, it helps create a rich lather.&lt;br /&gt;I love how soft it is. It is super gentle and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. I even wash all around that sensitive skin around my eyes and on my eyelids!&lt;br /&gt;The Bamboo Charcoal Sponge is ideal for oily or acne prone skin. The activated bamboo charcoal helps absorb oil, removes dirt and reduces excessive sebum. My teen has been using one and we are seeing great results without using any cleansers!&lt;br /&gt;The Konjac sponge gently exfoliates which leaves my skin soft, clear and clean. It cleans my pores and has really made a difference on my nose where blackheads tend to be more noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;The 100% natural konjac cleans deeply, hydrating the skin instead of drying it, so my face feels great after cleansing, not tight and stripped of moisture. It contains no fragrances, no harmful chemicals and is preservative free. Konjac is an eco-friendly choice made from the Konjac plant grown in Japan.&lt;br /&gt;When first removed from the box it was a hard lump that looked and felt like a rough rock. After a few moments of holding it under warm running water, it softened and expanded. This sponge is much bigger than previous sponges I have tried, making it easy to hold.&lt;br /&gt;The Konjac Sponge makes my face feel fabulous, like I have just gotten a facial. It feels so invigorated! It feels so good, I look forward to washing my face! If I plan to be away from home overnight, I take my Konjac Sponge with me!&lt;br /&gt;Taking care of the sponge is easy too.  It simply has to be rinsed and gently pressed between your hands to squeeze out the excess water. Simply hang it up by the attached string to dry between uses. The only negative thought I have about this sponge is that it doesn&#x27;t include a little hook to hang it like I have seen with similar products. It is easily remedied with any little suction cup hook from the dollar store or a command strip hook, but it would just be nice to have it included.&lt;br /&gt;The Konjac sponge should be replaced about every 4 - 6 weeks, but it is 100% biodegradable. You can compost it right out in your compost pile or even in your garden if you wish.e about this sponge is that it doesn&#x27;t include a little hook to hang it like I have seen with similar products.

            <li> I am a huge fan of Konjac sponges and this is no exception. I have used quite a few sponges (some charcoal, some original) and this one is one of my favorites. It&#x27;s large enough that you can keep it in your hand and clean your face without any issues. It is a sponge. I typically use it to rinse of my face masks or to just exfoliate in the morning and it makes my face super soft and clean. It is kind of small but that works great for cleaning the small areas of your face like between the nose and cheek. If you are looking for a sponge for your bathroom, this is the one!</li>
