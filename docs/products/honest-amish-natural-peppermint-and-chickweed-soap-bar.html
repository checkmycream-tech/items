            <li>If you want natural products for your beard or body, give Honest Amish a try before anything else.</li>
            <li>These guys rock I&#x27;ve bought 4 more bars since they really last a long time great smell too .</li>
            <li>My wife and daughter both have dropped using their old soap and LOVE this one.</li>
            <li>This bar of soap has a great smell and you actually feel clean without a feeling that there is still residue left on your body.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this soap!!</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin smooth and hair silky soft.</li>
            <li>Will be getting some more in the future.</li>
            <li>Most importantly it won&#x27;t dry out your beard if you use it to wash your face.</li>
            <li>Its a large block that I cut into 4 manageable pieces.  </li>
            <li>and I really like the way it helps my beard.</li>
            <li>It does not seem to have as much scent as other natural soaps I&#x27;ve use, but it does lather nicely and seems to hold up well.</li>
            <li>Scent could be a little stronger, otherwise I enjoyed this soap very much.</li>
            <li>Edit, i had broken it in half and each piece lasted about 2 weeks a piece,.im buying more great stuff.</li>
            <li>I mainly use it for my beard</li>
            <li>its a big square, that i have cut into 4 pieces, so for the price it will last awhile for sure</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin (and yes, a beard!)</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>, i would reorder this product again and recommend it to anyone looking to step up their beard game, or just looking for a good handmade soap bar</li>
            <li>Leaves my beard clean and ready to oil without dry my skin or the facial hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always looking for more natural alternatives to typical, domestic products and this soap is a winner.</li>
            <li>like the idea that it natural and organic.</li>
            <li>this was all natural.</li>
            <li>This so-called soap completely sucked ..</li>
            <li>Leaves no residue and does NOT dry my skin at all!  </li>
