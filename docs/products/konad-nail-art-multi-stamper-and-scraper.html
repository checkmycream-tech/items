    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>When I did get it to transfer to the stamper it did a real nice job.</li>
            <li>and it great</li>
            <li>I do love the control both sides of the stamper provide and it stamps perfectly.</li>
            <li>I read nothing but good things about this one</li>
            <li>Works great, Love it.</li>
            <li>and well I am loving it.</li>
            <li>Great buy and much more affordable on amazon than on the Konad website :)</li>
            <li>(It, by the way worked just fine for her!)</li>
            <li>I have been watching more videos, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy it again, but it works well</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve enjoyed playing around with all of my image plates.  </li>
            <li>Love that it comes with a holder.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I could use more practice too and more plates.  </li>
            <li>I would probably be better off getting a separate blade because at times I get the excess polish that is scraped off on my hand while stamping.</li>
            <li>Love it will be using it often.</li>
            <li>I have ended up with a hand covered in polish more often than not.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m just so excited!</li>
            <li>so I am hoping I am not disappointed!</li>
            <li>The stampers work great on both ends, they pick up the paint far better than my non konad stampers.</li>
            <li>Very cool item.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nice to not have to switch items in your hand since the special polish dries so quickly.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the stamper picking up, it works just fine.</li>
            <li>This is the best thing ever shipping came less then a week</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving it so far, Since The metal scraper is attached to the stamper</li>
            <li>This seems to get the job done fairly easily as long as the plate is good quality.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Should you already have another scraper the attached scraper actually does help you hold onto the stamper more easily and steadily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not really, but still handy.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s my first stamper</li>
            <li>When I first tried this I was a beginner</li>
            <li>it really work for me.</li>
            <li>I find it much easier to scrape and then transfer image to applicator with this than when the scraper is separate.</li>
            <li>I really like this Konad scraper stamper two in one with the stand.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen others really complain about this problem, so</li>
            <li>They were just the original separate double ended stamper and the scraper.</li>
            <li>Also, I thought that the scraper might get in the way, but it&#x27;s super convenient especially with the groove placement.</li>
            <li>it finally was the whole picture on my nail!  </li>
            <li>The one and only thing I dislike is that after scraping I have to be very careful to steer clear of touching the wet polish all over the scraper.</li>
            <li>It took me a few tries to master these stamper but overall very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Having the two sizes is nice, larger size for your whole nail design or the small size for just using a small design.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot easier and less messy! :)</li>

            <li> Scrapping and stamping really takes practice, make sure you let your base color dry completely before stamping.</li>

            <li> It does get a little messy and the stamping polish gets stuck in the area around the blade.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few issues with this stamper transferring from the plate to the stamp.</li>
            <li> I wanted to have the green detail stamper because the set I bought didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I had a stamper and scraper that were separate, but having them together cuts time in half for doing my nails!</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is in my error or not.</li>
            <li> ; hates the smell of me doing my nails, but it&#x27;s hard to stop when you have this thing.</li>
            <li> either way I&#x27;d rather use the desperate scraper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> I assumed that the holder and razor and stamper in one would be a little easier to use. It&#x27;s not really, but still handy. I have been watching more videos, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy it again, but it works well and it&#x27;s my first stamper so I&#x27;m just so excited! Having the two sizes is nice, larger size for your whole nail design or the small size for just using a small design. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the stamper picking up, it works just fine.</li>
            <li> I was afraid I would receive an imitation of the Konad Stamper and Scraper (&amp;#34;faux-nad&amp;#34;) but this is the real deal.  It works just as it is supposed to and I&#x27;ve enjoyed playing around with all of my image plates.  However, if I could go back I would buy the set that has the scraper separate from the stamper.  After scraping off the excess polish there is a lot left on the scraper and it sometimes ends up all over my hands while I&#x27;m getting the image off of the image plate and stamping it on my nail.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous to purchase this stamper as a read some of the reviews. I still took the risk to purchase this and well I am loving it. it really work for me. I do recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works great, Love it.</li>
            <li> Both sides work well; on Konad plates and Wistonia plates alike. As others said it is a little messy with the scrapper there but it&#x27;s nice to not have to switch items in your hand since the special polish dries so quickly.</li>
            <li> When I first tried this I was a beginner so I odn&#x27;t know if that has something to do with it.  But the picture that i had will not transfer over onto my nail until the 3rd or 4th try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally when I pressed hard enough to go through my finger it finally was the whole picture on my nail!  Eureka!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. I tried several times with different nail polish and never picked up the designs from cheeky plates 2012. Going back.  Even buffed it to improve grip. but did not work.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing ever shipping came less then a week and it great so now I don&#x27;t have to worry about losing my stamper when I am scraping</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few issues with this stamper transferring from the plate to the stamp. I am not sure if it is in my error or not. When I did get it to transfer to the stamper it did a real nice job.</li>
            <li> Very cool item.  It took me a few tries to master these stamper but overall very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Love that it comes with a holder.  I find it much easier to scrape and then transfer image to applicator with this than when the scraper is separate.</li>
            <li> Cannot wait to give this a whirl. I bought 3 stamping plates and needed the stamper. I read nothing but good things about this one so I am hoping I am not disappointed!</li>
            <li> I had a stamper and scraper that were separate, but having them together cuts time in half for doing my nails! Great buy and much more affordable on amazon than on the Konad website :)</li>
            <li> The stampers work great on both ends, they pick up the paint far better than my non konad stampers. Also, I thought that the scraper might get in the way, but it&#x27;s super convenient especially with the groove placement. My fianc&amp;eacute; hates the smell of me doing my nails, but it&#x27;s hard to stop when you have this thing.</li>
            <li> I really like this Konad scraper stamper two in one with the stand.It&#x27;s a lot easier and less messy! :)</li>
            <li> Great product! Came on time too. I&#x27;m loving it so far, Since The metal scraper is attached to the stamper it&#x27;s easier to use</li>
            <li> This seems to get the job done fairly easily as long as the plate is good quality.  I&#x27;m sure I could use more practice too and more plates.  It does get a little messy and the stamping polish gets stuck in the area around the blade.  I would probably be better off getting a separate blade because at times I get the excess polish that is scraped off on my hand while stamping.</li>
            <li> This stamper is so convenient dont have to worry about the stamper rolling away while stamping. Love it will be using it often.</li>
            <li> I received the Double stamper and scrapper but it was not what is depicted on the picture. It was konad brand and still works well. They were just the original separate double ended stamper and the scraper. Scrapping and stamping really takes practice, make sure you let your base color dry completely before stamping.</li>
            <li> I bought this after having seen it being used in a favourite vlogger&#x27;s video. (It, by the way worked just fine for her!) I wanted to have the green detail stamper because the set I bought didn&#x27;t. I do love the control both sides of the stamper provide and it stamps perfectly. The one and only thing I dislike is that after scraping I have to be very careful to steer clear of touching the wet polish all over the scraper. I have ended up with a hand covered in polish more often than not. I haven&#x27;t seen others really complain about this problem, so it&#x27;s probably just me and how I hold it, but either way I&#x27;d rather use the desperate scraper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should you already have another scraper the attached scraper actually does help you hold onto the stamper more easily and steadily.</li>
