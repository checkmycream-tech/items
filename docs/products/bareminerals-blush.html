            <li>Very nice product.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, and a good color.  </li>
            <li>I pick up the tiniest amount on my brush making sure to work the powder into the bristles well (swirling the brush in the cap works great) before applying it to my cheeks.  </li>
            <li>Pinker than I would have liked but good consistency.</li>
            <li>A wonderful coverup and lasts a decent length of time until refill needed.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it does not irritate, but blends perfectly giving a nice healthy bit of blush.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s nice to know that I can purchase the ones I love elsewhere.  </li>

            <li>Used this product for years and love it.</li>
            <li>and it gives my skin a luminous healthy glow.  </li>
            <li>this blush adds the perfect amount of color and makes my skin look younger and also helps me look well rested.  </li>
            <li>I love this brand and this shade.  </li>
            <li>My favorite color blush from my favorite make up brand.</li>
            <li>good color pigment, but still natural looking and easy to apply with good brush.  </li>
            <li>I have blonde hair and fair skin, and this is a good blush color for me.</li>
            <li>Works great on my skin type which is very sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge BM fan, but I don&#x27;t use the original mineral powder foundation because there isn&#x27;t a suitable color for my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>Blends easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s weightless and washes off so easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to adjust level of color.</li>
            <li>Beauty is the perfect everyday shade because it suits so many skin tones.  </li>
            <li>This blush is really great, I have used bare minerals now for almost10 years and will not use anything.  </li>
            <li>; goes smoothly and stays all day.</li>
            <li>They pick up the perfect amount of product and the application is never streaky or uneven.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a universal color in my opinion, and looks great on all skin tones.  </li>
            <li>However, the new Bare Skin serum foundation is wonderful and gives me an even, satin finish that wears well all day.  </li>
            <li>Never been much of a blush person, but I&#x27;m glad I took the leap.</li>
            <li>This is the only blush i have found to look good on me.</li>
            <li>Good to know that I can get it on Amazon and for about the same price as in the store.  </li>
            <li>It only takes the tiniest bit to produce a nice, smooth, natural-looking colour.</li>
            <li>I have several BM blushes and love them all, however, I use Beauty the most.  </li>
            <li>I got this in the colour &#x27;Beauty&#x27;, and it does indeed work beautifully against my pale skin.</li>
            <li>blue based so it suits warm and cool skin tones as well as neutral ones like mine.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is a little pricey, but great quality.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li>goes on easy, so natural looking and stays on all day.  </li>
            <li>Here in Texas where is hot and humid</li>
            <li>It takes a very small amount of this powder to get a great result so the container lasts forever.  </li>
            <li>I really like that you can tap out</li>
            <li>The container is also very sturdy.  </li>
            <li>Very affordable.</li>
            <li>I always feel like I end up with too much blush and my cheeks end up pinker than I&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t wear it every day, I do use it very often and it only takes a little bit to give a nice flush.  </li>
            <li>exactly how much powder you are going to use and then lock it back up.  </li>
            <li>I apply this blush to the apples of my cheeks and it gives me a very fresh, wide awake look.  </li>
            <li>I really like the color of Bare Minerals Blush in Beauty, but the color is a bit darker than what I normally wear.</li>
            <li>I really like the BM blush brushes and I have collected several over the years.  </li>
            <li>This color can be used for any skin tone, between a pink and rose , very pretty, Of course if you don&#x27;t like loose powder blush, its not for you, but knowing it is natural and won&#x27;t have a negative effect on skin is enough for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;VE BEEN USING BARE MINERALS FOR YEARS.  </li>
            <li>Bare Escentuals</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve not tried this then go with one of those offers that gets you several basic start up products in one set.</li>
            <li>I have light skin (but not fair)</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this shade and BM blushes in general.  </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this shade and BM blushes in general.  </li>
            <li>Natural look, lasts a long time, even on oily skin.  </li>
            <li>Will continue to purchase Bare Mineral products--just wish they would bring back the &amp;#34;heaven&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten older, blush has become an absolute necessity because as we age, the skin loses some of its color and</li>
            <li>The finish is matte but not flat</li>

            <li> Works great on my skin type which is very sensitive.  A wonderful coverup and lasts a decent length of time until refill needed.</li>
            <li> Very nice product.; goes smoothly and stays all day. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Never been much of a blush person, but I&#x27;m glad I took the leap. This stuff is a little pricey, but great quality. I also purchased a cheaper, lighter cream-based blush at the same time to compare and it doesn&#x27;t even come close. I got this in the colour &#x27;Beauty&#x27;, and it does indeed work beautifully against my pale skin. It only takes the tiniest bit to produce a nice, smooth, natural-looking colour. Blends easily. I imagine this container will last me quite a long time.</li>
            <li> This is the same product that I had purchased at a local store which later went out of business. Glad that I could find it online. I have blonde hair and fair skin, and this is a good blush color for me.</li>
            <li> I really like that you can tap out exactly how much powder you are going to use and then lock it back up.  I hate it when lush spills everywhere.  I have been using this blush for a few weeks and I find that it stays on my face all day.  The container is also very sturdy.  I will buy this blush again.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, and a good color.  Natural look, lasts a long time, even on oily skin.  Will continue to purchase Bare Mineral products--just wish they would bring back the &amp;#34;heaven&amp;#34; blush--it was the perfect color for my skin tone.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this make up for years and I love it. It&#x27;s weightless and washes off so easily. Doesn&#x27;t stain your washcloths if you rinse well too. Very affordable. If you&#x27;ve not tried this then go with one of those offers that gets you several basic start up products in one set. I&#x27;ll never go back to regular make up.</li>
            <li> good color pigment, but still natural looking and easy to apply with good brush.  Easy to adjust level of color.</li>
            <li> Bare Escentuals what else is there to comment on! Love the brand, I confess i have slept in the makeup and it never causes a break out and it is not on your pillow in the morning</li>
            <li> Very wonderful and beautiful blush.  Makes your cheek orgasmic glowing pink.  This is the only blush i have found to look good on me.</li>
            <li> I really like the color of Bare Minerals Blush in Beauty, but the color is a bit darker than what I normally wear. Beauty is a very bright pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that this blush is a loose powder, but I guess I&#x27;m not good enough at getting just a little bit on my brush.

            <li> I have had my Beauty blush for years and have yet to use it up.  While I don&#x27;t wear it every day, I do use it very often and it only takes a little bit to give a nice flush.  I have light skin (but not fair) and I think that Beauty is a color that anyone can wear.  It&#x27;s pink but not blue based so it suits warm and cool skin tones as well as neutral ones like mine.  I&#x27;m not sure that Bare Minerals even makes Beauty anymore.  I was recently in Sephora and I don&#x27;t think I saw it as one of the options.  Good to know that I can get it on Amazon and for about the same price as in the store.  BM blushes last all day with hardly a touch up and the color doesn&#x27;t change, even though I have oily skin.  The finish is matte but not flat and it gives my skin a luminous healthy glow.  Beauty is the perfect everyday shade because it suits so many skin tones.  It takes a very small amount of this powder to get a great result so the container lasts forever.  I really like the BM blush brushes and I have collected several over the years.  They pick up the perfect amount of product and the application is never streaky or uneven.  I apply this blush to the apples of my cheeks and it gives me a very fresh, wide awake look.  As I&#x27;ve gotten older, blush has become an absolute necessity because as we age, the skin loses some of its color and this blush adds the perfect amount of color and makes my skin look younger and also helps me look well rested.  I&#x27;m a huge BM fan, but I don&#x27;t use the original mineral powder foundation because there isn&#x27;t a suitable color for my skin tone.  However, the new Bare Skin serum foundation is wonderful and gives me an even, satin finish that wears well all day.  It&#x27;s just another great BM product.  I have several BM blushes and love them all, however, I use Beauty the most.  It&#x27;s a universal color in my opinion, and looks great on all skin tones.  This blush is almost pure pigment so a little bit goes a long, long way.  I pick up the tiniest amount on my brush making sure to work the powder into the bristles well (swirling the brush in the cap works great) before applying it to my cheeks.  I&#x27;m so happy I can find this color on Amazon.  I do have a back up but as soon as I need another one, I now know where to go.  Unfortunately, BM seems to discontinue shades very frequently so it&#x27;s nice to know that I can purchase the ones I love elsewhere.  I definitely recommend this shade and BM blushes in general.  They&#x27;re definitely worth every penny.sh making sure to work the powder into the bristles well (swirling the brush in the cap works great) before applying it to my cheeks.

They&#x27;re definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> goes on easy, so natural looking and stays on all day.  I love this brand and this shade.  So do others as it is sometimes hard to find at retail.</li>
            <li> Pinker than I would have liked but good consistency.</li>
            <li> My favorite color blush from my favorite make up brand. Win!</li>
