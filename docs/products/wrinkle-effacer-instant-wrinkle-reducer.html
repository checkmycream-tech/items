            <li>Great for under eyes before going out for the evening</li>
            <li>, it is great.</li>

            <li>and I&#x27;m sure you will order again too!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>really liked it and  </li>
            <li>Nothing is a magic cure all, but this is a good product and does what it claims.</li>
            <li>however It does reduce eye line wrinkles effectively.  </li>
            <li>I was so impressed that I shared my first order and the re-ordered so that I would have more on hand.  </li>
            <li>I worked a full stressful day and when I would use the ladies room would check my face and still looked great.</li>
            <li>wait until you have all your makeup ON and then use a drop or two of wrinkle magic on the very top.  </li>
            <li>It is a great quick fix.</li>
            <li>Very strong scent.</li>
            <li>Make sure you mix in the wrinkle magic in to your skin real good before it dries and always start with the anti redness cream under and around your eyes first.</li>
            <li>this is by far the best product of its type on the market, ladies don&#x27;t hesitate.  </li>
            <li>but you won&#x27;t find anything as effective as wrinkle magic.  </li>
            <li>best on bare skin, no moisturizer either.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>I see many people and they do not believe my age.  </li>
            <li>The more one uses, the tighter the it gets, though; so be forewarned.</li>
            <li>THis is the next best thing to plastic surgery.  </li>
            <li>I need moisture and concealment more than tightening, so I gave it to a friend to experiment with.</li>
            <li>I have medium, European complexion and this matches my skin perfectly.  </li>
            <li>When I go out, I put a dab of Aveeno Creme and Wrinkle Magic under both of my eyes.</li>
            <li>Then you leave it on for 3 minutes without touching it.</li>
            <li>I am shopping for a better price now but cannot find it.</li>
            <li>Better buy it.</li>
            <li>I love this product and carry a tube in my purse, as well as having it at home.</li>
            <li>I love it .</li>
            <li>Wrinkle Magic has been a life saver for me.  </li>
            <li>and I feel better about myself when I do go out.  </li>
            <li>Works fabulously!</li>
            <li>I have used many products over the years.</li>
            <li>It tightens to smooth out my under eye area and is amazing.</li>
            <li>I have tried it many times and IT DID NOT REDUCER MY EYE BAGS AND WRINKLES.  </li>
            <li>Get more wrinkles after putting on the face.</li>
            <li>Ok Ladies.</li>
            <li>This is the best instant line and wrinkle reducer, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of them.</li>
            <li>will order more when this tube is gone.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t write many reviews</li>
            <li>I would not leave home without  my wrinkle magic  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fabulous!</li>
            <li>Avon has a face primer that blurs the wrinkles for about 10.00- works better than this one.</li>
            <li>It does help eyes look more awake after a mostly sleepless night.</li>
            <li>the Wrinkle Magic was applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She had told me that the Wrinkle Magic worked for her…until one day when we went out for lunch.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many products to reduce the appearance of wrinkles and even puffiness under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t care now that I can get it here for a better price and quicker delivery......</li>
            <li>Try it,  you will be so glad.  </li>
            <li>I love the product but will find it at a lower price</li>
            <li>Perfect to camouflage those fine lines above your lip!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it!!</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick, and I liked the price.</li>
            <li>Best unknown product on the market -</li>
            <li>And such a good price too!</li>
            <li>It is fantastic.</li>
            <li>And being that it&#x27;s tinted it already acts as a light concealer.</li>
            <li>Lines smooth, bags gone.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>I am a natural redhead and have fair skin.</li>
            <li>It usually last for a good 8 hrs.</li>
            <li>A true miracle.</li>
            <li>This creme has been a true miracle for me.</li>
            <li>Wrinkle Magic really works.  </li>
            <li>(I know for I have a basket full)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many instant wrinkle reducers and have been allergic to all but wrinkle magic.  </li>
            <li>Around the eyes and above the top lip started looking dry and any fine lines were much more prominent.  </li>
            <li>C Great for the dark circles too!.  </li>
            <li>I put it on over my foundation, lightly dab it gently to blend.  </li>
            <li>It instantly erases the wrinkles, though not permanently...that would be nice.</li>
            <li>worth 40.00.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I love wrinkle magic, I&#x27;ve tried many different instant wrinkle removers but not one worked even close to how well this does.  </li>
            <li>I use it under my eyes, on my forehead between my eyes, and on my smile lines.</li>
            <li>I have purchased three so far and plan to buying more when I need it.  </li>
            <li>there is a trick to the success of how it works.  </li>
            <li>I am very glad that someone suggested it to me it is worth the sometimes 3 tries.</li>
            <li>I wear it everyday and the results are remarkable.</li>
            <li>Now I want to assure you that I use a miniscule amount of the product, because I understand that in skin products…less generally gives better results, and I still ended up with that whitish flakey ring around whatever area</li>
            <li>It also shipped super fast.</li>
            <li>I passed this tube of Wrinkle Magic to a younger friend with beautiful skin, no dry skin issues, and at this stage, all she has is some minor lines on her forehead, and the beginning of crow’s feet, around the corners of her eyes.  </li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t need very much.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.  </li>
            <li>I like the product very much</li>
            <li>But if this review helps someone else narrow their search for the right product, I will rest easy :) .</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have written a review on Amazon</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several wrinkle creams to no avail until I discovered wrinkle magic.</li>
            <li>The first one lasted over a year.</li>
            <li>Not sure whether people have found a better way to use the Wrinkle Magic</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was working but after applying my moisturizer it flaked off and had to wash my face.</li>
            <li>When I first applied it, I could feel it tightening my skin; and yes, the wrinkles were gone.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s never failed me.  </li>
            <li>Wrinkle Magic Instant Wrinkle Reducer does not work.  </li>
            <li>I first purchased it on a shopping network and then found it here as the network stopped offering it.</li>
            <li>I really like the way it works to give you a finished appearance!</li>
            <li>Better than Genie that leaves white residue everywhere.</li>
            <li>If you use it first your makeup and moisturizer willl &amp;#34;dilute the product and it can&#x27;t tighten the skin as well.  </li>
            <li>Much easier to work with!</li>
            <li>Therefore, in conclusion, maybe it may work for some women, but definitely not for me with dry skin, and not for my younger friend who has perfect skin.</li>
            <li>I have been spending $29.99 on another product and this product works just as good if not better.</li>
            <li>When first applied, after three or four minutes of holding my face expressionless, my skin looked amazing and tight.  </li>
            <li>So many products promise wrinkle reducer but never live up to their hype.</li>
            <li>and now that I&#x27;m a &amp;#34;woman of a certain age,&amp;#34; those circles have morphed into purple pouches.</li>
            <li>Does little for fine lines and tiny wrinkles; the tint is nice however.</li>
            <li>Therefore, in conclusion, maybe it may work for some women, but definitely not for me with dry skin, and not for my younger friend who has perfect skin.flakey white areas, and those fine lines were completely visible.  </li>
            <li>It really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>I work in a smoky casino, and it lasts through my whole shift.</li>
            <li>Just experiment with however much you need.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>It really work&#x27;s on the wrinkles,,,,,,,,,,  would buy again......</li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t get too much rest.</li>
            <li>Once you learn how to use it, it really does the job.l  </li>
            <li>At times, if it dries too fast, I just dab a dot of water and pat.</li>
            <li>The two products really work wonders together</li>
            <li>This really does make a difference.</li>
            <li>This is a product that I buy as soon as I am about ready to run out.  </li>
            <li>but with a point on one end and a circle on the other (made with pressed cotton) - You will love this product</li>
            <li>Got home 10 hours later and my face looked as fresh as the morning!</li>
            <li>I have never had much luck with this type of product, and if they should work for even 2 hours, I would give a decent rating.  </li>
            <li>I do however put it on top of the IT cosmetics &amp;#34; bye bye redness&amp;#34; cream which covers my dark circles around my eyes.</li>
            <li>The less you use the better the results.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend mixing with you</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT FOR ANYONE.  </li>
            <li>The trick is to put very little on and make sure you shake the tube really well before you apply.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t live without them.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>This product does not do what it says unless you glob it on and then you are left with huge white patches.</li>
            <li>and so it lasts forever.. makes for a very natural appearance</li>
            <li>put my makeup on then put a small amount of wrinkle magic over my makeup.</li>
            <li>Had bought this product in the past and I love it and will buy it again</li>
            <li>I had tried the Wrinkle Magic several times and in several different ways using both liquid foundation and mineral powder foundation.  </li>
            <li>Purchased this product based on great overall ratings from other purchasers but quite honestly I&#x27;m underwhelmed, as compared to experience with &#x27;Wunderlift&#x27; product (which has very few and relatively unfavorable ratings, oddly, on Amazon).  </li>
            <li>I recently demonstrated the (half face) effectiveness for my sister and now she is buying Wrinkle Magic as well.</li>
            <li>THis is the only under eye \\&quot;instant\\&quot; firming creme that is tinted slightly, and looks the most natural.</li>
            <li>be the clear, pen like applicator.</li>
            <li>(I fan my face with something) - don&#x27;t use too much or it will appear white - use a makeup stick to apply (looks like a q-tip)</li>
            <li>old &amp; work</li>
            <li>I think what determines whether you like it or not is your natural skin tone.  </li>
            <li>I am 50 years old.</li>
            <li>Covers circles under eyes and does tighten early morning bags under the eyes.</li>
            <li>and I like it thus far..</li>
            <li>This is the only product that doesn&#x27;t curdle as much.</li>
            <li>(56 yr old for a refence)</li>
            <li>There on both corners of her eyes and on her forehead were telltale signs of slightly flakey white areas, and those fine lines were completely visible.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle  but a little help please for a special occasion....</li>
            <li>I am not sure if I have just too many wrinkles or  this product should be used for a younger group of woman...</li>
            <li>Start off with just a dab or two, let dry for the 3 minutes, then if you&#x27;re puffiness isn&#x27;t gone..put a little more on.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend using the two products as you will look about 20 years younger.</li>
            <li>I gave her the small mirror I keep in my handbag, and told her to face the light from the window.  </li>
            <li>I have major problems with insomnia.</li>
            <li>I was surprised with the instant results...</li>
            <li>I have tried it on freshly cleansed skin that has completely dried, before any serum or moisturizer product.  </li>
            <li>Wrinkle Magic really makes me look a lot less tired</li>
            <li>I dab a very small amount just under my eyes and hold very still for about 2 minutes and you will look like you&#x27;ve just had your eyes done!!!</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT REALLY HIDES THE DARK CIRLES UNDER MY EYES.  </li>
            <li>As long as you don&#x27;t use too much, it&#x27;s really natural looking.</li>
            <li>It is a little tricky to put on, but when you figure it out it really works.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Wrinkle Magic has been a life saver for me.  </li>
            <li> and I feel better about myself when I do go out.  </li>
            <li> Works fabulously!</li>
            <li> I have used many products over the years.</li>
            <li> It tightens to smooth out my under eye area and is amazing.</li>
            <li> I have tried it many times and IT DID NOT REDUCER MY EYE BAGS AND WRINKLES.  </li>
            <li> Get more wrinkles after putting on the face.</li>
            <li> Ok Ladies.</li>
            <li> This is the best instant line and wrinkle reducer, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of them.</li>
            <li> will order more when this tube is gone.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews</li>
            <li> I would not leave home without  my wrinkle magic  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fabulous!</li>
            <li> Avon has a face primer that blurs the wrinkles for about 10.00- works better than this one.</li>
            <li> It does help eyes look more awake after a mostly sleepless night.</li>
            <li> the Wrinkle Magic was applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She had told me that the Wrinkle Magic worked for her…until one day when we went out for lunch.  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many products to reduce the appearance of wrinkles and even puffiness under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t care now that I can get it here for a better price and quicker delivery......</li>
            <li> Try it,  you will be so glad.  </li>
            <li> I love the product but will find it at a lower price</li>
            <li> Perfect to camouflage those fine lines above your lip!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it!!</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick, and I liked the price.</li>
            <li> Best unknown product on the market -</li>
            <li> And such a good price too!</li>
            <li> It is fantastic.</li>
            <li> And being that it&#x27;s tinted it already acts as a light concealer.</li>
            <li> Lines smooth, bags gone.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> I am a natural redhead and have fair skin.</li>
            <li> It usually last for a good 8 hrs.</li>
            <li> A true miracle.</li>
            <li> This creme has been a true miracle for me.</li>
            <li> Wrinkle Magic really works.  </li>
            <li> (I know for I have a basket full)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many instant wrinkle reducers and have been allergic to all but wrinkle magic.  </li>
            <li> Around the eyes and above the top lip started looking dry and any fine lines were much more prominent.  </li>
            <li> C Great for the dark circles too!.  </li>
            <li> I put it on over my foundation, lightly dab it gently to blend.  </li>
            <li> It instantly erases the wrinkles, though not permanently...that would be nice.</li>
            <li> worth 40.00.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I love wrinkle magic, I&#x27;ve tried many different instant wrinkle removers but not one worked even close to how well this does.  </li>
            <li> I use it under my eyes, on my forehead between my eyes, and on my smile lines.</li>
            <li> I have purchased three so far and plan to buying more when I need it.  </li>
            <li> there is a trick to the success of how it works.  </li>
            <li> I am very glad that someone suggested it to me it is worth the sometimes 3 tries.</li>
            <li> I wear it everyday and the results are remarkable.</li>
            <li> Now I want to assure you that I use a miniscule amount of the product, because I understand that in skin products…less generally gives better results, and I still ended up with that whitish flakey ring around whatever area</li>
            <li> It also shipped super fast.</li>
            <li> I passed this tube of Wrinkle Magic to a younger friend with beautiful skin, no dry skin issues, and at this stage, all she has is some minor lines on her forehead, and the beginning of crow’s feet, around the corners of her eyes.  </li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t need very much.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.  </li>
            <li> I like the product very much</li>
            <li> But if this review helps someone else narrow their search for the right product, I will rest easy :) .</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have written a review on Amazon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several wrinkle creams to no avail until I discovered wrinkle magic.</li>
            <li> The first one lasted over a year.</li>
            <li> Not sure whether people have found a better way to use the Wrinkle Magic</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was working but after applying my moisturizer it flaked off and had to wash my face.</li>
            <li> When I first applied it, I could feel it tightening my skin; and yes, the wrinkles were gone.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s never failed me.  </li>
            <li> Wrinkle Magic Instant Wrinkle Reducer does not work.  </li>
            <li> I first purchased it on a shopping network and then found it here as the network stopped offering it.</li>
            <li> I really like the way it works to give you a finished appearance!</li>
            <li> Better than Genie that leaves white residue everywhere.</li>
            <li> If you use it first your makeup and moisturizer willl &amp;#34;dilute the product and it can&#x27;t tighten the skin as well.  </li>
            <li> Much easier to work with!</li>
            <li> Therefore, in conclusion, maybe it may work for some women, but definitely not for me with dry skin, and not for my younger friend who has perfect skin.</li>
            <li> I have been spending $29.99 on another product and this product works just as good if not better.</li>
            <li> When first applied, after three or four minutes of holding my face expressionless, my skin looked amazing and tight.  </li>
            <li> So many products promise wrinkle reducer but never live up to their hype.</li>
            <li> and now that I&#x27;m a &amp;#34;woman of a certain age,&amp;#34; those circles have morphed into purple pouches.</li>
            <li> Does little for fine lines and tiny wrinkles; the tint is nice however.</li>
            <li> Therefore, in conclusion, maybe it may work for some women, but definitely not for me with dry skin, and not for my younger friend who has perfect skin.flakey white areas, and those fine lines were completely visible.  </li>
            <li> It really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I work in a smoky casino, and it lasts through my whole shift.</li>
            <li> Just experiment with however much you need.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> It really work&#x27;s on the wrinkles,,,,,,,,,,  would buy again......</li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t get too much rest.</li>
            <li> Once you learn how to use it, it really does the job.l  </li>
            <li> At times, if it dries too fast, I just dab a dot of water and pat.</li>
            <li> The two products really work wonders together</li>
            <li> This really does make a difference.</li>
            <li> This is a product that I buy as soon as I am about ready to run out.  </li>
            <li> but with a point on one end and a circle on the other (made with pressed cotton) - You will love this product</li>
            <li> Got home 10 hours later and my face looked as fresh as the morning!</li>
            <li> I have never had much luck with this type of product, and if they should work for even 2 hours, I would give a decent rating.  </li>
            <li> I do however put it on top of the IT cosmetics &amp;#34; bye bye redness&amp;#34; cream which covers my dark circles around my eyes.</li>
            <li> The less you use the better the results.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend mixing with you</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT FOR ANYONE.  </li>
            <li> The trick is to put very little on and make sure you shake the tube really well before you apply.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t live without them.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> This product does not do what it says unless you glob it on and then you are left with huge white patches.</li>
            <li> and so it lasts forever.. makes for a very natural appearance</li>
            <li> put my makeup on then put a small amount of wrinkle magic over my makeup.</li>
            <li> Had bought this product in the past and I love it and will buy it again</li>
            <li> I had tried the Wrinkle Magic several times and in several different ways using both liquid foundation and mineral powder foundation.  </li>
            <li> Purchased this product based on great overall ratings from other purchasers but quite honestly I&#x27;m underwhelmed, as compared to experience with &#x27;Wunderlift&#x27; product (which has very few and relatively unfavorable ratings, oddly, on Amazon).  </li>
            <li> I recently demonstrated the (half face) effectiveness for my sister and now she is buying Wrinkle Magic as well.</li>
            <li> THis is the only under eye \\&quot;instant\\&quot; firming creme that is tinted slightly, and looks the most natural.</li>
            <li> be the clear, pen like applicator.</li>
            <li> (I fan my face with something) - don&#x27;t use too much or it will appear white - use a makeup stick to apply (looks like a q-tip)</li>
            <li> old &amp; work</li>
            <li> I think what determines whether you like it or not is your natural skin tone.  </li>
            <li> I am 50 years old.</li>
            <li> Covers circles under eyes and does tighten early morning bags under the eyes.</li>
            <li> and I like it thus far..</li>
            <li> This is the only product that doesn&#x27;t curdle as much.</li>
            <li> (56 yr old for a refence)</li>
            <li> There on both corners of her eyes and on her forehead were telltale signs of slightly flakey white areas, and those fine lines were completely visible.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle  but a little help please for a special occasion....</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I have just too many wrinkles or  this product should be used for a younger group of woman...</li>
            <li> Start off with just a dab or two, let dry for the 3 minutes, then if you&#x27;re puffiness isn&#x27;t gone..put a little more on.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend using the two products as you will look about 20 years younger.</li>
            <li> I gave her the small mirror I keep in my handbag, and told her to face the light from the window.  </li>
            <li> I have major problems with insomnia.</li>
            <li> I was surprised with the instant results...</li>
            <li> I have tried it on freshly cleansed skin that has completely dried, before any serum or moisturizer product.  </li>
            <li> Wrinkle Magic really makes me look a lot less tired</li>
            <li> I dab a very small amount just under my eyes and hold very still for about 2 minutes and you will look like you&#x27;ve just had your eyes done!!!</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT REALLY HIDES THE DARK CIRLES UNDER MY EYES.  </li>
            <li> As long as you don&#x27;t use too much, it&#x27;s really natural looking.</li>
            <li> It is a little tricky to put on, but when you figure it out it really works.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t use too much or it starts to cake.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems that either too much comes out of the tube, or too little!</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for a few years - it works wonders - just a little dab and tap it on - I make sure I don&#x27;t move my facial muscles for a few minutes</li>
            <li> A very small area of fine lines on my cheek became blotchy and encircled in a white, slightly flakey area.  </li>
            <li> I just place a small amount in palm of my hand and dip my finger in and gently pat it on the problem areas of my face.  </li>
            <li> This is my second order of it, which lasts a very long time.  </li>
            <li> It does reduce the wrinkles under my eyes, but does not reduce it as much as other more expensive products</li>
            <li> I only used it once but not again because it did not do what I expected.</li>
            <li> made be look younger, if only for a little while.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, so I thought that maybe that could be an issue.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product on a home shopping show and could not live without it.  </li>
            <li> I use it every single day, and one tube lasts about six months.</li>
            <li> It got rid of the wrinkles if you DO NOT MOVE A SINGLE thing on your face.</li>
            <li> but I find it underperforms and leaves a dry, caked look on my face - not what we&#x27;re aiming at, here, people!...  </li>
            <li> only use a small amount, and for me, only use it alone without moisterizer or makeup...</li>
            <li> You have to dab off the excess after it dries, with a make-up remover cleansing towel..simply remove the excess as close to your under-eye lash line as possible, and remove a little at the outer corner, to remove that \\&quot;pulled\\&quot; effect.</li>
            <li> You usually only have to use a little.</li>
            <li> and it only takes a little to get the results you want.</li>
            <li> You only need a little</li>
            <li> The trick with this item is to use as little as possible.  </li>
            <li> I have used it for 5 years and bought a few extra in case it might be discontinued.</li>
            <li> However, the reasons that I gave it so few stars are: it did very little for the puffiness under my eyes; it didn&#x27;t last-within a few hours, the wrinkles were back; it was dry and had a tint to it that that stood out like a sore thumb on my face; and lastly, when I applied moisturizer or makeup (I dabbed it on so that I wouldn&#x27;t distrub the tightened areas), the tightening effect was immediately lost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other skin tighteners but they all tend to curdle if u mix them with an unde eye concealer.</li>
            <li> on time and as expected!</li>
            <li> Not as firming as other products I have tried however do like the fact it is tinted</li>
            <li> IT DOES NOT SEEM TO HELP OTHER WRINKLES.</li>
            <li> Rub a little underneath your eyes and fan to get it to dry.  </li>
            <li> I put a little on before my makeup, let it dry,  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin like water, you don&#x27;t get much and it works a little.</li>
            <li> it is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> No exaggeration when I state that it takes at least ten years off my face.</li>
            <li> If you have olive, or a dark skin tone, it isn&#x27;t going to work for you.</li>
            <li> I have had dark circles under my eyes since I  was a kid</li>
            <li> It takes a little practice with the application..</li>
            <li> I am a caretaker and get little rest</li>
            <li> The container came with just a little product in it.</li>
            <li> I had an eye-lift a few years ago, because I had \\&quot;hooded\\&quot; lids, that were interfering with my eyesight...</li>
            <li> Dried my skin out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years now.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical in trying these kinds of product, causes they usually leave a white residue on the skin, but this one does not, if you use a small to moderate amount.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your $.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work as stated waste of money</li>
            <li> and then it looks scaly and not smooth, but alone</li>
            <li> Use very little at one time.</li>
            <li> No more puffy eyes when I use it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works and am not sure  if I even use it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t firm skin but does leave icky brown residue.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> It used to come with a small purse size tube to carry with you and for some reason I can no longer find that combo.  </li>
            <li> but people kept asking me about the product and would talk (beg) for the small tube.  </li>
            <li> but people say I never look tired - they should only know my secret.</li>
            <li> Takes at least 10 years off my age!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Linda</li>
            <li> Nothing has worked, and each way brought me nothing other than very poor results.  </li>
            <li> I tend to be very skeptical, especially with trying beauty products.</li>
            <li> I find this wrinkle cream very ordinary.</li>
            <li> it does make your skin feel tight but it is weird.  </li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like white Elmer&#x27;s Glue on your face, but an ugly brown Elmer&#x27;s glue.  </li>
            <li> I would send it back if it wouldn&#x27;t be less expensive just to keep - even if I have to throw it in trash :-((  </li>
            <li> NOT HAPPY</li>
            <li> Not happy</li>
            <li> It temporarily removes those awful aging puffs, that make me look so tired, and takes about ten years off my face.  </li>
            <li> (In a way that the infamous Preparation H trick never did.)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great product and not too expensive.</li>
            <li> Do not like, to expensive</li>
            <li> This is a terrible waste of money</li>
            <li> I am 58, and have really bad under eye bags.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed trying to return..</li>
            <li> The package came in an awful condition - the tube was sealed in plastic</li>
            <li> I look absolutely awful without it.</li>
            <li> I find that you cannot use it with makeup liquid or powder it cakes and looks terrible.</li>
            <li> IT WAS EXPENSIVE AND DOES NOT WORK !!!!</li>
            <li> Awful stuff !  </li>
            <li> However, this is probably the worst of the worst.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the first time I have written a review on Amazon but I feel this product is a winner! It instantly erases the wrinkles, though not permanently...that would be nice. I wear it for my under eye wrinkles and forehead wrinkles. I put it on before applying my mineral make-up and it blends well. It usually last for a good 8 hrs. Hope they don&#x27;t stop making this product! The tube is smaller than it looks. I will continue to buy....worth 40.00.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  For me it does everything it says.  No more puffy eyes when I use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several wrinkle creams to no avail until I discovered wrinkle magic. It&#x27;s wonderful! A true miracle. I recommend this product to every woman and/or man who needs help with deep lines.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works and am not sure  if I even use it. The package came in an awful condition - the tube was sealed in plastic but obviously it was  cracked some place because part of the cream was inside the plastic. I would send it back if it wouldn&#x27;t be less expensive just to keep - even if I have to throw it in trash :-((  NOT HAPPY AT ALL</li>
            <li> The best for undereye bags and top lip wrinkles. Would not be without it - just purchased my second tube! The first one lasted over a year. I recently demonstrated the (half face) effectiveness for my sister and now she is buying Wrinkle Magic as well.</li>
            <li> this stuff is like wearing calamine lotion.  it does make your skin feel tight but it is weird.  it is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for a few years - it works wonders - just a little dab and tap it on - I make sure I don&#x27;t move my facial muscles for a few minutes (I fan my face with something) - don&#x27;t use too much or it will appear white - use a makeup stick to apply (looks like a q-tip) but with a point on one end and a circle on the other (made with pressed cotton) - You will love this product</li>
            <li> Temporary tightening of for bags. It lasts all day for me.  It does best without any makeup.  Have used for a couple years</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful.  I&#x27;ve tried many instant wrinkle reducers and have been allergic to all but wrinkle magic.  I&#x27;m 73 yrs. old &amp; work 40 hrs. a week. I see many people and they do not believe my age.  Hooray for Wrinkle Magic!  SG</li>
            <li> Even after reading the instructions and following them, the product does not mix well with liquid foundation and or moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 69 yo fellow who has used this product for about a month now. It is fantastic. No exaggeration when I state that it takes at least ten years off my face. The more one uses, the tighter the it gets, though; so be forewarned. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I started using this product a couple of years ago, when a co-worker let me use some of her&#x27;s to try. I am 58, and have really bad under eye bags. Short of surgery..I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of under eye treatments, including \\&quot;Youthology\\&quot;, which is overpriced, and leaves a white residue. THis is the only under eye \\&quot;instant\\&quot; firming creme that is tinted slightly, and looks the most natural. I have become expert at applying it. You have to dab off the excess after it dries, with a make-up remover cleansing towel..simply remove the excess as close to your under-eye lash line as possible, and remove a little at the outer corner, to remove that \\&quot;pulled\\&quot; effect. Or you can used a dampened Q-tip, to remove the excess under your lower lash line. I use it only under my eyes for the bags.  I had an eye-lift a few years ago, because I had \\&quot;hooded\\&quot; lids, that were interfering with my eyesight... but I didn&#x27;t get the lower bags done, because I didn&#x27;t have the money, and the insurance wouldn&#x27;t pay for it. THis is the next best thing to plastic surgery.  I use it every single day, and one tube lasts about six months. It really makes a difference. It temporarily removes those awful aging puffs, that make me look so tired, and takes about ten years off my face.  This is the only place I can find it now! It takes a little practice with the application..you don&#x27;t need very much. I work in a smoky casino, and it lasts through my whole shift. I look absolutely awful without it. I will be purchasing my 5th tube.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t firm skin but does leave icky brown residue.</li>
            <li> I can feel an immediate tightening feeling, however it doesn&#x27;t cover up circles, and when combined with a concealer, it flakes and rolls off.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s best on bare skin, no moisturizer either. Overall, it doesn&#x27;t suit my needs. I need moisture and concealment more than tightening, so I gave it to a friend to experiment with.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.  I think what determines whether you like it or not is your natural skin tone.  I have medium, European complexion and this matches my skin perfectly.  If you have olive, or a dark skin tone, it isn&#x27;t going to work for you.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of beauty products, but this one? I&#x27;m never going to be without it again. I have had dark circles under my eyes since I  was a kid and now that I&#x27;m a &amp;#34;woman of a certain age,&amp;#34; those circles have morphed into purple pouches. So attractive. Only not. This stuff works. (In a way that the infamous Preparation H trick never did.)</li>
            <li> For the price it worked well</li>
            <li> This product is not for me</li>
            <li> I bought this off of a home shopping network channel. I am 50 years old. I have major problems with insomnia. Therefore, I have those bags under my eyes. This creme has been a true miracle for me. I tend to be very skeptical, especially with trying beauty products. I am a natural redhead and have fair skin. When I go out, I put a dab of Aveeno Creme and Wrinkle Magic under both of my eyes. The creme helps to keep my skin moisturized. Then you leave it on for 3 minutes without touching it. Poof!!The puffiness goes away. Just experiment with however much you need. You usually only have to use a little. Start off with just a dab or two, let dry for the 3 minutes, then if you&#x27;re puffiness isn&#x27;t gone..put a little more on. Simple. I am shopping for a better price now but cannot find it. I even went to the website but it says they are out of stock. This is the only place I can find it now. Better buy it. It&#x27;s worth it!!</li>
            <li> Saw zero difference with use of this product.  Dried my skin out.  Waste of money!</li>
            <li> I love this product and carry a tube in my purse, as well as having it at home. Covers circles under eyes and does tighten early morning bags under the eyes. Use very little at one time. Have shared product with family and friends and will definitely reorder..</li>
            <li> I love it . I wake up with bags !!! But go out without bags .  Tried every product for bags or puffiness ! This is the best I found . Always keep an extra tube as a spare.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  A little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t use too much or it starts to cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does everything it says it does...smooths wrinkles, tightens skin , reduces under eye puffiness, and it does last all day.  I put it on my lids to give me a mini eye lift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product and not too expensive.</li>
            <li> Save your money, I have purchased way cheaper products that actually work. This product does not do what it says unless you glob it on and then you are left with huge white patches.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product based on great overall ratings from other purchasers but quite honestly I&#x27;m underwhelmed, as compared to experience with &#x27;Wunderlift&#x27; product (which has very few and relatively unfavorable ratings, oddly, on Amazon).  Not sure whether people have found a better way to use the Wrinkle Magic but I find it underperforms and leaves a dry, caked look on my face - not what we&#x27;re aiming at, here, people!...  Perhaps different skin types respond to these products in different ways but I would definitely opt for Wunderlift over anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  Not trying to promote one product over another, here; but don&#x27;t want to see people have to toss out tons of money on all the types of products that are out there.  But if this review helps someone else narrow their search for the right product, I will rest easy :) .</li>
            <li> It really work&#x27;s on the wrinkles,,,,,,,,,,  would buy again......</li>
            <li> Love..love..love..my favorite product...thank you!</li>
            <li> I like it very much.  I only put it on my under eye bags and puffiness.  I put it on over my foundation, lightly dab it gently to blend.  It seems to tighten the skin and makes me look younger. I have used it for 5 years and bought a few extra in case it might be discontinued.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin like water, you don&#x27;t get much and it works a little.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was working but after applying my moisturizer it flaked off and had to wash my face. Not good.</li>
            <li> It definitely decreases wrinkles where you apply it.  It is a great quick fix. I used it under my eyes and on my forehead.  People have  remarked on how good my face looks.</li>
            <li> Rub a little underneath your eyes and fan to get it to dry.  The bags underneath your eyes disapear.  You instantly look 10 years younger.  However, there is a lot of competion out there.</li>
            <li> This product received good reviews, so that&#x27;s why I tried it.  When I first applied it, I could feel it tightening my skin; and yes, the wrinkles were gone.  However, the reasons that I gave it so few stars are: it did very little for the puffiness under my eyes; it didn&#x27;t last-within a few hours, the wrinkles were back; it was dry and had a tint to it that that stood out like a sore thumb on my face; and lastly, when I applied moisturizer or makeup (I dabbed it on so that I wouldn&#x27;t distrub the tightened areas), the tightening effect was immediately lost.</li>
            <li> It does reduce the wrinkles under my eyes, but does not reduce it as much as other more expensive products</li>
            <li> Wrinkle Magic has been a life saver for me.  I am a caretaker to my husband with Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease and I really don&#x27;t get too much rest. Wrinkle Magic really makes me look a lot less tired and I feel better about myself when I do go out.  Once you learn how to use it, it really does the job.l  I purchased this product on a home shopping show and could not live without it.  The less you use the better the results.  I dab a pat under each eye and within seconds I look rested.  At times, if it dries too fast, I just dab a dot of water and pat. I am a caretaker and get little rest but people say I never look tired - they should only know my secret.</li>
            <li> It the best product I have used. I use it under my eyes and it looks like I had work done. I have used  it for about four years. Love it!!!!!</li>
            <li> This product truly is &amp;#34;MAGIC&amp;#34;,  It works instantly, and has taken years off my face, especially under my eyes. C Great for the dark circles too!.  Sharon G. Palm Springs, California,</li>
            <li> This product does work, but there are times when I have to redo it 3 times. I find that you cannot use it with makeup liquid or powder it cakes and looks terrible. I am very glad that someone suggested it to me it is worth the sometimes 3 tries. I wish they could make it so it mixes with makeup.</li>
            <li> I only used it once but not again because it did not do what I expected.</li>
            <li> Works fabulously! Send me about 2 gallons.</li>
            <li> I have used many products over the years. None work as well as this product.  I was so impressed that I shared my first order and the re-ordered so that I would have more on hand.  This is one product that I don&#x27;t want to be without, it is excellent.  Forget the high-end Department Stores and the 3 digit amounts and order this.  It works.</li>
            <li> did  everything it was suppose to do. made be look younger, if only for a little while.</li>
            <li> luv this product. Got from seller immediately very happy</li>
            <li> Flakes off.  It&#x27;s like white Elmer&#x27;s Glue on your face, but an ugly brown Elmer&#x27;s glue.  It got rid of the wrinkles if you DO NOT MOVE A SINGLE thing on your face.</li>
            <li> Just began using this and I like it thus far..hopefully it will be a on-going use</li>
            <li> There is an undeniable visable difference in just 3 minutes that lasts for hours. It tightens to smooth out my under eye area and is amazing. It&#x27;s a temporary fix, but I love the results!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years and it&#x27;s never failed me.  I like the product very much and it only takes a little to get the results you want.</li>
            <li> Do not like, to expensive</li>
            <li> Best unknown product on the market - I wear it everyday and the results are remarkable. Takes at least 10 years off my age!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Linda</li>
            <li> this product actually, somewhat, did as advertised.  So many products promise wrinkle reducer but never live up to their hype.</li>
            <li> Perfect to camouflage those fine lines above your lip!</li>
            <li> Wrinkle Magic Instant Wrinkle Reducer does not work.  The reason I purchased it was because of the great reviews it received on Amazon.  I have tried it many times and IT DID NOT REDUCER MY EYE BAGS AND WRINKLES.  IT WAS EXPENSIVE AND DOES NOT WORK !!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years now. I first purchased it on a shopping network and then found it here as the network stopped offering it. I&#x27;ve tried other skin tighteners but they all tend to curdle if u mix them with an unde eye concealer. This is the only product that doesn&#x27;t curdle as much. And being that it&#x27;s tinted it already acts as a light concealer. I do however put it on top of the IT cosmetics &amp;#34; bye bye redness&amp;#34; cream which covers my dark circles around my eyes. The two products really work wonders together and I can&#x27;t live without them. I highly recommend using the two products as you will look about 20 years younger. Make sure you mix in the wrinkle magic in to your skin real good before it dries and always start with the anti redness cream under and around your eyes first. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> on time and as expected! thank you for offering this product...I really like the way it works to give you a finished appearance!</li>
            <li> Very strong scent. Get more wrinkles after putting on the face.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible waste of money I&#x27;m very disappointed trying to return..I used it years ago and it was totally different..</li>
            <li> This product came with no packing slip. The container came with just a little product in it. Not happy</li>
            <li> The best at this time that I have found!!!!!</li>
            <li> Awful stuff !  It looks like clown makeup !</li>
            <li> Have not used enough of it yet to tell if it works as promised  I did not use this or review it.</li>
            <li> It works just don&#x27;t get it in your eyes. It burns . Stays for hours.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Ok Ladies. This is the best instant line and wrinkle reducer, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of them. And such a good price too! Better than Genie that leaves white residue everywhere. As long as you don&#x27;t use too much, it&#x27;s really natural looking. Give it a try. Works for me!</li>
            <li> This actually worked...I was surprised with the instant results...really liked it and  will order more when this tube is gone.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome....I have been spending $29.99 on another product and this product works just as good if not better. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews but I found this product so good I felt I needed to toss my opinion into the ring. I put this on in the morning, worked as described. Lines smooth, bags gone. I worked a full stressful day and when I would use the ladies room would check my face and still looked great. Got home 10 hours later and my face looked as fresh as the morning! Nothing is a magic cure all, but this is a good product and does what it claims. Great price too! It also shipped super fast. (56 yr old for a refence)</li>
            <li> This really does make a difference. This is my second order of it, which lasts a very long time.  I highly recommend mixing with you moisturizer otherwise I find it flakes and looks horrid under make up.  Play around with the ratio til you get what works best for your face and I&#x27;m sure you will order again too!</li>
            <li> Not as firming as other products I have tried however do like the fact it is tinted</li>
            <li> I have been using product for quite some time.  It is great.  I use it  under my eyes and it clears the puffiness within  minutes.  It also lasts all day.  I am never without it.</li>
            <li> I love wrinkle magic, I&#x27;ve tried many different instant wrinkle removers but not one worked even close to how well this does.  I put a little on before my makeup, let it dry,  put my makeup on then put a small amount of wrinkle magic over my makeup. The trick is to put very little on and make sure you shake the tube really well before you apply. I used to buy this at Shophq but they no longer sell it,  I&#x27;m so happy I found it on Amazon,  hope they always have it.</li>
            <li> Had bought this product in the past and I love it and will buy it again</li>
            <li> This is a product that I buy as soon as I am about ready to run out.  It is great to conceal puffy eyes.  I have puffy eyes from aging and allergies, this is one product that truly reduces the appearance.  I will continue to make this part of my make-up routine.</li>
            <li> Does little for fine lines and tiny wrinkles; the tint is nice however.</li>
            <li> Terrific product.  I was skeptical in trying these kinds of product, causes they usually leave a white residue on the skin, but this one does not, if you use a small to moderate amount.  I highly recommend it. It delivers what it promises to do.</li>
            <li> I would not leave home without  my wrinkle magic  it&#x27;s fabulous! This must be my 5th tube and I hope they never discontinue it. You only need a little and so it lasts forever.. makes for a very natural appearance so don&#x27;t hesitate to&lt;br /&gt;Purchase it. It really is wonderful!!!</li>
            <li> I have to use  the productit for some time before seeing whether it works as promised. Delivery was quick, and I liked the price.</li>
            <li> I find this wrinkle cream very ordinary. Avon has a face primer that blurs the wrinkles for about 10.00- works better than this one. Don&#x27;t waste your $.</li>
            <li> It is not as instant as it claims. It does help eyes look more awake after a mostly sleepless night.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product. I have been using it for well over a year on a daily basis. It is a little tricky to put on, but when you figure it out it really works. I use it under my eyes, on my forehead between my eyes, and on my smile lines. I can&#x27;t live without it. Don&#x27;t stop offering it!</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT REALLY HIDES THE DARK CIRLES UNDER MY EYES.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT FOR ANYONE.  IT DOES NOT SEEM TO HELP OTHER WRINKLES.</li>
            <li> I have never had much luck with this type of product, and if they should work for even 2 hours, I would give a decent rating.  However, this is probably the worst of the worst.  I had tried the Wrinkle Magic several times and in several different ways using both liquid foundation and mineral powder foundation.  Each time I followed the directions precisely, starting with shaking up the tube.  I have tried it on freshly cleansed skin that has completely dried, before any serum or moisturizer product.  I have tried mixing a tiny dab with moisturizer, and I have tried mixing a tiny dab with liquid foundation.  Nothing has worked, and each way brought me nothing other than very poor results.  When first applied, after three or four minutes of holding my face expressionless, my skin looked amazing and tight.  However, within a short period, these were some of my results.  Around the eyes and above the top lip started looking dry and any fine lines were much more prominent.  A very small area of fine lines on my cheek became blotchy and encircled in a white, slightly flakey area.  Now I want to assure you that I use a miniscule amount of the product, because I understand that in skin products…less generally gives better results, and I still ended up with that whitish flakey ring around whatever area the Wrinkle Magic was applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have dry skin, so I thought that maybe that could be an issue.  I passed this tube of Wrinkle Magic to a younger friend with beautiful skin, no dry skin issues, and at this stage, all she has is some minor lines on her forehead, and the beginning of crow’s feet, around the corners of her eyes.  She had told me that the Wrinkle Magic worked for her…until one day when we went out for lunch.  I could tell that she had some on under her make-up.  I gave her the small mirror I keep in my handbag, and told her to face the light from the window.  There on both corners of her eyes and on her forehead were telltale signs of slightly flakey white areas, and those fine lines were completely visible.  Therefore, in conclusion, maybe it may work for some women, but definitely not for me with dry skin, and not for my younger friend who has perfect skin.flakey white areas, and those fine lines were completely visible.  Therefore, in conclusion, maybe it may work for some women, but definitely not for me with dry skin, and not for my younger friend who has perfect skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products to reduce the appearance of wrinkles and even puffiness under my eyes.  Wrinkle Magic really works.  I just place a small amount in palm of my hand and dip my finger in and gently pat it on the problem areas of my face.  I love it!  I have purchased three so far and plan to buying more when I need it.  Thank you for this product.</li>
            <li> this is by far the best product of its type on the market, ladies don&#x27;t hesitate.  there is a trick to the success of how it works.  wait until you have all your makeup ON and then use a drop or two of wrinkle magic on the very top.  If you use it first your makeup and moisturizer willl &amp;#34;dilute the product and it can&#x27;t tighten the skin as well.  you can buy all the products out there (I know for I have a basket full) but you won&#x27;t find anything as effective as wrinkle magic.  It used to come with a small purse size tube to carry with you and for some reason I can no longer find that combo.  Does anyone else remember that set or know how to find it???  It was very handy but people kept asking me about the product and would talk (beg) for the small tube.  I don&#x27;t know why they took it off the shopping network but I don&#x27;t care now that I can get it here for a better price and quicker delivery......Try it,  you will be so glad.  Finally a product that does what it promises to do......elaine</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to do anything. Not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize the product had a tint to it.....did not blend well with my skin color..especially&lt;br /&gt;with a summer tan !!...however It does reduce eye line wrinkles effectively.  Future purchase&lt;br /&gt;will be the clear, pen like applicator.</li>
            <li> I need this product pls</li>
            <li> Great for under eyes before going out for the evening</li>
            <li> The trick with this item is to use as little as possible.  I wish, however they would work on the packaging of this product.  It seems that either too much comes out of the tube, or too little!</li>
            <li> Better than any others I&#x27;ve tried!!! Much easier to work with!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work as stated waste of money</li>
            <li> Thank you Jesus!!  you have to  work with this product and see what works for you...only use a small amount, and for me, only use it alone without moisterizer or makeup...it sucked up any puffiness I have under my eyes and covers the circles. I dab a very small amount just under my eyes and hold very still for about 2 minutes and you will look like you&#x27;ve just had your eyes done!!! I tried putting concealer over it or under it and then it looks scaly and not smooth, but alone, it is great.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this size and a travel size for 19.00. I love the product but will find it at a lower price&lt;br /&gt;It definitely works</li>
            <li> This product works, however if you move the skin once it has tightened, it loosens it back up. If you do not touch it at all it works.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I have just too many wrinkles or  this product should be used for a younger group of woman...but it did nothing for me....&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle  but a little help please for a special occasion....</li>
    </ol>
