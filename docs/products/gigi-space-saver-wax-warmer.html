    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I use this to wax my bike chain and it is perfect.</li>
            <li>I measured the temperature of the wax at 100C, which is perfect as it boils any water off the chain and the wax fills the slots.</li>
            <li>I bought mine from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply and have been VERY happy with it.</li>
            <li>it was the perfect size!</li>
            <li>wax perfectly</li>
            <li>Works awesome!</li>
            <li>but the temp is PERFECT.</li>
            <li>Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>and I am good to go!</li>
            <li>Great service and a great product.  </li>
            <li>This thing, I was so happy about the size.</li>
            <li>This warmer is a great bang for your buck.</li>
            <li>The warmer was great, i just had problems with the shipping company amazon decided to use.</li>
            <li>This thing works great.</li>
            <li>The size is great but it burns like a mo - fo.  </li>
            <li>This is great for at home waxing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try it again and see if it maintains a good temp with me turning it on and off all the time.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I bought this!</li>
            <li>I love this machine!</li>
            <li>so they ought to not be stingy and include more collars!</li>
            <li>I love my Gigi Warmer!</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made of plastic, which will get warm during heating-</li>
            <li>I have been waxing my own lip and eyebrows for years using GiGi&#x27;s cream wax with the muslin strips.</li>
            <li>She really liked the product.</li>
            <li>I have to take the can out while it&#x27;s warm for both of them.</li>
            <li>I love my warmer, works fast and the temperature is always perfect!  </li>
            <li>Perfect for at home&lt;br /&gt;Waxing heats up super fast!</li>
            <li>It was great at first</li>
            <li>This warmer is nice, compact, efficient, and easy to store.</li>
            <li>When I purchased this warmer I was worried about not being able to adjust the temperature</li>
            <li>I sometimes take mine to peoples homes and this wouldn&#x27;t be as safe to transport.    </li>
            <li>She will do a better job than me.  </li>
            <li>Advertised to safely heat wax all day.</li>
            <li>Love this item.</li>
            <li>as well abs had no problem with anything fitting out using the product</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>and it has good temperature control (not too hot).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy so far!</li>
            <li>The warmer is a really nice size, and it does save space, however the wax gets way too hot!</li>
            <li>It heats the wax very quickly,</li>
            <li>I will buy again, it was so easy to try on</li>
            <li>I thought maybe I could keep the original wax lid on, but they are too tightly fit and after using the wax it would end up making the lid stuck on, you also wouldnt want to leave the original lid on during warming--so that would leave more opportunity for dust and things to land in the wax.    </li>
            <li>I was kind of nervous to purchase because of the 1 star reviews, complaining about how fast it heats up.</li>
            <li>but overal i like this warmer , easy to store and clean.</li>
            <li>and when I got it home I tested it to make sure it didnt make wax too hot, it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>User friendly.</li>
            <li>This one is really space saver, works perfect as expected and affordable.</li>
            <li>Looks good at the price, definitely will recommend this</li>
            <li>It really should come with more than just ONE collar though.</li>
            <li>I was able to get though my first full body wax but not without some issues from the wax being too hot.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s purpose is to do its job quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li>Very convenient and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Only gave 4 stars because it would be nice if there was a temperature setting on this, its just on or off</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Heats up SUPER quickly, much quicker than the full size warmer.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast!</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and does exactly what it was advertised to do.</li>
            <li>At first it looks huge in the pictures, but when I got to the store and saw this little box- happiness.</li>
            <li>This product holds just the right amount of wax.  </li>
            <li>My old GiGi warmer was small and had temperature control and was AWESOME.</li>
            <li>It heats the wax to a nice comfortable temperature and cools right down once turned off.</li>
            <li>Great small size, fits all wax pots.</li>
            <li>so it hardens right away for horribly hot</li>
            <li>Very very unsatisfied.</li>
            <li>I buy the gigi hard wax and use it for everything, except bikini waxing (I prefer to go to the professionals for that lol).</li>
            <li>So wax got too hot and melted the on/off switch to off.</li>
            <li>But for my legs, eyebrows, underarms, etc... this saves me soooo much money and works so well!</li>
            <li>But it stopped working during the first time I used it...</li>
            <li>but it got way too hot.</li>
            <li>and I find the wax to be a tad hot.</li>
            <li>The wax heats up too hot to use.</li>
            <li>WAAAY too hot for waxing.</li>
            <li>I have to switch it between on and off to keep it a good temperature, and I have burned myself to the point of blisters a few times testing it on my arm before putting it on a client.</li>
            <li>I tried several different types of wax with this warmer, and none were a good match for the temperature this gets to.</li>
            <li>Use the wax to about half full and you&#x27;ll blister your skin for sure.</li>
            <li>and I love that I don&#x27;t have to mess with any temperature settings to get the wax to melt to the right warmth for me!</li>
            <li>This thing is more trouble than it is worth!</li>
            <li>Got it very fast better than what they have at Sally&amp;#34;s beauty supplies and to the people complaining it&#x27;s to hot the wax needs to be hot your suppose to blow on it a few times</li>
            <li>but I did not have to worry because it heats the wax really fast</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t really drip you can reuse the collar.</li>
            <li>I really wish I would have read the reviews on this before I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>Having no control on the temp of your wax makes this product very unreliable.</li>
            <li>Does it heat the wax fast?</li>
            <li>Does its job well, big wax jars can fit into it,</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this one, unfortunately it would have been perfect for my counter, if it worked.</li>
            <li>its so small, but has so many power in it!</li>
            <li>And it doesnt just get to hot if you leave it on too long, its too hot pretty much from the get go.</li>
            <li>I ended up returning it and buying the nicer model which I&#x27;ve owned in the past and liked it.</li>
            <li>People purchasing this complaining about how fast it heats up clearly didn&#x27;t recognize that this is an on/off, no heat settings device.</li>
            <li>The price is great and warms up the wax, but the temperature is always wrong.</li>
            <li>I returned this item and purchased a new one with an adjustable temperature.</li>
            <li>What a sham, wax is dangerously hot in under an hour, and that&#x27;s with a full wax load.</li>
            <li>the second one turned on for 10 minutes then stopped working just like the first.</li>
            <li>The wax does get really hot because there is only an on/off switch</li>
            <li>I found that with both this warmer and the larger version of Gigi&#x27;s warmer after the can has been warmed then left to cool in the warmer they both ended up being stuck.  </li>
            <li>When the level of wax in the can gets down to about half-way, the wax becomes too hot to use if you consistently leave the unit turned on.</li>
            <li>The price was so much lower than similar items at beauty supply places.</li>
            <li>/&gt;For a few dollars more I bought the larger version of this and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  </li>
            <li>I was worried at first that this was going to be too hot as I have previously used a different brand of GiGi.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only slightly bigger than the wax can, so it really does save a lot of space!</li>
            <li>This has only an on and off switch, and it&#x27;s simply way too hot.</li>
            <li>A little too cool</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more inconvenient, but it&#x27;s not terrible.    </li>
            <li>I took this back the next day and got a new one.</li>
            <li>Also the design is such that it gets pretty gross with wax, and then is difficult to clean or swap out new wax</li>
            <li>Like other reviewers, I&#x27;ve found this warmer gets way too hot, and as you may have noticed, has only an on/off switch, no adjustment.</li>
            <li>so that means it was used about 20-22 hours in total, and it no longer turns on or off, previous full size warmer didn&#x27;t last much longer with the same limited, personal use only.  </li>
            <li>The unit is small and compact and heats up very fast.</li>

            <li> The unit is small and compact and heats up very fast.</li>
            <li> If you keep it on, it does get a little too hot like other reviewers have noted.</li>
            <li> but as the can got half way down it heated the wax way too hot</li>
            <li> I use it for my big areas as well as minor ones</li>
            <li> Looking for another brand - like Gigi wax products but their warmers are junk, especially based on such little overall usage.</li>
            <li> I bought this from Sally&#x27;s a long while ago, I immediately turned it in when I got home to wax myself and it turned off maybe 10 minutes in..</li>
            <li> A complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I mean you really will ruin it if you use it without the collar</li>
            <li> So, either put a collar or fold in some wet old newspaper around to avoid the mess.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no way you can plug this in and come back a little later to use as it melts to water consistency.  </li>
            <li> its difficult to clean if you forget to put collar around.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure if this is true or at least with my warmer.  </li>
            <li> With hard wax it&#x27;s not that hard to keep the rims relatively clean-</li>
            <li> I just wait a sec before applying to skin.</li>
            <li> it takes about 30 mins for the wax to actually melt thinly because its only an on and off button .</li>
            <li> Recently I decided to try hard wax</li>
            <li> This makes the process take even longer than normal because if you forget to turn it back on, it gets too cold and the wax hardens up, and if you forget to turn it off, you could burn the skin you are waxing.</li>
            <li> The wax was fully workable for the half hour</li>
            <li> Its one star less &#x27;cuz</li>
            <li> The colar did not fit, the wax container recommended did not fit the warmer hole.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s finally just gotten too gross and too annoying, so I&#x27;m moving back to the adjustable warmer.</li>
            <li> Takes up very little space.</li>
            <li> This is the first can warmer I&#x27;ve ever purchased, and I am disappointed in it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so small</li>
            <li> The product directions were so small you could not read them with a magnifying glass.</li>
            <li> This is not safe.</li>
            <li> One review said the warmer is a bit too small to get the can of wax out</li>
            <li> not pleased that a company like GiGi would make a product like this...</li>
            <li> I like how small it is</li>
            <li> Sometimes you just accidentally drip and it ends up a horrible mess for you to clean.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s difficult to judge how long to leave it on and turn it</li>
            <li> After using it, all I can say is ignore the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a little thing and seems stupid...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a completely horrible product, it just gets way too hot.  </li>
            <li> The wax will get dusty and not be sanitary.</li>
            <li> Tired of burns and the effort it was taking to make it usable.</li>
            <li> Not good GiGi!</li>
            <li> I use hard wax and it takes about 30-40 minutes to heat up from the cold.</li>
            <li> the temp control wax pot warmers are expensive.</li>
            <li> Lame.</li>
            <li> that I wasn&#x27;t afraid to do it myself.</li>
            <li> So sad!</li>
            <li> Burned the crap out of my anus.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has done the job for me for &gt;5 years, though (didn&#x27;t crap out).</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Got it very fast better than what they have at Sally&amp;#34;s beauty supplies and to the people complaining it&#x27;s to hot the wax needs to be hot your suppose to blow on it a few times</li>
            <li> When I purchased this warmer I was worried about not being able to adjust the temperature but I did not have to worry because it heats the wax really fast and it has good temperature control (not too hot).</li>
            <li> This is the first can warmer I&#x27;ve ever purchased, and I am disappointed in it. Since the unit only has an \\&quot;on/off\\&quot; switch, there is no temperature control in it. When the level of wax in the can gets down to about half-way, the wax becomes too hot to use if you consistently leave the unit turned on. I have to rotate between on and off to keep me from burning the skin I am waxing. This makes the process take even longer than normal because if you forget to turn it back on, it gets too cold and the wax hardens up, and if you forget to turn it off, you could burn the skin you are waxing. If I had to do it over again, I would buy one that has a thermostat on it.  This thing is more trouble than it is worth!</li>
            <li> I use this to wax my bike chain and it is perfect. I measured the temperature of the wax at 100C, which is perfect as it boils any water off the chain and the wax fills the slots. I can&#x27;t imagine putting the wax on your skin at this temperature.</li>
            <li> I bought this at my local Cosmoprof (store for professionals) and when I got it home I tested it to make sure it didnt make wax too hot, it doesn&#x27;t. So it is functional. BUT it doesn&#x27;t have a lid. It&#x27;s such a little thing and seems stupid... but it&#x27;s a deal breaker. The wax will get dusty and not be sanitary. I thought maybe I could keep the original wax lid on, but they are too tightly fit and after using the wax it would end up making the lid stuck on, you also wouldnt want to leave the original lid on during warming--so that would leave more opportunity for dust and things to land in the wax.    Another thing to keep in mind about it not having a lid is transporting it. I sometimes take mine to peoples homes and this wouldn&#x27;t be as safe to transport.    I ended up returning it and buying the nicer model which I&#x27;ve owned in the past and liked it.</li>
            <li> The warmer is a really nice size, and it does save space, however the wax gets way too hot! And it doesnt just get to hot if you leave it on too long, its too hot pretty much from the get go. I have to switch it between on and off to keep it a good temperature, and I have burned myself to the point of blisters a few times testing it on my arm before putting it on a client. Not good GiGi! Fix your temperature controls!</li>
            <li> Great service and a great product.  I just couldn&#x27;t figure out how to made the Creme Wax work.  Giving it to my beautician!!  She will do a better job than me.  Shouldn&#x27;t have ordered something like this for myself, but my wax kept making my microwave spark!!!  Guess I&#x27;ll have to figure something else out.</li>
            <li> This items only has the ON/OFF option. You can only control the wax temperature by turning it on or off. I will be returning it</li>
            <li> No temp control. So wax got too hot and melted the on/off switch to off.</li>
            <li> This thing, I was so happy about the size. At first it looks huge in the pictures, but when I got to the store and saw this little box- happiness. It&#x27;s only slightly bigger than the wax can, so it really does save a lot of space! I use hard wax and it takes about 30-40 minutes to heat up from the cold. If you keep it on, it does get a little too hot like other reviewers have noted. You will burn yourself if you keep it continuously on. I do the turn off, turn back on thing. It&#x27;s a little more inconvenient, but it&#x27;s not terrible.    It&#x27;s made of plastic, which will get warm during heating- so I like to turn off occasionally for that reason as well. USE collars! Sometimes you just accidentally drip and it ends up a horrible mess for you to clean. If you don&#x27;t really drip you can reuse the collar. They look simple enough to make if you have leftover poster board (From children&#x27;s school projects or something as well). I&#x27;m happy so far! And I use the wax&#x27;s lid to keep it covered. With hard wax it&#x27;s not that hard to keep the rims relatively clean- the wax melds into itself.</li>
            <li> I bought mine from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply and have been VERY happy with it. I buy the gigi hard wax and use it for everything, except bikini waxing (I prefer to go to the professionals for that lol). But for my legs, eyebrows, underarms, etc... this saves me soooo much money and works so well! I am so glad I bought this!</li>
            <li> Perfect for at home&lt;br /&gt;Waxing heats up super fast!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so small and I love that I don&#x27;t have to mess with any temperature settings to get the wax to melt to the right warmth for me!</li>
            <li> I really wish I would have read the reviews on this before I purchased it.  I bought it from Sally&#x27;s today and I will be returning it tomorrow.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a completely horrible product, it just gets way too hot.  I was able to get though my first full body wax but not without some issues from the wax being too hot.  If you don&#x27;t mind playing with the on/off switch to control the temp then by all means, purchase this but if you don&#x27;t want to do all that, purchase one with a temp control.</li>
            <li> Having no control on the temp of your wax makes this product very unreliable. I returned this item and purchased a new one with an adjustable temperature.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it was the perfect size! But it stopped working during the first time I used it... so I had it replaced with the same warmer, the second one turned on for 10 minutes then stopped working just like the first. Do not waste your money on this one, unfortunately it would have been perfect for my counter, if it worked.</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast! I was kind of nervous to purchase because of the 1 star reviews, complaining about how fast it heats up. After using it, all I can say is ignore the negative reviews. People purchasing this complaining about how fast it heats up clearly didn&#x27;t recognize that this is an on/off, no heat settings device. It&#x27;s purpose is to do its job quickly and efficiently. Does it heat the wax fast? Heck yeah! Took about 5 minutes for it to be workable. When it got fully melted, I turned the warmer off. The wax was fully workable for the half hour I had it off, so problem solved! This warmer is a great bang for your buck. Fits my 14oz. wax perfectly and I couldn&#x27;t be happier! Would suggest to friends.</li>
            <li> The warmer was great, i just had problems with the shipping company amazon decided to use.</li>
            <li> so that means it was used about 20-22 hours in total, and it no longer turns on or off, previous full size warmer didn&#x27;t last much longer with the same limited, personal use only.  Looking for another brand - like Gigi wax products but their warmers are junk, especially based on such little overall usage.</li>
            <li> Heats up SUPER quickly, much quicker than the full size warmer. The wax does get really hot because there is only an on/off switch but I just blow on it before I apply it and I am good to go!</li>
            <li> I bought this from Sally&#x27;s a long while ago, I immediately turned it in when I got home to wax myself and it turned off maybe 10 minutes in.. I took this back the next day and got a new one. I turned it on to heat my wax but it got way too hot. I turned it off for a bit then back on, but it wouldn&#x27;t work with me anymore. So sad!</li>
            <li> Works the way you&#x27;d expect a warmer to.</li>
            <li> my mom bought this warmer from the actual store and i decided to put it to use. it takes about 30 mins for the wax to actually melt thinly because its only an on and off button . but overal i like this warmer , easy to store and clean.</li>
            <li> Takes up very little space. User friendly.</li>
            <li> Does its job well, big wax jars can fit into it, Its one star less &#x27;cuz its difficult to clean if you forget to put collar around. So, either put a collar or fold in some wet old newspaper around to avoid the mess.</li>
            <li> I have been waxing my own lip and eyebrows for years using GiGi&#x27;s cream wax with the muslin strips. Recently I decided to try hard wax and I needed a warmer. This thing works great. It heats the wax very quickly,</li>
            <li> I love this machine! its so small, but has so many power in it! I use it for my big areas as well as minor ones</li>
            <li> This has only an on and off switch, and it&#x27;s simply way too hot. I tried several different types of wax with this warmer, and none were a good match for the temperature this gets to. I&#x27;d have to &amp;#34;babysit&amp;#34; the warmer, turning it off and on to try to maintain a usable temperature. Ultimately I trashed it. Tired of burns and the effort it was taking to make it usable.</li>
            <li> Burned the crap out of my anus.  This is only one level heat.  The size is great but it burns like a mo - fo.  Gotta heat the wax and then use it when it&#x27;s cooling.  It&#x27;s a DIY thermostat.</li>
            <li> Great small size, fits all wax pots. Only gave 4 stars because it would be nice if there was a temperature setting on this, its just on or off and I find the wax to be a tad hot. I just wait a sec before applying to skin.</li>
            <li> This is great for at home waxing. The unit is small and compact and heats up very fast.</li>
            <li> I just got this product and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it. The price is great and warms up the wax, but the temperature is always wrong. A little too cool so it hardens right away for horribly hot so it burned my leg. I&#x27;m going to try it again and see if it maintains a good temp with me turning it on and off all the time. Sounds like a hassle but the temp control wax pot warmers are expensive.</li>
            <li> Advertised to safely heat wax all day. What a sham, wax is dangerously hot in under an hour, and that&#x27;s with a full wax load. Use the wax to about half full and you&#x27;ll blister your skin for sure. A complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> The product is junk I tossed it into the trash.  The colar did not fit, the wax container recommended did not fit the warmer hole.  The product directions were so small you could not read them with a magnifying glass.</li>
            <li> I love my warmer, works fast and the temperature is always perfect!  if you are looking for one,i recommend.</li>
            <li> This one is really space saver, works perfect as expected and affordable. Looks good at the price, definitely will recommend this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waxing with GiGi products for years and have used a variety of the waxes and warmers. I don&#x27;t recommend this one. Like other reviewers, I&#x27;ve found this warmer gets way too hot, and as you may have noticed, has only an on/off switch, no adjustment. I find I have to turn the warmer off and on periodically to adjust the temperature. Lame. Also the design is such that it gets pretty gross with wax, and then is difficult to clean or swap out new wax containers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has done the job for me for &gt;5 years, though (didn&#x27;t crap out). It&#x27;s finally just gotten too gross and too annoying, so I&#x27;m moving back to the adjustable warmer.</li>
            <li> Love this item. It heats up quickly and does exactly what it was advertised to do.</li>
            <li> This is not safe. The wax heats up too hot to use. There&#x27;s no way you can plug this in and come back a little later to use as it melts to water consistency.  I don&#x27;t understand why there is no temperature control. My old GiGi warmer was small and had temperature control and was AWESOME.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. I will buy again, it was so easy to try on that I wasn&#x27;t afraid to do it myself.</li>
            <li> I go this for my daughter, who is a esthetician She really liked the product. She had this brand of wax pot before.</li>
            <li> This warmer is nice, compact, efficient, and easy to store. It really should come with more than just ONE collar though. I mean you really will ruin it if you use it without the collar so they ought to not be stingy and include more collars!</li>
            <li> I wish I had read the reviews here before I bought this from my local Sally&#x27;s.  It was great at first but as the can got half way down it heated the wax way too hot and it&#x27;s difficult to judge how long to leave it on and turn it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a few dollars more I bought the larger version of this and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  One review said the warmer is a bit too small to get the can of wax out but I&#x27;m not sure if this is true or at least with my warmer.  I found that with both this warmer and the larger version of Gigi&#x27;s warmer after the can has been warmed then left to cool in the warmer they both ended up being stuck.  I have to take the can out while it&#x27;s warm for both of them.</li>
            <li> WAAAY too hot for waxing. Very very unsatisfied. Will not purchase again... not pleased that a company like GiGi would make a product like this...</li>
            <li> Stop working with in month not recommended</li>
            <li> Works awesome! I bought the gigi wax as well abs had no problem with anything fitting out using the product</li>
            <li> This product holds just the right amount of wax.  The price was so much lower than similar items at beauty supply places.</li>
            <li> I was worried at first that this was going to be too hot as I have previously used a different brand of GiGi.  I like how small it is but the temp is PERFECT. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love my Gigi Warmer! So far so good! It heats the wax to a nice comfortable temperature and cools right down once turned off.</li>
            <li> This product is a value for money at this price. Very convenient and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product!</li>
