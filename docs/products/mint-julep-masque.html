            <li>Very nice product.  </li>
            <li>but it is just a pleasant feeling...hard to describe accurately lol.  </li>
            <li>This makes for an awesome shave too, I love having a shave and then applying this because it just shuts all the pores up and looking good for the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>

            <li>My skin reacts, I apply a spot clearing product, and I&#x27;m good.</li>
            <li>dont know how good it is.</li>
            <li>It does feel good afterwards as it had that minty-ness.</li>
            <li>I have always loved the mint julep masque.</li>
            <li>great product....used for many years and probably always will</li>
            <li>very refreshing</li>
            <li>I love the mint mask!</li>
            <li>I think you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li>Bought this from Sallys for $5, and I love it!</li>
            <li>, i do recommend this julep mask, its pretty awesome, and seems to have worked for lots of others as well</li>
            <li>I love this masque!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>This product makes my skin look amazing.</li>
            <li>It has a great mint smell and light burn (that goes away immediately)</li>
            <li>Remove with warm water and</li>
            <li>It makes a nice change to not have  to blot my face throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I decided to leave it on for the recommended 15 minutes, and it washed off really nicely with a warm wash cloth.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve always liked it,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard people say it&#x27;s good for spot treatment with pimples, although I&#x27;ve never had many results in that area.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m super happy</li>
            <li>Great feel, easy to clean afterwards!</li>
            <li>I find it more effective this way as it dries and pulls out any black/white heads to the surface</li>
            <li>This is a nice, refreshing masque.</li>
            <li>This is great, from Queen Helene, this product does exactly what it claims.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>With a lovely spearmint smell, that is not the case</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I like the tub so much better than the tube since you can get all of it-</li>
            <li>I gotta say I love this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I decided to try the mask out, despite its spearmint component.</li>
            <li>I did notice -- as is with most pore-purifying products -- that some impurities did come to the surface, and I&#x27;m glad.</li>
            <li>It feels like silk going on, and I truly enjoy using it!  </li>
            <li>The consistency is a bit more moist than the tubes that I have used which also makes it easier to spread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the feeling it gives after every use.</li>
            <li>my face look and feel so much better</li>
            <li>i feel so much better to go places</li>
            <li>it better in the jar than the tube that I had always got</li>
            <li>The cool, mint feeling was very refreshing.  </li>
            <li>It looks like someone stuck their fingers in it and took a good 2 tablespoons worth of product</li>
            <li>You can buy it for around $5 at many drug stores and beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think by paying more you will get better results.</li>
            <li>I think this is appropriate for all skin types.</li>
            <li>I love this mask.</li>
            <li>But i had so many breakouts</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many masks from CVS and none have quite done the job they claim.</li>
            <li>It works way better than the toothpaste overnight</li>
            <li>and im stilll enjoying it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Warning: It DOES have minty fragrance added, so I would patch test this to make sure no irritation/allergies develop.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use it more than once to two times a week, depending on your tolerance of it, since it is drying.</li>
            <li>always, with Amazon, you might not get it from a reputable reseller so buyer beware.</li>
            <li>and they might have a better return policy in the event that you don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this mint julep masque itself.</li>
            <li>The sulfur in it is where the magic lies.</li>
            <li>Favorite masque.</li>
            <li>I was very happy to find that it comes in a big jar so I can use ALL of it &amp; not have to cut the tube.</li>
            <li>The mask itself applies super smooth and absolutely smells wonderfully.</li>
            <li>I was so excited!</li>
            <li>should mention that it layers nicely, and dries quickly too.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive, this is tingly but feels great.  </li>
            <li>This is a great mask that makes your skin feel clean and absorbs oil very well.  </li>
            <li>I followed up with my favorite light,oil free day lotion</li>
            <li>My skin always feels smooth and very clean after washing it off.  </li>
            <li>Feels &#x27;cool&#x27; (minty) on the skin and refreshes for sure.</li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty nice.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe you have to pay a lot of money to have a fine product that works.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After my very first use I noticed that my face looked and felt so much better then before I applied the mask.</li>
            <li>Like others, I enjoy the sensation and tightening feeling of the mask.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your skin REALLY smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s widely available almost in any chain stores like Walmart/CVS/Walgreens/etc</li>
            <li>I get a 12 ounce jar of it from another site for $3.63 and with free shipping.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even good for those of us who have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It has a refreshing mint scent, although it might be overpowering at first to some people.  </li>
            <li>I placed my order, pretty excited about a mint mask from one of my favorite skin care lines.</li>
            <li>My face feels so clean after using it.</li>
            <li>and it tingles when you put it on and its almost like you can feel it penetrate the skin and clean it out.</li>
            <li>This is used after cleansing your face; my face feel so clean and refreshed--amazing.  </li>
            <li>This was just okay for me, I didn&#x27;t really see a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>It works well, washes off easily, and it is priced right.</li>
            <li>Although this product does tend to dry out my cheeks, that&#x27;s easy to remedy with a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Rinse off is a breeze with just a warm washcloth, no heavy scrubbing required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>for effectiveness; I have used full face masks, lower face masks and spot treatments overnight.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin, and some areas are oily, so i felt it was helping reduce those oily areas, which was good, obviously.</li>
            <li>good stuff, this was my second batch</li>
            <li>Face feels super clean after using.</li>
            <li>feel cool when applying it on face, but doesn&#x27;t work well on me.</li>
            <li>I bought this because of all the great reviews on Amazon and other beauty sites.  </li>
            <li>Next time you use the mask, it will be nice and smooth and</li>
            <li>Next time you use the mask, it will be nice and smooth and malleable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-JR-</li>
            <li>I do not use this every day, and sometimes I still feel a bit silly putting this on my face as a man, but my god does it feel good and smell great when I do.  </li>
            <li>It dries up pimples really quick also.</li>
            <li>OMG I cant say enough about this product, it smells great and your skin feels so soft and smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve now been using this product for a good long while, almost a year, and here are some additional things to note.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have combination skin that is mostly slightly drier and it works great for me.</li>
            <li>It is so affordable and has actually worked better for me than the GlamGlow!  </li>
            <li>This mask smells nice and mentholly, it has a slight refreshing tingle.</li>
            <li>For a little over $10 this is a great deal considering the amount people are charging these days for products even a quarter of that size.</li>
            <li>It really leaves your skin feeling smooth and fresh.</li>
            <li>But damn was it worth it.</li>
            <li>More importantly, this product actually reduced the amount of oil on my forehead and nose.</li>
            <li>It actually feels minty/tingly and not burning, which is nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-You can see the oil being absorbed by the mask</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product and my only regrets are not trying this sooner!</li>
            <li>Okay, so I was excited to see the bigger version online, and so of course I ordered it.</li>
            <li>It does a good job like any other mask.  </li>
            <li>The CON of that one is that you have to mix it with apple cider vinegar to get the right</li>
            <li>Super comfortable and makes a noticeable difference in how clear</li>
            <li>The spearmint is strong, and my skin did feel a bit sensitive to it.</li>
            <li>, I was pleasantly surprised by how easily the masque came off with water.</li>
            <li>I really needed a mask that would pull the impurities from my pores (they&#x27;re kinda large, and I like products that reduce their size and clean them out).</li>
            <li>Most of all, I like that I always have much smoother skin that glows a little more, too, after using this product.</li>
            <li>and it really works!</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>However, after the first use I saw improvement in my complexion as well as my acne.</li>
            <li>I have been purchasing in the tubes for years, this is my first tub</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this many times before and would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>First off, I don&#x27;t know if its just me, but it BURNS.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lovely and easy to use.........AND not as messy as some.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would suggest a nice 1/2&amp;#34; facial (or paint) brush to apply to your face since it is very thick and gets kind of messy (and wasteful) to apply as it smushes around your fingers Other than that it makes my skin feel great and the smell is nice.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft and clean after using this.  </li>
            <li>This is the first real quality mask product I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li>You can really pack it on, and even though I applied it thicker in some places than others, it all came off with warm water and the wash cloth, unlike some other</li>
            <li>Order came fast and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>This product is well worth the purchase, and my skin definitely feels revitalized, refreshed, and clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It goes on pretty good and not to hard to get off.</li>
            <li>Queen Helene has cleared up these blemishes relatively quickly, and I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The only drawback of this product is all of the mint in here, if your skin is easily irritated you may want to take a pass on this one.  </li>
            <li>the large size lasts forever.</li>
            <li>My skin is really clean-no blackheads and feel nice and tight and it shrinks large pores.  </li>
            <li>Just a note for those who have not used this product use an old face cloth as when you take off the masque when dry, it tends to trun the face cloth green, otherwise, a great product!!</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin with large pores</li>
            <li>it really irritated my Rosacea.</li>
            <li>12 oz really is.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling smooth and refreshed and I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li>But the product name is really misleading.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed that over the hours my skin has remained soft, and fresh.</li>
            <li>I try to use it as often as I can as I apply it to my whole face and leave it on for 15-20 minutes (10 min).</li>
            <li>very clean!!you should put some skin care after use it .because</li>
            <li>This is one product that I really like.  </li>
            <li>For the pores, I didn&#x27;t really see a difference.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still completely worth it, although the price has spiked considerably.</li>
            <li>I felt it really was closing up my pores and cleaning my face out.</li>
            <li>They could do completely without the mint in this masque as it&#x27;s mainly for novelty purposes and usually won&#x27;t do much for your skin besides slightly irritate it and smell good.</li>
            <li>The sulfur and zinc oxide in this masque is what helps acne and the bentonite clay is gentle.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff and it is getting harder to find</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>You can also get it at most drug stores for about half of any of the prices listed on here, but I can never find the Large 12 ounce jar of it, which is why I buy it online.</li>
            <li>Occasionally, one will erupt into full pimple status.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll be honest and say that I&#x27;ve used this mask in the past</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I prefer this newer one MUCH more than the one I owned previously in the squeeze tube with the older packaging.</li>
            <li>is a fairly high priority for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this mask.</li>
            <li>It was a little drying, but my skin felt really fresh and clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>I use this every other day as an all-over mask and I makes my skin so smooth and has really made a difference in my blackheads.  </li>
            <li>far have not broken out or had any issue having incorporated it into my regime.</li>
            <li>I use it about 2-3 times a week, and so far, i really like it.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s pretty much the only drawback for me.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love using this product as a mask or as a spot treatment a few times a week.</li>
            <li>I ordered the 12 oz jar and was VERY surprised at the amount</li>
            <li>From what I understand, this is the original natural home treatment, developed by a dermatologist, that will actually dry up acne pimples, rinse away blackheads and even help shrink enlarged pores.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend it, but pleasepatch test first.</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel so soft!</li>
            <li>(I have huge pores) and my blackheads are less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I typically spend more for this product from a local beauty supply store.</li>
            <li>My favorite face mask but so hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li>Hoping this will help clear them up.  </li>
            <li>My 11 year old who is starting to get acne wants to try it.</li>
            <li>Both my husband and I have adult acne.  </li>
            <li>I would pass on this if you have sensitive skins.</li>
            <li>but that is because the skin there is quite sensitive....</li>
            <li>I got this for my teenager daughter (17 years old) for her birthday.  </li>
            <li>I was actually pleasantly surprised with the effectiveness of this product.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think there is much difference between cheaper clay masks and those that are more expensive</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t remember it ever completely clearing up blackheads.</li>
            <li>minty, not recommended for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Makes my face soft and cleans out the pores.  </li>
            <li>So do not put this anywhere NEAR your eyes.</li>
            <li>A mint julep is a drink made with fresh mint, so yes, I expected this mask to have mint in it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve heard their mud masque is more gentle for those who might find this irritating.</li>
            <li>Love that I can use a 1/2inch paint brush and dip in, brush on and have no mess on my hands and next to nothing wasted.</li>
            <li>I would recommend a moisturizer afterwards as it does leave your skin slightly dry, but not terribly uncomfortable or anything.  </li>
            <li>I recently moved from Utah to Colorado, and even though the climates are extremely similar, my face has been breaking out a little more.</li>
            <li>packaging- dried out quickly.</li>
            <li>even my mild acne is relieved for just a few days.</li>
            <li>I applied a regular coat over my entire face which barely even made a dent in the jar and I was very please about that.</li>
            <li>I have had the older packaging in the squeeze bottle and remember it being more uncomfortable on my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is new formula  and new packaging (the old one came in a tube) and my daughters says that there is a slight tingly feeling that lasts for about a minute.  </li>
            <li>Tightens skin, pores clear and apperar smaller.</li>
            <li>It is very affordable and will last a long time.</li>
            <li>I know that my wife had adult acne for years and this was the only mask she would use then</li>
            <li>Near daily use of this is now permanent part of my skin care routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Near daily use of this is now permanent part of my skin care routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wow it was opened how gross !!</li>
            <li>in all, definitely worth the money, especially since the 12 oz will easily last me a few months.</li>
            <li>Wearing it for 15 minutes every other day or so just makes my skin look much much healthier the next day, the pores appear smaller and</li>
            <li>In the past I would always get messy trying to squeeze it out of the tube, apply it to my face just to realize I needed more.</li>
            <li>I used to use this when I was a teenage and could really see it pulling the black heads out of my nose.</li>
            <li>I used this every evening in the shower for about a week, just a thin layer after washing but before exfoliating made a huge difference in the clearness and size of my pores.</li>

            <li> Very nice product.  </li>
            <li> but it is just a pleasant feeling...hard to describe accurately lol.  </li>
            <li> This makes for an awesome shave too, I love having a shave and then applying this because it just shuts all the pores up and looking good for the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>

            <li> My skin reacts, I apply a spot clearing product, and I&#x27;m good.</li>
            <li> dont know how good it is.</li>
            <li> It does feel good afterwards as it had that minty-ness.</li>
            <li> I have always loved the mint julep masque.</li>
            <li> great product....used for many years and probably always will</li>
            <li> very refreshing</li>
            <li> I love the mint mask!</li>
            <li> I think you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> Bought this from Sallys for $5, and I love it!</li>
            <li> , i do recommend this julep mask, its pretty awesome, and seems to have worked for lots of others as well</li>
            <li> I love this masque!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This product makes my skin look amazing.</li>
            <li> It has a great mint smell and light burn (that goes away immediately)</li>
            <li> Remove with warm water and</li>
            <li> It makes a nice change to not have  to blot my face throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I decided to leave it on for the recommended 15 minutes, and it washed off really nicely with a warm wash cloth.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve always liked it,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard people say it&#x27;s good for spot treatment with pimples, although I&#x27;ve never had many results in that area.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m super happy</li>
            <li> Great feel, easy to clean afterwards!</li>
            <li> I find it more effective this way as it dries and pulls out any black/white heads to the surface</li>
            <li> This is a nice, refreshing masque.</li>
            <li> This is great, from Queen Helene, this product does exactly what it claims.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> With a lovely spearmint smell, that is not the case</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I like the tub so much better than the tube since you can get all of it-</li>
            <li> I gotta say I love this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I decided to try the mask out, despite its spearmint component.</li>
            <li> I did notice -- as is with most pore-purifying products -- that some impurities did come to the surface, and I&#x27;m glad.</li>
            <li> It feels like silk going on, and I truly enjoy using it!  </li>
            <li> The consistency is a bit more moist than the tubes that I have used which also makes it easier to spread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the feeling it gives after every use.</li>
            <li> my face look and feel so much better</li>
            <li> i feel so much better to go places</li>
            <li> it better in the jar than the tube that I had always got</li>
            <li> The cool, mint feeling was very refreshing.  </li>
            <li> It looks like someone stuck their fingers in it and took a good 2 tablespoons worth of product</li>
            <li> You can buy it for around $5 at many drug stores and beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think by paying more you will get better results.</li>
            <li> I think this is appropriate for all skin types.</li>
            <li> I love this mask.</li>
            <li> But i had so many breakouts</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many masks from CVS and none have quite done the job they claim.</li>
            <li> It works way better than the toothpaste overnight</li>
            <li> and im stilll enjoying it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Warning: It DOES have minty fragrance added, so I would patch test this to make sure no irritation/allergies develop.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use it more than once to two times a week, depending on your tolerance of it, since it is drying.</li>
            <li> always, with Amazon, you might not get it from a reputable reseller so buyer beware.</li>
            <li> and they might have a better return policy in the event that you don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mint julep masque itself.</li>
            <li> The sulfur in it is where the magic lies.</li>
            <li> Favorite masque.</li>
            <li> I was very happy to find that it comes in a big jar so I can use ALL of it &amp; not have to cut the tube.</li>
            <li> The mask itself applies super smooth and absolutely smells wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I was so excited!</li>
            <li> should mention that it layers nicely, and dries quickly too.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive, this is tingly but feels great.  </li>
            <li> This is a great mask that makes your skin feel clean and absorbs oil very well.  </li>
            <li> I followed up with my favorite light,oil free day lotion</li>
            <li> My skin always feels smooth and very clean after washing it off.  </li>
            <li> Feels &#x27;cool&#x27; (minty) on the skin and refreshes for sure.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty nice.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe you have to pay a lot of money to have a fine product that works.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After my very first use I noticed that my face looked and felt so much better then before I applied the mask.</li>
            <li> Like others, I enjoy the sensation and tightening feeling of the mask.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your skin REALLY smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s widely available almost in any chain stores like Walmart/CVS/Walgreens/etc</li>
            <li> I get a 12 ounce jar of it from another site for $3.63 and with free shipping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even good for those of us who have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It has a refreshing mint scent, although it might be overpowering at first to some people.  </li>
            <li> I placed my order, pretty excited about a mint mask from one of my favorite skin care lines.</li>
            <li> My face feels so clean after using it.</li>
            <li> and it tingles when you put it on and its almost like you can feel it penetrate the skin and clean it out.</li>
            <li> This is used after cleansing your face; my face feel so clean and refreshed--amazing.  </li>
            <li> This was just okay for me, I didn&#x27;t really see a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> It works well, washes off easily, and it is priced right.</li>
            <li> Although this product does tend to dry out my cheeks, that&#x27;s easy to remedy with a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Rinse off is a breeze with just a warm washcloth, no heavy scrubbing required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> for effectiveness; I have used full face masks, lower face masks and spot treatments overnight.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, and some areas are oily, so i felt it was helping reduce those oily areas, which was good, obviously.</li>
            <li> good stuff, this was my second batch</li>
            <li> Face feels super clean after using.</li>
            <li> feel cool when applying it on face, but doesn&#x27;t work well on me.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of all the great reviews on Amazon and other beauty sites.  </li>
            <li> Next time you use the mask, it will be nice and smooth and</li>
            <li> Next time you use the mask, it will be nice and smooth and malleable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-JR-</li>
            <li> I do not use this every day, and sometimes I still feel a bit silly putting this on my face as a man, but my god does it feel good and smell great when I do.  </li>
            <li> It dries up pimples really quick also.</li>
            <li> OMG I cant say enough about this product, it smells great and your skin feels so soft and smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve now been using this product for a good long while, almost a year, and here are some additional things to note.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have combination skin that is mostly slightly drier and it works great for me.</li>
            <li> It is so affordable and has actually worked better for me than the GlamGlow!  </li>
            <li> This mask smells nice and mentholly, it has a slight refreshing tingle.</li>
            <li> For a little over $10 this is a great deal considering the amount people are charging these days for products even a quarter of that size.</li>
            <li> It really leaves your skin feeling smooth and fresh.</li>
            <li> But damn was it worth it.</li>
            <li> More importantly, this product actually reduced the amount of oil on my forehead and nose.</li>
            <li> It actually feels minty/tingly and not burning, which is nice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-You can see the oil being absorbed by the mask</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product and my only regrets are not trying this sooner!</li>
            <li> Okay, so I was excited to see the bigger version online, and so of course I ordered it.</li>
            <li> It does a good job like any other mask.  </li>
            <li> The CON of that one is that you have to mix it with apple cider vinegar to get the right</li>
            <li> Super comfortable and makes a noticeable difference in how clear</li>
            <li> The spearmint is strong, and my skin did feel a bit sensitive to it.</li>
            <li> , I was pleasantly surprised by how easily the masque came off with water.</li>
            <li> I really needed a mask that would pull the impurities from my pores (they&#x27;re kinda large, and I like products that reduce their size and clean them out).</li>
            <li> Most of all, I like that I always have much smoother skin that glows a little more, too, after using this product.</li>
            <li> and it really works!</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> However, after the first use I saw improvement in my complexion as well as my acne.</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing in the tubes for years, this is my first tub</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this many times before and would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> First off, I don&#x27;t know if its just me, but it BURNS.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lovely and easy to use.........AND not as messy as some.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would suggest a nice 1/2&amp;#34; facial (or paint) brush to apply to your face since it is very thick and gets kind of messy (and wasteful) to apply as it smushes around your fingers Other than that it makes my skin feel great and the smell is nice.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft and clean after using this.  </li>
            <li> This is the first real quality mask product I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li> You can really pack it on, and even though I applied it thicker in some places than others, it all came off with warm water and the wash cloth, unlike some other</li>
            <li> Order came fast and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> This product is well worth the purchase, and my skin definitely feels revitalized, refreshed, and clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It goes on pretty good and not to hard to get off.</li>
            <li> Queen Helene has cleared up these blemishes relatively quickly, and I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only drawback of this product is all of the mint in here, if your skin is easily irritated you may want to take a pass on this one.  </li>
            <li> the large size lasts forever.</li>
            <li> My skin is really clean-no blackheads and feel nice and tight and it shrinks large pores.  </li>
            <li> Just a note for those who have not used this product use an old face cloth as when you take off the masque when dry, it tends to trun the face cloth green, otherwise, a great product!!</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin with large pores</li>
            <li> it really irritated my Rosacea.</li>
            <li> 12 oz really is.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling smooth and refreshed and I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> But the product name is really misleading.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed that over the hours my skin has remained soft, and fresh.</li>
            <li> I try to use it as often as I can as I apply it to my whole face and leave it on for 15-20 minutes (10 min).</li>
            <li> very clean!!you should put some skin care after use it .because</li>
            <li> This is one product that I really like.  </li>
            <li> For the pores, I didn&#x27;t really see a difference.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still completely worth it, although the price has spiked considerably.</li>
            <li> I felt it really was closing up my pores and cleaning my face out.</li>
            <li> They could do completely without the mint in this masque as it&#x27;s mainly for novelty purposes and usually won&#x27;t do much for your skin besides slightly irritate it and smell good.</li>
            <li> The sulfur and zinc oxide in this masque is what helps acne and the bentonite clay is gentle.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and it is getting harder to find</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> You can also get it at most drug stores for about half of any of the prices listed on here, but I can never find the Large 12 ounce jar of it, which is why I buy it online.</li>
            <li> Occasionally, one will erupt into full pimple status.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll be honest and say that I&#x27;ve used this mask in the past</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I prefer this newer one MUCH more than the one I owned previously in the squeeze tube with the older packaging.</li>
            <li> is a fairly high priority for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this mask.</li>
            <li> It was a little drying, but my skin felt really fresh and clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> I use this every other day as an all-over mask and I makes my skin so smooth and has really made a difference in my blackheads.  </li>
            <li> far have not broken out or had any issue having incorporated it into my regime.</li>
            <li> I use it about 2-3 times a week, and so far, i really like it.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s pretty much the only drawback for me.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love using this product as a mask or as a spot treatment a few times a week.</li>
            <li> I ordered the 12 oz jar and was VERY surprised at the amount</li>
            <li> From what I understand, this is the original natural home treatment, developed by a dermatologist, that will actually dry up acne pimples, rinse away blackheads and even help shrink enlarged pores.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it, but pleasepatch test first.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel so soft!</li>
            <li> (I have huge pores) and my blackheads are less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I typically spend more for this product from a local beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> My favorite face mask but so hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Hoping this will help clear them up.  </li>
            <li> My 11 year old who is starting to get acne wants to try it.</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I have adult acne.  </li>
            <li> I would pass on this if you have sensitive skins.</li>
            <li> but that is because the skin there is quite sensitive....</li>
            <li> I got this for my teenager daughter (17 years old) for her birthday.  </li>
            <li> I was actually pleasantly surprised with the effectiveness of this product.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think there is much difference between cheaper clay masks and those that are more expensive</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t remember it ever completely clearing up blackheads.</li>
            <li> minty, not recommended for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Makes my face soft and cleans out the pores.  </li>
            <li> So do not put this anywhere NEAR your eyes.</li>
            <li> A mint julep is a drink made with fresh mint, so yes, I expected this mask to have mint in it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard their mud masque is more gentle for those who might find this irritating.</li>
            <li> Love that I can use a 1/2inch paint brush and dip in, brush on and have no mess on my hands and next to nothing wasted.</li>
            <li> I would recommend a moisturizer afterwards as it does leave your skin slightly dry, but not terribly uncomfortable or anything.  </li>
            <li> I recently moved from Utah to Colorado, and even though the climates are extremely similar, my face has been breaking out a little more.</li>
            <li> packaging- dried out quickly.</li>
            <li> even my mild acne is relieved for just a few days.</li>
            <li> I applied a regular coat over my entire face which barely even made a dent in the jar and I was very please about that.</li>
            <li> I have had the older packaging in the squeeze bottle and remember it being more uncomfortable on my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is new formula  and new packaging (the old one came in a tube) and my daughters says that there is a slight tingly feeling that lasts for about a minute.  </li>
            <li> Tightens skin, pores clear and apperar smaller.</li>
            <li> It is very affordable and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I know that my wife had adult acne for years and this was the only mask she would use then</li>
            <li> Near daily use of this is now permanent part of my skin care routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Near daily use of this is now permanent part of my skin care routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wow it was opened how gross !!</li>
            <li> in all, definitely worth the money, especially since the 12 oz will easily last me a few months.</li>

            <li> In the past I would always get messy trying to squeeze it out of the tube, apply it to my face just to realize I needed more.</li>
            <li> I used to use this when I was a teenage and could really see it pulling the black heads out of my nose.</li>
            <li> I used this every evening in the shower for about a week, just a thin layer after washing but before exfoliating made a huge difference in the clearness and size of my pores.</li>

            <li> So, great product, but RIDICULOUS PRICE!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought other mint masques and they do not work nearly as well as mint julep.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely add extra moisturizer after doing this masque so you don&#x27;t dry your skin</li>
            <li> I am getting to the age where I need to shy away from wearing as much powder foundation, but have never liked liquid foundation, so being able to keep my complexion</li>
            <li> This jar should last a long time.  </li>
            <li> My mom used to use a face mask a lot like this when I was growing up-- to the point where it was normal for me to see my mom every Saturday vacuuming the living room with a green face.</li>
            <li> It could be that my skin is just now less sensitive or something.</li>
            <li> Indeed, I do believe the mask has helped clear up my pores, and is certainly 100 steps ahead of Neutrogena or any common brand at your average retail store.</li>
            <li> There is nothing worse then having to smell a gross mask for 5 - 10 minutes stuck right under your nose.</li>
            <li> it detoxify all your skin and make it look tight and young.</li>
            <li> I would totally recommend this over any other form of this same product.</li>
            <li> It has helped with minor breakouts for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a long time and I am hoping I will&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried to find it in stores, but alas Amazon was the only reasonable place selling it!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if it helps with acne, but my guess would be not much if any.  </li>
            <li> husband also has been breaking out lately and has some fairly good blackheads on his nose, but so far I&#x27;ve been unable to convince him to just try having a green nose for a half hour one weekend...</li>
            <li> Ok so i was mad because i received a USED product.</li>
            <li> (it has been around for a very long time).  </li>
            <li> Apply masque generously and allow to dry for about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t dry my face out either.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After you first apply you may experience a little tingly sensation, but I just attribute this to knowing the product is working and the sensation will dull as the mask dries.</li>
            <li> you use this mask in an area where you usually don&#x27;t, its very likely that in the next two days you&#x27;ll seem some break outs.</li>
            <li> you use this mask in an area where you usually don&#x27;t, its very likely that in the next two days you&#x27;ll seem some break outs.</li>
            <li> its very dry .</li>
            <li> Sleeping with a dab of this over night, reduces the blemish and mostly the swelling that makes them painful and bothersome.  </li>
            <li> At least for my skin, which is just stubborn to clear up with well-acclaimed products!&lt;br /&gt;HERE</li>
            <li> When I bought this I was kind of skeptical, not sure exactly how it would look, afraid to sacrifice my manliness.</li>
            <li> It does what it says by pulling out dead skin, reduces redness, and shrinks acne related pimples as well as pores.</li>
            <li> so I had to be careful what I got her.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first when my mother brought it for me to try.</li>
            <li> I get blemishes on my jaw line that sit under the skin and don&#x27;t allow for other options of maintenance.</li>
            <li> That is where you only apply the masque to a small patch of skin on your face at the frequency you plan on using this masque and wait a couple weeks to see if you show any signs of irritation.</li>
            <li> Plenty of other knock-off brands work well</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t found any other masques that work as well as mint julep.  </li>
            <li> your mask gets a little dry in the jar, run it under some water, let the water drain out and do it again.</li>
            <li> your mask gets a little dry in the jar, run it under some water, let the water drain out and do it again.</li>
            <li> (Minus the random mountains that unexpectedly appear in unflattering spots on your face)</li>
            <li> There is a slight tingle when applied, but no burning.  </li>
            <li> and my black head&#x27;s are going away</li>
            <li> Almost half the jar was scooped out.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s slightly less</li>
            <li> For a bit of context, I have combination skin: (super) oily T-zone and (very) dry cheeks.</li>
            <li> The mask dries and becomes hard if you leave it on long enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it is a lot easier to apply and keeps it less messy.</li>
            <li> This makes it less messy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before I&#x27;d only bought the tubes and they were just SO hard to squeeze because of how thick this stuff is</li>
            <li> I have quite a few whiteheads that are not too noticeable.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t dried out or overly oily afterwards.  </li>
            <li> But this item came with the seal opened and a portion of the product missing as if someone has used the item.</li>
            <li> My daughter started using it a few years ago and suggested I give it a try.</li>
            <li> It reminded me of those green masks that you always saw on females on television!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t say that there has been any reformulation of it, but that doesn&#x27;t mean the ratios haven&#x27;t changed and they maybe added less mint with this newer look.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and small whiteheads</li>
            <li> no more thinking im being stared at thank you for selling it</li>
            <li> I usually am and this does not bother me.</li>
            <li> Have been using it from past 7 years.</li>
            <li> My grandmother used this masque for years and it sometimes hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> If you have VERY dry skin, I would be wary, but give it a shot with patch testing first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have terrible acne, fortunately; however, my chin has seen clearer days.</li>
            <li> I just checked out the prices on amazon while I was already buying some other stuff, and couldn&#x27;t believe how expensive they charge, so I felt compelled to leave a review.</li>
            <li> it is very hard to get out.</li>
            <li> A tube would be difficult to apply as it is pasty, with this you can just dab a finger in and spread it all over your face.</li>
            <li> Clay masks shouldn&#x27;t be expensive.  </li>
            <li> i was desperate to try this</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re skeptical, I would recommend just buying it and try for yourself!  </li>
            <li> I used to use GlamGlow masks, but the price is crazy!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the first real quality mask product I&#x27;ve ever bought. I don&#x27;t have terrible acne, fortunately; however, my chin has seen clearer days. I have quite a few whiteheads that are not too noticeable. Occasionally, one will erupt into full pimple status. Queen Helene has cleared up these blemishes relatively quickly, and I am pleasantly surprised. This product is well worth the purchase, and my skin definitely feels revitalized, refreshed, and clean. Indeed, I do believe the mask has helped clear up my pores, and is certainly 100 steps ahead of Neutrogena or any common brand at your average retail store.</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I have adult acne.  We&#x27;ve been using this product for years and it really works!</li>
            <li> It really works! My face feels so clean after using it. I love it</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s &amp;#34;mint julep&amp;#34; but damn it has a lot of peppermint oil in it- it really irritated my Rosacea. I would pass on this if you have sensitive skins. I also don&#x27;t like the tub vs tube packaging- dried out quickly.</li>
            <li> After having heard wonderful things about the Queen Helene Mint Julep Masque I decided to order the product. I ordered the 12 oz jar and was VERY surprised at the amount 12 oz really is. For a little over $10 this is a great deal considering the amount people are charging these days for products even a quarter of that size. The great part about this product is you don&#x27;t need to cake it on the get great results. I applied a regular coat over my entire face which barely even made a dent in the jar and I was very please about that. This seems like it will really last a while. The mask itself applies super smooth and absolutely smells wonderfully. There is nothing worse then having to smell a gross mask for 5 - 10 minutes stuck right under your nose. With a lovely spearmint smell, that is not the case here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After you first apply you may experience a little tingly sensation, but I just attribute this to knowing the product is working and the sensation will dull as the mask dries. Rinse off is a breeze with just a warm washcloth, no heavy scrubbing required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my very first use I noticed that my face looked and felt so much better then before I applied the mask. I look forward to seeing what this mask will do for me over time. This is a wonderful product and my only regrets are not trying this sooner!</li>
            <li> When I bought this I was kind of skeptical, not sure exactly how it would look, afraid to sacrifice my manliness. But damn was it worth it. This product makes my skin look amazing. Wearing it for 15 minutes every other day or so just makes my skin look much much healthier the next day, the pores appear smaller and even my mild acne is relieved for just a few days. When opened it has a very pleasant minty aroma and then when applied it has a sort of cooling sensation. This makes for an awesome shave too, I love having a shave and then applying this because it just shuts all the pores up and looking good for the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I would totally recommend this over any other form of this same product. A tube would be difficult to apply as it is pasty, with this you can just dab a finger in and spread it all over your face.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Feels &#x27;cool&#x27; (minty) on the skin and refreshes for sure. I like the tub so much better than the tube since you can get all of it- plus after the fact you can use the tub as a storage container for something like cotton balls soaked in toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest a nice 1/2&amp;#34; facial (or paint) brush to apply to your face since it is very thick and gets kind of messy (and wasteful) to apply as it smushes around your fingers Other than that it makes my skin feel great and the smell is nice. I find it a relaxing addition to my life and have been using it since I was about 14.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I&#x27;d only bought the tubes and they were just SO hard to squeeze because of how thick this stuff is so I&#x27;m super happy I chose the tub this go around. Won&#x27;t go back to the tube now. Love that I can use a 1/2inch paint brush and dip in, brush on and have no mess on my hands and next to nothing wasted.</li>
            <li> Use it as a mask that I keep on overnight and wash off in the morning.....I find it more effective this way as it dries and pulls out any black/white heads to the surface so I can wash it off in the morning with my exfoliator.&lt;br /&gt;It does sting a bit around the lips and corner of the nose area but that is because the skin there is quite sensitive....but after a minute or two it goes away.&lt;br /&gt;I like the smell and also how it dries evenly.&lt;br /&gt;Thus far have not broken out or had any issue having incorporated it into my regime. I don&#x27;t use it every day, but I would say once every two weeks</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a difference on my pores dpnt feel its cleans the skin dullness ,it seems like nothing can make pores to be smaller or cleaner .....</li>
            <li> I gotta say I love this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for years now in desperation of relief in my acne. I was a bit skeptical at first when my mother brought it for me to try. However, after the first use I saw improvement in my complexion as well as my acne. It does what it says by pulling out dead skin, reduces redness, and shrinks acne related pimples as well as pores. It&#x27;s even good for those of us who have sensitive skin. I will continue to use this product for years to come. My only recommendation would be to buy in jar form because in the bottle once it&#x27;s running out it is very hard to get out.</li>
            <li> Excellent inexenpsive mask</li>
            <li> I got this for my teenager daughter (17 years old) for her birthday.  She has a problem with some acne, but loves face masks so I had to be careful what I got her.  From what I understand, this is the original natural home treatment, developed by a dermatologist, that will actually dry up acne pimples, rinse away blackheads and even help shrink enlarged pores.  I know that my wife had adult acne for years and this was the only mask she would use then (it has been around for a very long time).  It has a refreshing mint scent, although it might be overpowering at first to some people.  If you don&#x27;t like mint, this is not the mask for you.&lt;br /&gt;The package directions are: Cleanse face and neck thoroughly. Apply masque generously and allow to dry for about 15 minutes. Leave on problem areas overnight, if desired. Remove with warm water and a washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are: Distilled Water, Kaolin, Bentonite, Glycerin, Zinc Oxide, Propylene Glycol, Sulfur, Chromium Oxide Greens, Fragrance, Methylparaben.&lt;br /&gt;This is new formula  and new packaging (the old one came in a tube) and my daughters says that there is a slight tingly feeling that lasts for about a minute.  The mask dries and becomes hard if you leave it on long enough.&lt;br /&gt;The price is incredible!  For overall quality and value, this is a winner!</li>
            <li> I was actually pleasantly surprised with the effectiveness of this product. For a bit of context, I have combination skin: (super) oily T-zone and (very) dry cheeks. Although this product does tend to dry out my cheeks, that&#x27;s easy to remedy with a good moisturizer. That&#x27;s pretty much the only drawback for me. More importantly, this product actually reduced the amount of oil on my forehead and nose. It makes a nice change to not have  to blot my face throughout the day. An even bigger bonus for me is it reduces the size of the pores on my nose. I still need to use nose strips to attain my ideal look, but I can go longer without needing to use a strip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, definitely worth the money, especially since the 12 oz will easily last me a few months.</li>
            <li> Have used since my teen years. Best anti-acne mask out there and the large size lasts forever.</li>
            <li> I used to use this when I was a teenage and could really see it pulling the black heads out of my nose. I thought I&#x27;d try it again, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well now. I&#x27;ll continue to use it on occasion.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love using this product as a mask or as a spot treatment a few times a week. It leaves my skin feeling smooth and refreshed and I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It really leaves your skin feeling smooth and fresh. As you put on the mask, you&#x27;ll feel a minty tingly feeling in your skin.  The next day I&#x27;ll notice my pores have become smaller.</li>
            <li> When I saw this product online I was so excited! I tried to find it in stores, but alas Amazon was the only reasonable place selling it! I placed my order, pretty excited about a mint mask from one of my favorite skin care lines. But the product name is really misleading. A mint julep is a drink made with fresh mint, so yes, I expected this mask to have mint in it. I wish I&#x27;d looked up a list of ingredients though, because I would have realized that the &#x27;mint&#x27; is actually spearmint, which I&#x27;ve never cared for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I decided to try the mask out, despite its spearmint component. I really needed a mask that would pull the impurities from my pores (they&#x27;re kinda large, and I like products that reduce their size and clean them out). The minute I put this mask on, I could feel my pores opening. The spearmint is strong, and my skin did feel a bit sensitive to it. I decided to leave it on for the recommended 15 minutes, and it washed off really nicely with a warm wash cloth. My skin immediately felt tighter, cleaner and looked refreshed. I followed up with my favorite light,oil free day lotion and I&#x27;ve noticed that over the hours my skin has remained soft, and fresh. I did notice -- as is with most pore-purifying products -- that some impurities did come to the surface, and I&#x27;m glad. I will follow up with another facial in about three days, and I think I&#x27;ll continue to use this mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should mention that it layers nicely, and dries quickly too. You can really pack it on, and even though I applied it thicker in some places than others, it all came off with warm water and the wash cloth, unlike some other masks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all I&#x27;d recommend this mask, and of course I&#x27;ll continue using Queen Helene products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now been using this product for a good long while, almost a year, and here are some additional things to note.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use this daily. No joke. I used this every evening in the shower for about a week, just a thin layer after washing but before exfoliating made a huge difference in the clearness and size of my pores. Near daily use of this is now permanent part of my skin care routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use this mask in an area where you usually don&#x27;t, its very likely that in the next two days you&#x27;ll seem some break outs. Don&#x27;t panic, this is good. You want your skin to bring up those impurities, so you can deal with it. About once a week I apply this to under my jawline, and my neck, especially if I&#x27;ve had a lot of sunscreen on or lotion. My skin reacts, I apply a spot clearing product, and I&#x27;m good. I can trust that my skin is clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your mask gets a little dry in the jar, run it under some water, let the water drain out and do it again. Then screw the lid back on, and walk away. Next time you use the mask, it will be nice and smooth and malleable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-JR-ek, just a thin layer after washing but before exfoliating made a huge difference in the clearness and size of my pores.

            <li> I typically spend more for this product from a local beauty supply store. I love the mint mask!</li>
            <li> I bought this because of all the great reviews on Amazon and other beauty sites.  I used to use GlamGlow masks, but the price is crazy!  So I gave this a try because why not for that price!  It is so affordable and has actually worked better for me than the GlamGlow!  I use this every other day as an all-over mask and I makes my skin so smooth and has really made a difference in my blackheads.  I have fewer blackheads, and my pores appear way smaller than before I started using this mask.  It also smells really great!  It feels like silk going on, and I truly enjoy using it!  If you&#x27;re skeptical, I would recommend just buying it and try for yourself!  I think you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> Works well, smells wonderful</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing in the tubes for years, this is my first tub and it is a lot easier to apply and keeps it less messy. The consistency is a bit more moist than the tubes that I have used which also makes it easier to spread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for effectiveness; I have used full face masks, lower face masks and spot treatments overnight. I get blemishes on my jaw line that sit under the skin and don&#x27;t allow for other options of maintenance. Sleeping with a dab of this over night, reduces the blemish and mostly the swelling that makes them painful and bothersome.  Like others, I enjoy the sensation and tightening feeling of the mask.  There is a noticeable difference in the size of my pores. Also, the redness that I have in my cheeks fades for a day or two.</li>
            <li> Been using this for about for months. Love the feeling it gives after every use.I like the mint smell and it tingles when you put it on and its almost like you can feel it penetrate the skin and clean it out. I try to use it as often as I can as I apply it to my whole face and leave it on for 15-20 minutes (10 min). It does wonders drying out and healing any acne that appears. Use it regularly and acne should be existent (Minus the random mountains that unexpectedly appear in unflattering spots on your face)</li>
            <li> its smell so good!! I feel my skin become very clean!!you should put some skin care after use it .because its very dry .</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft and clean after using this.  It isn&#x27;t dried out or overly oily afterwards.  I have oily skin and small whiteheads appear on my chin often.  Hoping this will help clear them up.  My skin is very sensitive, this is tingly but feels great.  I&#x27;ve used this many times before and would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This mask smells nice and mentholly, it has a slight refreshing tingle. It was a little drying, but my skin felt really fresh and clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty nice.  There is a slight tingle when applied, but no burning.  It does a good job like any other mask.  My pores do appear smaller afterwards (I have huge pores) and my blackheads are less noticeable.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if it helps with acne, but my guess would be not much if any.  I would recommend a moisturizer afterwards as it does leave your skin slightly dry, but not terribly uncomfortable or anything.  There is a faint sulfur smell that lingers after it is washed off, but most of us do this when we aren&#x27;t planning on going anywhere so I don&#x27;t see a problem with this.  This jar should last a long time.  I plan to continue to use.</li>
            <li> This is a great mask that makes your skin feel clean and absorbs oil very well.  This is one product that I really like.  Clay masks shouldn&#x27;t be expensive.  I really don&#x27;t think there is much difference between cheaper clay masks and those that are more expensive, why not keep your money in your pocket?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback of this product is all of the mint in here, if your skin is easily irritated you may want to take a pass on this one.  It works well, washes off easily, and it is priced right.</li>
            <li> Wooooo that minty feeling :---) kills acne and is perfect for sleepovers. And perfect if you want to look like Shrek and scare your roommate at 2am.</li>
            <li> if i put it on every nigh it mack;s my face look and feel so much better and my black head&#x27;s are going away i feel so much better to go places no more thinking im being stared at thank you for selling it</li>
            <li> I have used this brand before.  But this item came with the seal opened and a portion of the product missing as if someone has used the item.</li>
            <li> My mom used to use a face mask a lot like this when I was growing up-- to the point where it was normal for me to see my mom every Saturday vacuuming the living room with a green face. I recently moved from Utah to Colorado, and even though the climates are extremely similar, my face has been breaking out a little more. I&#x27;ve also always had issues with blackheads on my nose, chin, and forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be honest and say that I&#x27;ve used this mask in the past and I&#x27;ve always liked it, but I don&#x27;t remember it ever completely clearing up blackheads. It has helped with minor breakouts for me. Most of all, I like that I always have much smoother skin that glows a little more, too, after using this product. I am getting to the age where I need to shy away from wearing as much powder foundation, but have never liked liquid foundation, so being able to keep my complexion is a fairly high priority for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband also has been breaking out lately and has some fairly good blackheads on his nose, but so far I&#x27;ve been unable to convince him to just try having a green nose for a half hour one weekend...</li>
            <li> I do not use this every day, and sometimes I still feel a bit silly putting this on my face as a man, but my god does it feel good and smell great when I do.  My skin always feels smooth and very clean after washing it off.  You can feel it getting tighter as it dries and I don&#x27;t know why but it is just a pleasant feeling...hard to describe accurately lol.  I have not tried it for spot treating breakouts or blemishes yet but will have to try that next time the situation arises.</li>
            <li> Tightens skin, pores clear and apperar smaller. I use it on my face and neck, twice a week after exfoliating.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a long time and I am hoping I will&lt;br /&gt;like it better in the jar than the tube that I had always got before.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on pretty good and not to hard to get off.</li>
            <li> Great mask.&lt;br /&gt;Very minty, not recommended for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My sister has been using this product for years. My daughter started using it a few years ago and suggested I give it a try. It&#x27;s lovely and easy to use.........AND not as messy as some. I like it. I also have Rosacea and it didn&#x27;t hurt my face.</li>
            <li> OMG I cant say enough about this product, it smells great and your skin feels so soft and smooth afterwards. My 11 year old who is starting to get acne wants to try it. I have very oily skin with large pores I can see and feel a big difference after just one application.</li>
            <li> Have had it for a couple of weeks and it works. It leaves your skin REALLY smooth. It dries up pimples really quick also. For the pores, I didn&#x27;t really see a difference.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I was excited to see the bigger version online, and so of course I ordered it. As soon as I got it, I HAD to use it. I regret buying this online, because every time that I&#x27;ve used it, MY ENTIRE FACE BREAKS OUT IN ITCHY RED SPLOTCHES. This has NEVER happened whenever I bought it from the store, and I&#x27;m so upset because it makes my skin hurt like hell.</li>
            <li> feels and smells great refresh feeling must cop</li>
            <li> This is great, from Queen Helene, this product does exactly what it claims.  This is used after cleansing your face; my face feel so clean and refreshed--amazing.  My skin is really clean-no blackheads and feel nice and tight and it shrinks large pores.  Just a note for those who have not used this product use an old face cloth as when you take off the masque when dry, it tends to trun the face cloth green, otherwise, a great product!!</li>
            <li> Very nice product.  You can literally feel it shrinking pores and drying up all of the oils on the skin.  The cool, mint feeling was very refreshing.  It reminded me of those green masks that you always saw on females on television!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I was pleasantly surprised by how easily the masque came off with water.</li>
            <li> great product....used for many years and probably always will</li>
            <li> This product came from Amazon and was already opened and used. It looks like someone stuck their fingers in it and took a good 2 tablespoons worth of product</li>
            <li> Makes my face soft and cleans out the pores.  I alternate between the Mud and this.</li>
            <li> This item is AMAZING!!!!!!!! Works MARVELOULSY at clearing up pores and is the only thing that will get rid of my blackheads. I&#x27;ve heard people say it&#x27;s good for spot treatment with pimples, although I&#x27;ve never had many results in that area. It&#x27;s still completely worth it, although the price has spiked considerably. You can buy it for around $5 at many drug stores and beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li> Bought this from Sallys for $5, and I love it! It has a great mint smell and light burn (that goes away immediately) and it definitely has cleared up my skin ! I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> bought it for a gift. dont know how good it is.</li>
            <li> Queen Helene has wonderful products. I use their mineral foot soak and body lotion. I don&#x27;t believe you have to pay a lot of money to have a fine product that works. Don&#x27;t think by paying more you will get better results. Its all psychological and marketing.  I highly recommend this mask. I do not have oily skin but it doesn&#x27;t dry my face out either. I think this is appropriate for all skin types. I use this 2 times per week in winter and 3 times per week in the summer.</li>
            <li> I love this mask. It&#x27;s creamy, and tingly, and my skin loves it. Order came fast and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Ok so i was mad because i received a USED product. Almost half the jar was scooped out. But i had so many breakouts i was desperate to try this so I started to use the side that was untouched. First off, I don&#x27;t know if its just me, but it BURNS. So do not put this anywhere NEAR your eyes. However the burning only lasts about 10 seconds. It does feel good afterwards as it had that minty-ness. I felt it really was closing up my pores and cleaning my face out. I have combination skin, and some areas are oily, so i felt it was helping reduce those oily areas, which was good, obviously. I use it about 2-3 times a week, and so far, i really like it. I&#x27;ve tried many masks from CVS and none have quite done the job they claim. At least for my skin, which is just stubborn to clear up with well-acclaimed products!&lt;br /&gt;HERE&#x27;S A PLUS TIP: you can apply a dab on a zit and leave it overnight and it dries it up! It works way better than the toothpaste overnight trick!&lt;br /&gt;I also alternate this mask with the HEALING CLAY MASK (which is also amazingg).&lt;br /&gt;Overall, i do recommend this julep mask, its pretty awesome, and seems to have worked for lots of others as well</li>
            <li> good stuff, this was my second batch and im stilll enjoying it</li>
            <li> I love this masque! Super comfortable and makes a noticeable difference in how clear my skin looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: It DOES have minty fragrance added, so I would patch test this to make sure no irritation/allergies develop. I have pretty sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t irritate me. I have had the older packaging in the squeeze bottle and remember it being more uncomfortable on my skin. They don&#x27;t say that there has been any reformulation of it, but that doesn&#x27;t mean the ratios haven&#x27;t changed and they maybe added less mint with this newer look. I prefer this newer one MUCH more than the one I owned previously in the squeeze tube with the older packaging. It could be that my skin is just now less sensitive or something. It actually feels minty/tingly and not burning, which is nice. They could do completely without the mint in this masque as it&#x27;s mainly for novelty purposes and usually won&#x27;t do much for your skin besides slightly irritate it and smell good. A LOT of people that swear by this mask in beauty communities have all agreed that excluding the mint would be a great improvement. The sulfur and zinc oxide in this masque is what helps acne and the bentonite clay is gentle. This is also great as a spot treatment. I wouldn&#x27;t use it more than once to two times a week, depending on your tolerance of it, since it is drying. Great for people that are oily. I have combination skin that is mostly slightly drier and it works great for me. If you have VERY dry skin, I would be wary, but give it a shot with patch testing first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard their mud masque is more gentle for those who might find this irritating. According to the ingredients of both the the mint masque and the mud masque: BOTH have fragrance in it, so definitely patch test if you&#x27;re prone to irritation from fragrances. I usually am and this does not bother me. I will definitely try the mud masque and see if I like it. Great product for a great price. I would definitely recommend it, but pleasepatch test first. That is where you only apply the masque to a small patch of skin on your face at the frequency you plan on using this masque and wait a couple weeks to see if you show any signs of irritation. I would definitely add extra moisturizer after doing this masque so you don&#x27;t dry your skin out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard rave reviews over the Aztec brand clay mask that is also bentonite clay and has no fragrance. The CON of that one is that you have to mix it with apple cider vinegar to get the right pH so it&#x27;s slightly less convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, with Amazon, you might not get it from a reputable reseller so buyer beware. It&#x27;s widely available almost in any chain stores like Walmart/CVS/Walgreens/etc and they might have a better return policy in the event that you don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> This was just okay for me, I didn&#x27;t really see a huge difference.  I&#x27;ll keep it and still use it though.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, refreshing masque.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mint julep masque itself. It is the only thing that clears up my breakouts. The sulfur in it is where the magic lies. HOWEVER, I am giving it only 1 star because the price that amazon and others are selling it for on here is such a rip off!! I get a 12 ounce jar of it from another site for $3.63 and with free shipping. You can also get it at most drug stores for about half of any of the prices listed on here, but I can never find the Large 12 ounce jar of it, which is why I buy it online. I just checked out the prices on amazon while I was already buying some other stuff, and couldn&#x27;t believe how expensive they charge, so I felt compelled to leave a review. So, great product, but RIDICULOUS PRICE!!!!</li>
            <li> Wow it was opened how gross !!</li>
            <li> Favorite masque. Have been using it from past 7 years. Must have product.</li>
            <li> My grandmother used this masque for years and it sometimes hard to find in stores.  It works great if you have oily skin like mine.  I&#x27;ve bought other mint masques and they do not work nearly as well as mint julep.  Plenty of other knock-off brands work well but I haven&#x27;t found any other masques that work as well as mint julep.  It is very affordable and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and it is getting harder to find</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! Great feel, easy to clean afterwards! Made my face feel great!</li>
            <li> Good:&lt;br /&gt;-Feels very refreshing&lt;br /&gt;-You can see the oil being absorbed by the mask&lt;br /&gt;-Great smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad:&lt;br /&gt;-None, except do not use this after exfoliating because it might irritate your skin because of how well it works. YMMV though!</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel so soft!</li>
            <li> I have always loved the mint julep masque. I especially love how it now comes in a tub container. In the past I would always get messy trying to squeeze it out of the tube, apply it to my face just to realize I needed more. This makes it less messy.</li>
            <li> Face feels super clean after using. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> feel cool when applying it on face, but doesn&#x27;t work well on me.</li>
            <li> My favorite face mask but so hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> This stuff make my face feel smoooooth as a baby butt! I was very happy to find that it comes in a big jar so I can use ALL of it &amp; not have to cut the tube.</li>
            <li> this is very good mask... it detoxify all your skin and make it look tight and young. thanks</li>
