            <li>I have been using tussy for over forty years and have found it to be one of the best on the market, but it seem that noone wants to sell it anymore.</li>
            <li>had to return the item at my own expense.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and was delighted to find it online when it was no longer available in stores.  </li>
            <li>While it is not like I remembered it to be, it is still better than the rest of the deodorants on the market.</li>
            <li>I am and have been completely satisfied with this product.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Too many jars to have to order at one time.  </li>
            <li>Six is too many.</li>
            <li>The best I wish they would put it back in the store.</li>
            <li>What more could one say.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Tussy for almost 30 years and whenever I can&#x27;t find it, it becomes an all consuming mission to find more.</li>
            <li>So glad that Amazon has ways to get it.</li>
            <li>Love the smell</li>
            <li>I have used Tussy all my life and love it and never had an issue like this.  </li>
            <li>and they haven&#x27;t asked me if I am ordering more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pleased we can purchase this product from Amazon.</li>
            <li>but when we opened one there was water lying on top, and it feels grainy.</li>
            <li>I started using it years ago when I found so many deoderants caused allergic reactions, rashes, stinging, burning etc, and</li>
            <li>I have used Tussy for years and love the product.  </li>
            <li>HOWEVER, TUSSY IS MY FAVORITE.</li>
            <li>I was introduced to Tussy deodorant as a teenager and was always pleased with the results it provided.</li>
            <li>Love the cream been using it for years</li>
            <li>glad I can find it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Tusssy cream deodorant for many years</li>
            <li>The fragrance is lovely.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>- we were so pleased to find it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gentle but very effective with NO fragrance.  </li>
            <li>A Tried and True Deodorant Cream that remains as effective as any  Deodorant Cream.</li>
            <li>I was sure then, and I am certain that to pass on a good word</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for many years and was so pleased to find it available on the internet.  </li>
            <li>The smell is kind of baby fresh scent, powdery.</li>
            <li>It is not my primary deodorant but best for feet and other areas.  </li>
            <li>SHE WAS FULL OF WISDOM AND LOVE.  </li>
            <li>That worked out fine.  </li>
            <li>The packaging was fine</li>
            <li>Came very quickly &amp; the product was very fresh.</li>
            <li>Best stuff hands down!  </li>
            <li>Thanks for this Amazon! :-)</li>
            <li>The picture shows the Original Tussy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Tussy for all of my adult life, so I know what it&#x27;s suppose to look like and how effective it should be.</li>
            <li>Since I have been unable to find this product in the store, I was very happy to be able to get it on line.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>I am thankful to have found a readily available source of this old favorite.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li>The improved version is very creamy and light not what I was used to</li>
            <li>I love Tussy Deodorant; however some of the jars were too old.</li>
            <li>Considering I have sensitive skin, I appreciate using a product that is gentle but effective in preventing body odor.  </li>
            <li>Same great product - we had been looking for this old favorite since they recently stopped selling it in the local stores - glad we found it!</li>
            <li>We are quite satisfied with it but apparently has lost some of its popularity because some of the well known drug store no longer carry it in their inventory.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use most deordorants on the market due to the strong ingredients.</li>
            <li>It was reasonably priced and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>First let me say I love Tussy and is the only deodorant I use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I wasted as much as I was able to use.</li>
            <li>Have used it for50 year, it never fails.</li>
            <li>This was as it was the first time around as well.</li>
            <li>I love the deoderant but the entire batch had crystal like or looks like glass grit in it and for as much as you put on</li>
            <li>If you need something that really works, but is gentle, try this.</li>
            <li>I returned to it because most other products seem to be anti-perspirants.</li>
            <li>The fragrance and cream isn&#x27;t the same as the original that I used to buy.</li>
            <li>I TRIED MANY OTHER PRODUCTS,</li>
            <li>It is more &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34; than when it was available at CVS Pharmacy a few years back.  </li>
            <li>Also, the product that was inside was not even close to being as effective as it has been in the past.</li>
            <li>Given the product&#x27;s consistency over time, I would highly recommend Tussy, and hope that stores will return this product to their shelves soon.</li>
            <li>It was a little more creamy</li>
            <li>I will use it and have recommended to other men that have strong body problems.</li>
            <li>I was so very glad to find Amazon has Tussy cream deoderant, as it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find in stores.</li>
            <li>and unfortunetly it&#x27;s not available any more in Drug stores.</li>
            <li>I love it and have been using it for well over 30 years, but a few years ago they took it off the market.</li>
            <li>but I was sold the New and Improved with aluminum in it which I didn&#x27;t want.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is just a deodorant, and completely non-irritating, for which I am grateful!</li>
            <li>This is the only deodorant that has NEVER failed me, even on the hottest days.  </li>
            <li>Hard to find, for years this product was used in my home glad to find it again.</li>
            <li>My mother started me using Tussy when I was young.</li>
            <li>I am 60 years old and have never stopped using Tussy until a couple of years ago I could no longer find it.</li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s sensitive skin loves this deodorant.  </li>
            <li>old, I can&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li>Husband is old school.  </li>
            <li>you have a fixed income shipping cost is over rated.</li>
            <li>Since Tussy is the only deoderant that works for me and doesn&#x27;t irratate my sensitive skin will probabaly order again despite the grit.</li>
            <li>The Dr.Miracle product I order was the wrong kind.</li>
            <li>However, I am concerned that by the time we use the last two jars that they might be dried up.&lt;br /&gt;In the past we have been able to buy two jars at a time which means that our next purchase usually comes from fresh stock.</li>

            <li> This product (Tussy Deodorant Cream) has been used by my whole family for years and now it is hard to find it at stores.</li>
            <li> Oh Ill see if its available on Amazon, which it was, so I bought it</li>
            <li> Is this because it has been sitting on a shelf too long?  </li>
            <li> We always used Tussy due to very sensitive skin and we could no longer find it in pharmacies and usual stores -</li>
            <li> BUT, the jars I got from this seller seemed to be dried out some and had large hard crystallized pieces in it.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have experience iwht Tussy, you do need to be careful to put it on &amp;#34;AFTER&amp;#34; you&#x27;re dressed because it will get on your shirt if you put it on after you&#x27;ve applied Tussy under your arms.</li>
            <li> I will recommend to other people.</li>
            <li> Other deodorants cause him to break out.  </li>
            <li> Extremely over priced.</li>
            <li> It was the hands down choice of my parent.which</li>
            <li> , however one that I have opened was half water.</li>
            <li> However, it is drier and less creamy than previous.  </li>
            <li> and we recieved it in less than a week.  </li>
            <li> A little liquid forms between each use.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s the \\&quot;little</li>
            <li> just what I expected, a hard to find item that works well for me</li>
            <li> It is honestly not a comfortable day if I do not have this stuff on.</li>
            <li> A few months ago my brother got me one at Walmart, and I thought,</li>
            <li> The worst they sure replace it</li>
            <li> Something was wrong with this as even when it was sold locally</li>
            <li> I am not able to find any at the local stores, but am afraid to order it again.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t opened all yet, however one that I have opened was half water.</li>
            <li> Since I have been unable to find this product in the store, I was very happy to be able to get it on line.  It was reasonably priced and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Great, could not find in stores</li>
            <li> The worst they sure replace it</li>
            <li> It is more &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34; than when it was available at CVS Pharmacy a few years back.  A little liquid forms between each use.  It has probably undergone an ingredient change or adjustment to reduce the cost.  I still like it, but will be paying close attention for any further changes in quality.</li>
            <li> First let me say I love Tussy and is the only deodorant I use. BUT, the jars I got from this seller seemed to be dried out some and had large hard crystallized pieces in it. I&#x27;m sure I wasted as much as I was able to use.</li>
            <li> This is a family tradition. I can no longer find it in stores! I returned to it because most other products seem to be anti-perspirants.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years and was so pleased to find it available on the internet.  Walgreen&#x27;s where I shop doesn&#x27;t carry it anymore.  So I am very pleased with my purchase and it came without any problems as promised.</li>
            <li> While it is not like I remembered it to be, it is still better than the rest of the deodorants on the market. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I am and have been completely satisfied with this product.  It is just a deodorant, and completely non-irritating, for which I am grateful!</li>
            <li> I love it. It works, and it reminds me of my mom.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  Looks like it melted, then hardened again, very hard.  Probably won&#x27;t order again. Too many jars to have to order at one time.  Can&#x27;t believe it will still be good by the time I use it all.  I should have resized that before I ordered it.  The last time I ordered the minimum was only three jars.  That worked out fine.  Six is too many.</li>
            <li> The fragrance and cream isn&#x27;t the same as the original that I used to buy.</li>
            <li> I love it will order, again!</li>
            <li> The best I wish they would put it back in the store.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gentle but very effective with NO fragrance.  Our family has used this deodorant exclusively for over 50 years, And at Amozon , it&#x27;s readily available at a very fair price.</li>
            <li> The Dr.Miracle product I order was the wrong kind. I wanted the medicated kind</li>
            <li> The only deodorant that my skin doesn&#x27;t react to.  No claims on the jar, tho, re hypoallergenicity.</li>
            <li> I love this product and am so happy I found it again!</li>
            <li> Great deodorant...I&#x27;ve used since I was a teenager.  ..it&#x27;s kind to the skin as well as getting&lt;br /&gt;the job done!</li>
            <li> On time and as advertised. What more could one say.</li>
            <li> The best deodorant on the market,Hard to find in most stores and is very good for men and women both</li>
            <li> Great customer service &amp; superb quality of product! Keep up the great work! I will recommend to other people. I tried another vendor, which I will not ever use their service again. Very poor quality of the Tussy Cream Deoderant.</li>
            <li> I would recommend Tussy to anyone who is having problems with their deodorant. My mother started me using Tussy when I was young. I am 60 years old and have never stopped using Tussy until a couple of years ago I could no longer find it. Then a friend suggested Amazon and the rest is history.</li>
            <li> yes it made my expectations and I will be ordering again and it arrived on time in a timely manner thank you .</li>
            <li> Best stuff hands down!  It is not my primary deodorant but best for feet and other areas.  It is honestly not a comfortable day if I do not have this stuff on.</li>
            <li> It works!!!!!  I hate that you can&#x27;t purchase at stores any longer.  It is tried and proven!</li>
            <li> Have used it for50 year, it never fails. Got my husband to use and he also would use nothing else.The best....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Tussy for almost 30 years and whenever I can&#x27;t find it, it becomes an all consuming mission to find more. So glad that Amazon has ways to get it. I&#x27;ll never be in want again. It&#x27;s not an overpowering smell but pleasant. And simply, it works. If you don&#x27;t have experience iwht Tussy, you do need to be careful to put it on &amp;#34;AFTER&amp;#34; you&#x27;re dressed because it will get on your shirt if you put it on after you&#x27;ve applied Tussy under your arms.</li>
            <li> Came very quickly &amp; the product was very fresh.</li>
            <li> Always a winner with me.  Won&#x27;t change deodorants ever!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use most deordorants on the market due to the strong ingredients. Tussy has always worked for me and unfortunetly it&#x27;s not available any more in Drug stores.</li>
            <li> A Tried and True Deodorant Cream that remains as effective as any  Deodorant Cream.It was the hands down choice of my parent.which I learned from.I so trust the judgement of both my mother and father that when it came to a decision to try Tussy Cream Deodorant I was sure then, and I am certain that to pass on a good word would be very fitting.This was the second time that I have ordered the Tussy Cream Deodorant from the beneficiary of this opinion.I have no doubt where it concerns the like of Tussy Cream Deodorant nor has there been any doubt provided by the seller.Timely, efficient with no delays in a manner of speaking a job well done.This was as it was the first time around as well.Tussy Cream Deodorant is a welcomed product in this household.</li>
            <li> The only deodorant my brother can wear without hypersensitivity reaction, purchased 12 and he is happy.  like it like it like it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Tussy for all of my adult life, so I know what it&#x27;s suppose to look like and how effective it should be. The cans of Tussy I received had the Tussy label wrapped on the can with paper. Tussy does not use paper. Also, the product that was inside was not even close to being as effective as it has been in the past. I was very disappointed. I will contact Amazon and let them know that boot-legged Tussy is being sold on their website.</li>
            <li> just what I expected, a hard to find item that works well for me</li>
            <li> I was delighted to find someone still selling Tussy.  I can&#x27;t find it anywhere locally.  It has always been the deodorant of choice for my family. Plus, it&#x27;s alot cheaper than its competitors.  It works for me and I will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> I love Tussy Deodorant; however some of the jars were too old. I used it anyway even though I could tell that it had a different consistency when rubbed between my fingers. So it broke me out, underarms. I am not able to find any at the local stores, but am afraid to order it again.</li>
            <li> HAVE USED IT FOR OVER 50 YEARS AND CAN NO LONGER FIND IT IN DRUG STORES ETC.&lt;br /&gt;GLAD TO FIND IT ON THE INTERNET&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRODUCE</li>
            <li> Hard to find, for years this product was used in my home glad to find it again. Love the smell</li>
            <li> I do not require an anti-perspirant.  Tussy deodorant does the job for me.  If I had a problem, I would return the product.</li>
            <li> As a long-term user (over 25 years), I am very pleased with Tussy deodorant.  Considering I have sensitive skin, I appreciate using a product that is gentle but effective in preventing body odor.  Given the product&#x27;s consistency over time, I would highly recommend Tussy, and hope that stores will return this product to their shelves soon.</li>
            <li> I love the deoderant but the entire batch had crystal like or looks like glass grit in it and for as much as you put on you use your nails to pick the grit from your arm pit.  I have used Tussy all my life and love it and never had an issue like this.  Since I can no longer find it in retail stores decided to buy online.  I gave a jar to my sister and Aunt who also use it and I am on my 3rd jar and they haven&#x27;t asked me if I am ordering more. Since Tussy is the only deoderant that works for me and doesn&#x27;t irratate my sensitive skin will probabaly order again despite the grit.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and was delighted to find it online when it was no longer available in stores.  However, it is drier and less creamy than previous.  Is this because it has been sitting on a shelf too long?  Is it still being manufactured?  Because It still does the job, I will continute to use it.  There is nothing else out there like it.</li>
            <li> Been using this for 40 yrs.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  My husband&#x27;s sensitive skin loves this deodorant.  Other deodorants cause him to break out.  I&#x27;m so pleased we can purchase this product from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Extremely over priced.</li>
            <li> I love Tussy and was unable to find it locally, so I bought on here. The packaging was fine but when we opened one there was water lying on top, and it feels grainy. Something was wrong with this as even when it was sold locally it never looked or felt like this. Very sorry I ordered this.</li>
            <li> I was so very glad to find Amazon has Tussy cream deoderant, as it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find in stores. I started using it years ago when I found so many deoderants caused allergic reactions, rashes, stinging, burning etc, and my gramma told me to try Tussy. If you need something that really works, but is gentle, try this. Thanks for this Amazon! :-)</li>
            <li> I have used Tussy for years and love the product.  The product I received apparently had been on the shelf for a long time, as it was grainy.  I had to discard one jar, as it was too grainy to use.</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with this deodorant, you will never sweat, be wet under your ams or smell.The smell is kind of baby fresh scent, powdery. I love it and have been using it for well over 30 years, but a few years ago they took it off the market.A few months ago my brother got me one at Walmart, and I thought, Oh Ill see if its available on Amazon, which it was, so I bought it and Im happy I did!  Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this deodorant since I was 15 yrs. old, I can&#x27;t use anything else. I wish I had found it sooner</li>
            <li> MY GREAT-GRANDMOTHER USED TUSSY!!!! SHE WAS FULL OF WISDOM AND LOVE.  I TRIED MANY OTHER PRODUCTS, HOWEVER, TUSSY IS MY FAVORITE.</li>
            <li> I have been using tussy for over forty years and have found it to be one of the best on the market, but it seem that noone wants to sell it anymore. I will use it and have recommended to other men that have strong body problems.</li>
            <li> stores should have never discontinued selling this product..best deodarant..</li>
            <li> Same great product - we had been looking for this old favorite since they recently stopped selling it in the local stores - glad we found it!</li>
            <li> I was introduced to Tussy deodorant as a teenager and was always pleased with the results it provided. I am thankful to have found a readily available source of this old favorite.</li>
            <li> Love the cream been using it for years</li>
            <li> Our family has been using Tussy for probably close to sixty years. We are quite satisfied with it but apparently has lost some of its popularity because some of the well known drug store no longer carry it in their inventory. We are very happy to be able to purchase it through Amazon. However, I am concerned that by the time we use the last two jars that they might be dried up.&lt;br /&gt;In the past we have been able to buy two jars at a time which means that our next purchase usually comes from fresh stock.</li>
            <li> Husband is old school.  glad I can find it.</li>
            <li> my wife used it when we met, she still uses it, now i use it, and my daughter us it,,,, it-tussy........... just works. period.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only deodorant that works for my husband - so upset when the stores took them out - thank you for still selling them.</li>
            <li> Since I have an allergy to aluminum, this is the only deodorant that works for me ALL DAY without giving me painful welts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Tusssy cream deodorant for many years and it&#x27;s become almost impossible to buy locally.  So, I was really happy to find it on Amazon.  This is the only deodorant that has NEVER failed me, even on the hottest days.  The fragrance is lovely.</li>
            <li> The improved version is very creamy and light not what I was used to but it&#x27;s okay.  I like it</li>
            <li> The picture shows the Original Tussy but I was sold the New and Improved with aluminum in it which I didn&#x27;t want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to return the item at my own expense. Am meaning to contact Amazon but haven&#x27;t yet.</li>
            <li> We always used Tussy due to very sensitive skin and we could no longer find it in pharmacies and usual stores - so we looked it up and found it in your product list - we were so pleased to find it and we recieved it in less than a week.  Sometimes it&#x27;s the \\&quot;little things\\&quot; that make our day.  You made our day.  P &amp; C</li>
            <li> This product (Tussy Deodorant Cream) has been used by my whole family for years and now it is hard to find it at stores. I feel that stores should have them as before because the shipping of merchandise is a drag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you have a fixed income shipping cost is over rated. That is all I have to say.</li>
            <li> It was a little more creamy then I thought it would be however it did the job</li>
