    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a great product and the price is right when you buy the pack of three.  Just keep the extras in the refrigerator until you need them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using DML for a very long time, and recently switched to the SPF 25 lotion.  Initially, I didn&#x27;t like the thicker consistency of this lotion compared to the &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; DML lotion; however, that is my only complaint.  I use this lotion every day, and I have very sensitive skin, it&#x27;s great. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Dual purpose moisturizer and sunscreen.  It works well!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Just as expected.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this moisturizer for me because it has a high spf but doesn&#x27;t cause acne.  It feels a little thick while applying, but has a light feel once it&#x27;s on.  It&#x27;s a bit expensive for such a small amount, but I&#x27;ve been quite happy with the product itself.</li>
            <li> I have occasional rosacea and most products cause me to break out, so I rarely wore moisturizer. My dermatologist stressed the importance of protecting my face with SPF, so I picked up a tiny sample of this at her office when I checked out. It was light, yet moisturized well, but best yet it didn&#x27;t cause any break out - in fact my rosacea seems to have improved since using this product twice daily. I was thrilled that I could order it Amazon!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years. Along the way I have tried other moisturizers, including some very pricey ones. DML outdoes them all by incorporating a sunscreen in a formula that maintains moisture all day long. My dermatologist was the first to recommend it to me.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to my husband by a dermatologist. He uses it everyday. It does not make your eyes cry like some sunscreen products do.</li>
            <li> I keep returning to this as my basic well priced facial moisturizer</li>
            <li> Thank you for providing a sunscreen that I can use everyday.  I tried several different products all which left my face red, burning, and raw.  As a melanoma survivor I cannot afford to skip using sunscreen.  My dermatologist recommended this product and it has be very effective and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, have been using it for years.  I have very sensitive skin, prone to redness in some areas.  This moisturizer is very hydrating, and good spf protection, and does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for the winter months because it keeps my skin moisturized for the entire day and works good under makeup.  I also use it in the summer when I play golf because it has an spf of 25 and protects my skin from sun damage.  The added plus is that it isn&#x27;t costly.  I just ordered the 3 pack so I&#x27;m all set !!</li>
            <li> I bought this to wear under make-up.  It goes on smoothly enough but &amp;#34;pills&amp;#34; up under my foundation!  So, I will need to find something ELSE to wear on my face.  Even so, I will use it up, applying it to my arms and hands.  That&#x27;s why I gave it only 3 stars.  The guys might prefer it more, as they no doubt do NOT wear foundation, blush, etc.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for years after my dermatologist recommended it. Perfect!! And not overpriced like department store moisturizers. I love love love it!!</li>
            <li> Love it, feels good, recommended by my Dr &amp; skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li> I have used this moisturizer on my face twice a day for over 10 years. I first found it in a dermatologist office. It is so soothing for the skin and does not cause break outs. My skin is very sensitive so I&#x27;m grateful I found it. I always get compliments on my complexion and really think this moisturizer has had a lot to do with it.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work as I though it would.</li>
            <li> I know this product looks like a relic from the 70&#x27;s or 80&#x27;s, but it is the best moisturizer I have ever tried. My skin is extremely dry and very sensitive to products. I have tried every moisturizer available at the local big box stores and they always either make my face burn or make me breakout, and if I am really lucky it does both ;).  DML is a nice, thick moisturizer with a good SPF coverage and is PABA free. I use it year round and have no complaints. It is a thick lotion but does not feel heavy or greasy on you. You won&#x27;t be sorry you tried it. For a product that is not available in the big box stores and is considered more of a specialty face product, the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Light, non-greasy moisturizer with spf-good choice for sensitive skin. good deal to get 3 in one package.  dml reliable brand.</li>
            <li> It is great I&#x27;ve uses it 5 yrs!!!</li>
            <li> GREAT MOISTURIZER! ITEM WAS PACKAGED WELL!</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I was tired of walking the aisles at the pharmacy trying to make a decision on what to buy. I love DML. It contains sunscreen and makes my skin feel moisturized and smooth.</li>
            <li> I could never find a face lotion with SPF that didn&#x27;t burn or tingle. DML is so moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t burn at all. I don&#x27;t ever see myself switching to anything else...hope they never discontinue it!</li>
            <li> Excellent for mature skin.</li>
            <li> I love DML facial moisturizer because it has SPF 25, and it moisturizes well without leaving your face overly greasy and it hasn&#x27;t made my face break out at all.</li>
            <li> What I love most about this moisturizer is the SPF 25. Not a lot of moisturizers have that much SPF. Most usually only have 15. I just love it!</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by a close friend who said it was recommended to her by a dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;It is outstanding:  no perfume, readily absorbed, truly protective of face skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It is light and non-greasy.  I tend to have dry skin, and this product moisturizes very well.  I&#x27;m a big fan of DML in general.</li>
            <li> I first got a sample from my dermatologist. It&#x27;s a very light moisturizer that feels good on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered it several times.</li>
            <li> I first purchased this sunscreen moisturizer cream from my derm dr office. Covers well and I like the SPF factor. Non greasy.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin and my dermatologist suggested I purchase this moisturizer, esp as we live in Key West much of the year and using one that already has SPF 25 is a good idea by itself.  If it is humid outside, it does take a little time to be absorbed and then makeup ready, so I just adjust my schedule.</li>
            <li> Great product and price. Cheaper than buying from my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product several years since I picked up a sample in my dermatologist&#x27;s office. It comes in a pack of 3 when I order in on Amazon,so lasts a long time.  It goes on thick, but feels soothing.  It has a SPF 25 skin factor which I need as I have fair skin and a family history of skin cancer.</li>
            <li> I love the hyaluronic acid in this product.  I just wish they would add some zinc for better sun protection!</li>
            <li> love how this works for dry skin</li>
