            <li>It&#x27;s an excellent drug store make up!</li>
            <li>and  this is THE BEST powder compact I have ever used.</li>
            <li>and it came intact, completely perfect.</li>
            <li>and it is perfect.</li>
            <li>This is awesome matte powder at a great price.</li>
            <li>Good product for the money!</li>
            <li>Great for touch ups during the day, not cakey at all.</li>
            <li>I was really happy ðŸ˜Š  </li>
            <li>Covers great,</li>
            <li>Light and airy powder, that is perfect for making my skin look flawless.</li>
            <li>Honestly don&#x27;t know how I lived without this!</li>
            <li>good product for the money you spend, will recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li>What I need to do each day to feel good about myself has changed as time has passed.</li>
            <li>But I must say, it does a good job at matte-ifying your face.</li>
            <li>Good thing</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Good for mattifying your foundation.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good.</li>
            <li>and this works good on me.</li>
            <li>This is okay &amp; the price was great</li>
            <li>I have seen better powders out there!</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>I love this powder!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>This is a nice powder.</li>
            <li>Beautiful color, smooth and very light on your skin.</li>
            <li>This is a great powder, it goes on easy and is the perfect color (I got creamy natural)</li>
            <li>both the plastic cap and powder is VERY easy to break.</li>
            <li>Although the color seems to be too light, it blends well on fair skin.</li>
            <li>What an amazing deal for a matte powder I love.</li>
            <li>Through my 30&#x27;s, all I had to apply was eyeliner and if my hair was right, things were great.</li>
            <li>But now I&#x27;ve realized that there is a huge difference between looking washed out without makeup and the right makeup applied that makes me look and feel good!</li>
            <li>I love Rimmel Stay Matte Pressed Powder.  </li>
            <li>I bought a shade lighter this time around and love it.  </li>
            <li>Just love the smell of it</li>
            <li>love this powder.</li>
            <li>However, I would absolutely love this if it was stronger and more durable.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Its OK ...wish it came with a puff thing to apply it with.</li>
            <li>Totally satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Love the matte finish</li>
            <li>It is the only powder that makes my skin flawless and has a velvety matte finish.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more soon</li>
            <li>I am very happy with Rimmel Stay Matte and have ordered multiple times for myself and friends!</li>
            <li>This is a bit wasteful, on my part, but I like this powder foundation and am pleased with the application and color.</li>
            <li>First things first--if my skin looks good, that&#x27;s most important!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good for the price</li>
            <li>I was really excited for this product to come in because I love being matte.</li>
            <li>now it&#x27;s more useful and more sturdy....</li>
            <li>Easy to apply with a brush.  </li>
            <li>But for a quick touch up, its OK.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised at how good I think it is because of how cheap it is.  </li>
            <li>My skin is light but never the lightest shades.</li>
            <li>but it seems to stay very good unlike other powders i&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li>I would love it more if they could change the casing that&#x27;s more durable and easier to open and close.</li>
            <li>From there I can add more to dress up (and I often do add shadow and eyeliner), but otherwise I&#x27;m ready to GO!</li>
            <li>Ended up using a tissue paper which worked just fine, although I think that an appropriate applicator would do the job much</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cheap, because I&#x27;m not mad about having to purchase another one.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin, and very good skin for age 60, but do have some sunspots and minor wrinkles and flaws .</li>
            <li>I like full coverage.</li>
            <li>Love this product so much.</li>
            <li>Really, its amazing how a quick application of (for me with dry skin) moisturizer, then Rimmel Lasting Finish foundation, then this pressed powder makes a perfect finish to my skin that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Then, after a week or so, the cover broke in my purse (which luckily I could fix with some glue).</li>
            <li>Nice matte finish on my face that makes my skin look soft and natural. :)</li>
            <li>Unlike many mineral powders, there is no glittery or shiny mica to settle into my fine lines and accentuate them further.</li>
            <li>Great coverage without looking heavy.</li>
            <li>The shade I bought is Creamy Natural and love it.  </li>
            <li>With that, I look awake and fresh.</li>
            <li>Nice quality for a low price.</li>
            <li>I love this powder and buy it frequently.</li>
            <li>I rarely use makeup, but when I want to even out  </li>
            <li>Right now, i have 5 units in my cart - for me and for giving away to my aunts.</li>
            <li>I put it on right after I put on bronzer because I have an e.l.f. bronzer, which has a shimmer</li>
            <li>Overall, this product would be so much better served to customers as a compact with an included applicator and mirror....</li>
            <li>And it really lasts!</li>
            <li>Love it, I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li>It was my first time trying this make up</li>
            <li>but I wanted the EXACT.</li>
            <li>Wish it was more translucent actually but still works</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s  the exact color and number</li>
            <li>Its good enough that I can use it as a light foundation to even out my skintone or lighten the dark circles under my eyes and it makes my skin feel soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is fine enough that I do not need liquid makeup or concealer, but do like coverage to even out my complexion</li>
            <li>Its amazing and works for my oily uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li>The price on amazon is much cheaper than at any store.</li>
            <li>but really, the company should have sold it to me that way.</li>
            <li>So this really does the trick for getting rid of that shine but keeping the color.</li>
            <li>Let me start off by saying I have really oily skin.</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>While I still love the mineral veil product, the $18 price tag is rough for a college student.</li>
            <li>This product settles into fine lines and makes the face look dry and cakey.</li>
            <li>Natural-looking powder, works nicely for spot-coverage with a small shadow brush.</li>
            <li>Actually, I use a nice quality makeup brush and apply it like loose powder, although it is a pressed powder.</li>
            <li>I got it in creamy natural and it was more tan than I expected</li>
            <li>I love this but the only thing I have to complain about is how fragile this is.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take very long and its worth feeling pretty.</li>
            <li>I do wish I had gotten a little darker color, but it works fine as is.  </li>
            <li>the one hand, it does exactly what&#x27;s advertised: it gets rid of shine (caused by oily skin in my case), lasts a fairly long time (~4 hours for me) and matches my skintone well.</li>
            <li>I put it on in the early morning and it lasted all through the day and</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really stay matte for long.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s hard to when they break so easily....</li>
            <li>I ended up having to buy a pack to keep one in there, because there was no other way to use it on the go.</li>
            <li>I have super pale skin</li>
            <li>Occasionally, and especially if it&#x27;s been a long or particularly hot day</li>
            <li>After trying a lot of powders that either looked cake or didn&#x27;t hide the oily sheen on my face, I have been a Bare Minerals user.</li>
            <li>Having used and tried many different expensive mineral makeup products, I appreciate the extremely low cost and high quality of Stay Matte.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll go for a little more color in the next round.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ll go for a little more color in the next round.</li>
            <li> I can get this powder for $4 and it lasts just as long with almost the same results.</li>
            <li> First time it came in the mail, it was completely cracked and broken due to shipping.</li>
            <li> Keeps my face matte all day long.</li>
            <li> I have tried using less of the product and different brushes with the product</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased locally.  </li>
            <li> That, plus blush--with a little blush in the crease of my eyelid, a swipe of lipstick and some mascara--IS my BASIC routine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit lighter than expected, and I wish it came with an applicator and mirror, but I should have realized it didn&#x27;t have either.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I like to carry powder in my purse and the lid is loose and does not clip shut, which can make a mess in the purse, but that is a minor problem.</li>
            <li> Prevents my face from getting oily after a few hours.</li>
            <li> In fact I made mine into that by buying a 2.5 inch round mirror that I glued into the lid--</li>
            <li> It really sucks.</li>
            <li> It also can look chalky; not a good look.</li>
            <li> But I receive this product broken.</li>
            <li> Not great for oil control.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed, because if you even try to use it when you open it a million pieces falls onto the floor</li>
            <li> Powder was broken into bits when arrived:(</li>
            <li> so I was unhappy with that</li>
            <li> and I hate shimmery products.</li>

I wear it over a primer and foundation and the final outcome is a non-greasy, non-shiny face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does NOT come with an applicator, something I missed while reading the description so I had to hunt in my make up drawer for something to apply it with. Ended up using a tissue paper which worked just fine, although I think that an appropriate applicator would do the job much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is a nice powder. It&#x27;s a bit lighter than expected, and I wish it came with an applicator and mirror, but I should have realized it didn&#x27;t have either. For this reason, it stays in the makeup drawer instead of being used on the go.</li>
            <li> Great coverage without looking heavy.</li>
            <li> Prevents my face from getting oily after a few hours.</li>
            <li> This is like the dupe of MAC lightful. Although the color seems to be too light, it blends well on fair skin. The fact that it is cheaper than MAC and works the same as MY ALL TIME FAVE MAC lightful, i&#x27;m going for this instead. Right now, i have 5 units in my cart - for me and for giving away to my aunts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as matte as I&#x27;d like it to be. I like full coverage. The price on amazon is much cheaper than at any store. Will likely buy again.</li>
            <li> I have SUCH mixed feelings about this product...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the one hand, it does exactly what&#x27;s advertised: it gets rid of shine (caused by oily skin in my case), lasts a fairly long time (~4 hours for me) and matches my skintone well. Its good enough that I can use it as a light foundation to even out my skintone or lighten the dark circles under my eyes and it makes my skin feel soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there is NO APPLICATOR! I ended up having to buy a pack to keep one in there, because there was no other way to use it on the go. Then, after a week or so, the cover broke in my purse (which luckily I could fix with some glue). Overall, this product would be so much better served to customers as a compact with an included applicator and mirror.... In fact I made mine into that by buying a 2.5 inch round mirror that I glued into the lid-- now it&#x27;s more useful and more sturdy....but really, the company should have sold it to me that way.</li>
            <li> Honestly don&#x27;t know how I lived without this! Love this product so much. I put it on right after I put on bronzer because I have an e.l.f. bronzer, which has a shimmer and I hate shimmery products. So this really does the trick for getting rid of that shine but keeping the color. And it really lasts! I put it on in the early morning and it lasted all through the day and even the night, I didn&#x27;t have to reapply. t think I&#x27;m even going to buy the transparent one to try. Love it, I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great for touch ups during the day, not cakey at all.</li>
            <li> I would love it more if they could change the casing that&#x27;s more durable and easier to open and close.</li>
            <li> Natural-looking powder, works nicely for spot-coverage with a small shadow brush.</li>
            <li> I got it in creamy natural and it was more tan than I expected so I was unhappy with that but it seems to stay very good unlike other powders i&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying I have really oily skin. This product settles into fine lines and makes the face look dry and cakey. I have tried using less of the product and different brushes with the product but I don&#x27;t see any differences. It really sucks. I have seen better powders out there!</li>
            <li> I love Rimmel Stay Matte Pressed Powder.  I bought a shade lighter this time around and love it.  The shade I bought is Creamy Natural and love it.  I receive a $50 Amazon gift card from a service I provided online and so please I got to buy a bunch of products I needed.</li>
            <li> this is my holly grail matte powder</li>
            <li> I was really excited for this product to come in because I love being matte. But I receive this product broken.</li>
            <li> What I need to do each day to feel good about myself has changed as time has passed. Through my 30&#x27;s, all I had to apply was eyeliner and if my hair was right, things were great. But now I&#x27;ve realized that there is a huge difference between looking washed out without makeup and the right makeup applied that makes me look and feel good! First things first--if my skin looks good, that&#x27;s most important! Really, its amazing how a quick application of (for me with dry skin) moisturizer, then Rimmel Lasting Finish foundation, then this pressed powder makes a perfect finish to my skin that lasts all day. That, plus blush--with a little blush in the crease of my eyelid, a swipe of lipstick and some mascara--IS my BASIC routine. With that, I look awake and fresh. From there I can add more to dress up (and I often do add shadow and eyeliner), but otherwise I&#x27;m ready to GO! It doesn&#x27;t take very long and its worth feeling pretty. The powder is essential. This is THE one I buy.</li>
            <li> Excellent drugstore product. Keeps my face matte all day long. Sometimes I just use concealer, the Rimmel powder, and a swipe of mascara and that&#x27;s it!</li>
            <li> Powder was broken into bits when arrived:(</li>
            <li> I was really happy ðŸ˜Š  I got two of the even though it doesn&#x27;t say in the description. Nice quality for a low price. Just love the smell of it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good for the price</li>
            <li> love this powder. Covers great,</li>
            <li> I love this but the only thing I have to complain about is how fragile this is. I have had 2 of these and both the plastic cap and powder is VERY easy to break. I have had cracks in both of them... I never even dropped them! I like to take these wherever I go and it&#x27;s hard to when they break so easily.... But I must say, it does a good job at matte-ifying your face. Good thing it&#x27;s cheap, because I&#x27;m not mad about having to purchase another one. However, I would absolutely love this if it was stronger and more durable.</li>
            <li> I was exicitied to buy this product but when it came if was cracking and in crumbles!  I was very disappointed, because if you even try to use it when you open it a million pieces falls onto the floor/desk/ whatever.</li>
            <li> It was my first time trying this make up and I love it.  I was very surprised at how good I think it is because of how cheap it is.  It&#x27;s an excellent drug store make up!</li>
            <li> Its OK ...wish it came with a puff thing to apply it with.</li>
            <li> Good product. Very inexpensive. There is no pad to put the powder on so hopefully you already have some on hand.</li>
            <li> First time it came in the mail, it was completely cracked and broken due to shipping. I requested a replacement and the order was put I&#x27;m immediately upon request. It arrived two days later. Its amazing and works for my oily uneven skin tone. Definitely will buy again.</li>
            <li> Good for mattifying your foundation.</li>
            <li> This is a great powder, it goes on easy and is the perfect color (I got creamy natural) My skin is light but never the lightest shades.It also helps with shine control.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Rimmel Stay Powder before so I ordered this on Amazon because it was only $3 and some change but I didn&#x27;t realize that I would be getting TWO of them for the price of one! What an amazing deal for a matte powder I love. Totally satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply with a brush.  Love the matte finish and it seems to not accentuate any wrinkles.  I do wish I had gotten a little darker color, but it works fine as is.  I&#x27;ll go for a little more color in the next round.</li>
            <li> Use this for buffing my makeup and I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> This is okay &amp; the price was great but I wanted the EXACT. SAME. PRODUCT. I had previously purchased locally.  That is not at all what I got.  I received 2 powders.  Maybe this formula will grow on me.</li>
            <li> I love this powder and buy it frequently.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, and very good skin for age 60, but do have some sunspots and minor wrinkles and flaws . My skin is fine enough that I do not need liquid makeup or concealer, but do like coverage to even out my complexion and  this is THE BEST powder compact I have ever used. Having used and tried many different expensive mineral makeup products, I appreciate the extremely low cost and high quality of Stay Matte. It is the only powder that makes my skin flawless and has a velvety matte finish. Unlike many mineral powders, there is no glittery or shiny mica to settle into my fine lines and accentuate them further. My only complaint is that I like to carry powder in my purse and the lid is loose and does not clip shut, which can make a mess in the purse, but that is a minor problem.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to when finishing up my makeup. Just pat the stuff all over and I&#x27;m good. Occasionally, and especially if it&#x27;s been a long or particularly hot day, I&#x27;ll need a touch-up here and there but sometimes I don&#x27;t need to do so at all. To give you a clue in terms of color, I&#x27;m the girl who automatically buys the lightest shade of makeup, and this one works well for me.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more soon I have already hit pan on it. This is awesome matte powder at a great price.</li>
            <li> Good product for the money!</li>
            <li> Wish it was more translucent actually but still works</li>
            <li> I love this powder! After trying a lot of powders that either looked cake or didn&#x27;t hide the oily sheen on my face, I have been a Bare Minerals user. While I still love the mineral veil product, the $18 price tag is rough for a college student. I can get this powder for $4 and it lasts just as long with almost the same results. I am very happy with Rimmel Stay Matte and have ordered multiple times for myself and friends!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  the exact color and number I was looking for and it came within three days of ordering it. I love it! Just like the one I got in stores and it came intact, completely perfect.</li>
            <li> I rarely use makeup, but when I want to even out  my skin tone this powder is lightweight and does the trick. It does not cake or smear and keeps the shine away.  Actually, I use a nice quality makeup brush and apply it like loose powder, although it is a pressed powder. This is a bit wasteful, on my part, but I like this powder foundation and am pleased with the application and color.</li>
            <li> I have super pale skin and this works good on me. I use a bit of foundation, and this over it and it is perfect. Nice matte finish on my face that makes my skin look soft and natural. :)</li>
            <li> Not great for oil control. It also can look chalky; not a good look. But for a quick touch up, its OK.</li>
