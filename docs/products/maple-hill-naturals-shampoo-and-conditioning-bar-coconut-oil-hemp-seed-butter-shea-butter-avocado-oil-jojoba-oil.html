            <li>My family is n love with the bar shampoos!</li>
            <li>I got the fragrance free - great for my hair.  </li>
            <li>Also, I recommend you condition your hair with some kind of vinegar (I use apple cider vinegar)</li>
            <li>which to me is the hardest part to be honest because I am used to</li>
            <li>Smells great, and leaves my hair feeling clean but not dry.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It has a very strong smell as you&#x27;re washing your hair but goes away after you rinse it out.</li>
            <li>I loved the smell of the lavender one, but my hair is fine and it was too conditioning.  </li>
            <li>Any recommendations on conditioners to accompany a natural shampoo would be excellent!</li>
            <li>Anyway, this product came very quickly and the scent was heavenly!</li>
            <li>BUT OVERALL, this is a great shampoo and is great for animal and earth-loving people :)</li>
            <li>The soap lathers wonderfully and cleans my hair very well to the point that it is squeaky clean, without it feeling stripped.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the best minty feeling made my hair feel great clean and super soft</li>

            <li>This is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used--and I&#x27;m totally going to stick with it!</li>
            <li>I love the convenience of bar shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I have already repurchased this bar of shampoo in this and every scent because I really enjoy this product and don&#x27;t ever want to run out!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll defining be buying more of this.</li>
            <li>is more like a treatment for my hair.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t leave my hair sticky or dry best hair soap in the world .not</li>
            <li>I am supplementing this with additional conditioner once a week as my hair strips easily, however it doesn&#x27;t yet seem to be stripping my hair any more than the bottle shampoo/conditioners.</li>
            <li>This rinses better in hot water followed up with some cooler warm water.</li>
            <li>my hair is easy to comb thru afterwards.</li>
            <li>the lather felt rich and creamy</li>
            <li>Well worth the price!</li>
            <li>Amazing natural shampoo.</li>
            <li>I agree with the other review that the shine is great.  </li>
            <li>Depletes quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only just started using it, but it is so much better than I was expecting!</li>
            <li>But not as economical as a bottle of shampoo.</li>
            <li>So I tried for weeks to get the right combo for my hair.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using a shampoo bar</li>
            <li>While I LOVE the scent of this product as well as the tingle of the peppermint oil on my scalp, I can say I don&#x27;t love it simply because it leaves my long hair so tangled without any conditioner.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using natural products that don&#x27;t use much packaging.  </li>
            <li>use a mild natural hair shampoo on my hair and THEN use this bar shampoo over it.&lt;br /&gt;-Leave</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>I really like the shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It really deserves zero stars.</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t repeat the whole thing for those days.</li>
            <li>It rinses clean and my hair is left bouncy with volume, shiny, and manageable.</li>
            <li>a light natural conditioner to try to get the waxy feeling out and get the curls un-stuck (comb it using a wide tooth comb or my favorite a detangling brush such as this http://www.amazon.com/Benair-Detangling-Multi-height-Bristles-Staggered/dp/B00OTLOHY6/ref&#x3D;sr_1_13?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1426673281&amp;sr&#x3D;8-13&amp;keywords&#x3D;detangling+hair+brush) to get some of still stuck curls).</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming and actually has a subtle sweet and clean scent.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather like a normal shampoo</li>
            <li>My hair used to be greasy when i used normal bottle shampoo, now my hair is..</li>
            <li>The first time I used the bar, I used too much, so I had some residue left over.</li>
            <li>Then I read about how great shampoo bars are, and with dumb luck i came across this exact Maple Hill Naturals shampoo bar in Peppermint and looked at it multiple times for weeks before actually purchasing it.</li>
            <li>One day I do not wash my hair, the second day I wash it ONLY with the light natural conditioner.</li>
            <li>all the other reviews people say it didn&#x27;t clean there</li>
            <li>This is a large enough bar that it could easily be split in half or thirds and would be plenty for a short trip.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very short right now so any texture changes aren&#x27;t very obvious.</li>
            <li>I started using shampoo bars earlier this year after being let down by many different types all natural shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li>We tried them for the first time last year and were totally sold!</li>
            <li>or your hair might be a little filmy--but even without the vinegar its not bad and by the time my hair dries there is no film in by hair.</li>
            <li>I have thick, fine textured, loose curly hair.</li>
            <li>Hair is bouncy shiny and looks healthy without any other product (except on the second day I use a little of hair oil to keep frizz down).</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it!!  I got the fragrance free - great for my hair.  I loved the smell of the lavender one, but my hair is fine and it was too conditioning.  Fragrance free ids just perfect!</li>
            <li> I have been trying to go &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; for awhile now and nothing was working. Then I read about how great shampoo bars are, and with dumb luck i came across this exact Maple Hill Naturals shampoo bar in Peppermint and looked at it multiple times for weeks before actually purchasing it. ITS AMAZING, and IT LATHERS! It doesn&#x27;t lather like a normal shampoo but it does lather, which i love! I use this to shampoo, then apple cider vinegar on the ends of my hair as a rinse. My hair used to be greasy when i used normal bottle shampoo, now my hair is..dare i say luscious?  its shiny, has volume, no grease, and i can shampoo every other/ every two day(s). Seriously just try it. Also, i am allergic to coconut in any form, but even though this bar does have coconut in it i have NO allergic reaction. I am only in my twenties, but i know i will be a customer for life. I cant say how long the bar lasts for being that i only got it a few weeks ago, but when washing i cut a small chunk off to use in the shower and keep the rest in the container it came in. When i am finished with this bar i want to try the lavender one. Seriously, just give it a go.</li>
            <li> I love it it&#x27;s the best minty feeling made my hair feel great clean and super soft all the other reviews people say it didn&#x27;t clean there hair don&#x27;t know what there talking about my hair is short hair male and it didn&#x27;t leave my hair sticky or dry best hair soap in the world .not a waste of money .</li>
            <li> I would give negative star&#x27;s if I could it&#x27;s horrible and leaves my hair super greasy looking. So not satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a shampoo bar and I really like it. It gave my hair a squeaky cleaning feel that I needed  and the smell wash great it lingered on for days  the lather felt rich and creamy</li>
            <li> Amazing natural shampoo. On my second purchase</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used--and I&#x27;m totally going to stick with it! It has a very strong smell as you&#x27;re washing your hair but goes away after you rinse it out. Also, I recommend you condition your hair with some kind of vinegar (I use apple cider vinegar) or your hair might be a little filmy--but even without the vinegar its not bad and by the time my hair dries there is no film in by hair. BUT OVERALL, this is a great shampoo and is great for animal and earth-loving people :)</li>
            <li> I love the convenience of bar shampoo.  I agree with the other review that the shine is great.  I have found bar shampoo to be an exceptional item for travel as well as home use.  In one bar, you have shampoo, conditioner, body wash and facial wash if desired.  This is a large enough bar that it could easily be split in half or thirds and would be plenty for a short trip.  I intend to buy the 5-pack when I finish this bar.</li>
            <li> I really like the shampoo.  And I like the fact that I don&#x27;t have to use additional conditioner.  I enjoy using natural products that don&#x27;t use much packaging.  And this fits the bill.  I had to get accustomed to the feel of my hair after using it, but I don&#x27;t intend to return to liquid shampoo after using this product.</li>
            <li> Great for travel. Lasts a reasonably long time. But not as economical as a bottle of shampoo.</li>
            <li> It really deserves zero stars. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this stuff once and it completely dried out and damaged my hair.  I couldn&#x27;t even get a wide-toothed comb through my hair at all, it was so matted and tangled.  Two deep-conditionings later and my hair still feels like straw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avoid this product unless you are already bald!</li>
            <li> Product left my hair feeling waxy and seperated into dread like strands that never felt dry. Tried using it several times in an attempt to get past the &amp;#34;funky hair phase&amp;#34; mentioned in other reviews. It never happened.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming and actually has a subtle sweet and clean scent. I have thick, fine textured, loose curly hair. This shampoo and conditioning bar has changed the texture a little bit, my curls are tightening up and my hair&#x27;s volume is increasing. The first time I used the bar, I used too much, so I had some residue left over. This rinses better in hot water followed up with some cooler warm water. I am supplementing this with additional conditioner once a week as my hair strips easily, however it doesn&#x27;t yet seem to be stripping my hair any more than the bottle shampoo/conditioners.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only just started using it, but it is so much better than I was expecting! My hair is very short right now so any texture changes aren&#x27;t very obvious. I CAN brush through my hair with fingers or hairbrush (unlike the last natural soap I tried) and my hair feels &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; and not too oily or weighed down. Instant fan.</li>
            <li> While I LOVE the scent of this product as well as the tingle of the peppermint oil on my scalp, I can say I don&#x27;t love it simply because it leaves my long hair so tangled without any conditioner. While it shampoos perfectly, condition it does not. Any recommendations on conditioners to accompany a natural shampoo would be excellent! I am using argan oil but at times it doesn&#x27;t seem to kick the tangles!</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel greasy</li>
            <li> This shampoo bar is excellent! I started using shampoo bars earlier this year after being let down by many different types all natural shampoos and conditioners. I had tried other shampoo bars in the past, however they always left a residue and buildup which made my hair limp and greasy. This bar changed that. It rinses clean and my hair is left bouncy with volume, shiny, and manageable. I do not have to use a conditioner or any other products in my hair anymore. The soap lathers wonderfully and cleans my hair very well to the point that it is squeaky clean, without it feeling stripped. my hair is easy to comb thru afterwards. Also, the scent and feeling of the peppermint oil is very refreshing. I have already repurchased this bar of shampoo in this and every scent because I really enjoy this product and don&#x27;t ever want to run out! I can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
            <li> Cleanses good but leaves my hair too oily.</li>
            <li> I found that this just did not clean my hair, always felt like there was residue left that really built up after a few washes.</li>
            <li> Leaves a waxy residue. Depletes quickly.</li>
            <li> My family is n love with the bar shampoos! We tried them for the first time last year and were totally sold! Anyway, this product came very quickly and the scent was heavenly! Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> Smells great, and leaves my hair feeling clean but not dry.&lt;br /&gt;I like bar shampoo and I&#x27;ll defining be buying more of this. I just wish I could &amp;#34;subscribe&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Alright, so it took me a long time to get used to this shampoo bar and figured out what the heck was I doing.

However, I had already spend the money and needed to figure out a way to make this darn thing work for me. So I tried for weeks to get the right combo for my hair. It turns out that this is not a bar shampoo that I can just get in my hair and rinse out. I have after weeks come up with this routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-First use a mild natural hair shampoo on my hair and THEN use this bar shampoo over it.&lt;br /&gt;-Leave it for 3-5 minutes in my hair like a conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;-Rinse the mixture out. DO NOT OVERLY TRY TO GET IT OUT. Just rinse it (don&#x27;t try to comb it either).&lt;br /&gt;-Use a light natural conditioner to try to get the waxy feeling out and get the curls un-stuck (comb it using a wide tooth comb or my favorite a detangling brush such as this http://www.amazon.com/Benair-Detangling-Multi-height-Bristles-Staggered/dp/B00OTLOHY6/ref&#x3D;sr_1_13?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1426673281&amp;sr&#x3D;8-13&amp;keywords&#x3D;detangling+hair+brush) to get some of still stuck curls). Sometimes this step is not needed.&lt;br /&gt;-Rinse the conditioner out&lt;br /&gt;-DO NOT COMB AFTER SHOWER (which to me is the hardest part to be honest because I am used to it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so I realize after all this that this is not a shampoo is more like a treatment for my hair. After I sorted out this mess it works wonders. I mean it looks like I have curls made my a curling iron for like 2-3 days (I don&#x27;t repeat the whole thing for those days. One day I do not wash my hair, the second day I wash it ONLY with the light natural conditioner. Hair is bouncy shiny and looks healthy without any other product (except on the second day I use a little of hair oil to keep frizz down).</li>
