            <li>Love OPI polish!</li>
            <li>In true OPI fashion, this color is beautiful and the quality of the polish is exceptional.</li>
            <li>I even had someone comment that is was a nice brown.  </li>
            <li>This color is NOT as nice as the picture.</li>
            <li>So glad that I was able to find this nail color!  </li>
            <li>My favorite color of all.</li>
            <li>Love OPI polish, I have so so many polishes</li>
            <li>I always love the quality of opi polishes.</li>
            <li>and i love the color.</li>
            <li>JUST LOVE OPI THANKYOU</li>
            <li>I love OPI nailpolish and it does not disappoint.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Satisfied.</li>
            <li>This is the PERFECT deep purple.  </li>
            <li>As always, OPI delivers a quality formula with a stunning impact.  </li>
            <li>It is magnificent, fine as on the Picture, corresponds to the Description, fast Delivery, high Quality of a product, I am completely satisfied with Purchase</li>
            <li>This is just one more fabulous OPI color that I added to my growing collection.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Loved the color so much i had to order for myself.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had some true hit and misses with OPI polishes, but this is one that is a 5 star A+ in my book!</li>
            <li>Product arrived QUICKLY!</li>
            <li>Creamy and rich and covers in one application.</li>
            <li>It arrived 3 days after my order date, which was two full days before the earliest predicted day of arrival.</li>
            <li>It doesnt worth returning</li>
            <li>Great polish as always with OPI, but the color shown is not accurate.</li>
            <li>The only reason it got 4 stars is because the picture makes it look purple which I loved when it actually came as more of a maroon burgundy color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful color, but it is actually a deep red rather than a purple.</li>
            <li>It also dries quickly which is very convenient.</li>
            <li>which disppointed me very much.</li>
            <li>glad I got this color, and plan on wearing it regularly.</li>
            <li>it is a bit lighter than the gel version, but still a very solid purple. :)</li>
            <li>have used only OPI products for many years and will continue to do</li>
            <li>Pretty though.</li>
            <li>Was just as describe and exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love glow-y, deep purples with a bit of shimmer for Fall.</li>
            <li>The color looks maroon on the outside of the bottle, but I knew better.  </li>
            <li>I first saw this color in a salon.  </li>
            <li>The color is also pretty, just not what I had wanted.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more orange and less purple, but changes based on the light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really good option if you&#x27;re looking for a deep red nail polish.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s deep, almost black, purple with a beautiful shimmer.</li>
            <li>Usually they have really good products.  </li>
            <li>Very nice, not too dark, not too purple, not too red.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great formula, not streaky or thin.</li>
            <li>shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>It took 2 coats of the polish for full opacity, and I only had to touch up two chips over the week that I wore it.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>3 days from placing the order WOW!.</li>
            <li>Love this dark, smokey purple and the flashes of red in it!  </li>
            <li>The picture is not at all true to the color as it&#x27;s actually a very deep red and the picture makes it seem purple.</li>
            <li>but after that it pretty much looks black.</li>
            <li>It is also a very opaque color, so you may only need one coat which is such a time saver.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it lasts a long time on its own, even without a base or a top coat.</li>
            <li>Very dark and pretty.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Very dark and pretty.</li>
            <li> And like every other O.P.I polish, it lasts much longer than other brands!</li>
            <li> deep dark reddish, purple, blue combo!</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than expected.  </li>
            <li> I realize different computers/screens may show colors incorrectly but even the description does not fit the actual color.  </li>
            <li> In low lighting it can look almost black.</li>
            <li> I wanted purple nails, but something a little different.  </li>
            <li> Still ravishing, just not what I expected.</li>
            <li> This color is dark, but still has color.</li>
            <li> The base of this polish is a gorgeous purple, you can see the base on the first coat</li>
            <li> I would recommend using a base coat if your nails stain easily from dark polishes.</li>
            <li> #34;WOWWWW&amp;#34; when they see it or I show them, and their eyes bulge a little.  </li>
            <li> It is a very, very dark purple/maroon.  </li>
            <li> Oktoberfest\\&quot; is a blackened version of \\&quot;Fantasy Fire\\&quot; with the same deep redened purple base with red and gold shimmer.</li>
            <li> It has a dark red base with red shimmer.</li>
            <li> which is why I bought it, but for someone who is just looking at the picture, it could be confusing.</li>
            <li> Sad to say, and I made a mistake when I ordered and got two!</li>
            <li> Sad day!</li>
            <li> :(  </li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>

            <li> My favorite color of all. The only one I wear from September-March</li>
            <li> love this color!  deep dark reddish, purple, blue combo!</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this nail polish! It has a dark red base with red shimmer. It&#x27;s a really good option if you&#x27;re looking for a deep red nail polish. In low lighting it can look almost black. I would recommend using a base coat if your nails stain easily from dark polishes. Otherwise, it lasts a long time on its own, even without a base or a top coat. It is also a very opaque color, so you may only need one coat which is such a time saver. It also dries quickly which is very convenient.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color, quality and presentation.  I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Used this product in this color at my nail salon.  Wanted some at home for touch-ups, etc.  This color is dark, but still has color.</li>
            <li> Loved the color, but it chipped off in no time which is surprising for O.P.I. Usually they have really good products.  Not too happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It is magnificent, fine as on the Picture, corresponds to the Description, fast Delivery, high Quality of a product, I am completely satisfied with Purchase</li>
            <li> Like others have said, the color isn&#x27;t as advertised in the photos or the descriptions.  It is a very, very dark purple/maroon.  I even had someone comment that is was a nice brown.  :(  Not what I was looking for...  I realize different computers/screens may show colors incorrectly but even the description does not fit the actual color.  Quality wise, it is amazing as are all the OPI polishes I&#x27;ve ever tried.  Creamy and rich and covers in one application.</li>
            <li> Received this within 3 days and it&#x27;s the same color as the pic!  I would definitely recommend this nail polish</li>
            <li> Love OPI polish, I have so so many polishes, it&#x27;s a collecting thing. Never had any issues with them</li>
            <li> I LOVE this color! And it&#x27;s OPI so of course it&#x27;s a good polish. It&#x27;s a great winter color too!</li>
            <li> which disppointed me very much. It doesnt worth returning and I dont know what to do with this gel laquer.</li>
            <li> Love this dark, smokey purple and the flashes of red in it!  Consistent, flawless application and great wear time.  Shame it&#x27;s an LE.</li>
            <li> Another OPI great. I&#x27;ve had some true hit and misses with OPI polishes, but this is one that is a 5 star A+ in my book! It&#x27;s a great formula, not streaky or thin. It took 2 coats of the polish for full opacity, and I only had to touch up two chips over the week that I wore it. It&#x27;s a gorgeous, jewel toned purple, and worked great for winter toned outfits. It did not stain, and came off easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I got this color, and plan on wearing it regularly.</li>
            <li> In true OPI fashion, this color is beautiful and the quality of the polish is exceptional. You can never go Erin with OPI</li>
            <li> Loved the color in the gel one, so bought this one. it is a bit lighter than the gel version, but still a very solid purple. :)</li>
            <li> This is just one more fabulous OPI color that I added to my growing collection.&lt;br /&gt;I have used only OPI products for many years and will continue to do so.&lt;br /&gt;The quality is excellent.  I haven&#x27;t tried all the brands that are out there, but I can vouch for OPI.</li>
            <li> OPI Every Month Is Oktoberfest is a vampy reddish purple shimmer. This polish is GORGEOUS.  The base of this polish is a gorgeous purple, you can see the base on the first coat but after that it pretty much looks black. The formula was superb, fully opaque in two coats.  One of my favorites.</li>
            <li> Great polish as always with OPI, but the color shown is not accurate. It&#x27;s acutally a deep maroon. Pretty though.</li>
            <li> I always love the quality of opi polishes. The picture is not at all true to the color as it&#x27;s actually a very deep red and the picture makes it seem purple. I knew what the color actually looked like which is why I bought it, but for someone who is just looking at the picture, it could be confusing.</li>
            <li> Was just as describe and exactly what I was looking for. OPI makes a good product.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I had this color put on my nails while having a manicure. Loved the color so much i had to order for myself. Quick delivery, product excellent and i love the color. Thank you</li>
            <li> I absolutely love glow-y, deep purples with a bit of shimmer for Fall. I have been looking for Max Factor&#x27;s \\&quot;Fantasy Fire\\&quot; forever, when OPI releases their Germany collection.  \\&quot;Every Month is Oktoberfest\\&quot; is a blackened version of \\&quot;Fantasy Fire\\&quot; with the same deep redened purple base with red and gold shimmer. And it&#x27;s OPI so you know the formula is great-- much better than any Max Factor polish I&#x27;ve ever tried. So if you&#x27;re looking for an excellent vampy purple with a lot of liveliness and depth, \\&quot;Every Month is Oktoberfest\\&quot; is your girl!</li>
            <li> This polish is gorgeous! It&#x27;s deep, almost black, purple with a beautiful shimmer. I can&#x27;t wait to wear it this fall.&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was fast. It arrived 3 days after my order date, which was two full days before the earliest predicted day of arrival.</li>
            <li> I ABSOUTLEY LOVED THIS COLOR AND HAD TO HAVE IT JUST LOVE OPI THANKYOU</li>
            <li> This color is NOT as nice as the picture. Sad to say, and I made a mistake when I ordered and got two! Sad day!</li>
            <li> Very dark and pretty.</li>
            <li> So glad that I was able to find this nail color!  They need to bring it back!  The name says it all!</li>
            <li> The color looks maroon on the outside of the bottle, but I knew better.  I first saw this color in a salon.  I wanted purple nails, but something a little different.  This lacquer did not disappoint.  Very happy with the seller as well.  Arrived earlier than expected.  3 days from placing the order WOW!.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous color! It&#x27;s more orange and less purple, but changes based on the light. And like every other O.P.I polish, it lasts much longer than other brands!</li>
            <li> I love OPI nailpolish and it does not disappoint. The only reason it got 4 stars is because the picture makes it look purple which I loved when it actually came as more of a maroon burgundy color. The color is also pretty, just not what I had wanted.</li>
            <li> This color is like a chameleon.  It looks like a deep crimson red in some lights, then purple in others.  I love it as a fall shade!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Love it. Just what you would expect from O. P. I.  Would definitely do business again. Satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love the color and wears a week+ without chipping for me, which can not be beat!  Love OPI polish!</li>
            <li> This is the PERFECT deep purple.  As always, OPI delivers a quality formula with a stunning impact.  My guy friends say &amp;#34;WOWWWW&amp;#34; when they see it or I show them, and their eyes bulge a little.  So it&#x27;s not just my girl friends who are impressed.  The color is phenomenal, it&#x27;s really perfect.  I would give it 10 stars if I could.</li>
            <li> Very nice, not too dark, not too purple, not too red. Lots of compliments on this shade.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful color, but it is actually a deep red rather than a purple. Still ravishing, just not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Product arrived QUICKLY! beautiful color.</li>
