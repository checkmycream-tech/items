            <li> didnt realize how small product really is!!</li>
            <li> To much money for something so small.</li>
            <li> i thought a little big bottle&lt;</li>
            <li> The expected.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money</li>
            <li> the web the picture show big bottle but is real small</li>
            <li> just want to keep smelling like this everyday at work</li>
            <li> Need a refund for that mess!</li>
            <li> The vials are small in accordance with the product description.</li>
            <li> Pay close attention to the size, as I wrongly assumed that the portions where larger (because of the item&#x27;s image).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this thing is small and is not like the picture at all any way</li>

            <li> I was not happy I didn&#x27;t see anywhere that this was perfume.</li>
            <li> it sucks, it needs to be like 1 $ for how bad it stinks.</li>
            <li> Smell plain awful.  </li>
            <li> This vendor should have no affiliation with Amazon as they are giving a bad name, I am now shopping elsewhere as Amazon lost my business...........</li>
            <li> Bad</li>
            <li> I paied for two products $11.96 ,but just received one, then contect with the seller, the problem did end up with nothing definite,so terrible!</li>
