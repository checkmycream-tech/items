            <li>I bought this product because it said that it was sulfate-free and had good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Still, it is a good shampoo</li>
            <li>Great, produces a lot of suds unlike most shampoo without sulfates.</li>

            <li>so I was pleased to find TIGI&#x27;s Superstar Shampoo &amp; Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>If you like that smell, then you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
            <li>to have more suds when washing my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and great condition.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Many sulfate-free shampoos simply don&#x27;t clean well.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to rinse.  </li>
            <li>Good, natural shampoo...sulfate-free is a buy for me!</li>
            <li>I like the Self Absorbed shampoo and conditioner better.  </li>
            <li>Sulfate free, but no so soapy when washing your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Need</li>
            <li>If not, do not buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: The strawberry smell does not stay with your hair, so even though it is very strong in the bottle, you won&#x27;t smell much like it.</li>
            <li>Bed Head Superstar has a nice strawberry fragrance and lathers nicely without the dry, sticky feeling some non sulfate shampoos give you.</li>
            <li>Please head over there to watch my full review titled \\&quot;Going Sulfate Free</li>
            <li>This SLS free product is super.  </li>
            <li>, i get the results i&#x27;m looking for which is full thicker looking hair.</li>
            <li>This product is the best shampoo I ever used and would recommend it to everyone to at least try it once</li>
            <li>Only option available for this kind is strawberry</li>
            <li>The smell is divine but it has something else in it to make the super bubbly shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Stripped my hair of the keratin treatment too quickly.</li>
            <li>Just used and compared to other sulfate free shampoos, it felt like my hair got a good cleaning.</li>
            <li>It is sulfate free which is important to me and, more importantly, my hair is shiny and fluffy, too.  </li>
            <li>also get tons of complements on my long, very healthy &amp; shiny hair.</li>
            <li>But this shampoo feels and acts just like normal shampoo, which is a huge plus if you&#x27;re pressed for time and don&#x27;t have all day to sit there trying to rinse the shampoo out.</li>
            <li>With other shampoos seems like it take forever to get out the shampoo, but this rinses right out and my hair feel amazing.  </li>
            <li>It also leaves hair pleasantly soft and clean.</li>
            <li>The only downside is the smell is a bit strong and off-putting.</li>
            <li>I am a 34 yrs old male and my hair become very nice soft and naturally shining after i use this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and item was wrapped very well so that it wouldn&#x27;t leak during shipping.</li>
            <li>Like Pez candies, to me.&lt;br /&gt;- Very but not too moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I was nervous about how much lather I&#x27;d get.  </li>
            <li>I really like the TIGI BedHead Superstar shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years now and still love it as much as I did the first time I tried it.</li>
            <li>I almost don&#x27;t have to use conditioner but actually leaves my hair clean &amp;</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic and cleans hair without making it dry or stripping it.  </li>
            <li>I love that the shampoo is sulfate-free so my hair isn&#x27;t being stripped and dried out.</li>
            <li>Love Bed Head but have heard similar reports from people using other brands of sulfate-free shampoo as well.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair looking healthy and thick.  </li>
            <li>and it is hard to feel like I have clean hair without lather, like other SLS free shampoos do.  </li>
            <li>I really like the scent of this product and it makes my colored treated hair easy to manage; no more dry and brittle hair!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not ideal but a good middle ground between price and quality and low toxicity.</li>
            <li>Dry scalp lasted as long as I used this, as soon as I switched back to regular shampoo it was fine again.</li>
            <li>Not only does it prolong the keratin treatment, but I do not have to have my hair colored as frequently as before.  </li>
            <li>Most sulfate free shampoos are not easy to work into a lather, and are difficult to rinse out.</li>
            <li>I have switched completely to non-sulfate shampoos and use several different brands.</li>
            <li>Many leave a film or leave my hair feeling \\&quot;tacky\\&quot; like a lot of oil was left behind.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It definitely will not leave your hair dry.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore that it&#x27;s made for thick hair.</li>
            <li> I recommend this shampoo to those with thick hair that want a new look and formula made for their hair type!</li>
            <li> i will definitely buy more even though i usually buy a less expensive shampoo.</li>
            <li> I only gave this product 4 stars because it is quite expensive for the amount you get in the tube, plus I do not like it quite as much as Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li> and I have tried a lot that don&#x27;t fluff.</li>
            <li> It left my hair completely dead and shineless, though, so I&#x27;d still give it 1 star.</li>
            <li> I got this to prolong the effects of a keratin treatment but as soon as I&#x27;d used it for a few days, my scalp got really dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> and I am DEFINITELY reacting negatively to this product.</li>
            <li> and I appreciate the lightweight formula that Bed Head used to not weight down my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I just got out of the shower a few minutes ago</li>
            <li> My thick, waist length wavy hair is softer and shedding less since I switched.</li>
            <li> I am a little disappointed; I had high hopes for this one.  </li>
            <li> I will always use Bed Head products with my thin limp hair</li>
            <li> I have colored (to hide gray) waist length thick hair already</li>
            <li> My hair is thick to the max</li>
            <li> If you have thin  hair with no  body or lift......</li>
            <li> Afraid I may get landed on by a bee.</li>
            <li> I have a terrible allergy to ammonium lauryl sulfate in shampoos</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Shipping was prompt. Product is always perfect. I will always use Bed Head products with my thin limp hair, i get the results i&#x27;m looking for which is full thicker looking hair. I love this product. Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. :0)</li>
            <li> Good, natural shampoo...sulfate-free is a buy for me!</li>
            <li> Best shampoo for fine hair I have used......and I have tried a lot that don&#x27;t fluff.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years now and still love it as much as I did the first time I tried it. Shipping was fast and item was wrapped very well so that it wouldn&#x27;t leak during shipping.</li>
            <li> I reviewed this sulfate-free shampoo on my youtube channel, beautifullybookish. Please head over there to watch my full review titled \\&quot;Going Sulfate Free -- What&#x27;s The Hype?\\&quot; as I think I explained it best on there. Also, feel free to subscribe for more reviews if you like!</li>
            <li> I started using this product after receiving a keratin treatment on my hair and the hair salon indicated I would need to use a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner in order to prolong the treatment.  Not only does it prolong the keratin treatment, but I do not have to have my hair colored as frequently as before.  It adds volume to my hair, as well.  I even order it for my mother and she loves it, too.  Works best to use both shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Great, produces a lot of suds unlike most shampoo without sulfates. Only option available for this kind is strawberry so I smell like a fruit... Afraid I may get landed on by a bee.</li>
            <li> I have a terrible allergy to ammonium lauryl sulfate in shampoos so I was pleased to find TIGI&#x27;s Superstar Shampoo &amp; Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;- Smells amazing! Like Pez candies, to me.&lt;br /&gt;- Very but not too moisturizing. I almost don&#x27;t have to use conditioner but actually leaves my hair clean &amp; shiny.&lt;br /&gt;- Sulfate-free. Read: Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate-free.  It does contain Sodium C14-18 Olefin Sulfonate which can still be an irritant to some but my allergy is ALS specific. No dermatitis for me, yay!&lt;br /&gt;- Cleans well. I have colored (to hide gray) waist length thick hair already so I shampoo only every 3rd day. Many sulfate-free shampoos simply don&#x27;t clean well. Many leave a film or leave my hair feeling \\&quot;tacky\\&quot; like a lot of oil was left behind. No so with TIGI&#x27;s Superstar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a perfume girl so I alternate with sulfate-free Oscar Blandi line shampoos when I don&#x27;t want to smell quite so \\&quot;fruity\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also get tons of complements on my long, very healthy &amp; shiny hair. Whether simply good genes or good shampoo; my hair looks awesome and no allergic reaction! Win!</li>
            <li> I recently found out that I am sensitive/possibly allergic to sulfates. I bought this product because it said that it was sulfate-free and had good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I just got out of the shower a few minutes ago and I am DEFINITELY reacting negatively to this product. I think the culprit is one of these 2 chemicals:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sodium C14-18 Olefin Sulfonate&lt;br /&gt;Isopropylamine Dodecylbenzenesulfonate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if the above are sulfates, but I know that \\&quot;Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate\\&quot;, \\&quot;Sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate\\&quot;, and \\&quot;TEA-dodecylbenzenesulfonate\\&quot; are either sulfates or made up of sulfates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make of this what you will, but I will NOT be using this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the product smells like strawberry chapstick and/or strawberry soda. If you like that smell, then you&#x27;ll love this. If not, do not buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: The strawberry smell does not stay with your hair, so even though it is very strong in the bottle, you won&#x27;t smell much like it. It left my hair completely dead and shineless, though, so I&#x27;d still give it 1 star.</li>
            <li> I have switched completely to non-sulfate shampoos and use several different brands. Bed Head Superstar has a nice strawberry fragrance and lathers nicely without the dry, sticky feeling some non sulfate shampoos give you. My thick, waist length wavy hair is softer and shedding less since I switched. I only gave this product 4 stars because it is quite expensive for the amount you get in the tube, plus I do not like it quite as much as Burt&#x27;s Bees. Still, it is a good shampoo and I would buy it again, along with the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a medical condition of skin where i am not advised to use soaps with sodium laurel/laureth suphate. From reviews, i bought this shampoo and this turned out to be very good one. I am a 34 yrs old male and my hair become very nice soft and naturally shining after i use this shampoo. It definitely will not leave your hair dry.</li>
            <li> If you have thin  hair with no  body or lift......this stuff ,,,and the shampoo is the best i have ever used</li>
            <li> First of all, this is the best foaming sulfate free shampoo I have EVER used. Most sulfate free shampoos are not easy to work into a lather, and are difficult to rinse out. But this shampoo feels and acts just like normal shampoo, which is a huge plus if you&#x27;re pressed for time and don&#x27;t have all day to sit there trying to rinse the shampoo out. It also leaves hair pleasantly soft and clean. The only downside is the smell is a bit strong and off-putting.</li>
            <li> I like the Self Absorbed shampoo and conditioner better.  I am a little disappointed; I had high hopes for this one.  I will use it up but not buy again.</li>
            <li> I really like the scent of this product and it makes my colored treated hair easy to manage; no more dry and brittle hair! Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This SLS free product is super.  I was nervous about how much lather I&#x27;d get.  I&#x27;m just used to lather and it is hard to feel like I have clean hair without lather, like other SLS free shampoos do.  But no worries, this lathers great and when it rinses it is amazing.  It is so easy to rinse.  With other shampoos seems like it take forever to get out the shampoo, but this rinses right out and my hair feel amazing.  I&#x27;m so thankful that TIGI made this product.  Now, I wish they&#x27;d put it in a big bottle.  LOL</li>
            <li> This shampoo is a toxin-less version. It&#x27;s not ideal but a good middle ground between price and quality and low toxicity.</li>
            <li> I really like the TIGI BedHead Superstar shampoo and conditioner.  Leaves hair looking healthy and thick.  Plus I don&#x27;t have an irritated scalp later on.</li>
            <li> Sulfate free, but no so soapy when washing your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Need to have more suds when washing my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Good product....wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I got this to prolong the effects of a keratin treatment but as soon as I&#x27;d used it for a few days, my scalp got really dry and flaky. Dry scalp lasted as long as I used this, as soon as I switched back to regular shampoo it was fine again. Love Bed Head but have heard similar reports from people using other brands of sulfate-free shampoo as well. Watch out!</li>
            <li> I LOVE TIGI Bed Head Superstar Sulfate-Free Shampoo! I absolutely adore that it&#x27;s made for thick hair. My hair is thick to the max and I appreciate the lightweight formula that Bed Head used to not weight down my hair. I love that the shampoo is sulfate-free so my hair isn&#x27;t being stripped and dried out. The shampoo lathers up nicely and smells great, while the packaging is very pretty. I recommend this shampoo to those with thick hair that want a new look and formula made for their hair type!</li>
            <li> This product is the best shampoo I ever used and would recommend it to everyone to at least try it once and you will be hooked.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and great condition.  I love this shampoo.  It is sulfate free which is important to me and, more importantly, my hair is shiny and fluffy, too.  I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a great shampoo.</li>
            <li> The strawberry smell makes my hair smell yummy. the smell lasts a couple of days, too. i will definitely buy more even though i usually buy a less expensive shampoo.</li>
            <li> Just used and compared to other sulfate free shampoos, it felt like my hair got a good cleaning. Nice smell too. Would recommend</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic and cleans hair without making it dry or stripping it.  I&#x27;ll definitely buy this product again.  You should try it.</li>
            <li> The smell is divine but it has something else in it to make the super bubbly shampoo.  Stripped my hair of the keratin treatment too quickly.</li>
