            <li>This is not as good as it used to be</li>
            <li>Very good product for fine hair.  </li>
            <li>But this shampoo offers great volume with wonderful conditioning properties, as well.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully, if you purchase this product you will have better luck than I have!</li>
            <li>It mostly looks like a stringy mop on my head, and that&#x27;s on a good day.</li>
            <li>It smells great, lathers great, and really does add volume.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, colored hair and happened to come across this shampoo on-line.  </li>

            <li>This one is also a favorite of my teenagers.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Plus I love the smell.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s the most drying sulfate free shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I like this shampoo because it gives my hair body and is easy to style after using.</li>
            <li>This Catwalk Volume shampoo lathers beautifully, rinses out properly and leaves my hair feeling as it should.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine and finicky and it works well and the smell isn&#x27;t as overpowering as some shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It works fine in that regard.</li>
            <li>I find that this shampoo and conditioner smell great and actually do what they promise!!  </li>
            <li>Loved the smell but my hair is very fine and didn&#x27;t notice any difference between that and other like products.</li>
            <li>I have fine straight hair, so I bought this shampoo based on reviews.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it and will buy again.</li>
            <li>I have found that I love all the TIGI Catwalk Volume products that I have tried so far and this shampoo is no exception.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this, very excited that I was able to find it at such a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only able to use it a couple days in a row before I have to switch to another product for a week or so.  </li>
            <li>It really does give great volume and smells great without being sickening sweet.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>very timely sending product.</li>
            <li>and I am 67 years old!!!  </li>
            <li>These products are highly concentrated, which is great, because you only have to use a little.</li>
            <li>I have long and super extra fine hair.</li>
            <li>So hard to find this product anywhere - need more!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this shampoo, the matching conditioner and the sea salt spray from this product line.</li>
            <li>and I love the fullness in my naturally limp hair.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend product to anyone that wants volume an want volume an not flat hair</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have dry scalp issues, this shampoo may be right for you.</li>
            <li>It gives my fine limp hair a lot volume without drying it out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this root boost for a couple of years now - I have reasonably fine hair (although a lot of it) and it doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling heavy or oily.</li>
            <li>Most other volume shampoos dry your hair out.</li>
            <li>My hair is both fine and thin, so it&#x27;s a real challange!  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair, I always use store-brand hair products, and I&#x27;m never satisfied.</li>
            <li>I have to say that in the handful of years since I&#x27;ve last used this product, the manufacturer has managed to change it considerably.  </li>

            <li> I was an avid user of Catwalk for years and started finding it difficult to locate at my local salons, so I switched to other products.  I ordered this, very excited that I was able to find it at such a reasonable price.  I have to say that in the handful of years since I&#x27;ve last used this product, the manufacturer has managed to change it considerably.  I no longer am a devoted follower of this product.  I&#x27;m only able to use it a couple days in a row before I have to switch to another product for a week or so.  If I use this product for longer than a couple days, the buildup on my hair is horrible.  Hopefully, if you purchase this product you will have better luck than I have!</li>
            <li> I have very fine, colored hair and happened to come across this shampoo on-line.  It is one of the BEST shampoos  and conditioners that I have EVER used in my life and I am 67 years old!!!  I find that this shampoo and conditioner smell great and actually do what they promise!!  I now have great smelling hair with fullness and shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This product has not removed the color from my dyed hair--it has enhanced it.  I also have allergies and have had no problems on my scalp or skin with these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CLEARLY OUTSTANDING PRODUCTS!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. It creates great volume when used with the conditioner   and root boost. It gives my fine limp hair a lot volume without drying it out. Great product!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this root boost for a couple of years now - I have reasonably fine hair (although a lot of it) and it doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling heavy or oily. Plus it smells SO GOOD.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, I always use store-brand hair products, and I&#x27;m never satisfied. I love the Tigi Catwalk Volume Collection shampoo, conditioner and thickening gel. Definitely worth it and will buy again. My hair looks great, and I&#x27;ve been getting a lot of compliments! These products are highly concentrated, which is great, because you only have to use a little. Definitely lasts longer. I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is not as good as it used to be</li>
            <li> While I agree with the reviewer who mentioned how this product tend to weigh hair down, it is still a staple in my shower. I tend to alternate between three or four shampoos but this is one of my favs. The scent is wonderful and lingers the next day and I love the fullness in my naturally limp hair. This one is also a favorite of my teenagers.</li>
            <li> I have found that I love all the TIGI Catwalk Volume products that I have tried so far and this shampoo is no exception.  My hair is both fine and thin, so it&#x27;s a real challange!  Other \\&quot;volume\\&quot; shampoos that I have tried tend to not lather that well and to leave my hair feeling too stiff.

I would highly recommend this shampoo, the matching conditioner and the sea salt spray from this product line.</li>
            <li> Any product by Tigi is awesome. I have a lot of split ends and dryness. I am hoping this product will be the solution to bad hair days.</li>
            <li> It really does give great volume and smells great without being sickening sweet. Best when paired with their volumizing conditioner.</li>
            <li> Body without drying out my hair. Love it.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.  My hair is fine and finicky and it works well and the smell isn&#x27;t as overpowering as some shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> unfortunately the caps on both the canw were broken but the spray seems to be working.  very timely sending product.</li>
            <li> I have long and super extra fine hair. It mostly looks like a stringy mop on my head, and that&#x27;s on a good day. This shampoo actually adds body to my sad hair and makes it shiny without making it greasy. Plus I love the smell. I even tried the conditioner and it also adds weightless body. After years of trying every shampoo out there that claimed to add body or fullness, I finally found one that does what it says. Hopefully, they never discontinue or &amp;#34;improve&amp;#34; it.</li>
            <li> Loved the smell but my hair is very fine and didn&#x27;t notice any difference between that and other like products.</li>
            <li> great shampoo for volume</li>
            <li> Very good product for fine hair.  Most other volume shampoos dry your hair out. But this shampoo offers great volume with wonderful conditioning properties, as well.  I have found that I dont even need to use conditioner after this shampoo.  My hair is shiny and smells great!</li>
            <li> I have fine straight hair, so I bought this shampoo based on reviews. It smells great, lathers great, and really does add volume. I used it daily for a long time but realized it does build up on hair after a while. The back of my hair at the roots looked like it hadn&#x27;t been washed in a week, after it just was washed and blown dry. Just need to take a break from it and use a clarifying shampoo for a few days to be back to normal.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo to keep my blonde hair from getting brassy. It works fine in that regard. However, it&#x27;s the most drying sulfate free shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. My head itches like crazy when using it. If you don&#x27;t have dry scalp issues, this shampoo may be right for you.</li>
            <li> So hard to find this product anywhere - need more!</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo because it gives my hair body and is easy to style after using.</li>
            <li> Great product gives you great volume and lift just love it. Would highly recommend product to anyone that wants volume an want volume an not flat hair</li>
            <li> i just buy for my freind</li>
