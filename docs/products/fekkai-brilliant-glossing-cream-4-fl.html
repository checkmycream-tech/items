            <li>I ran across this great cream as a free sample from Bath &amp; Body Works.</li>
            <li>Amazing product.  </li>
            <li>I like it, my hair smells so good after I use it, also it ls better use with the shea butter shampoo.</li>
            <li>I found that the makeup mall has the best price that I have seen so far $19.50 plus shipping.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t dare to use more because it&#x27;s so oily, and my hair gets oily on its own over the duration of a day.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Fekkai Glossing for a couple of years and love how it nourishes my hair and leaves a nice shiny sheen on it.</li>
            <li>so far it&#x27;s the best hair product for me.</li>
            <li>I repeated this a couple of times, making sure I got the ends.</li>
            <li>so I think that is why it works better at glossing your hair and not making it look or feel greasy.  </li>
            <li>I DON&#x27;T KNOW A BETTER WORD</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>After I straighten my hair, I love to put this in.</li>
            <li>that many hair products cause.    </li>
            <li>Its also conveniently sold at Bath &amp; Body Works:)</li>
            <li>I have been using Fekkai Glossing for many years.  </li>
            <li>I love it and use it all the time.</li>
            <li>will love them..</li>
            <li>This is a good product and always useful to have in your arsenal of hair care products-</li>
            <li>will get it more if the price will lower and lower.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy to have finally found something so quick &amp; easy to use that works so nicely.</li>
            <li>I use Fekkai Advanced Brilliant Glossing Cream year round but mostly in the summer when I don&#x27;t feel like drying my hair.</li>
            <li>I like the clean, non-chemical smell, too.&lt;br /&gt;Word</li>
            <li>Makes hair very soft and shiny and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>MAKES HAIR SOFT, NICE SHINE, AND NO FRIZZ.   </li>
            <li>Since I was in Vegas when I bought it, the shiny sparkles seemed totally appropriate, but I can&#x27;t say that it did much to change the texture of my hair by making it smoother or softer.  </li>
            <li>I in particular love his products with olive oil.</li>
            <li>For best results use it on damp hair and then blow dry it and another tiny amount for final amazing touches with glossy glittery look.</li>
            <li>After a winter cleaning I pulled it out and long story short[er], was very pleased with the results of Fekkai Glossing Cream.      </li>
            <li>/&gt;So, all in all, try the Glossing Cream as it does give good results but save your money and don&#x27;t bother with other Fekkai products.</li>
            <li>It will make your hair soft with that same lovely fresh smell but there are definitely better products out there.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pricewise; you need so little to get a wonderful result that this tube will last me quite awhile.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical about the product but with the first use I was amazed of how light and effective it is, even in 50 degrees heat and humidity still the hair looks amazing.</li>
            <li>I received this as a sample but will definitely be purchasing more.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much tho as it can make your hair look greasy!</li>
            <li>I love the tiny gold reflective sparkles in it--like gold dust for my hair!</li>
            <li>which is ok if left on for an hour or so under a shower cap before rinsing.</li>
            <li>But you get more for your money with the larger ounces than the smaller ones and it is so worth the buck!!</li>
            <li>warning- don&#x27;t, like me, assume that because this is such a unique product, other Fekkai products are just as good.</li>
            <li>I still love it, as my hair tends to be dry and frizzy.  </li>
            <li>Makes hair very shiny.</li>
            <li>Your hands will have a glittery, sparkly sheen all over when you&#x27;re done applying, and you have to really scrub to wash it out of your hands.  </li>
            <li>It works really well on my hair,</li>
            <li>HAIR IS SMOOTH WHEN YOU USE A FLAT IRON,  </li>
            <li>Less is more.</li>
            <li>Though the price is on the high end</li>
            <li>I was given a sample and loved it, it makes your hair manageable and shiny without looking greasy, just can&#x27;t do without it, a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It is also good when mixed with a little hairspray in the palm of your hand to give a soft control without giving that \\&quot;fixed\\&quot; look.</li>
            <li>APPLIED SPARINGLY ONTO WET HAIR BY RUBBING IT IN WITH YOUR HANDS, LEAVES IT SMOOTH AND &#x27;MOIST&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t need big amounts to apply, just small portion and you good to go.    </li>
            <li>We both swear its actually making our hair grow faster since its keeping it healthy and repairing loose ends.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair so smooth and you really just need a little.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always on the lookout for new products that&#x27;ll bring my curls out, but not make them crunchy or</li>
            <li>This makes my hair so soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>Handles the frizz and creates shiny hair [which previously was a huge challenge].</li>
            <li>It basically makes it smooth and less fizzy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that a little goes a long way because this is an oily, SUPER SHINY product.  </li>
            <li>I have color treated, thin, baby fine hair that will curl when coaxed &amp; cut the right way.</li>
            <li>BUT ONLY USE THE  AMOUNT RECOMMENDED, TO MUCH WILL MAKE  </li>
            <li>I promise you will trash your old product</li>
            <li>It makes it vibrant and adds a shine that brings back your hairs youth!!!!</li>
            <li>I have long coarse hair that will dry on its own slightly kinky or waivy, but can get smooth if I work at it with a large round brush and hair dryer, or with a flat iron.  </li>
            <li>The Oribe cream is much better but a little bit more expensive.</li>
            <li>Great for thick, hard to manage hair.</li>
            <li>I have very curly and dry hair.</li>
            <li>I think this is a product for those with truly dry hair, but, again, I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to really soften your hair.</li>
            <li>It not only made my hair shiney, but also bouncier and added a soft texture.</li>
            <li>I am 40-years old but like to keep current with hairstyles and this product worked wonders on my dry hair.</li>

            <li> so it does last a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for a styling product or leave-in conditioner that will help with the frizz, improve smoothness and/or softness without me needing to use a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> My hair type is Thick and waivy and very prone to frizz, so I&#x27;m usually aiming for straight hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy brown hair and it took a lot of this stuff to calm it down.</li>
            <li> It actually makes my hair feel and look extremely dry!!</li>
            <li> Ive never been a guru for hair products as i&#x27;m a simple kyna&#x27; girl, so the sample packet lingered for about a year and a half at the back of my bathroom drawer.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let it air dry &amp; received lots of compliments on my hair yesterday.</li>
            <li> You work it through your damp hair and then blow dry</li>
            <li> I AM A SWIMMER, AND THE POOL WATER AND CHLORINE LEAVE MY HAIR DRY , WHISPY AND BRITTLE.  </li>
            <li> The only exception would be the pink conditioner ( Technician Care something or other?)</li>
            <li> If you use too much it looks dull and weighed down.</li>
            <li> Tames my dry, frizzy hair!</li>
            <li> FOR IT- NOT WET LOOKING, BUT NOT DRIED OUT AND THIN</li>
            <li> The cream feels healthy and works as a defrizzer for crazy air dried hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was wet, but not sopping.</li>
            <li> A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and it lacks the greace or paisty and sticky feeling</li>
            <li> You need to use a pea size amount (not dime-sized as the other reviewer mentioned).  </li>
            <li> Because I can only buy Fekkai online as it&#x27;s not available in Australia, I have spent a small fortune trying all products in the range and , apart from the Glossing Cream</li>
            <li> I also used it to tame some stray hairs when my hair was dry.</li>
            <li> they are simply not worth considering.</li>
            <li> It can be a bit pricey, but again you only need a very small amount</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was in little sample sizes @</li>
            <li> A little bit goes along way.</li>
            <li> I was surprised because its a bit expensive.</li>
            <li> This Glossing Cream controlls friz with just a small amount.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d give the Glossing Advanced formula a try and am extremely disappointed in this product!</li>
            <li> However, I am having a hard time finding it in stores.</li>
            <li> and they are very ordinary.</li>
            <li> and I was a little skeptical about this product.</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly hair</li>
            <li> Please if you have frizzy,curly difficult hair try these products.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>

            <li> I have color treated, thin, baby fine hair that will curl when coaxed &amp; cut the right way. I&#x27;m always on the lookout for new products that&#x27;ll bring my curls out, but not make them crunchy or sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was in little sample sizes @ Bath &amp; Body Works &amp; I figured, why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I squeezed a larger amount than I wanted to use into my hand &amp; was regretting it because you can&#x27;t put it back in the tube. No worries! My hair was wet, but not sopping. I rubbed my hands together &amp; then ran them through my hair. I repeated this a couple of times, making sure I got the ends. I then used a pick to comb my hair away from my face &amp; that was it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let it air dry &amp; received lots of compliments on my hair yesterday. I&#x27;m very happy to have finally found something so quick &amp; easy to use that works so nicely.</li>
            <li> I received this as a sample but will definitely be purchasing more.  This glossing cream does not leave a greasy feeling on your hair.  You need to use a pea size amount (not dime-sized as the other reviewer mentioned).  You work it through your damp hair and then blow dry and it makes your hair wonderfully soft without being greasy like other glossing products.  This is a cream product and not an oil product so I think that is why it works better at glossing your hair and not making it look or feel greasy.  This is probably the best hair product that I have ever used.  I am 40-years old but like to keep current with hairstyles and this product worked wonders on my dry hair.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the product but with the first use I was amazed of how light and effective it is, even in 50 degrees heat and humidity still the hair looks amazing. Though the price is on the high end but it doesn&#x27;t need big amounts to apply, just small portion and you good to go.    For best results use it on damp hair and then blow dry it and another tiny amount for final amazing touches with glossy glittery look.</li>
            <li> MAKES HAIR SOFT, NICE SHINE, AND NO FRIZZ.   HAIR IS SMOOTH WHEN YOU USE A FLAT IRON,  IT MAKES IT JUST LIKE SILK. BUT ONLY USE THE  AMOUNT RECOMMENDED, TO MUCH WILL MAKE  YOUR HAIR FALL FLAT AND GREASY. THIS CONTAINS  OLIVE OIL IN IT, SO A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY.  RECEIVED WITHIN A FEW DAYS, FAST SERVICE.</li>
            <li> Love Fekkai anything!! Great for thick, hard to manage hair. Makes hair very shiny.</li>
            <li> amazing amazing amazing- havent ever had the compliments I have received since using this product- hair is silky and looks like I walked out of hairdressers 10+ stars</li>
            <li> Great product.  Handles the frizz and creates shiny hair [which previously was a huge challenge].</li>
            <li> I use Fekkai Advanced Brilliant Glossing Cream year round but mostly in the summer when I don&#x27;t feel like drying my hair. This Glossing Cream controlls friz with just a small amount. I love the way it makes my hair look smooth and silky and it smells great too!  Don&#x27;t use too much tho as it can make your hair look greasy! It can be a bit pricey, but again you only need a very small amount so it does last a long time. I found that the makeup mall has the best price that I have seen so far $19.50 plus shipping.</li>
            <li> love this gloss! it gives me that shine that lasts all day!</li>
            <li> I have very curly and dry hair. This is the only product that works for me. It basically makes it smooth and less fizzy. And, it never stops working (i.e., my hair does get use to it). It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> I must admit, as a senior on a budget, I was somewhat astounded by the price of this item but decided to persue it anyway.  The glossing cream arrived three days ago and it is amazing!!!  Pricewise; you need so little to get a wonderful result that this tube will last me quite awhile.  It not only made my hair shiney, but also bouncier and added a soft texture. I think this was a good treat that i am glad i ordered!!</li>
            <li> I have long coarse hair that will dry on its own slightly kinky or waivy, but can get smooth if I work at it with a large round brush and hair dryer, or with a flat iron.  I&#x27;m always looking for a styling product or leave-in conditioner that will help with the frizz, improve smoothness and/or softness without me needing to use a flat iron.  I bought a sample size of this glossing cream while traveling and have only used it for about a week.  It gets mixed reviews from me.  It&#x27;s true that a little goes a long way because this is an oily, SUPER SHINY product.  Your hands will have a glittery, sparkly sheen all over when you&#x27;re done applying, and you have to really scrub to wash it out of your hands.  Since I was in Vegas when I bought it, the shiny sparkles seemed totally appropriate, but I can&#x27;t say that it did much to change the texture of my hair by making it smoother or softer.  I don&#x27;t dare to use more because it&#x27;s so oily, and my hair gets oily on its own over the duration of a day. I think this is a product for those with truly dry hair, but, again, I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to really soften your hair. It just adds a lot of shine.</li>
            <li> The Oribe cream is much better but a little bit more expensive. I have thick wavy brown hair and it took a lot of this stuff to calm it down. Scent is okay, nothing incredible.</li>
            <li> really good seller, I like it</li>
            <li> I AM A SWIMMER, AND THE POOL WATER AND CHLORINE LEAVE MY HAIR DRY , WHISPY AND BRITTLE.  THIS GLOSSING CREAM, APPLIED SPARINGLY ONTO WET HAIR BY RUBBING IT IN WITH YOUR HANDS, LEAVES IT SMOOTH AND &#x27;MOIST&#x27;.  I DON&#x27;T KNOW A BETTER WORD FOR IT- NOT WET LOOKING, BUT NOT DRIED OUT AND THIN LIKE BEFORE. I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I ran across this great cream as a free sample from Bath &amp; Body Works. Ive never been a guru for hair products as i&#x27;m a simple kyna&#x27; girl, so the sample packet lingered for about a year and a half at the back of my bathroom drawer. After a winter cleaning I pulled it out and long story short[er], was very pleased with the results of Fekkai Glossing Cream.      My hair type is Thick and waivy and very prone to frizz, so I&#x27;m usually aiming for straight hair. The cream feels healthy and works as a defrizzer for crazy air dried hair. After I straighten my hair, I love to put this in. A little goes a long way, and it lacks the greace or paisty and sticky feeling that many hair products cause.    My mother bought me two 7fl. oz. for Christmas. I was surprised because its a bit expensive. But you get more for your money with the larger ounces than the smaller ones and it is so worth the buck!! I bought some for my Best Friend and she is using every day! We both swear its actually making our hair grow faster since its keeping it healthy and repairing loose ends. Its also conveniently sold at Bath &amp; Body Works:)</li>
            <li> I have been using Fekkai Glossing for many years.  I still love it, as my hair tends to be dry and frizzy.  However, I am having a hard time finding it in stores.</li>
            <li> I love it and use it all the time. Fekkai has great hair products! I in particular love his products with olive oil. Makes hair very soft and shiny and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I started using this some years ago and wouldn&#x27;t want to finish my hair style with out it.  It makes it vibrant and adds a shine that brings back your hairs youth!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Fekkai Glossing for a couple of years and love how it nourishes my hair and leaves a nice shiny sheen on it. I thought I&#x27;d give the Glossing Advanced formula a try and am extremely disappointed in this product! It actually makes my hair feel and look extremely dry!! It&#x27;s like they came up with a formula that failed in the lab and needed to get rid of it so decided to market it as Advanced! I will continue to use the regular Fekkai Glossing, unless they change the formula on this!</li>
            <li> Please if you have frizzy,curly difficult hair try these products.&lt;br /&gt;You will love them..I promise you will trash your old product</li>
            <li> Amazing product.  Makes my hair so smooth and you really just need a little. Less is more. If you use too much it looks dull and weighed down. I will definitely get this again.</li>
            <li> I was given a sample and loved it, it makes your hair manageable and shiny without looking greasy, just can&#x27;t do without it, a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair so soft and shiny! I love the tiny gold reflective sparkles in it--like gold dust for my hair!</li>
            <li> This is a good product and always useful to have in your arsenal of hair care products- it works best for me on styled hair when applied to highlighted strands to add definition. It is also good when mixed with a little hairspray in the palm of your hand to give a soft control without giving that \\&quot;fixed\\&quot; look. I like the clean, non-chemical smell, too.&lt;br /&gt;Word of warning- don&#x27;t, like me, assume that because this is such a unique product, other Fekkai products are just as good. They are definitely NOT! I&#x27;ve tried the shampoos, conditioners, glaze, hairspray, styling creams, etc. and they are very ordinary. Because I can only buy Fekkai online as it&#x27;s not available in Australia, I have spent a small fortune trying all products in the range and , apart from the Glossing Cream they are simply not worth considering. The only exception would be the pink conditioner ( Technician Care something or other?) which is ok if left on for an hour or so under a shower cap before rinsing. It will make your hair soft with that same lovely fresh smell but there are definitely better products out there.&lt;br /&gt;So, all in all, try the Glossing Cream as it does give good results but save your money and don&#x27;t bother with other Fekkai products.</li>
            <li> I like it, my hair smells so good after I use it, also it ls better use with the shea butter shampoo.</li>
            <li> The company did not send this item.  They said that it got lost in the mail and that they did not have anymore.</li>
            <li> Tames my dry, frizzy hair!</li>
            <li> Same product. really good for my curls. will get it more if the price will lower and lower. hope so</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly hair and I was a little skeptical about this product. A little bit goes along way. I tried it after putting my mousse and gel in and it helped to keep my hair under control. I also used it to tame some stray hairs when my hair was dry. It smells good too. I would definitely recommend this product</li>
            <li> This is my second tube of this cream. It works really well on my hair, so far it&#x27;s the best hair product for me.</li>
