            <li> best feel for a sun protection that is not greasy</li>
            <li> This is great. Leaves no white mask. I always use it on the beach. Great protection.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite sunscreen</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my husband&#x27;s dermatologist.  My husband has been using it and likes it.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  It dries quickly and has no smell</li>
            <li> Use to help prevent skin cancer on the face. It seems to be helping do just that. I use it ever morning on my face after I shave.</li>
            <li> Great product &amp; received it promptly!!</li>
            <li> This goes on nicely last a long time not sticky</li>
            <li> Yes it is light and it gives me protection I need&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> I much prefer the lightly tinted version, also available on amazon. Itâ€™s a bit lower SPF (41) but much less runny and not greasy like this supposedly transparent but actually white kind&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lightly tinted:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012XO2W6/ref&#x3D;pd_lpo_sbs_dp_ss_2?pf_rd_p&#x3D;1944687502&amp;pf_rd_s&#x3D;lpo-top-stripe-1&amp;pf_rd_t&#x3D;201&amp;pf_rd_i&#x3D;B00BI0SBWA&amp;pf_rd_m&#x3D;ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_r&#x3D;1STC4VW4BNQAA702QGPE</li>
            <li> Blocks the sun well and is sweat resistant. Sometimes it feels a bit heavy but what ever is in it kept me from burning in two weeks of African sun.</li>
            <li> clean and non greasy. great protection. the cream is clean and consistent easy to apply. I recommend this over drug store brands</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist.  Great product.  Not greasy at all. I&#x27;ve been using it for several years.</li>
            <li> Yes, love this brand and always use it.  This is a good price for it as opposed to my dermatologist</li>
            <li> Always your top choice when doing outdoor activities!</li>
            <li> Always like to save money on this product, as it&#x27;s the best for my hair  Hope to find it again on Amazon.com</li>
            <li> I have used this sunscreen for 2 years. My sin tolerates it well. It&#x27;s non greasy, stays on well and works. My Dr recommended it and I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> Great product, recommended by my dermatologist! Goes on clear,  no offensive fragrance, excellent sun protection!</li>
            <li> leaves a white layer on face.</li>
            <li> Nice, non-irritating SPF sunscreen product from EltaMD. Unfortunately leaves a chalky white residue on the face. It seems all EltaMD products over SPF 40 do this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the sunscreen for several years and it is GREAT !!!</li>
            <li> If you have had any surgery this is the best for scars</li>
            <li> I started using this sunscreen last year and it moisturizers my skin as it is protecting it in the sun.  I sweat when playing tennis and it does not evaporate .</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen but not so water resistant... It doesn&#x27;t stay on long once you hit the water.</li>
            <li> This is a life saver to my face in Hawaii whereI now live.  Stays on well and really works.  It does NOT turn my face white!</li>
            <li> Actually stays in place durin a long run</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply, feels light and smooth.  I prefer a sunscreen with only minerals and no chemicals, but this is easier to use.</li>
            <li> This is much thicker and stays on much longer  than their regular sunscreen.  For everyday use I prefer the non sport version but if you plan on swimming or sweating a lot, this works great.</li>
            <li> Been using this, and the other Elta MD products for years now. They really do help me in the continuing fight against UY rays.</li>
            <li> I use this and the EltaMD face tinted sunscreen (SPF41). Both products are amazing if you have any kind of skin issues (allergies, rosacea, etc). This product is a bit pricey to use all over on a daily basis--I wish they would make this one more affordable. But I can&#x27;t live without the tinted facial sunscreen--I use that every single day instead of foundation. It&#x27;s the only thing that works on my face!</li>
            <li> A little expensive for the amount they give you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with EltaMD products. I will keep buying them!</li>
