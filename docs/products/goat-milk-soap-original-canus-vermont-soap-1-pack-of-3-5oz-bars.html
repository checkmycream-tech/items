            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell, love the texture, but this soap dries my skin out more than using a gold bar of Dial.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it feels when it lathers up.</li>
            <li>So glad we started using the soap.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>It is my favorite soap.</li>
            <li>LOVE.</li>
            <li>I love Canus goat milk soap.  </li>
            <li>The box says goat&#x27;s milk contains the most capric-capriyllic triglycerides which help moisturize the skin.</li>
            <li>My skin has never looked better .</li>
            <li>I also use it in the shower since I have so many allergies and skin ailments .</li>
            <li>The price was  better that where I use to order.</li>
            <li>Thought I&#x27;d try this, and it smells lovely</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it will be my soap of choice from now on.</li>
            <li>I love the feel of the soap.</li>
            <li>Most soaps make me itch.  </li>
            <li>We love this soap.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love the soap.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this soap on my face for over 10 years, just love it.</li>
            <li>This is our favorite all time soap.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find it in stores any more</li>
            <li>I love this soap.  </li>
            <li>this soap seems to work  wonderful, and I  really  love the original  or natural sent,I hope  to  be  able to continue  to keep  buying.</li>
            <li>well, let&#x27;s say...beyond forty, and over the years I have tried many, many soaps, in my quest for one that lathers well, smells good, but is gentle to the skin.</li>
            <li>Never disappointed with Canus products!</li>
            <li>Awesome for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>It feels great, and the scent is amazing, I mean absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just my skin (red hair and very fair complexion), but I won&#x27;t be re-ordering.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this soap works great for me.</li>
            <li>This soap makes your skin feel so  soft and a great lather.</li>
            <li>Leaves our skin silky soft after doing a great job of cleaning it.</li>
            <li>I have tried every product out there and this is, by far, THE BEST at keeping me smelling fresh and clean all day.</li>
            <li>it has a nice clean scent, very creamy and mild for your skin and lasts a good amount of time.</li>
            <li>; so I use The Original Canus Vermont brand and love it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is the original scent and although it is very prounced I find it pleasant</li>
            <li>Also have a nice mild smell,and your skin feel so clean after using it.</li>
            <li>This is wonderful, lathers well and has a nice, delicate fragrance that men or women can like.</li>
            <li>Have used this for many years now and love how it makes my skin smell (fresh)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used milk soap before, but a different kind, and loved it.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin and her soaps feel so moisturizing and have a great lather, plus its nice to know I am using something chemical free.</li>
            <li>I just love it, lathers good, nice scent,even use the empty boxes to freshen&lt;br /&gt;up</li>
            <li>Maybe this brand is fine if you don&#x27;t take baths.</li>
            <li>So if you aren&#x27;t giving them away as gifts, the multi-pack is fine.</li>
            <li>It has a very rich, luscious lather and it feels great on my dry skin.</li>
            <li>I love this soap, it has a nice soft scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad i can find it in amazon because I used to only be able to get it by driving many many miles out of the city.</li>
            <li>I like how it worked to help soften and smooth my daughter&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>Sooo smooth   </li>
            <li>Smells like cheap men&#x27;s cologne or aftershave.</li>
            <li>Great soap this is the only place I can find it</li>
            <li>Others offer for $1.69 a bar and free shipping.  </li>
            <li>It has a clean fragrance and rinses off easily.</li>
            <li>This soap is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>It helped me to smooth my skin,</li>
            <li>Quality, gentleness, good lather, wonderfully soft fragrance, long-lasting, affordable, all wrapped into one.</li>
            <li>the bathroom storage cabinet and was so surprised by how much I loved it!&lt;br /&gt;Made</li>
            <li>I use the Original Fragrance as well as the Fragrance Free.</li>
            <li>Has a delightful scent and rinses, even in hard water, easily.</li>
            <li>I discovered it in a local store that no longer carries it, and I thought I would have to live without it until I discovered it at Amazon.com, and at a great price!</li>
            <li>Very fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>I fell in love with this soap the first time I tried it.</li>
            <li>I purchased this soap from another site originally.  </li>
            <li>VERY refreshing smell - natural and ph balanaced</li>
            <li>I like the original as I do not like added fragrances.</li>
            <li>Have tried the Lavender and don&#x27;t like it as well as the Original.</li>
            <li>But if you want a nice bar soap that smells so good, is gentle enough to use on ALL body parts, including your face, this is the product to try!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t completely remedy the condition, but it certainly helped a great deal.  </li>
            <li>It also has a clean, non-perfumed scent.  </li>
            <li>You feel clean after using it.</li>
            <li>You HAVE to clean it before a bath.</li>
            <li>and it leaves my skin feeling clean.</li>
            <li>I have never had such a pleasant surprise from a product.</li>
            <li>a county fair a few years ago just to be nice.  </li>
            <li>This soap lasts a long time even though it lathers up very nicely.</li>
            <li>Great lather, easy to rinse off, lovely subtle smell and leaves my skin clean</li>
            <li>When I run out I miss it so much, so I try to buy a pack of three or more.</li>
            <li>The bars last me about one month, and provide a good lather.  </li>
            <li>I loved it, but could not find it locally.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not a bad smell.</li>
            <li>I have a real thing for good smelling things that aren&#x27;t real perfumey, but have a good clean smell and are gentle enough to use in the shower for all those...</li>
            <li>Soap smells really fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>So happy to find it here on Amazon at such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The sent is pleasant and it doesn&#x27;t dry you out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny -- before I used this soap, I used whatever was available.  </li>
            <li>My wife and daughter use this soap for facial cleansing, they are very pleased with the quality of this product.</li>
            <li>Canus soap does a good job of combating dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I had recently discovered the full line of Canus Products and am thrilled with them all.</li>
            <li>Creamy soap that doesn&#x27;t clog drains,doesn&#x27;t dry skin and feels good on the body when using.</li>
            <li>Love this soap, skin feels softer no itching great for babies long lasting soap</li>
            <li>my 5 yr old grandson and i love this soap.</li>
            <li>You  can not buy it out the stores,even in the drug stores you have order it, but it worth it..</li>
            <li>Seems to help with rough skin, good cleanning power.</li>
            <li>Makes a nice present for friends.</li>
            <li>is easily absorbed and is non-greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The scent is so fresh, it will make you sleep like a baby.  </li>
            <li>However it&#x27;s great on the skin and very creamy and unlike other moisturizing soaps if you go to the gym and work out</li>
            <li>but I really prefer the original version of the canus soap.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll smell &amp; feel so good after using this soap you&#x27;ll wonder why it&#x27;s not more commercially available</li>
            <li>I did not mean to order the original</li>
            <li>When coming back to America, I made sure to pick some up again.</li>
            <li>I rather enjoy the scent, though some might find it slightly masculine.      </li>
            <li>I USED TO BE ABLE TO PURCHASE THIS ITEM AT BIG LOTS</li>
            <li>PRETTY CREAMY FOR SHAVING.</li>
            <li>finally after more research, i read about goat&#x27;s milk soap.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>This is not the first time using this product.  </li>
            <li>I used it tonight for the first time.</li>
            <li>Very soothing on the skin!</li>
            <li>Goat&#x27;s milk soap is just plain good for your skin.  </li>
            <li>Goat Milk Soap - Original (3 Pack)  are very mild and it works very well with dry skin.</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor...if you&#x27;re looking for a gentle soap with a clean, soft smell, this is it.</li>
            <li>Luckily, through my searching I have found WendyLou&#x27;s Natural Milk Baths and Soaps.  </li>
            <li>Unlike most soaps it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling dry.  </li>
            <li>leaves you skin, smooth, silky, clean and doesn&#x27;t try it out the way other soaps do</li>
            <li>Goat&#x27;s milk soap is the best I have found for dry hands, especially living in a very dry climate.</li>
            <li>Before purchasing this soap, I typically used whatever cheap bar or body wash was available.  </li>
            <li>And yes this is a real review.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>Hopefully I will be purchasing again for the whole family.</li>
            <li>he really dosen&#x27;t like to use anything else anymore.  </li>
            <li>I ordered a bunch, and when I&#x27;m not using them I place them in my drawers to add a gentle fragrance to my clothes.</li>
            <li>Priced too high!</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s a gentle soap,  I use it both on my face and body.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a real pain.</li>
            <li>I used to get very itchy  in the winter, but since I started using this soap, I have no problem.</li>
            <li>I saw a real, visible difference in my skin after showering and washing my face with this soap.  </li>
            <li>While I like this soap tremendously, next time, I&#x27;ll purchase the fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>Just Amazon charges too much.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I cannot wear perfume and most fragrances in most types of products either bring on asthma or make me nauseated.</li>
            <li>The bars are a good size although I see they have followed the other markets in scooping out the mid section of the soap.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle on the skin and has such a clean smell.  </li>
            <li>Favorite soap - I won&#x27;t buy any other brand.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many other soaps and body washes but nothing seems to work quite as well as this soap  </li>
            <li>I had purchased several multipacks of the original scent.  </li>
            <li>I intend to by more and try the other scents.  </li>
            <li>It is finely milled so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>But it lathers nicely and the scent is long lasting.</li>
            <li>Paired with cera ve moisturizer my skin stays soft and pretty.</li>
            <li>The soap has also done a good job of removing the little bumps on my upper arms.  </li>
            <li>i read the reviews on this particular brand and decided to give it a try</li>
            <li>this soap is heads and shoulders above anything one can purchase in the super markets and apothecaries.</li>
            <li>I had been purchasing the liquid form of this soap for several years and discovering that it was becoming a real issue to find it locally.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I like it but price too high, will not purchase again</li>
            <li>But cost is really high.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>highly recommend using goat&#x27;s milk soap.</li>
            <li>Wow !!</li>
            <li>i finally discovered black soap that worked great for a few month&#x27;s, but then became super drying to my face.</li>
            <li>Great soap, but tooooooo expensive.  </li>
            <li>have very sensitive skin and have been buying this for over a year...</li>
            <li>Was very surprised.  </li>
            <li>Or if your skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>I got this for $12 and It was the exact same thing</li>
            <li>But now, my skin is always so soft, almost silky!</li>
            <li>However, a dry winter gave me dry skin, and sparked my search for a better soap.      </li>
            <li>I finally decided \\&quot;Hmm, I think I want to try to my Goat&#x27;s Milk Soap\\&quot; -- and WOW!!!!</li>
            <li>We also use it on our two year old.</li>
            <li>directly from the animal</li>
            <li>Keeps his skin soft  and from drying ou</li>
            <li>This soap is gentle enough for all body parts, including your face.</li>
            <li>The scent is soft and comforting and leaves the skin feeling creamy.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>If you want soft skin this is the product to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Canus goat&#x27;s milk soaps and lotions (both fragrance free and with fragrance) for a few years now</li>
            <li>Leaves your body feeling soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>Hours after you get out of the shower, you can touch your skin, and it still feels soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li>It is so creamy and makes your body feel soft.</li>
            <li>I had purchased a bar from some young girls</li>
            <li>my skin feel so soft and clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it makes it soft.</li>
            <li>On the plus-side, the soap was pleasantly fragranced and did leave my skin feeling a little softer than my usual soap.</li>
            <li>The goat&#x27;s milk makes your hands soft and not tight.  </li>
            <li>its leaves skin smooth but only worked on my husband&#x27;s face for a short time, then went back to being red.</li>
            <li>Only Soap I use - gently - vegan and does not dry out the skin</li>
            <li>Your skin will feel very soft and tried it on my face and left face just as soft</li>
            <li>This soap makes your skin so soft, never dry feeling.  </li>
            <li>every single dsay really helped my skins and my fave .</li>
            <li>On this particular version of Canus, the description, does not mention THIS IS NOT THE STANDARD VERSION, it is the vegetable version, two very different products.</li>
            <li>considering you get three bars for the price that you would generally pay for one bar of goats</li>
            <li>They are homemade, with the glycerin still retained and are all natural based with either essential oils or fragrance added.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 25 year old female with acne along my jawline and around my mouth.</li>
            <li>Canus goats milk doesn&#x27;t do that it stays firm after becoming wet</li>
            <li>This is a product I can highly, highly recommend if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li>Canus goats milk soap is the only soap I have ever tried that not only even out the complexion of my skin, but helped treat/minimize existing acne AND keep new acne from forming.</li>
            <li>Your face will not dry out with this soap!</li>
            <li>I now use this soap only and no other.</li>
            <li>The ingredients listed on the package include goat&#x27;s milk, but the main ingredient is tallow--in other words, animal fat.  </li>
            <li>We bought it on sale and thought I would try it on our 2 year old that has a dry skin condition.</li>
            <li>It is the only soap that does not dry my skin.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell, love the texture, but this soap dries my skin out more than using a gold bar of Dial.  </li>

            <li> So glad we started using the soap.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> It is my favorite soap.</li>
            <li> LOVE.</li>
            <li> I love Canus goat milk soap.  </li>
            <li> The box says goat&#x27;s milk contains the most capric-capriyllic triglycerides which help moisturize the skin.</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked better .</li>
            <li> I also use it in the shower since I have so many allergies and skin ailments .</li>
            <li> The price was  better that where I use to order.</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d try this, and it smells lovely</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it will be my soap of choice from now on.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of the soap.</li>
            <li> Most soaps make me itch.  </li>
            <li> We love this soap.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love the soap.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this soap on my face for over 10 years, just love it.</li>
            <li> This is our favorite all time soap.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find it in stores any more</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  </li>
            <li> this soap seems to work  wonderful, and I  really  love the original  or natural sent,I hope  to  be  able to continue  to keep  buying.</li>
            <li> well, let&#x27;s say...beyond forty, and over the years I have tried many, many soaps, in my quest for one that lathers well, smells good, but is gentle to the skin.</li>
            <li> Never disappointed with Canus products!</li>
            <li> Awesome for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It feels great, and the scent is amazing, I mean absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just my skin (red hair and very fair complexion), but I won&#x27;t be re-ordering.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this soap works great for me.</li>
            <li> This soap makes your skin feel so  soft and a great lather.</li>
            <li> Leaves our skin silky soft after doing a great job of cleaning it.</li>
            <li> I have tried every product out there and this is, by far, THE BEST at keeping me smelling fresh and clean all day.</li>
            <li> it has a nice clean scent, very creamy and mild for your skin and lasts a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> ; so I use The Original Canus Vermont brand and love it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is the original scent and although it is very prounced I find it pleasant</li>
            <li> Also have a nice mild smell,and your skin feel so clean after using it.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful, lathers well and has a nice, delicate fragrance that men or women can like.</li>
            <li> Have used this for many years now and love how it makes my skin smell (fresh)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used milk soap before, but a different kind, and loved it.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and her soaps feel so moisturizing and have a great lather, plus its nice to know I am using something chemical free.</li>
            <li> I just love it, lathers good, nice scent,even use the empty boxes to freshen&lt;br /&gt;up</li>
            <li> Maybe this brand is fine if you don&#x27;t take baths.</li>
            <li> So if you aren&#x27;t giving them away as gifts, the multi-pack is fine.</li>
            <li> It has a very rich, luscious lather and it feels great on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I love this soap, it has a nice soft scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad i can find it in amazon because I used to only be able to get it by driving many many miles out of the city.</li>
            <li> I like how it worked to help soften and smooth my daughter&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> Sooo smooth   </li>
            <li> Smells like cheap men&#x27;s cologne or aftershave.</li>
            <li> Great soap this is the only place I can find it</li>
            <li> Others offer for $1.69 a bar and free shipping.  </li>
            <li> It has a clean fragrance and rinses off easily.</li>
            <li> This soap is fabulous.  </li>
            <li> It helped me to smooth my skin,</li>
            <li> Quality, gentleness, good lather, wonderfully soft fragrance, long-lasting, affordable, all wrapped into one.</li>
            <li> the bathroom storage cabinet and was so surprised by how much I loved it!&lt;br /&gt;Made</li>
            <li> I use the Original Fragrance as well as the Fragrance Free.</li>
            <li> Has a delightful scent and rinses, even in hard water, easily.</li>
            <li> I discovered it in a local store that no longer carries it, and I thought I would have to live without it until I discovered it at Amazon.com, and at a great price!</li>
            <li> Very fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> I fell in love with this soap the first time I tried it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this soap from another site originally.  </li>
            <li> VERY refreshing smell - natural and ph balanaced</li>
            <li> I like the original as I do not like added fragrances.</li>
            <li> Have tried the Lavender and don&#x27;t like it as well as the Original.</li>
            <li> But if you want a nice bar soap that smells so good, is gentle enough to use on ALL body parts, including your face, this is the product to try!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t completely remedy the condition, but it certainly helped a great deal.  </li>
            <li> It also has a clean, non-perfumed scent.  </li>
            <li> You feel clean after using it.</li>
            <li> You HAVE to clean it before a bath.</li>
            <li> and it leaves my skin feeling clean.</li>
            <li> I have never had such a pleasant surprise from a product.</li>
            <li> a county fair a few years ago just to be nice.  </li>
            <li> This soap lasts a long time even though it lathers up very nicely.</li>
            <li> Great lather, easy to rinse off, lovely subtle smell and leaves my skin clean</li>
            <li> When I run out I miss it so much, so I try to buy a pack of three or more.</li>
            <li> The bars last me about one month, and provide a good lather.  </li>
            <li> I loved it, but could not find it locally.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not a bad smell.</li>
            <li> I have a real thing for good smelling things that aren&#x27;t real perfumey, but have a good clean smell and are gentle enough to use in the shower for all those...</li>
            <li> Soap smells really fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> So happy to find it here on Amazon at such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The sent is pleasant and it doesn&#x27;t dry you out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny -- before I used this soap, I used whatever was available.  </li>
            <li> My wife and daughter use this soap for facial cleansing, they are very pleased with the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> Canus soap does a good job of combating dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I had recently discovered the full line of Canus Products and am thrilled with them all.</li>
            <li> Creamy soap that doesn&#x27;t clog drains,doesn&#x27;t dry skin and feels good on the body when using.</li>
            <li> Love this soap, skin feels softer no itching great for babies long lasting soap</li>
            <li> my 5 yr old grandson and i love this soap.</li>
            <li> You  can not buy it out the stores,even in the drug stores you have order it, but it worth it..</li>
            <li> Seems to help with rough skin, good cleanning power.</li>
            <li> Makes a nice present for friends.</li>
            <li> is easily absorbed and is non-greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The scent is so fresh, it will make you sleep like a baby.  </li>
            <li> However it&#x27;s great on the skin and very creamy and unlike other moisturizing soaps if you go to the gym and work out</li>
            <li> but I really prefer the original version of the canus soap.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll smell &amp; feel so good after using this soap you&#x27;ll wonder why it&#x27;s not more commercially available</li>
            <li> I did not mean to order the original</li>
            <li> When coming back to America, I made sure to pick some up again.</li>
            <li> I rather enjoy the scent, though some might find it slightly masculine.      </li>
            <li> I USED TO BE ABLE TO PURCHASE THIS ITEM AT BIG LOTS</li>
            <li> PRETTY CREAMY FOR SHAVING.</li>
            <li> finally after more research, i read about goat&#x27;s milk soap.</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> This is not the first time using this product.  </li>
            <li> I used it tonight for the first time.</li>
            <li> Very soothing on the skin!</li>
            <li> Goat&#x27;s milk soap is just plain good for your skin.  </li>
            <li> Goat Milk Soap - Original (3 Pack)  are very mild and it works very well with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor...if you&#x27;re looking for a gentle soap with a clean, soft smell, this is it.</li>
            <li> Luckily, through my searching I have found WendyLou&#x27;s Natural Milk Baths and Soaps.  </li>
            <li> Unlike most soaps it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling dry.  </li>
            <li> leaves you skin, smooth, silky, clean and doesn&#x27;t try it out the way other soaps do</li>
            <li> Goat&#x27;s milk soap is the best I have found for dry hands, especially living in a very dry climate.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this soap, I typically used whatever cheap bar or body wash was available.  </li>
            <li> And yes this is a real review.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Hopefully I will be purchasing again for the whole family.</li>
            <li> he really dosen&#x27;t like to use anything else anymore.  </li>
            <li> I ordered a bunch, and when I&#x27;m not using them I place them in my drawers to add a gentle fragrance to my clothes.</li>
            <li> Priced too high!</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s a gentle soap,  I use it both on my face and body.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a real pain.</li>
            <li> I used to get very itchy  in the winter, but since I started using this soap, I have no problem.</li>
            <li> I saw a real, visible difference in my skin after showering and washing my face with this soap.  </li>
            <li> While I like this soap tremendously, next time, I&#x27;ll purchase the fragrance free.  </li>
            <li> Just Amazon charges too much.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I cannot wear perfume and most fragrances in most types of products either bring on asthma or make me nauseated.</li>
            <li> The bars are a good size although I see they have followed the other markets in scooping out the mid section of the soap.  </li>
            <li> It is gentle on the skin and has such a clean smell.  </li>
            <li> Favorite soap - I won&#x27;t buy any other brand.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many other soaps and body washes but nothing seems to work quite as well as this soap  </li>
            <li> I had purchased several multipacks of the original scent.  </li>
            <li> I intend to by more and try the other scents.  </li>
            <li> It is finely milled so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> But it lathers nicely and the scent is long lasting.</li>
            <li> Paired with cera ve moisturizer my skin stays soft and pretty.</li>
            <li> The soap has also done a good job of removing the little bumps on my upper arms.  </li>
            <li> i read the reviews on this particular brand and decided to give it a try</li>
            <li> this soap is heads and shoulders above anything one can purchase in the super markets and apothecaries.</li>
            <li> I had been purchasing the liquid form of this soap for several years and discovering that it was becoming a real issue to find it locally.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I like it but price too high, will not purchase again</li>
            <li> But cost is really high.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend.</li>
            <li> highly recommend using goat&#x27;s milk soap.</li>
            <li> Wow !!</li>
            <li> i finally discovered black soap that worked great for a few month&#x27;s, but then became super drying to my face.</li>
            <li> Great soap, but tooooooo expensive.  </li>
            <li> have very sensitive skin and have been buying this for over a year...</li>
            <li> Was very surprised.  </li>
            <li> Or if your skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> I got this for $12 and It was the exact same thing</li>
            <li> But now, my skin is always so soft, almost silky!</li>
            <li> However, a dry winter gave me dry skin, and sparked my search for a better soap.      </li>
            <li> I finally decided \\&quot;Hmm, I think I want to try to my Goat&#x27;s Milk Soap\\&quot; -- and WOW!!!!</li>
            <li> We also use it on our two year old.</li>
            <li> directly from the animal</li>
            <li> Keeps his skin soft  and from drying ou</li>
            <li> This soap is gentle enough for all body parts, including your face.</li>
            <li> The scent is soft and comforting and leaves the skin feeling creamy.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> If you want soft skin this is the product to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Canus goat&#x27;s milk soaps and lotions (both fragrance free and with fragrance) for a few years now</li>
            <li> Leaves your body feeling soft and supple.  </li>
            <li> Hours after you get out of the shower, you can touch your skin, and it still feels soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li> It is so creamy and makes your body feel soft.</li>
            <li> I had purchased a bar from some young girls</li>
            <li> my skin feel so soft and clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it makes it soft.</li>
            <li> On the plus-side, the soap was pleasantly fragranced and did leave my skin feeling a little softer than my usual soap.</li>
            <li> The goat&#x27;s milk makes your hands soft and not tight.  </li>
            <li> its leaves skin smooth but only worked on my husband&#x27;s face for a short time, then went back to being red.</li>
            <li> Only Soap I use - gently - vegan and does not dry out the skin</li>
            <li> Your skin will feel very soft and tried it on my face and left face just as soft</li>
            <li> This soap makes your skin so soft, never dry feeling.  </li>
            <li> every single dsay really helped my skins and my fave .</li>
            <li> On this particular version of Canus, the description, does not mention THIS IS NOT THE STANDARD VERSION, it is the vegetable version, two very different products.</li>
            <li> considering you get three bars for the price that you would generally pay for one bar of goats</li>
            <li> They are homemade, with the glycerin still retained and are all natural based with either essential oils or fragrance added.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 25 year old female with acne along my jawline and around my mouth.</li>
            <li> Canus goats milk doesn&#x27;t do that it stays firm after becoming wet</li>
            <li> This is a product I can highly, highly recommend if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> Canus goats milk soap is the only soap I have ever tried that not only even out the complexion of my skin, but helped treat/minimize existing acne AND keep new acne from forming.</li>
            <li> Your face will not dry out with this soap!</li>
            <li> I now use this soap only and no other.</li>
            <li> The ingredients listed on the package include goat&#x27;s milk, but the main ingredient is tallow--in other words, animal fat.  </li>
            <li> We bought it on sale and thought I would try it on our 2 year old that has a dry skin condition.</li>
            <li> It is the only soap that does not dry my skin.</li>
            <li> It was mild enough and she hardly ever has dry skin since I bought this and your moisureizing products.  </li>
            <li> The size of the bar surprised me, much bigger than other bars.</li>
            <li> i tried many things, ridiculous things, home remedy things, nothing worked!!</li>
            <li> This past winter was the first one I have not experience the dry pathes that occur on my arms.  </li>
            <li> though pricey, the lavendar is just as nice and less expensive for some reason, nourishes the skin and smalls heavenly to both men and women</li>
            <li> SO IT WILL LAST A LONG TIME</li>
            <li> For me, it seems to help cut down on the mosquito bites, and, I am being refffered to as &amp;#34;an old goat&amp;#34; every since I started using it, about 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> All you women know exactly what I mean.</li>
            <li> the area around my nose still peels on occasion when i don&#x27;t drink enough water or the weather is too dry, but this soap has worked miracles when it comes to my peeling condition.</li>
            <li> Prior to using Canus products, I had very dry skin/eczema and even the milder soaps like Dove didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really soften skin, maybe it&#x27;s my hard water.</li>
            <li> I have found that it leaves waaaay too much soap scum even after just 3 showers.</li>
            <li> One bar lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, horny hair follicles, rosacea...</li>
            <li> Bought this for my hubby&#x27;s winter dry skin \\&quot;itchies\\&quot; a couple of years ago.</li>
            <li> and since we started using this product, his has stopped complaining of his itchy dry skin.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t over dry my face or body</li>
            <li> I have a dry  skin  issue  and</li>
            <li> Each soap is in a plain white box - the print is only on the plastic wrapper that goes around the 3-pack.  </li>
            <li> i first tried homemade soap off of ebay, but it was too expensive and the bars were too small and finished way too fast.</li>
            <li> I first tired goat milk soap while I was visiting in Greece.</li>
            <li> and I will be buying it for less next time.</li>
            <li> My face has very, very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> My very dry hands never hurt or itch when I use this soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other goat milk soaps but they do not compare to this one.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this soap &amp; will not use any other.  </li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t want any other soap...</li>
            <li> I quit using store brand soap years ago due to chemicals.</li>
            <li> I would never use any other soap for my face.  </li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t get to smelling like with some of these other soaps (dove)</li>
            <li> It is pretty expensive.</li>
            <li> this product is hard to find locally, so ordering eliminates the hassle of scouting for the product.</li>
            <li> Wonderful,cleans skin and clears ups dark spots.</li>
            <li> Will not use any other bar soap.....ever!</li>
            <li> However, it sleds for half the price on Walgreens.com</li>
            <li> Not sweet but not &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Little or no fragrance and made from Goat&#x27;s Milk ...</li>
            <li> A little pricey.</li>
            <li> Well........Ivory Soap,  come on down!</li>
            <li> She has eczema and few things work for her skin.</li>
            <li> we use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap a few years ago when traveling.  </li>
            <li> I had a small bar of this soap that I bought at a gift shop while traveling.</li>
            <li> Stick with the small Mom and Pop soap makers.</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t to crazy about the smell, I mean it was clean but kinda boring like i just bought Ivory soap from the store.</li>
            <li> There are very few products that that I can say this about.</li>
            <li> No one talks about it, but soaps can be very harsh on a woman&#x27;s sensitive, feminine areas, and can burn like mad, or make you itchy afterwards.</li>
            <li> the soap doesn&#x27;t get mushy and if you have hard water</li>
            <li> ah hmmmm....private, delicate parts, of a woman.</li>
            <li> and I do not react to it in a negative way.</li>
            <li> I previously used dove as I that is until I found Canus my complaint with dove was that it always left terrible mess in the shower ( soapy scum, yuk )</li>
            <li> This soap seriously saved my skin.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worse than ever.  </li>
            <li> i have really bad eczema around my nose since i was a kid and have felt the painful everyday peeling, as if i had a sunburn every single day of my life!</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed that it&#x27;s a vegetable oil soap,</li>
            <li> I am scared to order again in fear of getting the wrong product again.</li>
            <li> and I hope that you never stop carrying it as I have been unable to locate it anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the gentleman from MN is wrong-animal fat (TALLOW) is not from milk, as he states in response to the woman from PA.</li>
            <li> Sorry I ordered it.</li>
            <li> In the winter when the wind and cold just sap the mositure out of my face</li>
            <li> we have nothing bad to say about it.</li>
            <li> I never intended to use the soap.&lt;br /&gt;One day, in the shower, I was shocked when I had no soap.  </li>
            <li> I had ordered this for a friend and she was disappointed that the manufacturing was not in Canada.  </li>
            <li> so she will still use it but was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> I hate cleaning the tub so often.</li>
            <li> This product has very bad ingredients.</li>
            <li> (hate paying shipping!).</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have used this soap for several years now.  I keep returning to this brand after trying others.  I love how smooth it leaves my skin and smells very nice and clean.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this soap the first time I tried it. It feels great and smells great (original fragrance). I now use this soap only and no other. I&#x27;ve tried other goat milk soaps but they do not compare to this one. I&#x27;m glad i can find it in amazon because I used to only be able to get it by driving many many miles out of the city. When I run out I miss it so much, so I try to buy a pack of three or more. I definitely recommend it to everyone!! And yes this is a real review.</li>
            <li> I first tired goat milk soap while I was visiting in Greece. It worked wonders for my skin! When coming back to America, I made sure to pick some up again. This soap has helped my skin dramatically and smells pleasant! If you have dry skin, horny hair follicles, rosacea...I would highly recommend this! Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great soap with a wonderful fragrance.  I have been using it for a couple of years now and everytime that I unwrap a bar, I am reminded how great it is by the wonderful fragrance.    It&#x27;s funny -- before I used this soap, I used whatever was available.  Now that I tried it, it&#x27;s the only soap I use.  So, here it is in a three-pack.    Also try the lotion and the bubbly bubble bath.</li>
            <li> Favorite soap - I won&#x27;t buy any other brand.  The original fragrance is a wonderful clean scent suitable for either men or women.  It leaves my skin in great condition!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my hubby&#x27;s winter dry skin \\&quot;itchies\\&quot; a couple of years ago. We both love it and are hooked!</li>
            <li> I have been happy with all purchases I have made except this one. I ordered the regular goats milk soap and got the one made with vegetable oil. I had already opened it so I didn&#x27;t return it but do not like the product at all. I am scared to order again in fear of getting the wrong product again.</li>
            <li> I had ordered this for a friend and she was disappointed that the manufacturing was not in Canada.  By all indication on the description is was but when we received it, it was made in Waterbury, Vt.  For some reason, she knows there is a difference.  It was a gift for her birthday so she will still use it but was disappointed.  The soap is a different color but seems to still do the trick!</li>
            <li> This soap smells AMAZING! I like how it worked to help soften and smooth my daughter&#x27;s skin. She has eczema and few things work for her skin. I have tried many other soaps and body washes but nothing seems to work quite as well as this soap  Hopefully I will be purchasing again for the whole family.</li>
            <li> What my sister wanted, she likes this and uses it a lot.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this soap works great for me. It has a wierd smell to me but it&#x27;s not a bad smell. I don&#x27;t itch or get a rash, yay. We also use it on our two year old. You get alot of soap for the price and it lasts a while as well.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this soap, I typically used whatever cheap bar or body wash was available.  However, a dry winter gave me dry skin, and sparked my search for a better soap.      Canus soap does a good job of combating dry skin.  It didn&#x27;t completely remedy the condition, but it certainly helped a great deal.  Anytime I would use another soap my skin would feel like sandpaper.  The soap has also done a good job of removing the little bumps on my upper arms.  The bars last me about one month, and provide a good lather.  I rather enjoy the scent, though some might find it slightly masculine.      All things considered, I am sure there are superior soaps, but this is a good buy with good quality.</li>
            <li> Good lather and lite scent after use . Doesn&#x27;t interfere with perfume or cream applied after bathing.&lt;br /&gt;I use it all the time!</li>
            <li> I purchased this soap from another site originally.  It has a nice rounded shape, easy to hold in your hand.  The goat&#x27;s milk makes your hands soft and not tight.  It also has a clean, non-perfumed scent.  It is finely milled so it lasts a long time. I keep it at my bathroom sink for those folk like me that prefer bar soap to liquid.  It would work equally well in the shower.  My son says it doesn&#x27;t make his hands greasy and it doesn&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; scent.</li>
            <li> Love this soap! I keep a good supply! It is the only soap that does not dry my skin.</li>
            <li> This soap is one of the best I have used for mositurizing my skin. What the PA person ahead of me in her review doesn&#x27;t understand is the animal fat is from the milk itself. &lt;br /&gt;Not directly from the animal so it&#x27;s benefits are plentiful and I would tend to agree with the properties this company claims. Works great after multi workout days in the hot MN summer. In the winter when the wind and cold just sap the mositure out of my face it is so refreshing. This past winter was the first one I have not experience the dry pathes that occur on my arms.  &lt;br /&gt;Another benefit - the soap doesn&#x27;t get mushy and if you have hard water it helps counter the affect of that water. PA - you can continue looking. I will buy your portion</li>
            <li> I had recently discovered the full line of Canus Products and am thrilled with them all.</li>
            <li> my 5 yr old grandson and i love this soap. we use it everyday. he really dosen&#x27;t like to use anything else anymore.  it has a nice clean scent, very creamy and mild for your skin and lasts a good amount of time. we&#x27;ve used many goat milk soaps, and this is our favorite.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this soap &amp; will not use any other.  Keeps his skin soft  and from drying ou</li>
            <li> Quality, gentleness, good lather, wonderfully soft fragrance, long-lasting, affordable, all wrapped into one. These words best describe Canus Goat&#x27;s Milk Soap. This is, by far, the best soap I have ever used. I&#x27;m...well, let&#x27;s say...beyond forty, and over the years I have tried many, many soaps, in my quest for one that lathers well, smells good, but is gentle to the skin. I have a real thing for good smelling things that aren&#x27;t real perfumey, but have a good clean smell and are gentle enough to use in the shower for all those...ah hmmmm....private, delicate parts, of a woman. All you women know exactly what I mean. No one talks about it, but soaps can be very harsh on a woman&#x27;s sensitive, feminine areas, and can burn like mad, or make you itchy afterwards. This soap is gentle enough for all body parts, including your face. It&#x27;s not drying to the skin and it doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling like the Mohave Desert. I discovered it in a local store that no longer carries it, and I thought I would have to live without it until I discovered it at Amazon.com, and at a great price! I ordered a bunch, and when I&#x27;m not using them I place them in my drawers to add a gentle fragrance to my clothes. You won&#x27;t find a better soap anywhere. Thank you Amazon and I hope that you never stop carrying it as I have been unable to locate it anywhere else. Do yourself a favor...if you&#x27;re looking for a gentle soap with a clean, soft smell, this is it. At this affordable price, what have you got to lose?</li>
            <li> Your skin will feel very soft and tried it on my face and left face just as soft and it smells wonderful</li>
            <li> My son uses this for his skin condition and we have been buying from ULTA for $30. I got this for $12 and It was the exact same thing.. will buy from here from now on.</li>
            <li> I purchased this soap and kinda tucked it away in my linen closet because I was using another soap in the shower.  I finally decided \\&quot;Hmm, I think I want to try to my Goat&#x27;s Milk Soap\\&quot; -- and WOW!!!! It feels great, and the scent is amazing, I mean absolutely amazing! I will be purchasing this again when I run out-- I also have the Goat&#x27;s Milk Lotion and it&#x27;s also great!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched for this soap for about a year.  Bought it in a California boutique for more $.  The scent is soft and comforting and leaves the skin feeling creamy.  I love it.</li>
            <li> This soap makes your skin feel so  soft and a great lather. Also have a nice mild smell,and your skin feel so clean after using it. I have  been using this soap for 6 months now and I love it.  You  can not buy it out the stores,even in the drug stores you have order it, but it worth it..</li>
            <li> Husband has been using it to and since we started using this product, his has stopped complaining of his itchy dry skin.  Love, this product a lot. It lathers really good too. Really love it a lot.</li>
            <li> Only Soap I use - gently - vegan and does not dry out the skin</li>
            <li> Smells so good &amp; natural.&lt;br /&gt;Good for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend you try it.&lt;br /&gt;Reasonably priced for a 3 bar package.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the gentleman from MN is wrong-animal fat (TALLOW) is not from milk, as he states in response to the woman from PA. Tallow comes from the solid fat around the kidneys and loins of the goat. People that don&#x27;t want animal parts used in the soapmaking process can still have goat milk soap made from vegetable oils. It&#x27;s all a matter of choice.</li>
            <li> have very sensitive skin and have been buying this for over a year...leaves you skin, smooth, silky, clean and doesn&#x27;t try it out the way other soaps do</li>
            <li> This soap makes your skin so soft, never dry feeling.  Sooo smooth   And smells wonderful-- you won&#x27;t want any other soap...</li>
            <li> I had a small bar of this soap that I bought at a gift shop while traveling. I decided to get it out and use it because my skin was &#x27;crawling&#x27; in the 100+ weather we have been having. I found it to be soothing to my skin and the itching was relieved. I cannot wear perfume and most fragrances in most types of products either bring on asthma or make me nauseated. This is the original scent and although it is very prounced I find it pleasant and I do not react to it in a negative way. There are very few products that that I can say this about. Thank you for this quality product.</li>
            <li> Although this soap does appear to get rave reviews, I have a problem with the fact that it is not ALL vegetable based contains(Tallow)and it contains preservatives(DMDM Hydantoin-which releases formaldehyde into the product!!). Luckily, through my searching I have found WendyLou&#x27;s Natural Milk Baths and Soaps.  They are homemade, with the glycerin still retained and are all natural based with either essential oils or fragrance added. I have very dry skin and her soaps feel so moisturizing and have a great lather, plus its nice to know I am using something chemical free.</li>
            <li> This soap is a great soap for a baby or anyone. We bought it on sale and thought I would try it on our 2 year old that has a dry skin condition. It was mild enough and she hardly ever has dry skin since I bought this and your moisureizing products.  Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> Wonderful,cleans skin and clears ups dark spots.</li>
            <li> I had been purchasing the liquid form of this soap for several years and discovering that it was becoming a real issue to find it locally. I was happy to see that Amazon carried the bar form of this soap. I love the scent and the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Love this soap, skin feels softer no itching great for babies long lasting soap</li>
            <li> anything made in Vermont I always trusted....terrific STATE.....love ya Vermont!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love the scent!  The bars are a good size although I see they have followed the other markets in scooping out the mid section of the soap.  Cheaters they all are!  But it lathers nicely and the scent is long lasting.</li>
            <li> I love this soap, it has a nice soft scent. You feel clean after using it. It leaves my skin feeling soft. I previously used dove as I that is until I found Canus my complaint with dove was that it always left terrible mess in the shower ( soapy scum, yuk ) Canus goats milk doesn&#x27;t do that it stays firm after becoming wet and it doesn&#x27;t leave a soapy residue. I have tried the unscented and another scented version but I really prefer the original version of the canus soap.</li>
            <li> wonderful soap though pricey, the lavendar is just as nice and less expensive for some reason, nourishes the skin and smalls heavenly to both men and women</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for years. Creamy soap that doesn&#x27;t clog drains,doesn&#x27;t dry skin and feels good on the body when using. Also bars are big. Can ne used in shower or at sink</li>
            <li> My wife and daughter use this soap for facial cleansing, they are very pleased with the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product! The smell is wonderful and the feel is clean and relaxing. Never disappointed with Canus products!</li>
            <li> I had purchased several multipacks of the original scent.  The first group of 3 was great and I put in a review stating such.  Now I had opened the next multipack of 3 and found all of the remaining bars moldy.  Was very surprised.  I sent off and email to the company and after 4 days have not received a response.  Very disappointing.  We will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Our good friends gave us a bar of this goat milk soap as a hostess gift.  My husband and I love the way this soap smells.  Very fresh and clean.  It lasts quite a while and doesn&#x27;t crack.  I have been buying this product for over a  year now and don&#x27;t plan on changing to another product, ever!</li>
            <li> I gave this a good rating because it true. It&#x27;s a good, good soap. I love the smell it has and so does my wife. Well She loves it I get to use it sometimes. It just makes us fell better. We worl with Alpacas. It helps with that smell. You feel like you never set foot in a barn or out in the field.&lt;br /&gt;Yes I would tell my friends to try it.</li>
            <li> Love this soap and don&#x27;t use anything else now. In fact, a bar travels with me everywhere I go. I am spoiled.</li>
            <li> Smells like cheap men&#x27;s cologne or aftershave. Even my husband couldn&#x27;t stand it. Didn&#x27;t really soften skin, maybe it&#x27;s my hard water.</li>
            <li> Goat Milk Soap - Original (3 Pack)  are very mild and it works very well with dry skin. I like it because it leaves  you feeling flesh.</li>
            <li> Great soap this is the only place I can find it</li>
            <li> If you want soft skin this is the product to use. Or if your skin is very sensitive. I love the liquid also. I use it to wash my hair also. I quit using store brand soap years ago due to chemicals. Goat milk soap is the only product I use. Once you use it you will never go back to store brand soap again.</li>
            <li> SMELLS great for the morning shower..  VERY refreshing smell - natural and ph balanaced VERY good for the body but the smell alone is worth the soap!!!!</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite soap for years.  Non drying for my skin.  I like the original as I do not like added fragrances.</li>
            <li> use it every day.....good for my skin</li>
            <li> this is the best soap ever!</li>
            <li> 3 Bars-not 9 Bars!!!  Over $6 a bar.  Others offer for $1.69 a bar and free shipping.  Learn from my mistake.  I thought is was 9.  Not the case, only 3 shipped! Priced too high!</li>
            <li> I USED TO BE ABLE TO PURCHASE THIS ITEM AT BIG LOTS A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO. PRETTY CREAMY FOR SHAVING. THE STUFF IN THE AEROSOL CANS NEVER SEEMED TO WORK FOR ME. THERE ARE THREE BARS TO THE PACKAGE SO IT WILL LAST A LONG TIME</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Canus goat&#x27;s milk soaps and lotions (both fragrance free and with fragrance) for a few years now and I love it. Prior to using Canus products, I had very dry skin/eczema and even the milder soaps like Dove didn&#x27;t help. But now, my skin is always so soft, almost silky! You&#x27;d never know that I suffered from severe eczema growing up. I can&#x27;t believe dermatologists haven&#x27;t put this on their list of recommended products yet!</li>
            <li> This soap was for my husband, he loves it and I love it.  Great smell.</li>
            <li> This soap is one of the best ones I&#x27;ve used.  Unlike most soaps it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling dry.  It has a clean fragrance and rinses off easily. Since it&#x27;s a gentle soap,  I use it both on my face and body.  Great product.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll smell &amp; feel so good after using this soap you&#x27;ll wonder why it&#x27;s not more commercially available</li>
            <li> OMG - the smell is soooo wonderful and the lather is so creamy.  Have one by every sink.</li>
            <li> Great for itchy skin!</li>
            <li> Love the smell, love the texture, but this soap dries my skin out more than using a gold bar of Dial.  I thought it&#x27;d help but it&#x27;s worse than ever.  Maybe it&#x27;s just my skin (red hair and very fair complexion), but I won&#x27;t be re-ordering.  I was a little disappointed that it&#x27;s a vegetable oil soap,</li>
            <li> Do your research. Canus products contain formaldehyde aka DMDM Hydantoin as printed on their ingredient list. Stick with the small Mom and Pop soap makers. Canus has sold out!</li>
            <li> I have used this brand of soap for a while. So happy to find it here on Amazon at such a reasonable price. I use the Original Fragrance as well as the Fragrance Free. I love the way it feels when it lathers up. It has a very rich, luscious lather and it feels great on my dry skin. I use only this soap and no others. I am hooked. I know a good thing when I see it.</li>
            <li> its leaves skin smooth but only worked on my husband&#x27;s face for a short time, then went back to being red.</li>
            <li> Awesome for dry skin.  Has prevented any further ezcema issues.</li>
            <li> I have found that it leaves waaaay too much soap scum even after just 3 showers. I hate cleaning the tub so often. You HAVE to clean it before a bath. It&#x27;s a real pain. I have gone back to using Dove. I&#x27;ve used milk soap before, but a different kind, and loved it. Maybe this brand is fine if you don&#x27;t take baths.</li>
            <li> My Family starting using this soap awhile ago and we LOVE IT!!! No soap residue on self or tub we have nothing bad to say about it.So glad we started using the soap.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You Canus</li>
            <li> This soap is good and it&#x27;s at a good price. The sent is pleasant and it doesn&#x27;t dry you out.</li>
            <li> love this soap! i have really bad eczema around my nose since i was a kid and have felt the painful everyday peeling, as if i had a sunburn every single day of my life! i tried many things, ridiculous things, home remedy things, nothing worked!! i finally discovered black soap that worked great for a few month&#x27;s, but then became super drying to my face. finally after more research, i read about goat&#x27;s milk soap. i first tried homemade soap off of ebay, but it was too expensive and the bars were too small and finished way too fast. i read the reviews on this particular brand and decided to give it a try and i&#x27;m so glad i did!!  the area around my nose still peels on occasion when i don&#x27;t drink enough water or the weather is too dry, but this soap has worked miracles when it comes to my peeling condition. doesn&#x27;t over dry my face or body and it leaves my skin feeling clean.</li>
            <li> This soap smells so fresh and wonderful and feels so creamy on the skin! I just love it! It is my favorite soap.</li>
            <li> On this particular version of Canus, the description, does not mention THIS IS NOT THE STANDARD VERSION, it is the vegetable version, two very different products.</li>
            <li> I read on a website that goat milk soap is an excellent product for feminine hygiene, better than Summer&#x27;s Eve. I&#x27;m always concerned about freshness so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. LOVE. IT! I have tried every product out there and this is, by far, THE BEST at keeping me smelling fresh and clean all day. My partner likes it too. ;-)</li>
            <li> I love Canus goat milk soap.  I used to get very itchy  in the winter, but since I started using this soap, I have no problem. It also feels great on the skin.</li>
            <li> My face has very, very dry skin.  I saw The Goat&#x27;s Milk Soap in a store and gave it a try.  I have never had such a pleasant surprise from a product. The box says goat&#x27;s milk contains the most capric-capriyllic triglycerides which help moisturize the skin. Whatever.  But it works.  I saw a real, visible difference in my skin after showering and washing my face with this soap.  I would never use any other soap for my face.  This is a product I can highly, highly recommend if you have dry skin. I don&#x27;t care what it tastes like.</li>
            <li> Without a doubt the best bar soap I have ever used! It has a very refreshing scent that stays with you all day.</li>
            <li> Wow !! what an awesome soap . I am of the over forty set and get complimented on my skin all the time .I always get asked what I use and I tell people . My skin has never looked better . I also use it in the shower since I have so many allergies and skin ailments . If any of you have alot of allergies and or skin ailments this is the soap to use . I think you will notice the difference after one use , I did . I will never use anything else ever again .</li>
            <li> NICE SOAP.  Leaves your body feeling soft and supple.  Have not had any flaky skin all winter.  Hours after you get out of the shower, you can touch your skin, and it still feels soft to the touch.  And the smell is clean and very pleasant. . . NOT flowery.</li>
            <li> This is the very best soap I have ever used.  Highly recommend it.  My very dry hands never hurt or itch when I use this soap.</li>
            <li> i love this soap bars they are the best i ever had keep on coming i used it every single dsay really helped my skins and my fave . thank you!!!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent for men or women.  Moistens skin while cleaning with nice suds.  Great gift for anyone.</li>
            <li> This is not the first time using this product.  I just love it, lathers good, nice scent,even use the empty boxes to freshen&lt;br /&gt;up a room or my linen closet.  I intend to by more and try the other scents.  The price was  better that where I use to order.</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t to crazy about the smell, I mean it was clean but kinda boring like i just bought Ivory soap from the store. However it&#x27;s great on the skin and very creamy and unlike other moisturizing soaps if you go to the gym and work out you don&#x27;t get to smelling like with some of these other soaps (dove) so overall I got over the blan smell and for the price considering you get three bars for the price that you would generally pay for one bar of goats milk soap well I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> While I like this soap tremendously, next time, I&#x27;ll purchase the fragrance free.  Thought I&#x27;d try this, and it smells lovely, however, my skin doesn&#x27;t think so...;0)</li>
            <li> I like it but price too high, will not purchase again</li>
            <li> The very best soap I&#x27;ve ever used and smells wonderful, make bath time a pleasure. I&#x27;m sure it will be my soap of choice from now on.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes the perfect amount, and smells very good - not too strong, a fresh scent to it!</li>
            <li> oops... I mixed this up with my canus milk lotion review but except for the lather part I feel the same</li>
            <li> Goat&#x27;s milk soap is the best I have found for dry hands, especially living in a very dry climate.</li>
            <li> This note of alert is intended for those who care:  Amazon includes this soap in its category \\&quot;cruelty free,\\&quot; a choice on the left side of the page that narrows results within \\&quot;soap.\\&quot;  That is flat-out incorrect.  The ingredients listed on the package include goat&#x27;s milk, but the main ingredient is tallow--in other words, animal fat.  It might or might not be tested on animals (I don&#x27;t know), but it is definitely MADE of animals.  I ordered this based on its good reviews and Amazon&#x27;s categorization of it as cruelty-free.  Since the ingredients are not listed in the product description as of this writing, and because repacking and returning items is a pain in the neck, I am mentioning it for those who might, like me, want to know.</li>
            <li> Little or no fragrance and made from Goat&#x27;s Milk ... this soap is heads and shoulders above anything one can purchase in the super markets and apothecaries. You too will be hooked on the entire line of CanUs products.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of the soap. It is so creamy and makes your body feel soft. The fragrance is great. The size of the bar surprised me, much bigger than other bars. I will share this soap with family and friends</li>
            <li> Seems to help with rough skin, good cleanning power. Works good. Makes a nice present for friends. A little pricey.</li>
            <li> An excellent product that is worth the money. It is pretty expensive.</li>
            <li> Wonderful soap for keeping skin soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> Most soaps make me itch.  This is wonderful, lathers well and has a nice, delicate fragrance that men or women can like.</li>
            <li> We love this soap. The smell is heavenly and stays in the bathroom all day.</li>
            <li> I have a dry  skin  issue  and this soap seems to work  wonderful, and I  really  love the original  or natural sent,I hope  to  be  able to continue  to keep  buying.</li>
            <li> Canus Vermont gives us a wonderful product here withtheir Goat Milk Soap. I used it tonight for the first time. Great lather, easy to rinse off, lovely subtle smell and leaves my skin clean&lt;br /&gt;soft and moisturized.  Best soap I&#x27;ve used in years. (I am 75). Thank you Canus Vermont &amp; Amazon for presenting this to us. I love it.</li>
            <li> This product has very bad ingredients. I will not use it or do I want my family to. Sorry I ordered it.</li>
            <li> Love the soap.  Leaves my skin feeling great.  Soap smells really fresh and clean.  But cost is really high.  Now I have found the same soap at Meijer, so I&#x27;ll get it from there from now on.</li>
            <li> Great soap, but tooooooo expensive.  Last time I ordered from another company, I received 3 pkgs of 3 bars each for the same price;  alas, that offer is no longer available.  Well........Ivory Soap,  come on down!</li>
            <li> I purchased this soap because I had reviews about it and how it helped some people who suffered from Eczema. I tried it for several weeks, but it did not help me. However, this might be a case of &amp;#34;your mileage may vary&amp;#34;. On the plus-side, the soap was pleasantly fragranced and did leave my skin feeling a little softer than my usual soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked this soap.  It retains the wonderful goat milk aroma until the soap is used up.  I was happy to find a multi-pack.  Each soap is in a plain white box - the print is only on the plastic wrapper that goes around the 3-pack.  So if you aren&#x27;t giving them away as gifts, the multi-pack is fine.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap on my face for over 10 years, just love it.</li>
            <li> this product is the best soap I&#x27;ve ever used. a canadian import, the quality control is the highest. Has a delightful scent and rinses, even in hard water, easily. has some degree of moisturizing properties. this manufacturer also produces a fabulous skin lotion, which is also a great find. is easily absorbed and is non-greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend. this product is hard to find locally, so ordering eliminates the hassle of scouting for the product.</li>
            <li> This is our favorite all time soap.  No offensive overpowering scent.  Leaves our skin silky soft after doing a great job of cleaning it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Excellent service by vendor.</li>
            <li> This soap seriously saved my skin. I&#x27;m a 25 year old female with acne along my jawline and around my mouth. Canus goats milk soap is the only soap I have ever tried that not only even out the complexion of my skin, but helped treat/minimize existing acne AND keep new acne from forming. I can&#x27;t find it in stores any more so I buy on Amazon. Paired with cera ve moisturizer my skin stays soft and pretty. Finally!!!</li>
            <li> This soap is fabulous.  The scent is so fresh, it will make you sleep like a baby.  Use it ounce and you will be hooked.  G.G.</li>
            <li> Goat&#x27;s milk soap is just plain good for your skin.  I had purchased a bar from some young girls&lt;br /&gt;at a county fair a few years ago just to be nice.  I never intended to use the soap.&lt;br /&gt;One day, in the shower, I was shocked when I had no soap.  I found the bar of goat&#x27;s milk soap&lt;br /&gt;in the bathroom storage cabinet and was so surprised by how much I loved it!&lt;br /&gt;Made my skin feel so soft and clean.&lt;br /&gt;Later, I heard that the ph in goat&#x27;s milk is the same as for humans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know where to find those &amp;#34;goatie girls&amp;#34; so I use The Original Canus Vermont brand and love it.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend using goat&#x27;s milk soap.</li>
            <li> I know this must be good soap and not baaaaad soap. It doesn&#x27;t cause rashes. For me, it seems to help cut down on the mosquito bites, and, I am being refffered to as &amp;#34;an old goat&amp;#34; every since I started using it, about 10 years ago. Bully...............I meant &amp;#34;Billy Good Stuff&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> Canus Vermont Soap is great!</li>
            <li> I have used this soap for years and love it !</li>
            <li> The soap is wonderful, just what I wanted. And it was delivered on time. However, it sleds for half the price on Walgreens.com and I will be buying it for less next time. No reflection on the product or the delivery though. Just Amazon charges too much.</li>
            <li> The original version does not smell as good as orchid. I did not mean to order the original and I wish I hadnt. But this soap is amazing either way. Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  It is gentle on the skin and has such a clean smell.  It is all I use in the shower.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap a few years ago when traveling.  I loved it, but could not find it locally.  I was very pleased to find it again.</li>
            <li> Very soothing on the skin! Love this soap!</li>
            <li> I like this soap it helped me with my exfoliation because my skin get irritated after using likas papaya soap. It helped me to smooth my skin,</li>
            <li> Nice soap with a heavenly scent.  Not sweet but not &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34;.  Could work for male or female.  One bar lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Have used this for many years now and love how it makes my skin smell (fresh) and it makes it soft. This soap lasts a long time even though it lathers up very nicely. I have found it in a local store now, so don&#x27;t have to order it online anymore (hate paying shipping!). But if you want a nice bar soap that smells so good, is gentle enough to use on ALL body parts, including your face, this is the product to try! Your face will not dry out with this soap! Will not use any other bar soap.....ever! Love it! Have tried the Lavender and don&#x27;t like it as well as the Original.</li>
