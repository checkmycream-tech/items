            <li>It was not mailed in a&lt;br /&gt;very good package to prevent it from happening -</li>
            <li>It was good.</li>

            <li>I love their products!</li>
            <li>Beautiful but one of the flowers fell off the first time I put it on.</li>
            <li>Well made, stylish and holds hair nicely.</li>
            <li>Without a doubt the most beautiful hair tool I&#x27;ve ever seen; would recommend highly.</li>
            <li>I love these clips-</li>
            <li>this item is lovely.</li>
            <li>The clip works great even though the price is more than what I would normally pay.  </li>
            <li>WELL WORTH THE MONEY!!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s as good as new.  </li>
            <li>All the petals were intact and the clip was fine.</li>
            <li>, I was excited to use it for a wedding.</li>
            <li>Luckily my handy husband will be able to glue it back on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to be able to wear something fun and frilly with my hair that doesn&#x27;t need to be dug out later.</li>
            <li>My friends with straight hair borrow it from me and love it too.</li>
            <li>I glued the petals on with super glue</li>
            <li>It is very pretty.</li>
            <li>They lay flat in the back of your hair so if you are laying on the floor doing yoga, they are perfect.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty, but one of the flowers fell off immediately after receiving it.</li>
            <li>The clip was beautiful and had a really strong grasp of my fine, thin hair.      </li>
            <li>The product is worth money</li>
            <li>I would love this clip if it didn&#x27;t have the white flowers at all.</li>
            <li>Design is really pretty.</li>
            <li>to re-glue one already, it&#x27;s quite a pretty item.</li>
            <li>All the flowers were intact upon arrival and seem very well fastened.</li>
            <li>I have very long but fine hair (but lots of hair)</li>
            <li>We have searched for this particular teeth/claw design for sometime now.</li>
            <li>They are very comfortable to wear for anyone with long or short hair.</li>
            <li>Since several others said theirs arrived broken, I wanted to say it is possible to receive it perfect.</li>
            <li>Quite pretty actually.  </li>
            <li>It can just be hot glued back on though.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s pretty tough -- I&#x27;ve dropped it and squished it many times.  </li>
            <li>I received the replacement a couple days later from Amazon intact and better packaged than previously.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone interested but be careful they do break easliy!</li>
            <li>I can barely use it as a pony tail holder.  </li>
            <li>Loving it, I returned it, explained the bad packaging and waited for a replacement - well, the second one arrived even more broken than the first.  </li>
            <li>Probably just as well, it looks like the petals would have probably broken easily just leaning your head against something anyway.  </li>
            <li>However, the first one arrived with 2 petals broken off the large white flower.</li>
            <li>It was packaged with the clip in one large plastic bag with bubble wrap wrapped around it and sent in an envelope cardboard box (that could unfortunately be flattened easily during shipping -- which we all know the delivery folks are rough on these boxes).</li>
            <li>was not excited about paying so much for the clip, but when I saw it had the pretty&lt;br</li>

            <li> The clip had no chance - it was in a flat cardboard envlope with no padding and no space between the clip and the cardboard.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed, but being that the clip was just so pretty, I decided to order one, and hoped that it would be fine.</li>
            <li> they just used a plain old manilla&lt;</li>
            <li> It was packaged with several other items in a box.</li>
            <li> originally I was sent the wrong product by mistake</li>
            <li> I finally broke two of the little petals off a couple of weeks ago when I dropped it onto a hardwood floor face-down, but I just glued them back on with gorilla glue</li>
            <li> FIRST ONE CAME WITH BROKEN PETALS AND</li>
            <li> REPLACEMENT ONE WITH ONE FLOWER LOOSE IN BAG</li>
            <li> This hair clip was a little smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> I do notice that the way the petals are lifted, like some other reviewers noted, it can be easily broken, so it is a delicate clip for that reason, but it has a strong hold nonetheless.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> so as much disappointed as I am, I&#x27;m not surprised - they should have packaged&lt;br /&gt;it a little better.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold my hair as well as the other ones that I have.  </li>
            <li> Since other reveiwers said theirs were broke</li>
            <li> I love these clips, I can&#x27;t find them in local stores anymore which stinks!!</li>
            <li> but now it&#x27;s let me down.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair, but it is thin and this clip is not large enough to put my hair up.  </li>
            <li> This item was in a separate bag with bubble wrap round it and the box had ample bubble packets in it also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks now and find it well made.  </li>
            <li> The quality is not nearly as good as I expected.  </li>
            <li> I usually like to use these clips to place over my pony tail holder.</li>
            <li> :-/</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s broke before I open my package, that&#x27;s crazy</li>
            <li> althought the flowers are very delicate and I need</li>
            <li> So I ended up returning it for a refund - we could have played that game all year....    </li>
            <li> Mine also came broken.  </li>
            <li> but it arrived broken due to bad packaging.</li>
            <li> I am sad to write this review - I ordered it and it arrived broken.  </li>

            <li> I love these clips- they are sturdy, comfortable, and gorgeous!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this hair clip for my daughter as a present.  We have searched for this particular teeth/claw design for sometime now. The clip works great even though the price is more than what I would normally pay.  She loves the clip and wears it all the time.</li>
            <li> My item arrived in 2 days through my Amazon Prime. It was packaged with several other items in a box. This item was in a separate bag with bubble wrap round it and the box had ample bubble packets in it also. This item was perfect. All the petals were intact and the clip was fine. Since several others said theirs arrived broken, I wanted to say it is possible to receive it perfect. I only gave it 4 stars since I have not used it in my hair yet, so I don&#x27;t know how well it holds. It is very pretty.</li>
            <li> This hair clip was a little smaller than I expected but it is perfect. I have very long but fine hair (but lots of hair) and the clip did everything I would expect a larger one to do. It arrived in perfect condition and was so feminine and perfect. Without a doubt the most beautiful hair tool I&#x27;ve ever seen; would recommend highly.</li>
            <li> I am sad to write this review - I ordered it and it arrived broken.  Petals on the white flower broke off during shipment.  The clip had no chance - it was in a flat cardboard envlope with no padding and no space between the clip and the cardboard.  The clip was beautiful and had a really strong grasp of my fine, thin hair.      Loving it, I returned it, explained the bad packaging and waited for a replacement - well, the second one arrived even more broken than the first.  There was no change in packaging.  So I ended up returning it for a refund - we could have played that game all year....    Probably just as well, it looks like the petals would have probably broken easily just leaning your head against something anyway.  I would love this clip if it didn&#x27;t have the white flowers at all.</li>
            <li> Clip came today, and I&#x27;m sure it would have been great had it not been all broken.&lt;br /&gt;I was not excited about paying so much for the clip, but when I saw it had the pretty&lt;br /&gt;white flowers on it, I was excited to use it for a wedding. It was not mailed in a&lt;br /&gt;very good package to prevent it from happening - they just used a plain old manilla&lt;br /&gt;envelope so as much disappointed as I am, I&#x27;m not surprised - they should have packaged&lt;br /&gt;it a little better.</li>
            <li> I ordered during the holiday season...originally I was sent the wrong product by mistake however they worked with me to immediatly get the problem resolved.  I love their products!</li>
            <li> It is indeed a beautiful clip.  Be mindful, however, that to say it is for \\&quot;large\\&quot; hair is a bit inaccurate.  I have shoulder length hair, but it is thin and this clip is not large enough to put my hair up.  I can barely use it as a pony tail holder.  I have to put my hair in an elastic and then put the clip over it in order for it to hold.  I wish it included pictures on how to use it, because it doesn&#x27;t work for what I intended.</li>
            <li> This is a very beautiful clip and it is very strong. However, the first one arrived with 2 petals broken off the large white flower. It was packaged with the clip in one large plastic bag with bubble wrap wrapped around it and sent in an envelope cardboard box (that could unfortunately be flattened easily during shipping -- which we all know the delivery folks are rough on these boxes). I was disappointed, but being that the clip was just so pretty, I decided to order one, and hoped that it would be fine. I received the replacement a couple days later from Amazon intact and better packaged than previously. I do notice that the way the petals are lifted, like some other reviewers noted, it can be easily broken, so it is a delicate clip for that reason, but it has a strong hold nonetheless. I usually like to use these clips to place over my pony tail holder. You definitely cannot use this alone to do an up-do if you have medium-thick hair because it&#x27;s not big enough. I will try to post a picture to help for a visual.</li>
            <li> FIRST ONE CAME WITH BROKEN PETALS AND REPLACEMENT ONE WITH ONE FLOWER LOOSE IN BAG</li>
            <li> This caravan duck clip it for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;I rate this product is great A++.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend to all my friend.</li>
            <li> I brought these for my sister as she says they are the only things on earth to use! They lay flat in the back of your hair so if you are laying on the floor doing yoga, they are perfect.  WELL WORTH THE MONEY!!</li>
            <li> Quite pretty actually.  I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks now and find it well made.  All the flowers were intact upon arrival and seem very well fastened.</li>
            <li> Beautiful but one of the flowers fell off the first time I put it on.</li>
            <li> Beautiful clip, but it arrived with one of the flowers falling off.  Luckily my handy husband will be able to glue it back on.</li>
            <li> Beautiful clip that holds your hair great. Design is really pretty.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s broke before I open my package, that&#x27;s crazy I bought this for my girlfriend but now it&#x27;s let me down. don&#x27;t buy this, 15 dollor means a dupe.</li>
            <li> but it arrived broken due to bad packaging. Do not think I will purchase anymore from this company. What a shame.</li>
            <li> this item is lovely. althought the flowers are very delicate and I need to re-glue one already, it&#x27;s quite a pretty item.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this beautiful clip.  I&#x27;ve had it for almost 4 years now, and I&#x27;ve never seen another like it.  It almost has a sort of mid-70&#x27;s retro look to it.  I had no problem with the packaging when it came, I think it was bubble-wrapped, though.  Also, it&#x27;s pretty tough -- I&#x27;ve dropped it and squished it many times.  I finally broke two of the little petals off a couple of weeks ago when I dropped it onto a hardwood floor face-down, but I just glued them back on with gorilla glue and it&#x27;s as good as new.  It&#x27;s expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> Well made, stylish and holds hair nicely.</li>
            <li> Very pretty, but one of the flowers fell off immediately after receiving it. :-/ It can just be hot glued back on though.</li>
            <li> Works great. It&#x27;s a smaller size clip but holds my mass of curly hair in place. The flowers don&#x27;t even get caught in my hair -- which has always a problem for me. It&#x27;s nice to be able to wear something fun and frilly with my hair that doesn&#x27;t need to be dug out later. My friends with straight hair borrow it from me and love it too.</li>
            <li> It was good. The product is worth money and my mom loved it. She got like that once form Vagas but she lost and was always looking like this one.</li>
            <li> The quality is not nearly as good as I expected.  It&#x27;s made of lighter material which doesn&#x27;t make it sturdy.  It doesn&#x27;t hold my hair as well as the other ones that I have.  I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Mine also came broken.  But it is so beautiful.  Since other reveiwers said theirs were broke I was expecting it.  I glued the petals on with super glue and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li> I love these clips, I can&#x27;t find them in local stores anymore which stinks!! They are very comfortable to wear for anyone with long or short hair. I would recommend this product to anyone interested but be careful they do break easliy!</li>
