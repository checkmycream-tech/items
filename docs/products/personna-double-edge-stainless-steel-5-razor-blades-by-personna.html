            <li>good blades, very pleased</li>
            <li>I bought these because the Shark blades were too flimsy and kept catching.  </li>
            <li>Gives him a nice close shave.</li>
            <li>After trying most blades out there this one with my trusty Edwin Jagger&lt;br /&gt;wins best shave so far.</li>
            <li>The best of the double edge razors.</li>
            <li>I LOVE using this blades with my Merkur Safety Razer.</li>
            <li>My husbands favorite razor blades  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be buying any more of these.  </li>
            <li>They are better than the Merkur blades that came with my razor.  </li>
            <li>More shaves will enable me to give a better analysis of the product.</li>
            <li>There are shaper blades on the market, but they are going to give you as many shaves.</li>
            <li>Perfectly sharp great blade great for</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure if you had a different type of beard they would be great.</li>
            <li>These are fine in a pinch, but I&#x27;d go with Merkurs if you have the choice.</li>
            <li>Great products...used all 6 of the blades and quickly ordered more to use daily.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>If you want to get some starter blades, just get one of the sampler packs, it&#x27;s a much better value for so much variety.</li>
            <li>First blade easily lasted a week.  </li>
            <li>if you have any level of sensitive skin, you may want to stick to the more comfortable brands</li>
            <li>Smooth shave and very durable.</li>
            <li>I think i&#x27;ve already saved a couple of tanks of gas worth of razer cartridges.</li>
            <li>Strange thing is with my beard the Personna in the Blue Box work great.</li>
            <li>My personal favorite.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and quality product!</li>
            <li>but this would be perfect for everyday shaving and minimal growth.</li>
            <li>These blades work very well for beginners and pros alike.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast, well packaged.  </li>
            <li>I did not check country of origin, but these things were really grabby - sort of like trying to shave with a cheese grater.</li>
            <li>and they were reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>Sharp, smooth, but not as likely to cut you as a Feather, particularly in a more aggressive razor.</li>
            <li>Not as sharp or as long-lasting as Feather, but good just the same.</li>
            <li>slicing it in a couple of spots on my main fingers.  </li>
            <li>so you dont&#x27; irritate and thus can continue with the shave proper (and not back off to save the pain.. thus leaving more beard).&lt;br</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Clean shave every single time and a closer shave than ever!</li>
            <li>These were much stiffer, but felt dull, pulling on the hair when it was more than 1 day growth.</li>
            <li>Cut pretty cleanly, deeply, and i DIDN&#x27;T</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely very sharp at first and VERY VERY CLOSE.  </li>
            <li>you dont&#x27; have sensitive skin.. this will definitely shave you real close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would steer clear of these.</li>
            <li>advanced ge saftey razer users remember VERY SHARP!</li>
            <li>the end, Personnas are very sharp razors (i think they are 2nd sharpest available on the market or close.  </li>
            <li>If you want a super sharp razor, then look no further.</li>
            <li>With my sensitive skin, that made me back off the shave a bit and thus leave more of a beard behind then using the Astras where i never felt in danger or irritated, thus could continue going for the closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> the end, Personnas are very sharp razors (i think they are 2nd sharpest available on the market or close.  </li>
            <li> If you want a super sharp razor, then look no further.</li>
            <li> With my sensitive skin, that made me back off the shave a bit and thus leave more of a beard behind then using the Astras where i never felt in danger or irritated, thus could continue going for the closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I went back to using these double edge blades with my old razor that I still have and they last forever if when you finish saving, you just rub against a wash cloth carefully, rinse under the water and then lay in towel and fold towel over and dry them.  </li>
            <li> Overpriced, inconsistent from one blade to the next, only two or three shaves per blade for me (five shaves is what I usually get from Shark Super Chrome blades or Astra blades for half the price of these Personnas).</li>
            <li> They do tend to dull faster than less sharp blades and thus you can feel this blade more - easire to irritate the skin.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sharp enough to last 5-7 shaves and they work well on any type of razor.</li>
            <li> Not only sharp, but long lasting.</li>
            <li> But for me the red box of Personna where to sharp.</li>
            <li> Then I just grab blade and fan it in the air to dry.  </li>
            <li> Only downside is that they come in a tiny cardboard box rather than the little plastic container with a spent blade slot.</li>
            <li> very sharp and stays that way for several shaves.  </li>
            <li> I had a slight accident trying to put my razor back together again, and the razor head slipped thorugh my fingers making the razor \\&quot;twirl\\&quot; in my head..</li>
            <li> When we were young, he shaved at least twice a day.</li>
            <li> Use them carefully.</li>
            <li> You do have to be careful and pay attention and can&#x27;t just go thru the motions - you will hurt yourself</li>
            <li> It seems that the quality varies between blades from being as sharp as promised or dull enough to pull on your entire beard.</li>
            <li> He is older with a very thick beard.</li>
            <li> I find these blades very sharp, as sharp as the feather,these blades will glide accross</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to actually get the blades out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So.. very sharp.  </li>
            <li> Sounds like a lot to do, but it takes less than 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> Caused a lot of little nic&#x27;s on me.</li>
            <li> The green Astra blades work for me.</li>
            <li> youre face,with out scrapping, also will remain sharp for at least 3-4 shaves.</li>
            <li> The blades themselves are alright, but the casing they come in is really difficult to deal with.</li>

            <li> Very good blades.  Not as sharp or as long-lasting as Feather, but good just the same.</li>
            <li> I found these to be sharper than the Japanese Feather Razors. Use them carefully. If you want a super sharp razor, then look no further.</li>
            <li> I find these blades very sharp, as sharp as the feather,these blades will glide accross youre face,with out scrapping, also will remain sharp for at least 3-4 shaves.</li>

            <li> Superb razor blades from Israel.  Sharp, smooth, but not as likely to cut you as a Feather, particularly in a more aggressive razor.</li>
            <li> These blades work very well for beginners and pros alike. They&#x27;re sharp enough to last 5-7 shaves and they work well on any type of razor.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using these blades for over a year. (bought from another company). He is older with a very thick beard. When we were young, he shaved at least twice a day. Excellent blades</li>
            <li> The best of the double edge razors.</li>
            <li> These blades are just like the Derby for me? One or two shaves per blade???</li>
            <li> Read a lot about these and thought I&#x27;d try.  Arrived fast, well packaged.  First blade easily lasted a week.  These are Excellent blades.</li>
            <li> Great blades, great shave. Only downside is that they come in a tiny cardboard box rather than the little plastic container with a spent blade slot.</li>
            <li> Great service But for me the red box of Personna where to sharp. I&#x27;m sure if you had a different type of beard they would be great. Strange thing is with my beard the Personna in the Blue Box work great. I guess the red box is just sharper then the blue box Personna</li>
            <li> Unlike Personna&#x27;s Comfort Coated blades, these blades tend to chaff my skin while shaving with a safety razor. I&#x27;d recommend getting Personna&#x27;s Comfort Coated blades instead. Those tend to last 3 days and come in an economy pack of 100.</li>
            <li> Best blades I have tried. My personal favorite.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and quality product! I LOVE using this blades with my Merkur Safety Razer. Clean shave every single time and a closer shave than ever! So inexpensive too. I think i&#x27;ve already saved a couple of tanks of gas worth of razer cartridges.</li>
            <li> I did not check country of origin, but these things were really grabby - sort of like trying to shave with a cheese grater. The green Astra blades work for me.</li>
            <li> Great blade. Smooth shave and very durable. I think I need to go up another level in sharpness but this would be perfect for everyday shaving and minimal growth.</li>
            <li> good blades, very pleased</li>
            <li> I went back to using these double edge blades with my old razor that I still have and they last forever if when you finish saving, you just rub against a wash cloth carefully, rinse under the water and then lay in towel and fold towel over and dry them.  Then I just grab blade and fan it in the air to dry.  Sounds like a lot to do, but it takes less than 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> UPDATED:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IN the end, Personnas are very sharp razors (i think they are 2nd sharpest available on the market or close.  I know b/c I had a slight accident trying to put my razor back together again, and the razor head slipped thorugh my fingers making the razor \\&quot;twirl\\&quot; in my head.. slicing it in a couple of spots on my main fingers.  Cut pretty cleanly, deeply, and i DIDN&#x27;T FEEL A THING...  (oh i did afterwards trying to mend up - took about 5 days to mend from these slices).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely very sharp at first and VERY VERY CLOSE.  You do have to be careful and pay attention and can&#x27;t just go thru the motions - you will hurt yourself ifyou do that. They do tend to dull faster than less sharp blades and thus you can feel this blade more - easire to irritate the skin.  With my sensitive skin, that made me back off the shave a bit and thus leave more of a beard behind then using the Astras where i never felt in danger or irritated, thus could continue going for the closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So.. very sharp.  very effective.  BE CAREFUL!&lt;br /&gt;AND..  if you have any level of sensitive skin, you may want to stick to the more comfortable brands so you dont&#x27; irritate and thus can continue with the shave proper (and not back off to save the pain.. thus leaving more beard).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you dont&#x27; have sensitive skin.. this will definitely shave you real close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IN my experience and for my coarse hair/sensitive skin, my razor rankings are:  Astra, Wilkinson, Personna, Derby</li>
            <li> My husbands favorite razor blades  and they were reasonably priced.  He has been using them forever.  Gives him a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be buying any more of these.  Overpriced, inconsistent from one blade to the next, only two or three shaves per blade for me (five shaves is what I usually get from Shark Super Chrome blades or Astra blades for half the price of these Personnas).</li>
            <li> very sharp and stays that way for several shaves.  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  Just started to use them.  They are better than the Merkur blades that came with my razor.  More shaves will enable me to give a better analysis of the product.</li>
            <li> Not only sharp, but long lasting. There are shaper blades on the market, but they are going to give you as many shaves.</li>
            <li> I would steer clear of these. It seems that the quality varies between blades from being as sharp as promised or dull enough to pull on your entire beard. If you want to get some starter blades, just get one of the sampler packs, it&#x27;s a much better value for so much variety.</li>
            <li> After trying most blades out there this one with my trusty Edwin Jagger&lt;br /&gt;wins best shave so far.</li>
            <li> Great products...used all 6 of the blades and quickly ordered more to use daily.</li>
