            <li>The curling trick works great because of the rounded barrel</li>
            <li>Bought as a gift and have been told it works great by the recipient.</li>
            <li>and it does a great job, better than my Chi!  </li>
            <li>Thank you for a great product and amazing customer service.  </li>
            <li>TOTALLY LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>It comes in a really nice case.</li>
            <li>Nice quality and nice packaging the level of Apple inc.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for coarse hair, so happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>It works very good with professional results at home!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but I love the job that it does.</li>
            <li>I have owned about 4 $150+ hair straighteners, this is possibly the best on the market for its price.</li>
            <li>I did a lot of research before making this purchase and overall have been very happy with this</li>
            <li>They just don&#x27;t make them like they used to :)</li>
            <li>all though, I love my Karmin -</li>
            <li>Love it..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m finished my hair looks phenomenal</li>
            <li>I love this straightener.  </li>
            <li>your looking for best flat iron don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this one.</li>
            <li>then the others.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waist your time researching for the best flat iron.</li>
            <li>The best flat iron I owned.</li>
            <li>Use it in conjunction with Moroccan Oil and Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Hot off the Presses to insure a gorgeous shine and heat protection.  </li>
            <li>All I had to produce was a copy of the original purchase, which was easy since I bought it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Variable temperature control allows for those of us who want to maintain damage free hair.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair smooth and sometimes shiny.  </li>
            <li>However, this item seems to be made of cheap materials that off-gas when on.  </li>
            <li>I believe it is just cheap plastic that off-gasses</li>
            <li>Have been using it weekly at a medium setting and my long air straightens beautifully within 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s what all tourmaline plates will do to my hair, but just in case, I&#x27;ll keep using my wonderful ceramic corioliss.</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>I was worried that this flat iron was to good to be true, but it truly works!</li>
            <li>quick heat up</li>
            <li>only reason I did not give it a 5 star rating is because I felt as if the material it is made from is not of exceptional quality.</li>
            <li>it gets the job done quickly.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>So overall I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I love, love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>I just love my new iron.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s beautiful, heats up super fast, I never go above 350 because I have fine, naturally wavy, color processed hair</li>
            <li>great product, exactly how I expected to be!</li>
            <li>Even before I got the extensions with just my own hair I had to make multiple passes</li>
            <li>Please note, It gets very hot and heats up very fast which she loves.  </li>
            <li>really nice flat iron..</li>
            <li>It was a bit pricey for me, and I was only able to buy it because my sweet daughter bought it for me for my birthday.</li>
            <li>This price is a bit more that the Chi&#x27;s, but worth every penny extra.</li>
            <li>It works today (2 years after purchase) as well as it did the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>but I couldn&#x27;t go any higher on the heat setting because it would burn my hair.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>and it really makes it  shinny!</li>
            <li>I will definately buy more Karmin products in the future.</li>
            <li>It does have a burning hair type smell when you use it, but it doesn&#x27;t really bother me.</li>
            <li>It has more features than the other irons I was considering.</li>
            <li>I have owned many Chi&#x27;s and this by far surpasses the Chi flat iron in every way!!!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s shiny and not dry or brittle, there&#x27;s no smell, only the smell of whatever heat safe styling product I&#x27;m using.  </li>
            <li>Karmin has a new customer for life!</li>
            <li>One of the main reasons I purchased was for the dual voltage feature since I travel overseas</li>
            <li>I spent a long time hunting for the right iron and the features on this one plus some outstanding reviews sold me.  </li>
            <li>This flat iron heats up extremely quick and looks great, but when I used it on my curly hair it gave it a weird texture and also made it crunchy.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend it, is worth it every penny.</li>
            <li>It can double as a curling iron with the right technique.</li>
            <li>very light and convenient..hair stays flat without frizz until the next wash..would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li>I still have to make 2 passes down the length of the hair to get it smooth.  </li>
            <li>this is the first flat iron I&#x27;ve used that handles it in one pass</li>
            <li>I was looking for certain features in a new flat iron.</li>
            <li>&amp; it makes my hair shiny &amp; soft.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth every dime spent!</li>
            <li>finally decided on getting the Karmin G3 Pro 2012 flat iron in white, it is really very pretty.....</li>
            <li>This item works pretty much like any other high-end flat iron that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I have natural African American hair and this flat iron gets it very straight.</li>
            <li>no regrets</li>
            <li>Recently the cord has started to give a spotty connection when placed down certain way</li>
            <li>so I emailed them and within less than a week there was a new one at my door at no cost to me!</li>

            <li> I did my homework before ordering the Karmin G3 Pro 2012 flat iron.</li>
            <li> The Karmin flat iron does not burn your hair at all</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several irons in the past and this one does the job as if I used my hair stylist&#x27;s flat iron.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is an expensive product but worth</li>
            <li> With my $20 flat iron I would have to straighten it at least twice to get the desired style, but this 1 I only have to do it once</li>
            <li> I used other flat iron brands in the past - none of them come close to Karmin.</li>
            <li> THIS IS MY OTHER HALF!</li>
            <li> I feel like my hair is less damaged with it too.</li>
            <li> and I asked a few hair stylists which one they suggested.</li>
            <li> - this has cut my time in half!  </li>
            <li> (the negative reviews that the other people gave, they don&#x27;t even make any sense...</li>
            <li> buy the Karmin G3 Pro 2012 flat iron, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with this flat iron.</li>
            <li> But it is less expensive</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with it is the smell of it :(</li>
            <li> I am nervous that if I drop it on the tile floor in my bathroom the wrong way that it will crack.</li>
            <li> My hair is impossible..</li>

            <li> I did my homework before ordering the Karmin G3 Pro 2012 flat iron. I wanted the best for my money. I was looking for certain features in a new flat iron. I asked several people which iron they used and I asked a few hair stylists which one they suggested. I was online for 2 weeks, searching...and...searching. I even went on UTube to see what info I could get!! I  was obsessive : /  and determined to get the best I could afford.&lt;br /&gt;I finally decided on getting the Karmin G3 Pro 2012 flat iron in white, it is really very pretty.....but I love the job that it does. I&#x27;ve had several irons in the past and this one does the job as if I used my hair stylist&#x27;s flat iron. I just love my new iron.&lt;br /&gt;If your looking for best flat iron don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this one. It has more features than the other irons I was considering. It was a bit pricey for me, and I was only able to buy it because my sweet daughter bought it for me for my birthday. But it is less expensive then the others.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waist your time researching for the best flat iron. I have already done all the \\&quot;homework\\&quot; for you.....buy the Karmin G3 Pro 2012 flat iron, you won&#x27;t be sorry. (the negative reviews that the other people gave, they don&#x27;t even make any sense...ignore them!)&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!!</li>
            <li> I have owned about 4 $150+ hair straighteners, this is possibly the best on the market for its price. Even my friends are looking to upgrade to this one! The moment you receive the product you know you&#x27;ve purchased a quality tool. Variable temperature control allows for those of us who want to maintain damage free hair. It works today (2 years after purchase) as well as it did the first time I used it. Karmin has a new customer for life!</li>
            <li> The best flat iron I owned. It&#x27;s great for coarse hair, so happy with my purchase. Me and my daughters use it for over a year now.</li>
            <li> Nice product. It works very good with professional results at home!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it months and really happy with it.</li>
            <li> THIS IS MY OTHER HALF! TOTALLY LOVE IT! no regrets</li>
            <li> This flat iron heats up extremely quick and looks great, but when I used it on my curly hair it gave it a weird texture and also made it crunchy. I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s what all tourmaline plates will do to my hair, but just in case, I&#x27;ll keep using my wonderful ceramic corioliss.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife for her birthday and she loves it and says its the best styling iron she has used. Please note, It gets very hot and heats up very fast which she loves.  Great product. Thank you.</li>
            <li> great product, exactly how I expected to be! I definitely recommend it, is worth it every penny. I used other flat iron brands in the past - none of them come close to Karmin.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before making this purchase and overall have been very happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I like about it:&lt;br /&gt;-Adjustable temperature&lt;br /&gt;-Heats to over 400 degrees&lt;br /&gt;-Very quick heat up&lt;br /&gt;-Light flashes when it is not up to temperature&lt;br /&gt;-Long power cord&lt;br /&gt;-Sleek design&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I did not give it a 5 star rating is because I felt as if the material it is made from is not of exceptional quality. I am nervous that if I drop it on the tile floor in my bathroom the wrong way that it will crack. I have come to the conclusion that this is likely a similar issue with all newer straighteners on the market. They just don&#x27;t make them like they used to :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all though, I love my Karmin - it gets the job done quickly.</li>
            <li> I have natural African American hair and this flat iron gets it very straight. I feel like my hair is less damaged with it too.</li>
            <li> This item works pretty much like any other high-end flat iron that I&#x27;ve tried. It has an adjustable heat setting that goes up to 460 F. It can double as a curling iron with the right technique. Leaves hair smooth and sometimes shiny.  However, this item seems to be made of cheap materials that off-gas when on.  The smell of burning plastic seems noxious and has not gone away after months of usage.  The unit seems to be functional.  No technical problems.  I believe it is just cheap plastic that off-gasses when heated.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t mind breathing in toxic fumes every time you use this product, then go for it. It works well. If you do mind the smell of burning plastic, I would recommend looking elsewhere.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for . The only problem I have with it is the smell of it :(</li>
            <li> Great.&lt;br /&gt;My wife is very happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;It is an expensive product but worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> Worth the money! It comes in a really nice case. With my $20 flat iron I would have to straighten it at least twice to get the desired style, but this 1 I only have to do it once &amp; it makes my hair shiny &amp; soft. It does have a burning hair type smell when you use it, but it doesn&#x27;t really bother me.</li>
            <li> Love it..really nice flat iron..very light and convenient..hair stays flat without frizz until the next wash..would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I spent a long time hunting for the right iron and the features on this one plus some outstanding reviews sold me.  One of the main reasons I purchased was for the dual voltage feature since I travel overseas I can still bring my tools.  I got the white one, it&#x27;s beautiful, heats up super fast, I never go above 350 because I have fine, naturally wavy, color processed hair and I also have extensions by Dream Catchers.  The curling trick works great because of the rounded barrel but I did have to give it four stars based on the fact  I still have to make 2 passes down the length of the hair to get it smooth.  Even before I got the extensions with just my own hair I had to make multiple passes but I couldn&#x27;t go any higher on the heat setting because it would burn my hair.&lt;br /&gt;When I&#x27;m finished my hair looks phenomenal, it&#x27;s shiny and not dry or brittle, there&#x27;s no smell, only the smell of whatever heat safe styling product I&#x27;m using.  So overall I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love, love this flat iron. I have owned many Chi&#x27;s and this by far surpasses the Chi flat iron in every way!!! The Karmin flat iron does not burn your hair at all what so ever and it really makes it  shinny! I was worried that this flat iron was to good to be true, but it truly works! This price is a bit more that the Chi&#x27;s, but worth every penny extra. You cannot go wrong with this flat iron.</li>
            <li> My hair is impossible.. this is the first flat iron I&#x27;ve used that handles it in one pass - this has cut my time in half!  Definitely worth every dime spent! Now I have time to actually do my make up!</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift and have been told it works great by the recipient. Nice quality and nice packaging the level of Apple inc.</li>
            <li> I love this straightener.  I&#x27;ve had it for over 2 years now and it does a great job, better than my Chi!  I would like to give a shout out to Karmin for the awesome warranty as well.  Recently the cord has started to give a spotty connection when placed down certain way so I emailed them and within less than a week there was a new one at my door at no cost to me! All I had to produce was a copy of the original purchase, which was easy since I bought it on Amazon.  Thank you for a great product and amazing customer service.  I will definately buy more Karmin products in the future.</li>
            <li> As an total newbie to flat ironing, I couldn&#x27;t believe how easy it was to take my frizzy hair and turn it into a do that looked like I walked out of an expensive salon.  Have been using it weekly at a medium setting and my long air straightens beautifully within 10 minutes.  LOVE IT!!!! Use it in conjunction with Moroccan Oil and Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Hot off the Presses to insure a gorgeous shine and heat protection.  Wish I found this iron years ago.</li>
