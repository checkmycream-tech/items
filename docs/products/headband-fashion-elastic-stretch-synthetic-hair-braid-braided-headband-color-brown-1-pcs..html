            <li>Still, it looks okay.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sort of too shiny as well, but it is still cute.</li>
            <li>I plan to buy more for Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li>More of a chestnut brown.</li>
            <li>love it.  </li>
            <li>The product is ok for the price, is synthetic hair</li>
            <li>I just got my hair dyed so it matches better, so</li>
            <li>I will start wearing it more often for sure.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cute headband.</li>
            <li>Especially extremely cute when going for a hippie look.  </li>
            <li>The color isn&#x27;t brown like in the picture, it&#x27;s more auburn.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m satisfied with this hairband.</li>
            <li>My favorite of all hair looks - the braid is the perfect size to add style to everyday hair</li>
            <li>Durable and strong.  </li>
            <li>The quality is fine, but it&#x27;s not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>Because it was cheap</li>
            <li>Not bad at all for the price</li>
            <li>but I guess I got lucky.</li>
            <li>It is a cute headband, but not nearly as thick as shown.</li>
            <li>It is a very pretty color</li>
            <li>It took more than a month to arrive as it ships directly from Taiwan</li>
            <li>In actuality, it is very, very skinny, NOTHING like the photo.</li>
            <li>The only way I can wear it is around the top of my head like an 80\\&quot;s headband.</li>
            <li>The color worked pretty well</li>
            <li>it is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>The color is more of a ash brown not red at all</li>
            <li>Anyways, even though it is cheap and has free shipping, it is not worth it.</li>
            <li>Very misleading photo.</li>
            <li>Instead, it comes off as being very unnatural; it&#x27;s a shade of hair color that doesn&#x27;t exist.</li>
            <li>Really dresses up a hairdo.</li>
            <li>This is very well made.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally auburn hair, and I was expecting the braid to look exactly like my shade.</li>
            <li>I ordered back in April on my full head of hair.</li>
            <li>will tone down the shine and look more realistic.</li>
            <li>love the headband but picture is not accurate.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not a true Brown, there is a nice red in it.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll use a hot glue gun to fix it later, for now it sits in a drawer.</li>
            <li>And it arrived early!  </li>
            <li>It is much thinner than pictured (I did measure width before) and it is so big around, it doesn&#x27;t stay on my head as it should.</li>
            <li>This in Clairs cost about nearly 10 bucks, but it&#x27;s cheaper here</li>
            <li>I would send back, but shipping back would probably cost as much as the headband.</li>
            <li>so it was very shiny, but i put some loose powder make up and that solved the problem.</li>
            <li>The elastic barely stretches and it slides up.</li>
            <li>I had ordered a set of five thin looking braids from the same seller and then this braid as well, (paying much more for this single braid) because it looked much thicker than the others.  </li>

            <li> Thought the braid would be thicker but it&#x27;s pretty skinny, about half an in or so wide.  </li>
            <li> This item took WAY too long to be delivered, it came after I needed it.  </li>
            <li> The photos make the braid appear wider, but it&#x27;s only as wide as my smallest finger.</li>
            <li> Someone left a review saying it was a bit red like the picture, not true</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be mislead by the photo, it is very narrow, not at all like what is pictured...do not waste your money</li>
            <li> Looks like plastic, too shiny, not realistic.</li>
            <li> shiny, but a little powdered make up brushed on it</li>
            <li> This braid is pictured as  a wide braid headband.</li>
            <li> Was expecting a thicker brain, not some skinny 1/2 inch wide band.  </li>
            <li> It arrived only a few days before Halloween, but the braid was coming unraveled.</li>
            <li> Completely useless, would not waste your money unless you have a really big head.</li>
            <li> Not worth the wait!</li>
            <li> But the braid itself is very thin and small, and the fibers are so fake that it stands out too much when compared to your natural hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Was a waste of money as it does not go with my hair color.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It wound up being identical to the small braids.  </li>
            <li> The headband is heavy duty!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the color and too small also in the picture</li>
            <li> Not only that, the color is off, and it is very poorly made.</li>
            <li> Hard to find with a reddish tint.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s hard to match the color on these</li>
            <li> It is maybe 1/2&amp;#34; thick.  </li>
            <li> Its not as thick as how It looks in the picture so</li>
            <li> The braid is listed as 3/4&amp;#34; thick.  </li>
            <li> It is less than 1/4&amp;#34; thick and extremely fake looking to boot.  </li>
            <li> the one i received is very narrow - like the elastic portion on the bottom, so that was a bit disappointing.</li>
            <li> The company sent the wrong item, and would NOT contact me</li>
            <li> This is very thin, does not at all look the like the picture.</li>
            <li> This was very frustrating!</li>
            <li> I was greatly disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Terrible fake product.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is the worst headband I have ever purchased.</li>

            <li> I ordered this for Oktoberfest, 3 1/2 weeks before I needed it. This item took WAY too long to be delivered, it came after I needed it.  It is much thinner than pictured (I did measure width before) and it is so big around, it doesn&#x27;t stay on my head as it should. The elastic barely stretches and it slides up. The only way I can wear it is around the top of my head like an 80\\&quot;s headband. Completely useless, would not waste your money unless you have a really big head.</li>
            <li> The company sent the wrong item, and would NOT contact me so I could replace it/return it. Was a waste of money as it does not go with my hair color.</li>
            <li> I had ordered a set of five thin looking braids from the same seller and then this braid as well, (paying much more for this single braid) because it looked much thicker than the others.  It wound up being identical to the small braids.  It is maybe 1/2&amp;#34; thick.  There is no way that the photograph they have is an actual representation of this product.  Not only that, the color is off, and it is very poorly made.</li>
            <li> The color is warm which I like.  Hard to find with a reddish tint.  Durable and strong.  Nice braid.  Quality item.</li>
            <li> Its very Nice And a Quick way to style up your Hair !</li>
            <li> The collor is different from what you see on webside.  It is not brown,  It has lots of red too</li>
            <li> The colour is definitely auburn which works well with my hair and my daughter&#x27;s. It is a cute headband, but not nearly as thick as shown. Chose it because it looked thicker than the others we have ordered, but same size as smaller ones advertised at lower price.</li>
            <li> It slips off my head which defeats the purpose of a headband.</li>
            <li> This braid is pictured as  a wide braid headband. In actuality, it is very, very skinny, NOTHING like the photo. I am very disappointed. I would send back, but shipping back would probably cost as much as the headband. Very misleading photo.</li>
            <li> I was greatly disappointed with this purchase. The photo indicates that the braid headpiece would be oversized, giving off that lovely, exaggerated look I was wanting to acquire with my hair. But the braid itself is very thin and small, and the fibers are so fake that it stands out too much when compared to your natural hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I would like to stress that the color that it&#x27;s supposed to be (which is auburn) is NOT auburn at all. I have naturally auburn hair, and I was expecting the braid to look exactly like my shade. Instead, it comes off as being very unnatural; it&#x27;s a shade of hair color that doesn&#x27;t exist. It is not auburn! The braid looks as if it were dyed in diluted blush wine. That&#x27;s the only way I can describe the color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer Beware!</li>
            <li> This is a nice headband. The color worked pretty well and I&#x27;m happy with it. I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s hard to match the color on these but I guess I got lucky.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Every day I brush my hair into formation and I put the imaginary brown braided headband I ordered back in April on my full head of hair. I love that I never received this product.</li>
            <li> Though it doesn&#x27;t match my hair color it is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> The headband is heavy duty! Great! Someone left a review saying it was a bit red like the picture, not true that was the only reason I bought it. The color is more of a ash brown not red at all but it&#x27;s still a very nice head piece.</li>
            <li> Looks like plastic, too shiny, not realistic.</li>
            <li> Had no grip on the inside. Did not match my hair like I thought it would. Terrible fake product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be mislead by the photo, it is very narrow, not at all like what is pictured...do not waste your money</li>
            <li> The photos make the braid appear wider, but it&#x27;s only as wide as my smallest finger. The quality is fine, but it&#x27;s not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> This is very thin, does not at all look the like the picture. I was very disappointed. Was expecting a thicker brain, not some skinny 1/2 inch wide band.  Not what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Love the fact it came in Fast!!!!&lt;br /&gt;looks great and the color . Piece looks like it will last for ever. Good quality</li>
            <li> What you&#x27;d expect for the price.  Still, it looks okay.</li>
            <li> love the headband but picture is not accurate.  the one i received is very narrow - like the elastic portion on the bottom, so that was a bit disappointing.</li>
            <li> This is the worst headband I have ever purchased. It is brassy in color. I guess they don&#x27;t know what brown is. Its too big I don&#x27;t know anyone with a head as big as this band. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li> Not worth the wait! I bought this for a Halloween costume. It took 3-4  weeks for delivery, with no tracking info. I knew shipping was going to take a while, but I had no idea where it was. This was very frustrating! It arrived only a few days before Halloween, but the braid was coming unraveled. Because it was cheap and I didn&#x27;t have the time to get it replaced I kept it and used Bobby pins to keep it in place. Maybe I&#x27;ll use a hot glue gun to fix it later, for now it sits in a drawer. Also, reviews about the color are correct it&#x27;s not a true Brown, there is a nice red in it. It is a very pretty color so I didn&#x27;t mind. Anyways, even though it is cheap and has free shipping, it is not worth it.</li>
            <li> Thought the braid would be thicker but it&#x27;s pretty skinny, about half an in or so wide.  It&#x27;s sort of too shiny as well, but it is still cute.</li>
            <li> My favorite of all hair looks - the braid is the perfect size to add style to everyday hair look</li>
            <li> Its not as thick as how It looks in the picture so if thats what caught your attention to buy it then don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The angle the picture was taken from would suggest this braid is thicker and larger then it actually is. Its about an inch wide.&lt;br /&gt;Very shiny, but a little powdered make up brushed on it will tone down the shine and look more realistic. Not bad at all for the price</li>
            <li> The braid is listed as 3/4&amp;#34; thick.  It is less than 1/4&amp;#34; thick and extremely fake looking to boot.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> great buy! And it arrived early!  Looks very natural and fits perfectly also. I plan to buy more for Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too big for my head and not adjustable.</li>
            <li> More of a chestnut brown. But that&#x27;s perfect for me since my hair is chestnut brown.  Can&#x27;t wait to wear this.</li>
            <li> love it.  Really dresses up a hairdo.</li>
            <li> This synthetic hair braid was supposed to be brown--as the (incorrect picture shows) but I got a dirty-blond color instead--and it looks like plastic hair too... I don&#x27;t know what to do with this garbage as I Can&#x27;t use it. PISSED OFF in Michigan!!</li>
            <li> The product is ok for the price, is synthetic hair so it was very shiny, but i put some loose powder make up and that solved the problem. It took more than a month to arrive as it ships directly from Taiwan but it came in good condition.</li>
            <li> Not used to wearing, but I like it.  I just got my hair dyed so it matches better, so I will start wearing it more often for sure.  This is very well made.  Excellent quality.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the color and too small also in the picture look much better!</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cute headband. Especially extremely cute when going for a hippie look.  The color isn&#x27;t brown like in the picture, it&#x27;s more auburn.  But that&#x27;s o.k because it blends in with my medium brown locks. This in Clairs cost about nearly 10 bucks, but it&#x27;s cheaper here and it&#x27;s just about the same quality. So I&#x27;m satisfied with this hairband.</li>
