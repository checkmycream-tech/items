            <li> I love the necklace but a few of the chains have already broken and I&#x27;ve worn it twice.</li>
            <li> Some of the chains were loose, and 2 of the leafs were not even attached.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting this to break long ago as it only cost a few dollars including shipping.</li>
            <li> considering how little I paid for it.  </li>
            <li> Not to heavy to wear.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I can even wear this because the tarnish on the leaf cannot be hidden.</li>
            <li> I am still trying to figure out how to fix this mess of chains!</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I had to go get something for her last minute..</li>
            <li> However, it was all just one color not like shown on picture :/</li>
            <li> It came tangled and broken.  </li>
            <li> I had to get pliers and try to link the items back together - the clasp was so horrible</li>
            <li> I spent an hour trying to untangled very annoying.</li>

            <li> Got tangled and broke.  Never wore it.</li>
            <li> This was to be a Christmas present..When I opened the bag it was in, the necklace was TOTALLY in pieces! I am still trying to figure out how to fix this mess of chains! Needless to say, I had to go get something for her last minute..If it wasn&#x27;t cheap, I would have really been upset and mailed it back, but after looking at it, the postage would have been more than the necklace was worth..It is true, you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> I was expecting this to break long ago as it only cost a few dollars including shipping. But so far so good!

            <li> Fell apart first time I wore it!</li>
            <li> It broke almost immediately the same day.  I had to get pliers and try to link the items back together - the clasp was so horrible it practically fell to pieces.</li>
            <li> amazing for either dress up, casual or jean day. My daughter borrows it often. Not to heavy to wear. Like it alot</li>
            <li> very nice light weight and lovely  for the price. I would recommend it,I am very happy with this necklace PRETTY</li>
            <li> I love this necklace. Ithe leaves are a little flimsy, but the chain is great quality. Plus it&#x27;s super cute!</li>
            <li> The necklace is pretty and looks good when worn but isn&#x27;t made well. It broke the first time I wore it.</li>
            <li> Was delivered to me already tarnished. Not sure if I can even wear this because the tarnish on the leaf cannot be hidden.</li>
            <li> It took me over 2 months after ordering to actually receive this chain. It came with 2 of the feathers detached which were easily replaced. All in all, it&#x27;s a lovely chain. It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> Given the price, I like it.</li>
            <li> Great necklace for the price.  I was really surprised by it&#x27;s good quality considering how little I paid for it.  It&#x27;s really cute!!!</li>
            <li> Pretty necklace love it the only thing that keep me from rating higher is that it gets tangled I spent an hour trying to untangled very annoying.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT! I love for things to hang and this just was perfect! It wasn&#x27;t all in a ball when I received it! Great product. Great buy!</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for is all I can say.</li>
            <li> okay so i ordered this for my mom. and it came in the mail today.. and omg it was great. my mom completely fell in love with it :) :) :) :) :) : )</li>
            <li> material is cheap but design is good</li>
            <li> Nice and the price was even better!</li>
            <li> I love the style but I just used 2 times and tear apart</li>
            <li> this is a great necklace but beware the complications with tangling</li>
            <li> It came tangled and broken.  Some of the chains were loose, and 2 of the leafs were not even attached.  Normally, I don&#x27;t mind, especially for the price I get the jewelry for, but this was beyond the repairs I could do.  Nothing I did could salvage this.  I&#x27;m going to order it again just to see if a better one comes, cause hey, it&#x27;s cheap, and if it comes the same way, I know better for the future.  Beware!</li>
            <li> Good length.  Its a cheap way to dress up a sweater.</li>
            <li> broke when i took it out of the envelope it was sent in</li>
            <li> necklace was falling apart the very first day</li>
            <li> gave as a gift . love</li>
            <li> I recommend this product as nice gift to give to wife or girlfriend. For the cost of this item is not bad plus coming out foreign country. My wife loves it she doesn&#x27;t wear it as much but sometimes.</li>
            <li> Really nice. However, it was all just one color not like shown on picture :/</li>
            <li> Beautiful necklace in person-purchased one in silver and one in gold to use this winter with sweaters.  I hope they hold up!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute, but you definitely get what you pay for. It&#x27;s very flimsy, the leaves bend very easy, and it if it get&#x27;s tangled the chains break easy.</li>
            <li> This necklace broke as soon as it came out of the package</li>
            <li> Very exotic necklace, received on time, just what i wanted. Can&#x27;t wait to wear it to my upcoming party. Looks just as described in the picture.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money.  Doesn&#x27;t look cheap at all.  Looks like something you would buy from s department store.</li>
            <li> Its a cute necklace, I can&#x27;t really complain other than it took a month to come but I do like it. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I enjoy this necklace a lot. Its fun and different then anything I&#x27;ve ever seen. You can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> I love the necklace but a few of the chains have already broken and I&#x27;ve worn it twice.</li>
            <li> If I could give this item a 0 I would.  The chains tangled with one another throughout the day requiring my attention to fix them.  The chains then tangled to a degree that I could not fix them just by having te necklace on my dresser.  In my efforts to detangle the necklace the leaves then were rippin off.  As a result this necklace is now in my garbage.  It aggravated me to the extent that I didn&#x27;t even think about a return or refund I just didn&#x27;t want to deal with it anymore!</li>
            <li> Not so bad, is cheap, but kind of cute.</li>
