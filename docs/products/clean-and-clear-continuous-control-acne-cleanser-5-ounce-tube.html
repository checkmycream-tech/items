    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>If anyone is suffering from this condition I would suggest trying this stuff because it works wonderfully well.</li>
            <li>Awesome deal!</li>
            <li>Does the job excellently.</li>
            <li>This product is awesome.  </li>
            <li>Greatest Acne soap ever created.</li>
            <li>Also, it contains menthol, so it feels pleasantly tingly on skin (but do not get it into your eyes; it burns like the flames of he11!).</li>
            <li>Coming from someone who has struggled with bacne forever, this product was surprisingly good!  </li>
            <li>and I am very satisfied!</li>
            <li>It works great on my face during a breakout too.</li>
            <li>Besides for that problem, the product works great</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great cleanser, although it stings a bit.</li>
            <li>I think the fact that this cleanser has menthol makes it great, as menthol is known to reduce acne inflammation.</li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>But I would also add that you should use a good moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li>but thats what makes the product good because its a continuos control wash.</li>
            <li>good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been 6 years that I&#x27;m using this product and love it, works soooo well!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still getting there, but I love this product!</li>
            <li>My recommendation is that if you can find a more pleasant face wash that works for you, get that.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Obviously I am very happy with the results that this cleanser has produced, but to be perfectly honest I don&#x27;t really care for the product itself.</li>
            <li>I slather a bunch onto my arms and let it sit for about 45 seconds and rinse with warm water.</li>
            <li>and I liked it</li>
            <li>It is very strong and it will bleach your clothes and towels.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found this to be the most effective product for me.  </li>
            <li>Best over-the-counter product thus far.</li>
            <li>That right there made me happy.</li>
            <li>What a HUGE compliment!  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do anything; but started using this and persa gel daily, and it WORKS so great!</li>
            <li>I really love it.</li>
            <li>the most you have to lose is your acne and about $4 (non-clearance price in my area.)  </li>
            <li>its working love this stuff</li>
            <li>i recommend anyone to try this what you got to lose but your acne :)</li>
            <li>Thank you Clean and Clear Continuous Cleanser for working effectively and being so affordable!!!</li>
            <li>an wow lol</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m over 40 and found this product way too strong.</li>
            <li>well, you don&#x27;t need very much for it to be effective.  </li>
            <li>the back of my legs are BEAUTIFUL.</li>
            <li>When used twice a day, the Clean and Clear greatly reduces the number of pimples I get.</li>
            <li>Huge.</li>
            <li>The redness and bumps have diminished greatly and I am wearing short shorts as I type this.  </li>
            <li>one that is oil free or it defeats the purpose of washing your face.</li>
            <li>Also, this has helped to tighten my pores tremendously, and gets rid of blackheads very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I am excited to see what my legs will look like by the end of the week.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels really clean after rinsing off.</li>
            <li>lol  be careful!</li>
            <li>I dont have super oily skin or tons of breakouts.</li>
            <li>I use it once a day as face scrub in the morning, and at night I use a mild cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I could tell a big difference after one use, and my skin is nearly flawless a week later.  </li>
            <li>and it really worked!!</li>
            <li>Moisturizing is also a definite must when using this wash because it WILL dry you out no matter how accustomed your skin already is to 10% BP products (but honestly, moisturizing is a good idea regardless of what cleanser you use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this worked great as powerful everyday wash</li>
            <li>It really clears up my skin and renders it kissably smooth</li>
            <li>It is one of the best OTC acne medicines available, and slightly cheaper than other drugstore cleansers like Neutrogena.</li>
            <li>It has a cool minty tingle that makes your face feel refreshed, and it really prevents pimples.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face clean and it goes on thick, covering the skin good.</li>
            <li>I use the Clean and Clear moisturizer right after.</li>
            <li>I dealt with acne problems for many years, went through countless acne-fighting products.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to use a white towel or a towel you don&#x27;t care about.</li>
            <li>Left this on longer than the 30 seconds and felt I had better results.</li>
            <li>I tried so many different acne products.  </li>
            <li>This was my second order and was pleased with both.</li>
            <li>and this is the only product that works for our son, so I was glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I had vowed never to use Clean and Clear again after my disaster breakout with the blackhead cleanser.</li>
            <li>Clean and Clear</li>
            <li>I began using the Clean and Clear Continuous Control Acne Cleanser one week ago today.  </li>
            <li>I am in my mid-20&#x27;s and have had mild inflammatory acne since my early teens.</li>
            <li>I get an occasional white head every now and then, but it&#x27;s better than a cheek full of disgustingness.  </li>
            <li>This particular product from Clean and Clear isnt stocked in the large chain stores in our area</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m switching to a new Clean and Clear scrub hoping it will work as well as this one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 years now, and have been acne-free the whole time.  </li>
            <li>but it really does the trick.  </li>
            <li>Face Wash really works.</li>
            <li>It NEVER dries your skin out by removing too much oil.  </li>
            <li>Found this item to really help with my three son&#x27;s acne.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done everything, but I found that this worked really, really well and didn&#x27;t leave me over-dry.    </li>
            <li>I was at a loss and ready to call a dermatologist.</li>
            <li>all over.it went straight in the garbage,but what i do like is clean and clear blackhead eraser scrub,it smell really good and leaves my face super soft,so i will continue to use clean and clear blackhead eraser scrub,as for the clean and clear continuous control acne cleanser never again will i put that crap on my face.</li>
            <li>Not a fan of the cool sensation that is left on the skin.</li>
            <li>Buying by the case does offer a good price advantage, though not enough, and keeps me from having to find in stock every few weeks.  </li>
            <li>and it seems to do a decent job.</li>
            <li>also highly recommend using a sulfur face mask twice a week.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried this product, I had major cheek acne that wouldn&#x27;t go away.  </li>
            <li>Then I picked up Clean &amp; Clear Continuous Control Acne Cleanser at the grocery store, and after a few weeks of daily use I haven&#x27;t had another breakout and most of my preexisting acne has healed as well</li>
            <li>In general, I have pretty clear skin</li>
            <li>it is way to strong for my face, i had use a dime size all over my wet face and then rinse,after i look in the mirror my face was red</li>
            <li>However, compared to the cost, messiness, and expense of other available treatments, this one wins hands down.</li>
            <li>is totally clear.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used all the face washes (salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide), used the astringents and spot-treatments, and tried the natural stuff.  </li>
            <li>It has been the only one to really work well for me</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 15 year old girl if that helps.</li>
            <li>But my face completely cleared up after using this product for a couple of weeks</li>
            <li>and I was surprised because my skin looked...</li>
            <li>so far i just started using it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still worth spending the extra money (even for a cheap/poor college student such as myself) because of how well it works.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend and will be back to buy more&lt;3</li>
            <li>But it makes your skin smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom if you use it everyday, so your skin has a daily regimen and can fight breakouts.</li>
            <li>Doug has been using this product for at least ten years or more.</li>
            <li>My major problem with it is I&#x27;ve ruined all of my towels - the peroxide bleaches out their color.  </li>
            <li>but nothing major.</li>
            <li>But the first time I used it, it made me very itchy, especially around the eye area, so I used it only around the places that were infected, and then slowly worked around my whole face when my skin got used to it.  </li>
            <li>Considering the amount of time I&#x27;ve spent with other products (all of which are super expensive, don&#x27;t do anything, leave me over-dry or super greasy), I&#x27;m thankful to have found something that&#x27;s relatively cheap and does the trick in keeping things manageable.</li>
            <li>I still break out, but this product dries out pimples quickly, especially when it&#x27;s applied directly without rinsing off.  </li>
            <li>Just use a white towel or an old towel.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a little bit of a stingy feeling, and if you get it in your eyes it hurts like a bitch, and your face is pretty red afterward</li>
            <li>Just a few days later, my skin looks so much healthier!</li>

            <li> Just a few days later, my skin looks so much healthier!</li>
            <li> I recommend using old wash cloths to wash your face and be very careful not to get it on your clothes.</li>
            <li> I was buying a new face wash every few weeks.</li>
            <li> Definitely use a lotion afterwards though, because this will dry out your skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s VERY thick, more of a paste than a liquid really, which makes it difficult to lather and rinse off.</li>
            <li> Over the past 7 years I&#x27;ve tried nearly every facewash, and this is the only one that NEVER makes me break out ever.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it can be expensive in stores, and you can run out of it quick if you don&#x27;t ration it correctly.  </li>
            <li> I developed pretty bad adult acne.</li>
            <li> I found that this cleanser has like the highest amount of benzoyl peroxide out of any of the other facial washes</li>
            <li> Nothing worked or helped very long.  </li>
            <li> It will dry out your skin, so wear a lotion and 2)</li>
            <li> I also use an exfoliator, which helped get rid of dry skin as well as acne scars.</li>
            <li> these issues are really a small price to pay for clear skin</li>
            <li> It dries out your skin, ruins your towels and makes your face red for a while.</li>
            <li> If you insist on using this stuff, use paper towels to dry your face!</li>
            <li> The benzol peroxide ingredient seeps into your skin and ruins towels, sheets, pillowcases, and clothes - left our gray towels blotched with pink and purple spots and ruined our sheets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> .. just be careful like the other reviews say -</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend to anyone with frustrating acne.</li>
            <li> Got frustrated and purchased a simple tube of Clean and Clear Continuous Cleanser for a mere $4.50 lat night at Wal-Mart, came home, took a shower, and rubbed a dime-sized amount on the back of my thighs for 30 seconds each as directed.  </li>
            <li> Not much to say - the title says it all!</li>
            <li> The Acne cleanser works as advertised and as other reviewers have mentioned.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take away all the oil like some other facewash does, but I think that&#x27;s part of why it works.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure of the long-term effect of this product, but I will continue to use this product for a while, and will follow-up with another review later.</li>
            <li> Be very careful with this product.</li>
            <li> The active ingredient, benzoyl peroxide, is a bleaching agent, so it will bleach fabric.</li>
            <li> It also stings my eyes no matter how carefully I avoid getting it near them, and the menthol sometimes makes my face uncomfortably \\&quot;tingly\\&quot; and raw afterward.</li>
            <li> Two caveats with this medicine: it will bleach your towels, and it will make your skin a little sun-sensitive.</li>
            <li> I got acne cysts, little bumps, all kinds of pimples all over my face.</li>
            <li> It was so bad, I was put on Accutane, a powerful Rx drug for acne.</li>
            <li> Only drawback is the weird smell, but I wash it off and don&#x27;t rub it on the inside of my nose so that is not really a problem.</li>
            <li> (The worst kind).</li>
            <li> I stood there looking at it for a few minutes because for once, my face wasn&#x27;t covered in pimples.</li>
            <li> I use benzoyl peroxide cleansers to shave with and that cool feeling is the worst, especially in the bikini region</li>
            <li> ive had really bad cyst acne it happened really out of no</li>
            <li> For the past two years I&#x27;ve been embarrassed to show them in shorts</li>
            <li> I have since used it over the past 2 years.</li>
            <li> For the past year, it looks just like it did before Accutane.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very harsh to the skin, I think that&#x27;s why it works so well at getting rid of acne.  </li>
            <li> Not a very good \\&quot;every day\\&quot; product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 12 years now for a condition called faliculitis where the hair follicle gets infected and hard bumps form on the scalp.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cleanser since my late teens.</li>
            <li> I recommend this for acne sufferers to at least TRY,</li>
            <li> The back of my legs were horrible - red bumps from shaving up the leg as opposed to downward.  </li>
            <li> I had a serious acne problem since I started puberty, my face was covered in acne.  </li>
            <li> and I think made it worse.  </li>
            <li> so i tired it</li>
            <li> This is ridiculous!</li>
            <li> I used to buy expensive Proactive</li>
            <li> Using everyday would irritate my skin and make me break out horribly.</li>
            <li> I also dont get acne too bad.</li>
            <li> I never had acne this bad, even in my teens.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any of those horrible painful cysts in a while.</li>
            <li> Nasty.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 6 years that I&#x27;m using this product and love it, works soooo well!</li>
            <li> Used this during the time period up to my wedding. I dont have super oily skin or tons of breakouts. this worked great as powerful everyday wash</li>
            <li> I am in my mid-20&#x27;s and have had mild inflammatory acne since my early teens. Over the years I have used a number of different topical benzoyl products to keep it at bay, but none of them ever totally eliminated the problem. Then I picked up Clean &amp; Clear Continuous Control Acne Cleanser at the grocery store, and after a few weeks of daily use I haven&#x27;t had another breakout and most of my preexisting acne has healed as well (woot!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously I am very happy with the results that this cleanser has produced, but to be perfectly honest I don&#x27;t really care for the product itself. It&#x27;s VERY thick, more of a paste than a liquid really, which makes it difficult to lather and rinse off. It also stings my eyes no matter how carefully I avoid getting it near them, and the menthol sometimes makes my face uncomfortably \\&quot;tingly\\&quot; and raw afterward. Moisturizing is also a definite must when using this wash because it WILL dry you out no matter how accustomed your skin already is to 10% BP products (but honestly, moisturizing is a good idea regardless of what cleanser you use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the big picture these issues are really a small price to pay for clear skin and I have every intention of continuing to use this product, but they are irksome enough that I had to give this cleanser 4 stars instead of 5. My recommendation is that if you can find a more pleasant face wash that works for you, get that. If you are fed up with persistent acne and are ready to pull out the heavy artillery, buy this stuff.</li>
            <li> I dealt with acne problems for many years, went through countless acne-fighting products.  I&#x27;ve used all the face washes (salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide), used the astringents and spot-treatments, and tried the natural stuff.  I&#x27;ve found this to be the most effective product for me.  I use it once a day as face scrub in the morning, and at night I use a mild cleanser.  I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 years now, and have been acne-free the whole time.  Definitely use a lotion afterwards though, because this will dry out your skin.  And use white face towels, because this will bleach the color out of anything else.</li>
            <li> Tried everything, even retin A and tetracycline. Didn&#x27;t do anything; but started using this and persa gel daily, and it WORKS so great! Would recommend this to anyone who has moderate+ skin problems.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 12 years now for a condition called faliculitis where the hair follicle gets infected and hard bumps form on the scalp. If anyone is suffering from this condition I would suggest trying this stuff because it works wonderfully well.</li>
            <li> Awesome deal! I have those red bumps on my upper arms and I use this stuff every time I shower. I slather a bunch onto my arms and let it sit for about 45 seconds and rinse with warm water. Red bumps are almost gone! It works great on my face during a breakout too. My skin feels really clean after rinsing off.</li>
            <li> I found that this cleanser has like the highest amount of benzoyl peroxide out of any of the other facial washes but it really does the trick.  It has been the only one to really work well for me.. just be careful like the other reviews say - this WILL bleach things.. towels, pillowcases, the bathroom rug  lol  be careful!</li>
            <li> While this may work on your skin issues, it will RUIN your towels and sheets that aren&#x27;t white.  The benzol peroxide ingredient seeps into your skin and ruins towels, sheets, pillowcases, and clothes - left our gray towels blotched with pink and purple spots and ruined our sheets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend trying a product with salicylic acid instead - same results, no damage to your linens.</li>
            <li> it is way to strong for my face, i had use a dime size all over my wet face and then rinse,after i look in the mirror my face was red all over.it went straight in the garbage,but what i do like is clean and clear blackhead eraser scrub,it smell really good and leaves my face super soft,so i will continue to use clean and clear blackhead eraser scrub,as for the clean and clear continuous control acne cleanser never again will i put that crap on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 29 and have been using this product for 3+ years.  I still break out, but this product dries out pimples quickly, especially when it&#x27;s applied directly without rinsing off.  My major problem with it is I&#x27;ve ruined all of my towels - the peroxide bleaches out their color.  I&#x27;m switching to a new Clean and Clear scrub hoping it will work as well as this one.</li>
            <li> I dug this stuff out from under my cabinet...I had vowed never to use Clean and Clear again after my disaster breakout with the blackhead cleanser. But since this had no beads to irritate my skin, I decided to give it a try and it really worked!! 2 days after putting it on once or twice daily, I could see breakouts that were starting to come had faded, and my blackheads were actually disappearing from my nose! There&#x27;s a little bit of a stingy feeling, and if you get it in your eyes it hurts like a bitch, and your face is pretty red afterward, I&#x27;m assuming from the chemical contents. But it makes your skin smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom if you use it everyday, so your skin has a daily regimen and can fight breakouts. I highly recommend and will be back to buy more&lt;3 I&#x27;m a 15 year old girl if that helps.</li>
            <li> I was using this product in the shower, and after a couple days was noticing bleach spots on my towel and bath mat. I couldn&#x27;t figure out what was happening. Then I realized this product was the doing it. I was washing my face, showering, and still when I&#x27;d step out onto the tub mat the water on my feet would bleach the mat. This is ridiculous! It should come with a BIG warning to only use white towels.</li>
            <li> Not much to say - the title says it all! The Acne cleanser works as advertised and as other reviewers have mentioned. It really clears up my skin and renders it kissably smooth, aww-yeah! Only drawback is the weird smell, but I wash it off and don&#x27;t rub it on the inside of my nose so that is not really a problem.</li>
            <li> Clean and Clear Face Wash really works. I really love it. It has a cool minty tingle that makes your face feel refreshed, and it really prevents pimples. In general, I have pretty clear skin and this face wash keeps it that way. I go through this product so often that I am constantly buying it. Only, I have one recommendation. Be very careful with this product. It is very strong and it will bleach your clothes and towels. This happened even when I used it in the shower. Make sure to use a white towel or a towel you don&#x27;t care about. Besides for that problem, the product works great and I am very satisfied!</li>
            <li> I have been using this cleanser since my late teens. It is one of the best OTC acne medicines available, and slightly cheaper than other drugstore cleansers like Neutrogena. When used twice a day, the Clean and Clear greatly reduces the number of pimples I get. Also, it contains menthol, so it feels pleasantly tingly on skin (but do not get it into your eyes; it burns like the flames of he11!). There are only two drawbacks to this product: 1) It will dry out your skin, so wear a lotion and 2) The active ingredient, benzoyl peroxide, is a bleaching agent, so it will bleach fabric. I recommend using old wash cloths to wash your face and be very careful not to get it on your clothes.</li>
            <li> The back of my legs were horrible - red bumps from shaving up the leg as opposed to downward.  For the past two years I&#x27;ve been embarrassed to show them in shorts but I&#x27;m muscular so would like to show them off!  I initially tried a Neutrogena salicylic acid dealy, didn&#x27;t work and I applied it nightly to work as I slept.  No dice.  Got frustrated and purchased a simple tube of Clean and Clear Continuous Cleanser for a mere $4.50 lat night at Wal-Mart, came home, took a shower, and rubbed a dime-sized amount on the back of my thighs for 30 seconds each as directed.  NOT KIDDING - today the back of my legs are BEAUTIFUL. The redness and bumps have diminished greatly and I am wearing short shorts as I type this.  ONE USE!! I am excited to see what my legs will look like by the end of the week.  Goodbye red bumps.  Goodbye ingrown hair.  Goodbye covering my legs up in the summertime.  HELLO LEGS!! Thank you Clean and Clear Continuous Cleanser for working effectively and being so affordable!!!</li>
            <li> Not a fan of the cool sensation that is left on the skin. I use benzoyl peroxide cleansers to shave with and that cool feeling is the worst, especially in the bikini region</li>
            <li> Over the past 7 years I&#x27;ve tried nearly every facewash, and this is the only one that NEVER makes me break out ever.  It doesn&#x27;t take away all the oil like some other facewash does, but I think that&#x27;s part of why it works.  It NEVER dries your skin out by removing too much oil.  It also has the strongest concentration of Benzoyl Peroxide I&#x27;ve seen in an onver the counter product (10%).  This does wonders for me and if this product ever went away I&#x27;d be screwed.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it can be expensive in stores, and you can run out of it quick if you don&#x27;t ration it correctly.  Even though it&#x27;s a cream that doesn&#x27;t spread that well, you don&#x27;t need very much for it to be effective.  It&#x27;s still worth spending the extra money (even for a cheap/poor college student such as myself) because of how well it works.</li>
            <li> I used to buy expensive Proactive and now I don&#x27;t have to! I use this at night and the benzyl peroxide gets rid of the dirt and grime. Big fan. Huge.</li>
            <li> Left this on longer than the 30 seconds and felt I had better results. It&#x27;s a great cleanser, although it stings a bit. I think the fact that this cleanser has menthol makes it great, as menthol is known to reduce acne inflammation. It didn&#x27;t get rid of acne but it definitely helped reduce outbreaks.</li>
            <li> Found this item to really help with my three son&#x27;s acne.  Buying by the case does offer a good price advantage, though not enough, and keeps me from having to find in stock every few weeks.  Good product and it seems to do a decent job.</li>
            <li> I began using the Clean and Clear Continuous Control Acne Cleanser one week ago today.  I used it once per day, and since I suffer from rather inflammatory acne, worked up to twice a day by the 5th day.  Today, while grocery shopping, I was actually told by a stranger my skin looks like porcelain!  What a HUGE compliment!  I have struggled with acne for 15 or so years, even being treated by several dermatologists, to no avail.  I picked this up on clearance at Target since I didn&#x27;t have anything to lose (besides the acne.)  I could tell a big difference after one use, and my skin is nearly flawless a week later.  Also, this has helped to tighten my pores tremendously, and gets rid of blackheads very quickly.  I recommend this for acne sufferers to at least TRY, the most you have to lose is your acne and about $4 (non-clearance price in my area.)  I&#x27;m not sure of the long-term effect of this product, but I will continue to use this product for a while, and will follow-up with another review later.</li>
            <li> Very necessary for my acne-prone skin/face. Best over-the-counter product thus far. Does the job excellently. A must have for persons suffering with acne related symptoms.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome.  I had a serious acne problem since I started puberty, my face was covered in acne.  I tried so many different acne products.  I tried facials which irritated my face and I think made it worse.  I tried changing my diet.  I tried detoxing.  I stopped wearing make up.  Nothing worked or helped very long.  The first time I tried this product, I had major cheek acne that wouldn&#x27;t go away.  It was covered in white heads and red spots.  Nasty.  But my face completely cleared up after using this product for a couple of weeks, I don&#x27;t even need to use make up to cover up anymore.  I use it daily now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very harsh to the skin, I think that&#x27;s why it works so well at getting rid of acne.  But the first time I used it, it made me very itchy, especially around the eye area, so I used it only around the places that were infected, and then slowly worked around my whole face when my skin got used to it.  I get an occasional white head every now and then, but it&#x27;s better than a cheek full of disgustingness.  I also recommend using a moisturizer, because it dries out the skin.  I also use an exfoliator, which helped get rid of dry skin as well as acne scars.</li>
            <li> So, I have had cystic nodular acne since I was 17 (The worst kind). I have seen countless dermatologists and have taken/used: minocycline, clindamycin, benzamycin, salicylic acid, and hibiclens on my face. When I started taking this medicine my face cleared in a month. I have since used it over the past 2 years. Now, I will occasionally get a pimple still, but compared to before it&#x27;s nothing. Two caveats with this medicine: it will bleach your towels, and it will make your skin a little sun-sensitive. However, compared to the cost, messiness, and expense of other available treatments, this one wins hands down.</li>
            <li> Doug has been using this product for at least ten years or more. He is now thirty years of age.</li>
            <li> This product probably works different for different people. I&#x27;m over 40 and found this product way too strong. It dries out your skin, ruins your towels and makes your face red for a while. Not a very good \\&quot;every day\\&quot; product. I actually got a zit AFTER using the product. If you insist on using this stuff, use paper towels to dry your face!</li>
            <li> Im the type of person who has combination skin. I also dont get acne too bad. But i would tell anyone who feels a breakout coming on to use this product. I use it in the shower along with an exfoliating sponge maybe every 3 or so days. Using everyday would irritate my skin and make me break out horribly. But I would also add that you should use a good moisturizer afterwards. one that is oil free or it defeats the purpose of washing your face. Yes it will discolor colored towels and pillow cases if you sweat at night but thats what makes the product good because its a continuos control wash. Just use a white towel or an old towel.</li>
            <li> Coming from someone who has struggled with bacne forever, this product was surprisingly good!  I&#x27;ve used Pro-activ, Murad, Neutogena, Oxy, you name it.  I&#x27;ve done everything, but I found that this worked really, really well and didn&#x27;t leave me over-dry.    I still get pimples on my back / chest, but I have noticed a substantial difference since using this (and I&#x27;ve been using it for the last two years).  Considering the amount of time I&#x27;ve spent with other products (all of which are super expensive, don&#x27;t do anything, leave me over-dry or super greasy), I&#x27;m thankful to have found something that&#x27;s relatively cheap and does the trick in keeping things manageable.</li>
            <li> Greatest Acne soap ever created. Been using this for about 12 years.( twice a day )&lt;br /&gt;Face is totally clear. HIGHLY recommend to anyone with frustrating acne.</li>
            <li> I developed pretty bad adult acne. I am 28. I never had acne this bad, even in my teens. I got acne cysts, little bumps, all kinds of pimples all over my face. Believe me when I tell you I tried EVERYTHING! I was buying a new face wash every few weeks. I tried creams, toners, pads. Even tried the store brand proactive. I didn&#x27;t like salycic acid products because they made my face red and irritated. I was at a loss and ready to call a dermatologist. On a last chance effort I bought this face wash and I liked it, it didn&#x27;t irritate my face at all. I use it twice a day. That right there made me happy. It leaves my face clean and it goes on thick, covering the skin good. Avoid the eye area! It didn&#x27;t stain or bleach my clothes. After using it for about 2 months, I looked in the mirror one day and I was surprised because my skin looked...good. I stood there looking at it for a few minutes because for once, my face wasn&#x27;t covered in pimples. I haven&#x27;t had any of those horrible painful cysts in a while. I still get a pimple here and there but nothing major. Buy this face wash and stick with it, don&#x27;t give up and you will see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also highly recommend using a sulfur face mask twice a week. Walmart makes a store brand one.</li>
            <li> This was my second order and was pleased with both. This particular product from Clean and Clear isnt stocked in the large chain stores in our area and this is the only product that works for our son, so I was glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 19 and have struggled for YEARS with terrible acne. It was so bad, I was put on Accutane, a powerful Rx drug for acne. I did well with that and my acne stayed away for about a year and then it came back. For the past year, it looks just like it did before Accutane. I just recently found this and was intrigued by the 10% BP, which I&#x27;ve never seen on an over the counter cleanser. Just a few days later, my skin looks so much healthier! It&#x27;s still getting there, but I love this product! I use the Clean and Clear moisturizer right after.</li>
            <li> ive had really bad cyst acne it happened really out of no where i went to alot of dermatologist an nothing so i came across a video on youtube who was talking about their acne and they have used this product and it worked wonders so i tired it and i kid you not my face has cleared a lot its not fully cleared but its working love this stuff so far i just started using it an wow lol i recommend anyone to try this what you got to lose but your acne :)</li>
