            <li>Great item!!</li>
            <li>Best toothbrush I have ever had,</li>
            <li>This unit is excellent and works as it should.</li>
            <li>My dentist, who is very good, has been bothering me to use this for a couple of years now.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s working very good.  </li>
            <li>But for just $19.77, I think this is a very good deal.</li>
            <li>Very good brush though, couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li>Awesome value and works great.</li>
            <li>I bought this one because it gets great reviews and the price is very good.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush comes with a compact charging stand, an excellent brush-head, and good battery power.  </li>
            <li>I bought this Oral-B Vitality and it has been superb and I am very pleased for the performance and price.  </li>
            <li>Everything else is just great.</li>
            <li>The timer is great for kids and keeps them brushing longer.</li>
            <li>2-minute timer - automatically tells you after 2 minutes of brushing, great way to build that habit  </li>
            <li>After one 4 minute session with this toothbrush I am a happy convert.</li>
            <li>It does a great job with the gums as well as the teeth.  </li>
            <li>So now I&#x27;m really happy</li>
            <li>I thought it was a great price for the product.</li>
            <li>Great product for the money.</li>
            <li>I have had it a couple of months and it works great.</li>
            <li>Sleek and power, great combo for a toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>So I ended up getting the Vitality ($24.99) instaed of getting the 5000 ($119-149) that I would not have been as happy with.</li>
            <li>so, you&#x27;re welcome.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m one happy customer.  </li>
            <li>In combination with flossing and the use of a dental pic, it is all you need for great dental hygiene.  </li>
            <li>This product continues to work great for my family.  </li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>I charged this one as directed and it worked great for a couple of days then got weaker for a couple of days and quit working all together.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Get one, use it, and your teeth and gums will be happy.  </li>
            <li>and it does a great job</li>
            <li>So happy in fact, I bought one for my Dad.</li>
            <li>but i feel like i have made a really great investment.  </li>
            <li>I have been happy with everything that I have order from Amazon.</li>
            <li>This oral-b toothbrush is a great price too.</li>
            <li>this thing works great.</li>
            <li>and it works great.</li>
            <li>Great item at a great price.  </li>
            <li>This price on this one looked great, but I was concerned about the \\&quot;flossing\\&quot; claim on these heads.  </li>
            <li>Great tooth brush.</li>
            <li>The price was great.</li>
            <li>Teeth look great.</li>
            <li>We get zero cavities with the Sonicare unit, so it&#x27;s doing a great job.</li>
            <li>and it attribute it to this great and afforable tooth brush</li>
            <li>Great electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This brush is amazing!</li>
            <li>my wife used this toothbrush every day and it works great for her, and it keeps on working good.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, perfect for travel.  </li>
            <li>Good value for a price.</li>
            <li>I think this is just as good.</li>
            <li>Just about as good as going to the dentist hygenist.</li>
            <li>this is a really good toothbrush that lets me get my teeth and gums cleaner than I had been.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush is fairly vigorous and does a good job cleaning.  </li>
            <li>The bottom line is that this is a really good find for someone looking for an electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>This brush is good.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>The good:    </li>
            <li>This toothbrush feels so good</li>
            <li>Your mouth feels so good after brushing with this.</li>
            <li>good buy</li>
            <li>my dental hygiene was to switch to a good electric toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this one is good I think.</li>
            <li>A good brush...but be prepared to get another in about 3 years.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;and gums are in fairly good health.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so good brushing that I had to come do a review.  </li>
            <li>It should NOT be a substitute for a good ole fashion manual flossing ... in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>This does just as good of a job at 1/5 the price.  </li>
            <li>This thing costs under $20, if I remember correctly, and it is as good as any of the &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; products out there.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using these Oral B brushes, my exams are so good</li>
            <li>I feel like I take good care of my teeth-</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>Electric toothbrushes allow for good cleaning without pain in my arms.</li>
            <li>Infact you get a good tickling massage on the gums when you use it.</li>
            <li>This is a good purchase.</li>
            <li>This does a good job for the money.  </li>
            <li>It does not get between teeth, but it does a good job of working around the gums.  </li>
            <li>Does a good job at brushing teeth</li>
            <li>Choose wisely.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ll start by saying that we already agree that having an electronic toothbrush is a good idea.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s good news</li>
            <li>I bought the toothbrush because it&#x27;s really good value and a friend recommended it.</li>
            <li>It gets in there and gets in there good.</li>
            <li>I can keep it off the charger for a good four days</li>
            <li>I would recommend this toothbrush to anybody who want to maintain a good oral hygiene.</li>
            <li>the one I used now is in good condition.</li>
            <li>rechargeable battery lasts a good amount of time, but is not user replaceable.  </li>
            <li>It may not be most wonderful thing in the world &amp; I love my [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>For around $30, this powerful toothbrush is an excellent value.</li>
            <li>Great buy and works in top notch order.</li>
            <li>Be sure to check out their great prices on name brand items.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>5 star rating is not because this is perfect, but because the results you get are well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>Love it great price</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>This works real good, and the price was just right.  </li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush and was amazed how superbly it does the cleaning.</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, this is a pretty impressive product for the money.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush!  </li>
            <li>Performs way...Over the Top!</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about 5 weeks and love it!  </li>
            <li>I really love this electric toothbrush!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this toothbrush!</li>
            <li>Strong motor and the 2 min timer is great.</li>
            <li>This electric tooth brush does a fine job and is a great value.  </li>
            <li>This product is very good and useful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is no alarm or jingle sound which is great if you don&#x27;t want to wake up the family</li>
            <li>This brush is a amazing.</li>
            <li>It really was an impressive sight to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it is a nice power toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>However, those models do cost a good bit more.  </li>
            <li>This model gives good value for the money -- no problems, does what it&#x27;s supposed to, battery lasts for many charge cycles.  </li>
            <li>but it is nice to get that heads up from the unit itself.  </li>
            <li>I can honestly say this is the absolute best.  </li>
            <li>Good price for a toothbrush that I have used for many years.</li>
            <li>feel great and look clean after brushing.  </li>
            <li>great clean</li>
            <li>It is very easy hold on to and maneuver around in your mouth.  </li>
            <li>Makes buying a good electric toothbrush much more accessible!</li>
            <li>I immediately ordered the sensitive heads and am very happy with my toothbrush.</li>
            <li>the Floss action is the best for gum disease.</li>
            <li>Considering the fact that it&#x27;s priced much more reasonably, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a very good product for the price.  </li>
            <li>Its easy to use, and does a great clean.   </li>
            <li>Fast delivery, good quality and good price.</li>
            <li>If this is your first time purchasing an electric toothbrush, this is a great start.</li>
            <li>just had my six-month checkup (first checkup since switching to this brush) and my dentist went on and on about how great my gums looked.</li>
            <li>Nice grip, and easy on &amp; off.  </li>
            <li>The speed is very good and it is not at all loud in its rotations.</li>
            <li>I love the size because it can get all around your teeth and close to the gumline.  </li>
            <li>I also love the timer.  </li>
            <li>If you are thinking of buying a cheap no frills electric toothbrush then you have found just that!</li>
            <li>I love the 2 minute timer as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also impressed how well it removes surface stains (such as from coffee or tea).</li>
            <li>Here are the details, mostly in comparison to the Crest SpinBrush I was using before.    </li>
            <li>, I love this brush.</li>
            <li>I think for for the money, this is definitly a better value.</li>
            <li>, I have no problem brushing for the minutes or more.</li>
            <li>and I like that better.</li>
            <li>the job better than you&#x27;d think.</li>
            <li>She said it was the best present she got for her birthday!  </li>
            <li>love it ....</li>
            <li>glad to see that this generation of electric brushes doesn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;require</li>
            <li>After more than six months I can say that my teeth and&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice one, works well, powerful, nice price too.</li>
            <li>I will order more for others too.</li>
            <li>I am fairly sure this is damaging to gums and teeth.</li>
            <li>Recommend spending more money for a better product.</li>
            <li>Cheaper isn&#x27;t always better.</li>
            <li>For a three month electric toothbrush, there are much better values out there.</li>
            <li>better than manual tooth brush...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Here&#x27;s how the Sonicare one is better than the Oral-b one:&lt;br /&gt;-The</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>you won&#x27;t be pleased.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d also tried the under-$10, disposable electric toothbrushes, but found I could do a better cleaning job with my manual toothbrushes.    </li>
            <li>and I assume, then, more thoroughly) than we can do manually.    </li>
            <li>My dentist says my teeth look fabulous!</li>
            <li>It is an impressively sturdy unit, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>I started out comparing Sonicare and Oral B electric brushes, The Oral B 5000 came out on top</li>
            <li>The brushes surround each tooth to make sure to get in between the teeth and around the gum line.  </li>
            <li>The Oral-B rechargeable is much better.</li>
            <li>So glad I was able to find this.  </li>
            <li>;  I love the rubber grip handle.  </li>
            <li>my dentist is pleased with me, but he&#x27;s not making the money off me that he once did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with my decision.</li>
            <li>I bought it to replace a brush that cost over $150 and it does a better job.</li>
            <li>What I like most is the two-minute indicator.  </li>
            <li>&amp; i am cavity free, and hope to stay that way as well!  </li>
            <li>Think they&#x27;ll be impressed at the dentist&#x27;s office at his next cleaning appointment!</li>
            <li>My husbands favorite brand...</li>
            <li>She said that I didn&#x27;t need to get the top of the line with all of the bells and whistles</li>
            <li>ELECTRIC TB ARE ALOT BETTER THAN MANUAL.</li>
            <li>(To be perfect, it would need to be able to handle international voltages -</li>
            <li>My gums are way better now</li>
            <li>and I would love to be able to hang it somehow to the wall so that it is not sitting on the sink.</li>
            <li>Make sure you buy the correct brushes that go with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used the more example ($100+</li>
            <li>It had been years since I used a powered toothbrush and this experience convinced me that using that a powered toothbrush will always make for an more efficient cleaning.      </li>
            <li>Like many that have reviewed this product I had never used an electric toothbrush before.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for more than a month</li>
            <li>Removes much more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely glad to have traded-up to this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>why I like my Oral B better:    </li>
            <li>I was told my gums are in much better shape than before.    </li>
            <li>some point I realized I was brushing my teeth more with my \\&quot;backup\\&quot; manual brush than with the electric one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This oral electric brush is best for me rather than the regular brush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with my toothbrush</li>
            <li>So yes, it is certainly better than doing your tooth brushing manually -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fully satisfied for now.</li>
            <li>To my surprise, I found that it works much better than the Sonicare did.</li>
            <li>Also, the circular motion of the Oral-B Vitality works and cleans much better than the back-and-forth motion of the Sonicare brush.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>I Love my Flossing Tooth Brush.</li>
            <li>I am glad I decided to buy this.</li>
            <li>I really, really love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied with this rechargeable toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>It has a timer so you can make sure you get your two minutes in.  </li>
            <li>Excellent pricing for this basic Oral B electric brush.</li>
            <li>This is better than i thought it was going to be.</li>
            <li>The best think about this toothbrush it does have a 2 min timer on it, and the charge last almost a week.</li>
            <li>It was gentle on my gums, no bleeding, and the bristles did a great job of leaving my mouth feeling very clean.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, so far so good!</li>
            <li>The built in timer is a nice feature because I didn&#x27;t realize how quickly I was brushing my teeth before and now spend more time on them as I</li>
            <li>VEry clean teeth after using this.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my teeth feeling very clean.  </li>
            <li>Awesome brushes can&#x27;t say enough good things about this brush...really reasonable price and</li>
            <li>Otherwise I think this is a good buy and am looking forward to good report at my next dentist appointment.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very easy to clean and it holds a charge for quite a while.  </li>
            <li>They feel as clean as if I had just come from the dentist!</li>
            <li>My teeth have never felt so clean after brushing and the price is unbeatable!</li>
            <li>(ie, really clean!)</li>
            <li>I have used Oral-B power brushes for 25 yrs and cannot feel that I have clean teeth w/o one!</li>
            <li>Stay Clean My Friends!</li>
            <li>It really does work well and with a great clean feeling after brushing.</li>
            <li>This is the best clean I have ever had outside of the dentist.</li>
            <li>It was the only purpose of buying it as I already had a very good Braun brush.</li>
            <li>I like the quadrant approach for more accurate mouth care.    </li>
            <li>Purchase and Enjoy :)</li>
            <li>However, this toothbrush is GREAT in comparison to an old fashioned toothbrush or a battery-operated on.  </li>
            <li>The Oral-b Vitality Floss Action Rechargeable Power Toothbrush seems to be the happy medium between those two extremes.  </li>
            <li>The most important feature to me are teeth.  </li>
            <li>wanted to note that the instruction sheet is very thorough and gives good information on how to use the brush and how to tell if you&#x27;re brushing too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable and it functions good.</li>
            <li>Amazon also gets 5 stars for its fast and efficient service, quick shipping and great competitive prices.  </li>
            <li>Braun keeps coming up with fanciful, more costly versions of its excellent original product, but - unless you&#x27;re in love with bells and whistles - they add little but expense.</li>
            <li>- Rechargeable NiCd battery can be replaced so it is much more environmentally friendly than brushes with non replaceable batteries    </li>
            <li>This is not a bad thing!</li>
            <li>I love the clean feeling i get after I brush my teeth.  </li>
            <li>This product was easily set up and it doesn&#x27;t spray all over the place when it is on.  </li>
            <li>It is just that extra bit better than your manual toothbrush, and the two-minute-warning timer is great.</li>
            <li>AND it&#x27;s so easy to brush for 2 minutes because the electronic toothbrush notifies you when time is up.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Instructions on care and cleaning were easy to understand, too.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and easy to recharge.</li>
            <li>i have been using electric tooth brushes for years , they keep my teeth clean and oral b is the top of line in electric tooth brushes.</li>
            <li>but the toothbrush is still going strong.</li>
            <li>Still going strong after 3 years.</li>
            <li>I have had this toothbrush for almost 2 years now and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li>Good product for the price - highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I have liked the toothbrush very much.  </li>
            <li>The Oral-B Vitality Floss Action Rechargeable is a very good, basic rechargeable toothbrush at a fair price.  </li>
            <li>Its pretty amazing</li>
            <li>Tried the Oral-B Vitality with the floss action brush head and it was amazing!</li>
            <li>The new unit fairly burst from its packaging with youthful vigor, and is now in service helping preserve my ancient choppers.</li>
            <li>The grip section is not too slim so it is a comfortable hold and easy to maneuver; the rubber covering on the handle also means it is not slippery to hold.  </li>
            <li>Worked fine for about 1 min.</li>
            <li>I like it because it is light and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>These really irritated my gums the first time I used it, but it felt great afterwards</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think twice, at this price, this is an awesome buy, and a very small price to pay for clean shiny teeth!!</li>
            <li>This little tool works superbly.  </li>
            <li>Sure, it feels like you just took a belt-sander or a particularly powerful floor buffer to the inside of your mouth, but who can argue with the results?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still thinking about returning it because the sound is a bit jarring.  </li>
            <li>the sound it makes.      </li>
            <li>This is a great toothbrush with soft bristles and floss action which I found to be effective.  </li>
            <li>The one feature I would wish it came with is a charging indicator light.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been happy with several generations of Oral-B electronic toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>and the lack of a charger light.</li>
            <li>The great thing about it is the smaller tip and neck.  </li>
            <li>I actually enjoy using this</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not that important to me.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I think the price and quality of this toothbrush make it a great option.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t position the brush precisely, the edges of the head batter your teeth-- sounding like a jackhammer in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>B0017KHCB2 Glister Advanced Toothbrush]].</li>
            <li>In the short term, this seemed like a great, value priced electric toothbrush, but once that odor begins (and it could be as soon as a couple months), I would advise throwing it away because there&#x27;s no getting rid of it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worked great the entire time.  </li>
            <li>More fun to use than a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product and I am here to let you know my Sonicare is now in a landfill</li>
            <li>This is important.    </li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product.  </li>
            <li>This product also needs a charging light</li>
            <li>Works well and comes with a free spare head.</li>
            <li>The suitcase was open and one of our dogs decided that her Phillips Sonicare Toothbrush would make a great chew toy.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush, it&#x27;s well worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I had it filled, but the week before I had it done</li>
            <li>My teeth had a smooth, polished feeling and I felt the detailed grooves of the brush head to get into each groove in my teeth.</li>
            <li>Just keep in mind the range of brushes available.</li>
            <li>If I get the same longevity out of this one I&#x27;ll be really happy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li>However, there is dentist who suggest not to use this kind of toothbrush too much.</li>
            <li>leaves my teeth feeling almost as good as a professional dental cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The FlossAction brush head does a good job of getting near the tooth/gum line.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But, it does a good job so far and no show stopper complaints.  </li>
            <li>This one looked good with the floss action bristles.</li>
            <li>I thought it was still working fine, but compared to a nice new one, i might as well have not been brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li>Luckily toothpaste cleans up easy.  </li>
            <li>Luckily toothpaste cleans up easy.  </li>
            <li>The Vitality charges quickly, the charge lasts 1 - 2 weeks using the brush 2 - 3 times a day and it is easy to keep clean.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this one so far.  </li>
            <li>My good old manual toothbrush just wasn&#x27;t doing a good enough job of removing stains.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m 80, still have a version of my original teeth, and,</li>
            <li>I bought it when it first came out, and it cost me $170.00.I love my Sonicare, but the replacement heads can cost up to $50.00.</li>
            <li>And I am glad we purchased this model over the higher end ones OralB has in their product line.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And even for those of us with no impairments, the electric motor is able to brush each tooth at a much higher rate (</li>
            <li>My one concern over this toothbrush is that the replacement heads look like they cost a significant proportion of what the brush itself costs.</li>
            <li>Still going on its original rechargable battery pack without problems.  </li>
            <li>powerful!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re concerned about keeping your teeth clean and healthy, but don&#x27;t want to devote too much time, energy or money into your routine, this product is for you!</li>
            <li>This toothbrush does a good job and has a pretty decently powered</li>
            <li>At first, it was a nice change; I felt like the new toothbrush was doing a better job cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t think my mouth felt that clean.</li>
            <li>So I used it again, my mouth felt clean, it does take some time to get used to this if you never used an electric toothbrush before..</li>
            <li>I found after a few days I dont miss either and it has done a great job on my teeth and gums keeping them clean and healthy.</li>
            <li>so I had to invest in something that would really clean my teeth.</li>
            <li>Every time I use it, my mouth and teeth feel so clean, like after I go to the dentist.  </li>
            <li>My teeth felt &#x27;dentist clean&#x27; after brushing for a couple minutes.</li>
            <li>My teeth didn&#x27;t look this clean even after a visit to the dentist.</li>
            <li>My hygienist announced that I have a&lt;br /&gt;truly clean mouth.  </li>
            <li>Just having my ten year old tooth brush run out of vibrations, I tried to duplicate it as best</li>
            <li>i had a sonic at 3 times the price,,, this one makes teeth feel clean but not sqicky clean...  </li>
            <li>Gets my teeth clean and seems to do an alright job at cleaning around my gum line.  </li>
            <li>This one is by far the best out of the different toothbrushes I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li>my teeth feel so clean.</li>
            <li>Noisy, but cheap and good enough for a kid that may lose the $30+ Unit from home.</li>
            <li>It seems to really clean well.</li>
            <li>It forces you to clean one tooth at a time rather than &#x27;brushing&#x27; like I did with the Sonicare (even though they told me not to).    </li>
            <li>My teeth feel really clean after I brush and the two-minute buzzing notification ensures I don&#x27;t skimp on brushing time.</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m finished brushing I feel content that  my mouth and teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li>cause they were right!</li>
            <li>The Oral-B Vitality does a much better job of cleaning your teeth, and will easily get to areas at the gum line that you would really have to work to clean effectively with a regular brush - so you won&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now I know that I was definately not brushing for the full 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I hope to get good results when I go back for my dental checkup.</li>
            <li>I thought that you could go a full 2 weeks without having to charge it up.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>may in fact save you dentist bills in the future, its that good.</li>
            <li>like to use it for the full 2 min.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t replace regular flossing but it does do a good job of getting in between your teeth.</li>
            <li>but after using this toothbrush, I am having doubts about how good I brushed!</li>
            <li>My Sonicare electric toothbrush finally gave up and wouldn&#x27;t charge anymore after a good 8 years of use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good thing it came with two brush heads, cause now my husband has claimed the second one.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is a good solid product for the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good size for my hand and the rotating head is nice and small so it doesn&#x27;t stretch my lips</li>
            <li>As most reviewers have noted, this is a solid and inexpensive unit that is aptly able to clean a person&#x27;s teeth well.</li>
            <li>I wanted a rechargeable toothbrush that would keep a consistent and strong motion.      </li>
            <li>Other than that is great</li>
            <li>Teeth and gums feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>I believe that this toothbrush might have more rotations compared to my older one.</li>
            <li>Removes tartar quickly.  </li>
            <li>and my gums have adjusted to it quickly.     </li>
            <li>The one lost was an older model and this one is newer and better.  </li>
            <li>I bought one of these lost it in flight and quickly replaced it...</li>
            <li>This seems to be a very powerful brush and much more effective than the previous Oral B brush I had.  </li>
            <li>It seems to clean better, but it is pretty much</li>
            <li>It changes quickly, and holds its charge for a good long time.  </li>
            <li>This is my second Oral-B rechargeable Power toothbrush &amp; I am very pleased with the job it does.</li>
            <li>Hopefully, you&#x27;ll read this and other honest reviews and find a more reliable brand of toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I thought it might be time to try something new, and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>After trying out my Oral B Toothbrush and enjoying it, we bought this as a new toothbrush for her.  </li>
            <li>This is a great buy for the price (less than $30).  </li>
            <li>Heads are extremely easy to replace and readily available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great so far, has a nice little stand and the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li>the 2 minutes felt like forever the first time!     </li>
            <li>While it seems to clean the teeth, it is a lot rougher on them than my original choice ten or more years ago.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unique design does, indeed, give it the superior cleaning action that the packaging says it does, and it cleans my teeth better than other toothbrush heads do.</li>
            <li>Having read the reviews about mold/mildew, I have been very vigorous about rinsing it between brushings and it seems to be fine.</li>
            <li>From the first time I used it until now, I&#x27;ve felt my mouth clean.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush works perfectly fine and is much cheaper than others on the market.</li>
            <li>It does a job of keeping  my mouth pretty clean.</li>
            <li>This seems to be a great little toothbrush for the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very happy with this product&#x27;s cleaning power, but didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars for one major reason - there is a hole in the brush head that traps water, and starts to leak and drip down onto you.  </li>
            <li>I was debating if I really wanted to spend the money on this toothbrush or just by a cheap electric one.  </li>
            <li>It would be nice to have different colored heads, like Philips provides.)</li>
            <li>It seems to hold a charge well and is quite powerful.</li>
            <li>I love that this brush is rechargeable - a real advantage over the cheapest power brushes, and the quality makes it a great alternative to more expensive ones.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Its powerful &amp; does</li>
            <li>that makes me laugh every time...</li>
            <li>I do not regret it at all - this thing is powerful and does a thorough job.</li>
            <li>it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>Its very affordable and cleans your teeth very well!&lt;br /&gt;I am glad they have a $30 toothbrush in this economy instead of just the $100 ones.&lt;br /&gt;Dr</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d try the Oral-b Vitality Floss Action Rechargeable Power Toothbrush since the price fits our budget better.</li>
            <li>I have one implant, and some \\&quot;erosions\\&quot; on several teeth near the gum line that were caused by overly-vigorous manual brushing, and I find that the Oral-b does a great job in those difficult-to-brush areas.  </li>
            <li>My dentist has always recommended a toothbrush like this, because you can work the gumline effectively in hard-to-reach places like the upper-back molars (which has historically been my brushing achillies heel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but most days I will use the Floss Action Heads because I felt \\&quot;dentist clean\\&quot; afterwards.</li>
            <li>Liked the way it brushed</li>
            <li>My dentist then recommended I get one and said the cleaning is far superior to the \\&quot;old fashioned\\&quot; way.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re using a regular toothbrush, you have no idea of how really effective a toothbrush can be.  </li>
            <li>As good as I expected, which isn&#x27;t that often the case the case.</li>
            <li>This is far better then the water pick I have been using.</li>
            <li>Love the brushing action.  </li>
            <li>The handle became warm after the second charging.     </li>
            <li>It is worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I have used this new Oral-b Vitality Floss Action toothbrush for over a month now and am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>For the perfect brushing, you should get one of the models that has a pressure sensor, particularly if you have problems with your gums and/or pressing too hard.  </li>
            <li>Let it charge adequately the first time though.</li>
            <li>I recently had a re-treat root canal doen on a molar, the Endodontist told me to use an electric toothbrush to better clean my teeth, so I purchased this..</li>
            <li>- Great cleaning ability and you can change the head to either a precision clean, sensitive, pro white, dual clean, or floss action</li>
            <li>The precision did not have as smooth a feeling and took me longer to get the clean I got with floss action.</li>
            <li>so when I went to the dentist last week and got praise about how great my flossing was and how much improvement they saw, they couldn&#x27;t believe me when I said I didn&#x27;t change my dental habits, just bought a new toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Firstly, it isn&#x27;t dependent on batteries; it&#x27;s rechargeable, which is great, so you dont have to spend money buying batteries every few weeks.</li>
            <li>My teeth still feel clean, and the brush is much gentler.</li>
            <li>This brush makes my mouth feel so clean just like the one it replace that cost 3X as much.</li>
            <li>This really isn&#x27;t a problem, as when I went to the dentist after using this brush for a month, my teeth were almost perfectly clean.</li>
            <li>It works really well in getting my teeth clean-</li>
            <li>a week unplug the unit, remove the head, and clean the whole thing of any residue.  </li>
            <li>Once a week unplug the unit, remove the head, and clean the whole thing of any residue.  </li>
            <li>my dentist was surprised at how clean my teeth were!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased to know that apparently I&#x27;ve been brushing</li>
            <li>I also find the smaller, rounder floss action head to be perfect to get to the teeth in the back of my mouth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to overlook these minor sacrifices for clean and healthy teeth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a very rough-and-tumble feel to it, but it feels so good, almost like a rough massage to my teeth and gums.      </li>
            <li>Definately alot more fun than using a standard tooth brush on your teeth.  </li>
            <li>the manual says it takes) it gave a strong brushing action.  </li>
            <li>The brush power however is not as high as I was expecting, but my teeth still feel clean after brushing.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for those who like clean teeth.</li>
            <li>Amazon was great in sending me a replacement but the second one had the exact same problem.</li>
            <li>In fact, up until a week ago, my first Oral B (from the Professional Series) was still going strong.  </li>
            <li>I also very much like the timer feature.  </li>
            <li>The last powered toothbrush I owned had a very large head, too large to fit around my gum line and accurately reach all the crevices of my teeth.</li>
            <li>My recommendation is to try other brands or Oral-B&#x27;s more advanced power toothbrush models.</li>
            <li>I was about to throw out my old favorite Braun unit but now with the replacement power handle its just like new!  </li>
            <li>It, particularly, has a far reach and does a much better job than my manual toothbruch.  </li>
            <li>This gets your teeth super clean and they stay feeling clean for a long time.</li>
            <li>and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone who is looking for a new way to clean their teeth.</li>
            <li>yeah, pay no attention to that sensation after the first time you use Oral-B&#x27;s Vitality.  </li>
            <li>When I first used it, I did not like it, felt the plastic was hitting my teeth</li>
            <li>Cleans teeth VERY well!</li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush ever.</li>
            <li>I first bought this a year ago, and it&#x27;s been sitting in my room idle for a variety of reasons.  </li>
            <li>When I set the power handle on the charger the first time, I just had to hope that it was working.</li>
            <li>This is my first power toothbrush</li>
            <li>My dentist say I have a healthy mouth, but I like eating foods that tend to stain the teeth, such as curry.</li>
            <li>Noticed handle gets hot to the touch when turned on (so the battery is trying operate motor) without the unit operating.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it came with an extra brush head since my wife wanted to try it as well.</li>
            <li>So this is the first electric tooth brush I have ever purchased.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used the&lt;br /&gt;brush</li>
            <li>This is my first time using an electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>It gave me such great, long service, I ordered another one through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I think it does a better job cleaning teeth than a standard toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Gave it my son to use and he seemed to actually use it for more than two seconds.</li>
            <li>also love that we have a variety of heads to choose from, being as my husband does not like the same tooth brushes as me.</li>
            <li>did not get any bleeding when I first used it</li>
            <li>The first one died after two weeks and it would no longer hold a charge.</li>
            <li>Despite these differences, my wife says that it cleans better while using the same brushes as its predecessor.</li>
            <li>I found this to be pretty close to the battery life that I received.    </li>
            <li>This is my first power toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>overall, I&#x27;m quite pleased with this brush</li>
            <li>No charging light - my old Professional Oral B had a light, there was no doubt when it was plugged in and charging.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;  </li>
            <li>Old model had LED light indicating the handle was connected and receiving a charge.</li>
            <li>but you can really feel it cleaning, and also getting things out of the spaces in between your teeth as well!</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I need.</li>
            <li>With these heads i feel like this toothbrush really deepcleans my mouth!  </li>
            <li>First auto toothbrush I&#x27;ve had</li>
            <li>The first time I used the Oral-B Vitality I felt as if I had just come from the dentists office.</li>
            <li>Overall the cost will be more then this in 2 years.</li>
            <li>This is my first power brush and it excels my expectation.</li>
            <li>if I had, I would have known that this is not the first time that this has happened.  </li>
            <li>After using my first Oral B brush for 1.5 years without problems, this model wasn&#x27;t working out for me.</li>
            <li>but there&#x27;s many features they left out.</li>
            <li>We charged it as directed and it worked the first time.  </li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t think it was holding a change, but it turns out that it was the plug I was using in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that the head is so small because the kids are comfortable with it too.</li>
            <li>They were never really bad, but this checkup he said they have stopped receding and looked, in his words, \\&quot;pink, healthy, and great.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It would be good to know that it is charging or is fully charged, so that electricity isn&#x27;t being wasted.    </li>
            <li>I have used this brand of tooth brush for many, many years - they last a very long time and well worth the price.</li>
            <li>so I am getting a pack of Precision heads (they are super cheap, like $14 for 3) for back ups</li>
            <li>/&gt;Details: The Oral-B Vitality is a very straightforward and simple unit.</li>
            <li>If someone had very sensitive teeth or gums, there is a sensitive teeth refill head that might work better.</li>
            <li>This is my very first rechargeable power toothbrush, and the experience has been very positive, so far.</li>
            <li>It also has the pretty much unnecessary timer (I brush longer than it times), but it is powerful and a great cleaner.</li>
            <li>No bells or whistles, but it&#x27;s just as effective as any other model sold ( I should know, - I&#x27;m a dental specialist :</li>
            <li>The flossing action does help clean between teeth and along the gumline.</li>
            <li>My teeth always feel so clean after brushing just like a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li>The precision head seem to have a better cleaning action to it, compared to the floss action head.</li>
            <li>Grandma was beeming for the ease of ordering on Amazon and fast delivery made sure it was at her house before the big day.  </li>
            <li>It cleanses my teeth &amp; gums just as good as the more expensive model.</li>
            <li>When I told her I was glad to see that she endorsed the floss action she nearly had a stroke.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works well and is compact enough for travelling but it would be good if it had dual wattage because I can bring it anywhere in the world to use it, as it is it can only be used in the US.</li>
            <li>The Oral-B power toothbrush easily cleans the hard-to-reach areas of your teeth, removing more plaque than an ordinary toothbrush.</li>
            <li>* Positive Points:</li>
            <li>As long as I brush before I dress, or drape a towel over me while brushing, all is well, but I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve started my day by changing tops or cleaning one off before going to work.</li>
            <li>I have tried a few other power toothbrushes over the years and I must say that this is one of the best.  </li>
            <li>I did much shopping before I bought the Vitality, but really, for the money especially, it does an outstanding job.</li>
            <li>Some of you might be scared with the idea of putting electric equipment in your mouth &amp; not sure if you need this or its any good.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s really good for lazy person because you don&#x27;t have to move your hand.</li>
            <li>Using the oval Floss Action brush head once a day, it does a superior job of removing calculus buildup in the most troublesome area behind my lower front teeth.  </li>
            <li>So far I really like it for getting my teeth clean without my feeling like I have to scrub.</li>
            <li>* Good speed, not too fast or slow, just feels right  </li>
            <li>That job is still best left to my manual toothbrush due to its larger head.    </li>
            <li>it holds its charge for a week for me, then i charge it overnight, and it is strong as anything the next morning.  </li>
            <li>It is still going strong after almost 2 years of daily use, with no sign of lessening power or charge.  </li>
            <li>The brush action (back and forth) is fast and powerful leaving my teeth and gums feeling very clean.  </li>
            <li>For the price and pure cleaning/shining/flossing/etc.  </li>
            <li>There wasn&#x27;t much info/reviews at the time, but what was out there was positive.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I love the brushing action, after first getting used to the feel of the brush against my teeth and</li>
            <li>The heads I purchased at the time worked great, but the ones I bought a year later were significantly less so.  </li>
            <li>Holds a good charge and  comes with an extra brush head and has a 2 year limited</li>
            <li>The toothbrush head is larger than the one I had been using, but that is fine.  </li>
            <li>I always wanted a rechargeable toothbrush at a low cost, and after reading so many positive reviews I purchased the oral-b vitality floss action.</li>
            <li>My husband is a HUGE fan of the timer, however I tend to stop and restart several times in my ritual</li>
            <li>Battery power is great; I can take it on a short (few days) trip without needing to take the charger with me.</li>
            <li>A great improvement over my last few that I have used.  </li>
            <li>and im used to it, my teeth have gotten much whiter as well.</li>
            <li>My teeth are whiter and my breath is fresher (too much info, I know).</li>
            <li>does the job without fanfare (timers, etc) and functions very well.  </li>
            <li>The replacement heads are reasonably price.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this because I am living away from my primary rechargeable toothbrush for several months</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much.  </li>
            <li>Reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>It seems like there should be a light that glows different colors.</li>
            <li>Except that the replacement heads are much cheaper.</li>
            <li>If I were truly intense about dental&lt;</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>brush head is gentle yet</li>
            <li>with a gentle reminder from the device,&lt;br /&gt;which is when the unit starts to have an intermittent slowing motion.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used this brand for over 20 years and never had a real problem with any brush I bought.</li>
            <li>You really do feel like you&#x27;re come from the dentist after using this.  </li>
            <li>- Reasonable price for replacement heads (about $15 for 3).</li>
            <li>- There is no indicator light to let you know when the brush is fully charged or even to let you know when the charge is low.    </li>
            <li>This really cleans teeth well.  </li>
            <li>I really like the two minute timer feature</li>
            <li>following Oral B brush heads will fit this model:&lt;br /&gt;1.  </li>
            <li>following Oral B brush heads will fit this model:&lt;br /&gt;1.  </li>
            <li>Really.  </li>
            <li>The only downside is that it does not have a light indicating whether it is charging or not....</li>
            <li>It was too much to continue switching out brushes.  </li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>You really can.  </li>
            <li>really don&#x27;t like getting ripped off.</li>
            <li>When you brush you keep the mouth semi-closed and the brush in contact with your teeth at the border with your gums, without pushing too much.</li>
            <li>I really like this brush</li>
            <li>and it still works for him very well.</li>
            <li>Plus it arrived so fast..</li>
            <li>it cleans very well.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really feel like I needed one</li>
            <li>teeth feel much cleaner than they did when brushing with this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>you should really give this one a try.  </li>
            <li>I really like the two minute timer, and I feel that my teeth have been cleaner since switching to this brush.</li>
            <li>- wiping my rear with the $20 bill I spent for this thing would have been a much better investment.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize it at the time, but it was actually still covered under a 2-yr warranty, so maybe I could have gotten a free replacement, I</li>
            <li>The only thing is that it takes more than 2 minutes for what i call complete cleaning.</li>
            <li>Does not seem to be as powerful (fast) as our old handle.  </li>
            <li>Some other bonus items I liked about this product: came with 2 brush heads, so won&#x27;t need to replace heads for at least 6 months; also liked the 2 minute timer alert, but not shutting off</li>
            <li>I was trying to be cheap and bought generic ones and they are not the same at all, they dont really seem to clean your teeth at all.  </li>
            <li>Before this, I&#x27;ve used a variety of regular toothbrushes and spent a lot of money on the latest toothpastes but my teeth didn&#x27;t feel completely clean unless I went for a cleaning at the dentist.</li>
            <li>Over the past couple weeks, I realized that my gums were becoming more irritated, so I am not sure that it works better in practice.</li>
            <li>I feel like it is really getting my teeth clean in a short time.  </li>
            <li>Finally, the original battery wore out as I was having to charge it almost daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Supposedly most of the other oral-b heads are interchangeable, but I haven&#x27;t tried that yet.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know what you need the other speed for...and for 30$-40$ more than the price of the Vitality.</li>
            <li>Not sure it&#x27;s safe anymore?!</li>
            <li>On my second one now since the original one quit working for some reason.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my gum and cause the pain like other traditional toothbrushes do when pressing close to my gum to clean more thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Previously, I never spent more than $5 max for a toothbrush because \\&quot;they all do the same thing\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>But there&#x27;s a big difference in how clean your mouth will feel after using one of these for a week.</li>
            <li>The FlossAction head is slightly larger in size than the brush-head I used before (the Precision Clean).  </li>
            <li>I tried the precision clean heads after using the heads the unit shipped with above.  </li>
            <li>But if you want to have something little more delicate, I recommend you to buy the ones with a little more soft brush and more sophisticated functions.</li>
            <li>Rotary action cleans teeth and easily reaches the back of the mouth and backs of the teeth where you normally don&#x27;t brush very well.</li>
            <li>It still works fine and holds a charge for a very long time.</li>
            <li>and my only real gripe with it is that it doesn&#x27;t have a charging indicator light like my old brush.</li>
            <li>They probably could be cheaper looking at the simplicity of manufacture, but since they compete with a full toothbrush you&#x27;ll pay about the same.  </li>
            <li>(the head is smaller than a standard toothbrush) and I was able to clean the teeth all of the way in the back of my mouth with no problems.  </li>
            <li>And surprisingly, the little \\&quot;rubber pieces\\&quot; that act as \\&quot;floss action\\&quot; actually does feel like the dentist cleaning my teeth and my teeth and gums</li>
            <li>I was due to buy more refills, &amp; decided I would rather buy a new set of power brush.  </li>
            <li>Gets to, and does a great job cleaning, places that are hard to reach with a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>It was delivered very timely and in new packaging.</li>
            <li>This one highlights \\&quot;floss action\\&quot; and it gets the job done even better than previous models.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s relatively quiet and the flossing action head really gets your teeth clean.  </li>
            <li>Such a fresh clean feeling, gets the job done, and i think I&#x27;ve only charged it once overnight</li>
            <li>I like this product for the price, but more expensive electric toothbrushes do work better.     </li>
            <li>Replaced an older Oral \\&quot;B\\&quot; with this, and found it to be satisfactory.  </li>
            <li>It is a decent brush</li>
            <li>dentist bothered me again during my most check-up this August, and I finally started using this electric toothbrush, and the difference between this and a regular Oral B toothbrush is night and day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The extra head it comes with is a plus too, and the timer helps, though if you have a big mouth like mine, you may need more than 2 minutes to brush.</li>
            <li>The charge last 3 - 4 weeks and the recharge is quick.</li>
            <li>But hubby thinks his teeth feels cleaner after using it, and he&#x27;s actually been flossing every night since he got it to, so it&#x27;s definitely helped in many ways.</li>
            <li>(The manufacturer&#x27;s web site has complete information on which brush heads fit the different models.)  </li>
            <li>particularly like the fact that it&#x27;s served me well all these years, and the two minute timer.</li>
            <li>This unit lasts for a few brushes still having fairly good power left and so does not require a recharge every day.</li>
            <li>Typical electric toothbrushes cost more than 2-3 times this one and they do not clean any better.  </li>
            <li>I held out for a long time in buying an electric toothbrush, wondering whether it would really make a difference, but I&#x27;m glad I finally did.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for anyone wanting a low-cost electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Sure this one does not have extra features like digital timer, 30 sec notifier, charging light indicator, etc, etc.</li>
            <li>If you have a unit that&#x27;s compatible with this replacement I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECCOMEND</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this toothbrush &amp; brush-head combination.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think my teeth have felt this clean in a long time.</li>
            <li>Maybe even better due to the flossing action of the brush head(s) that come with this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now switched to the extra sensitive brush&lt;br /&gt;heads, which seem gentler on my gums and still get my teeth just as clean.  </li>
            <li>It has only one speed which is fine because why do you really want alternate speeds?</li>
            <li>This takes the older and current heads and zips right along.</li>
            <li>I was wrong -- this one works great.</li>
            <li>I notice I don&#x27;t put near as much pressure on my teeth and gums as I used to.</li>
            <li>I would advise the sensitive brush if you tend to use too much pressure when brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that the sensitive brushes are often sold by subscription, another marketing strategy I do not like.</li>
            <li>That being said, I am pleasantly surprised by how much I like this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush itself is a great deal, though the replacement heads can be expensive.  </li>
            <li>You know how the dentist tells you to brush in circles, but almost nobody ever does that because a normal toothbrush is not designed that way?  </li>
            <li>does a good job of getting the gum line towards the back of my (small) mouth.  </li>
            <li>With this brush, my teeth are sparkling white and fresh.</li>
            <li>The timer helps me continue to brush when I might have normally stopped.</li>
            <li>and it would work well enough when the batteries were fresh.  </li>
            <li>We have a Sonicare unit that we normally use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned Oral B electric toothbrushes for over 20 years and you van count on them to last a long time and to be at the cusp of the latest technology with each new role-out.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s easy enough to take a rubber band and reduce the cord to the necessary length.</li>
            <li>have also used several different toothbrush heads with the Vitality, but the Floss Action brush is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>I have a small mouth inside and this new brush fits a little more snugly inside my mouth, but on the plus side, this one holds slightly more</li>
            <li>My other was so worn out and this new one is fabulous.</li>
            <li>I wonder if they have a new manufacturer.</li>
            <li>We have had our Oral-B tooth brush for over 10 years and it just bit the dust 2 weeks ago, so I was on the hunt for a new tooth brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was new in box.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>They work out to about the price of a new toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I should not have gotten rid of it before trying out my new one though, which broke almost immediately.  </li>
            <li>Now, I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>so I got a new one.  </li>
            <li>No indicator for battery life - It is designed with the expectation that most people will leave it plugged in all the time, but I prefer to run my batteries down between charges and I didn&#x27;t get much warning when it quit in the middle of a brush one night.    </li>
            <li>As it is, the only way to know the toothbrush is when the charging stand turns warm after a few hours plugged in.</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;m a big dude), but I liked the idea of the circular action, and I wanted to spend less than 50 bucks on an upgrade, so I gave it a shot.  </li>
            <li>it hurt at first (definitely had to get used to the increased sensation vs. a normal brush)</li>
            <li>Simply the best that my meager income can manage...</li>
            <li>This product is comparable to my high end professional series model.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I felt like my teeth were very clean, except along the gum line where I was hesitant to direct the Oral-b brush since it&#x27;s a little harsher than my Sonicare</li>
            <li>This is my second Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush but first of this model.  </li>
            <li>After the first use I not only felt the difference, but could see it too.  </li>
            <li>I was totally sold on this toothbrush after the first use.</li>
            <li>This is my 3rd brush but the first one made in Mexico.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve tried many other toothbrushes, but this one definitely gets the job done and is one I&#x27;d recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Out of the box, you have to charge it 16 hours before your first initial use.</li>
            <li>If and when it ever wears out or breaks, I will purchase the same exact product again.</li>
            <li>I was sceptical at first because of the mixed reviews i read</li>
            <li>First of all the overall price.</li>
            <li>From the first charge (which took only about 8 hours, as opposed to the 16</li>
            <li>Bought for my 8 year old and she loves it!</li>
            <li>What I do know is that my mouth feels extra EXTRA clean after it&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li>like my old toothbrush, manifestly lack the power I had when new.)</li>
            <li>So, at some point, the batteries will get old and you&#x27;ll need to buy a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>Like the fact that replaceable brushes are readily available for it and are long lasting.</li>
            <li>everyday use this easy to brush my teeth</li>
            <li>I went to Consumer&lt;br /&gt;Reports, and the ones they really liked were pretty expensive, so I</li>
            <li>So try floss action first, others later if unsatisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Refills.</li>
            <li>I got it, charged it up for a full 16 hours just like the tiny instructions said to do, and it didn&#x27;t even operate for a second - no movement, no noise, no nothing.  </li>
            <li>This leaves my teeth so clean, I&#x27;m not sure how much cleaner a more expensive brush would even get my teeth, so this is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>The Oral-B toothbrush is powerful and works a longtime on a single charge.</li>
            <li>Even when I floss afterwards, it&#x27;s very little left (and mostly in my teeth that are very close</li>
            <li>My dentist suggested me this due to some dental issues and it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the new Oral B power toothbrush for several weeks now and much to my surprise</li>
            <li>I have almost always used less expensive electric tooth brushes, and this is among the best I have tried before.</li>
            <li>After using manual toothbrushes for our entire lives, my husband and I were very surprised how much cleaner our teeth felt.  </li>
            <li>This brush is far better than my previous one, to the point that I have to order a second one since my wife already stole mine for herself!    </li>
            <li>I had been using traditional toothbrushes which also had heads that seemed too large for my mouth.     </li>
            <li>I find the price very reasonable as long as the battery keeps working.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had read both positive and negative reviews for this Oral-b Vitality Floss Action toothbrush and decided to give it a shot because it was a different cleaning action than the sonic style, and the price seemed much more affordable (~$25).  </li>
            <li>This brush is fantastic, the Floss Action head can be a little aggressive</li>
            <li>head&lt;br /&gt;-Bristles rotate and get in between teeth fairly well, but seem a little harsh along the gum line</li>
            <li>These brushes are much softer, and should arrive as a set like this to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I do like this toothbrush, but only in conjunction with Braun&#x27;s sensitive toothbrush heads.  </li>
            <li>I clean it regularly with rubbing alcohol, soap &amp; water, and keep it dry, as well as changing the brush heads routinely, but nothing seems to stop the odor from happening.</li>
            <li>So, I decided to try the Oral-b Vitality Floss Action toothbrush.    </li>
            <li>Also, if you have sensitive teeth or gums, forget it.  </li>
            <li>However, I do not like the fact that I have to recharge the brush so frequently.</li>
            <li>Another point:  Buy replacement brush-heads from Amazon - much cheaper than local drug store.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the higher-end Oral-B professional unit, and I notice almost no difference with results between the two brushes.</li>
            <li>I received the head that has floss action and I&#x27;m planning to try a couple of the others.</li>
            <li>wow when u put it in your mouth.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my 6+ year old one that I bought in the UK.</li>
            <li>My teeth can be occasionally sensitive, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems with sensitivity with the brush even though it has a lot of power.</li>
            <li>I have had no problems with it so far.</li>
            <li>B0001WXTRI Crest SpinBrush Pro, Soft Bristles (Colors May Vary)]]</li>
            <li>This tooth brush is very simular, only with out the sterilizer.</li>
            <li>did switch to the sensitive head</li>
            <li>Of all things my granddaughter (8yrs old) wanted this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>printed near the on/off switch, however.  </li>
            <li>I do have to use my old toothbrush to scrub my tongue, though, because this brush doesn&#x27;t do the job.  </li>
            <li>She tells all her clients to throw away the floss head and use the sensitive brush ...\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Product completely stopped working after 2 months.</li>
            <li>The savings can be considerable.</li>
            <li>Sonicare brush/bristles have a plastic cover for when toothbrush is not in use; Oral-b just stays exposed when not in use, much like a regular toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;-The</li>
            <li>(and I have sensitive gums already).</li>
            <li>Which I am attributing to the floss action head that we are using with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know why it says Floss action. ??</li>
            <li>Do you really need a digital timer (this one vibrates when you&#x27;re done)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(The brush comes with 2 floss action heads)    </li>
            <li>- Complete Charge takes 16 hours and this lets the brush run for about 1 week (assuming you use it for 2 minutes twice a day).  </li>
            <li>like I&#x27;ve just been to the dentist for a professional cleaning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My old Oral B did not have this, and it was slippery to hold</li>
            <li>Almost feels like a professional teeth-cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I nearly cut myself twice.  </li>
            <li>Sensitive</li>
            <li>Sensitive</li>
            <li>The unit itself is intuitive, simple to use, and works really well.  </li>
            <li>My sensitive teeth handle the brushing action without any pain.  </li>
            <li>and no issues so far.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be holding up so far (1 month).  </li>
            <li>The floss action feels like it cleans around the gum well, but does not replace flossing.  </li>
            <li>It comes with two oval Floss Action brush heads.  </li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>the &#x27;professional&#x27; one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been old school and use a toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I always felt that my toothbrush couldn&#x27;t ever reach that far</li>
            <li>So far I have had no problems with it.</li>
            <li>you like your old manual toothbrush</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace an old toothbrush.</li>
            <li>but I suggest getting the sensitive heads.</li>
            <li>and I like it so far.</li>
            <li>I bought this device for the so called floss action but it doesn&#x27;t have any.</li>
            <li>Definitely spend a few bucks more to get this product.</li>
            <li>You get the same high-quality head (plus a refill) that is featured in higher priced Oral-b models, but it&#x27;s attached to a bare bones but fully functional handle that keeps it priced at about the cost of 3 disposable electrics.    </li>
            <li>I was skeptical because of the lower price, but it feels so much more powerful than the others.  </li>
            <li>Nice to know if I go on a business trip and leave the charger behind.    </li>
            <li>Your teeth really do feel much cleaner and it takes much less time than a normal toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The small, rotating head easily gets to the gum line of even the rear teeth.  </li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush (Oral-B Vitality Floss Action Rechargeable Power Toothbrush, Blue and White).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a more expensive Oral-B mechanical toothbrush for many years now, but that one is wearing down, so</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s noisier and rougher (compared to the subtle \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; movement of the sonicare), and has more moving parts.</li>
            <li>Since it has the two minute timer built in, it was very simple to see the clean feeling of one over the other.  </li>
            <li>I had such high hopes for this tooth</li>
            <li>Plainly put,the toothbrush delivered an efficient clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Their is a timer that after 2 minutes it stops briefly then keeps on going and repeats this cycle 2 or 3 times and then just keepes moving like normal</li>
            <li>It reaches in some of the problem areas...behind the very back teeth and really can get in there and scrub behind the front bottom and top.  </li>
            <li>The head of the Oral-b is only 1/2 to 1/3 the size of a manual toothbrush, and I always brush my entire tongue as the last part of \\&quot;tooth\\&quot; brushing to get that minty, fresh taste.  </li>
            <li>I spent hours looking for a review that told me this exact info</li>
            <li>this never worked, despite my trying twice to charge it using two different outlets in my home that normally work with no problem.  </li>
            <li>I figured a rechargeable toothbrush lasting 6-7 years (replacing the heads of course) was normal.  </li>
            <li>But it rather quickly would be less and less powerful as the batteries drained.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyhow, the only thing I don&#x27;t like about this brush, and it&#x27;s enough to make me consider using a different brush, is that they inserted these hard pieces of plastic in with the soft hairs, and it kind of rasps on your gums.  </li>
            <li>Had to get a new one after my cat knocked over my old brush &amp; it fell into the toilet.</li>
            <li>Oral-B electric toothbrushes are available with wide a range of features and at a wide range of prices, but I found that the low-cost Vitality serves me well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking at the more expensive electric toothbrushes -- Sonicare, and higher end Oral-b -- for quite some time, but could never pull the trigger when for the same price, I can practically buy a lifetime supply of manual toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>I deducted half a star because there is no indicator light telling you the battery status, though this is a minor issue.</li>
            <li>The size of the brush head is a little larger than the precision clean.</li>
            <li>toothbrush tips are easy to change so everyone in the family can have their own while using the same base.  </li>
            <li>There is no warning indicator light for low battery or a timer warning you  how long you have flossed/brushed in an area of your mouth which I have had on other simular products.</li>
            <li>Also since using it, and  using it almost exclusively during same 3-4 years, have had at least 50% less plaque/tartar deposits for my dentist&#x27;s office to clean at my regular semi-annual check-ups--a fact much appreciated by same professionals and one that more than one dental hygienist has noted on countless patients who regularly use such brushes.  </li>
            <li>I think this is important because it means you don&#x27;t have too press hard.  </li>
            <li>Thought I could get a sonicare like my sis, but it was so much more expensive and seems to be a bit high maintenance.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for people who are just starting out and then upgrade later OR just keep buying this because I know I would.  &#x3D;DDDD</li>
            <li>The base and brushes connect with metal parts that feel very secure and strong.  </li>
            <li>Users will see a clear difference within the first few brushings.    </li>
            <li>The one that has a polishing action similar to the one the dental hygienist uses looks intriguing.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>The Oral-B Vitality Floss Action Rechargeable Power Toothbrush is relatively inexpensive, and, from my perspective, is all the toothbrush I need.</li>
            <li>I just got this toothbrush to replace my old one of a similar style that held up for about 4 years.</li>
            <li>It continues working after the two minute timer (apparently others don&#x27;t, which I read in reviews).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised its priced so low!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Added later: The sensitive brush head is circular and removes the jackhammer effect.</li>
            <li>/&gt;\\&quot;I was picking up some items from my dentist&#x27;s office yesterday and noticed that she had the Oral-B ... Toothbrush on her counter as a recommended item and that it had the same woodchuck action floss head as this one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised to see all the very recent reviews that say it doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>My eight-year old model 900TX finally rusted out inside and started misbehaving, so I replaced it with this one.</li>
            <li>Needed a replacement while hospitalized as my old one was lost in transit to physical rehab.  </li>
            <li>I feel like it really gets into all of the harder to reach areas</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t know if another would be better or worse than this one.</li>
            <li>Vitality model is a less expensive model than my Professional Oral B, but it seems to be just as good as far as cleaning my teeth.  </li>
            <li>If you check my other reviews, you&#x27;ll notice that I almost never give a 5-star rating, so consider this 4-star rating very high praise indeed.</li>
            <li>And this toothbrush will be a huge boon to anyone with grip or motor skill impairments since it&#x27;s practically effortless to simply move from tooth to tooth, leaving all the hard work to the electric motor.  </li>
            <li>The handle is bare bones, but you get what you need: 1) a powerful motor that loses no steam before you&#x27;re done brushing; 2) an inductive charging system which means there are no exposed electrical contacts that you need to keep dry; and 3) a timer which notifies you via a slight stutter in the motor action that 2-minutes has elapsed -- this helps you to pace how quickly to move the brush from quadrant to quadrant within your mouth.      </li>
            <li>The brush heads are much more complex: the rotating center and \\&quot;floss action\\</li>
            <li>I finally had to give the old Braun toothbrush a proper burial.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are sensitive and it&#x27;s not an exaggeration to say that every teeth-brushing experience in my life has been tinged with a discomfort that is totally absent with this toothbrush, even though it has such an aggressive feel.  </li>
            <li>It gives an extra level of cleaning, especially at the gum line, that my old Oral-B battery operated brush did not provide.  </li>
            <li>the floss action is nice because it has a small head, which makes it easier to get to the hard to reach back molars.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste money on other brands - this does a fantastic job cleaning your teeth.</li>
            <li>So apparently the head does not last longer than 1.5 months.</li>
            <li>This works very similarly to the more expensive Bruan/Oral B professional series and has the luxury of being rechargeable and can theoretically last years.</li>
            <li>the first one I bought is broken in 2 days but the replacement is really convenient</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth at the gum line and my dentist said that the \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; action irritates the sensitivity and to use only once a day (use regular toothbrush on other brushings).  </li>
            <li>This Oral -B is small enough to reach behind my molars without hurting my mouth and has enough of a brush surface to do a good job of cleaning my teeth and massaging my gums.  </li>
            <li>large or heavy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;My only gripe (and it&#x27;s so minor that I&#x27;m still giving this item five stars) is that it&#x27;s hard to clean the charger</li>
            <li>and I miss that little green light telling me it is sitting correctly.</li>
            <li>However, this is a powerful little toothbrush - at least it gives you the impression you are really getting your teeth cleaned.</li>
            <li>The small head makes it easy to get into tight spaces in the mouth (especially crowded teeth) and to focus on each tooth.  </li>

            <li> Best tooth brush I have ever owned.  </li>

            <li> Great item!!</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush I have ever had,</li>
            <li> This unit is excellent and works as it should.</li>
            <li> My dentist, who is very good, has been bothering me to use this for a couple of years now.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working very good.  </li>
            <li> But for just $19.77, I think this is a very good deal.</li>
            <li> Very good brush though, couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Awesome value and works great.</li>
            <li> I bought this one because it gets great reviews and the price is very good.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush comes with a compact charging stand, an excellent brush-head, and good battery power.  </li>
            <li> I bought this Oral-B Vitality and it has been superb and I am very pleased for the performance and price.  </li>
            <li> Everything else is just great.</li>
            <li> The timer is great for kids and keeps them brushing longer.</li>
            <li> 2-minute timer - automatically tells you after 2 minutes of brushing, great way to build that habit  </li>
            <li> After one 4 minute session with this toothbrush I am a happy convert.</li>
            <li> It does a great job with the gums as well as the teeth.  </li>
            <li> So now I&#x27;m really happy</li>
            <li> I thought it was a great price for the product.</li>
            <li> Great product for the money.</li>
            <li> I have had it a couple of months and it works great.</li>
            <li> Sleek and power, great combo for a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> So I ended up getting the Vitality ($24.99) instaed of getting the 5000 ($119-149) that I would not have been as happy with.</li>
            <li> so, you&#x27;re welcome.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one happy customer.  </li>
            <li> In combination with flossing and the use of a dental pic, it is all you need for great dental hygiene.  </li>
            <li> This product continues to work great for my family.  </li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> I charged this one as directed and it worked great for a couple of days then got weaker for a couple of days and quit working all together.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Get one, use it, and your teeth and gums will be happy.  </li>
            <li> and it does a great job</li>
            <li> So happy in fact, I bought one for my Dad.</li>
            <li> but i feel like i have made a really great investment.  </li>
            <li> I have been happy with everything that I have order from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This oral-b toothbrush is a great price too.</li>
            <li> this thing works great.</li>
            <li> and it works great.</li>
            <li> Great item at a great price.  </li>
            <li> This price on this one looked great, but I was concerned about the \\&quot;flossing\\&quot; claim on these heads.  </li>
            <li> Great tooth brush.</li>
            <li> The price was great.</li>
            <li> Teeth look great.</li>
            <li> We get zero cavities with the Sonicare unit, so it&#x27;s doing a great job.</li>
            <li> and it attribute it to this great and afforable tooth brush</li>
            <li> Great electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing!</li>
            <li> my wife used this toothbrush every day and it works great for her, and it keeps on working good.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, perfect for travel.  </li>
            <li> Good value for a price.</li>
            <li> I think this is just as good.</li>
            <li> Just about as good as going to the dentist hygenist.</li>
            <li> this is a really good toothbrush that lets me get my teeth and gums cleaner than I had been.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush is fairly vigorous and does a good job cleaning.  </li>
            <li> The bottom line is that this is a really good find for someone looking for an electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> This brush is good.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> The good:    </li>
            <li> This toothbrush feels so good</li>
            <li> Your mouth feels so good after brushing with this.</li>
            <li> good buy</li>
            <li> my dental hygiene was to switch to a good electric toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this one is good I think.</li>
            <li> A good brush...but be prepared to get another in about 3 years.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;and gums are in fairly good health.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so good brushing that I had to come do a review.  </li>
            <li> It should NOT be a substitute for a good ole fashion manual flossing ... in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> This does just as good of a job at 1/5 the price.  </li>
            <li> This thing costs under $20, if I remember correctly, and it is as good as any of the &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; products out there.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using these Oral B brushes, my exams are so good</li>
            <li> I feel like I take good care of my teeth-</li>
            <li> Good product.  </li>
            <li> Electric toothbrushes allow for good cleaning without pain in my arms.</li>
            <li> Infact you get a good tickling massage on the gums when you use it.</li>
            <li> This is a good purchase.</li>
            <li> This does a good job for the money.  </li>
            <li> It does not get between teeth, but it does a good job of working around the gums.  </li>
            <li> Does a good job at brushing teeth</li>
            <li> Choose wisely.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ll start by saying that we already agree that having an electronic toothbrush is a good idea.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s good news</li>
            <li> I bought the toothbrush because it&#x27;s really good value and a friend recommended it.</li>
            <li> It gets in there and gets in there good.</li>
            <li> I can keep it off the charger for a good four days</li>
            <li> I would recommend this toothbrush to anybody who want to maintain a good oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> the one I used now is in good condition.</li>
            <li> rechargeable battery lasts a good amount of time, but is not user replaceable.  </li>
            <li> It may not be most wonderful thing in the world &amp; I love my [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> For around $30, this powerful toothbrush is an excellent value.</li>
            <li> Great buy and works in top notch order.</li>
            <li> Be sure to check out their great prices on name brand items.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> 5 star rating is not because this is perfect, but because the results you get are well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> Love it great price</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> This works real good, and the price was just right.  </li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and was amazed how superbly it does the cleaning.</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still, this is a pretty impressive product for the money.</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush!  </li>
            <li> Performs way...Over the Top!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 5 weeks and love it!  </li>
            <li> I really love this electric toothbrush!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Strong motor and the 2 min timer is great.</li>
            <li> This electric tooth brush does a fine job and is a great value.  </li>
            <li> This product is very good and useful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is no alarm or jingle sound which is great if you don&#x27;t want to wake up the family</li>
            <li> This brush is a amazing.</li>
            <li> It really was an impressive sight to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it is a nice power toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> However, those models do cost a good bit more.  </li>
            <li> This model gives good value for the money -- no problems, does what it&#x27;s supposed to, battery lasts for many charge cycles.  </li>
            <li> but it is nice to get that heads up from the unit itself.  </li>
            <li> I can honestly say this is the absolute best.  </li>
            <li> Good price for a toothbrush that I have used for many years.</li>
            <li> feel great and look clean after brushing.  </li>
            <li> great clean</li>
            <li> It is very easy hold on to and maneuver around in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> Makes buying a good electric toothbrush much more accessible!</li>
            <li> I immediately ordered the sensitive heads and am very happy with my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> the Floss action is the best for gum disease.</li>
            <li> Considering the fact that it&#x27;s priced much more reasonably, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a very good product for the price.  </li>
            <li> Its easy to use, and does a great clean.   </li>
            <li> Fast delivery, good quality and good price.</li>
            <li> If this is your first time purchasing an electric toothbrush, this is a great start.</li>
            <li> just had my six-month checkup (first checkup since switching to this brush) and my dentist went on and on about how great my gums looked.</li>
            <li> Nice grip, and easy on &amp; off.  </li>
            <li> The speed is very good and it is not at all loud in its rotations.</li>
            <li> I love the size because it can get all around your teeth and close to the gumline.  </li>
            <li> I also love the timer.  </li>
            <li> If you are thinking of buying a cheap no frills electric toothbrush then you have found just that!</li>
            <li> I love the 2 minute timer as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also impressed how well it removes surface stains (such as from coffee or tea).</li>
            <li> Here are the details, mostly in comparison to the Crest SpinBrush I was using before.    </li>
            <li> , I love this brush.</li>
            <li> I think for for the money, this is definitly a better value.</li>
            <li> , I have no problem brushing for the minutes or more.</li>
            <li> and I like that better.</li>
            <li> the job better than you&#x27;d think.</li>
            <li> She said it was the best present she got for her birthday!  </li>
            <li> love it ....</li>
            <li> glad to see that this generation of electric brushes doesn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;require</li>
            <li> After more than six months I can say that my teeth and&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice one, works well, powerful, nice price too.</li>
            <li> I will order more for others too.</li>
            <li> I am fairly sure this is damaging to gums and teeth.</li>
            <li> Recommend spending more money for a better product.</li>
            <li> Cheaper isn&#x27;t always better.</li>
            <li> For a three month electric toothbrush, there are much better values out there.</li>
            <li> better than manual tooth brush...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Here&#x27;s how the Sonicare one is better than the Oral-b one:&lt;br /&gt;-The</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be pleased.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d also tried the under-$10, disposable electric toothbrushes, but found I could do a better cleaning job with my manual toothbrushes.    </li>
            <li> and I assume, then, more thoroughly) than we can do manually.    </li>
            <li> My dentist says my teeth look fabulous!</li>
            <li> It is an impressively sturdy unit, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> I started out comparing Sonicare and Oral B electric brushes, The Oral B 5000 came out on top</li>
            <li> The brushes surround each tooth to make sure to get in between the teeth and around the gum line.  </li>
            <li> The Oral-B rechargeable is much better.</li>
            <li> So glad I was able to find this.  </li>
            <li> ;  I love the rubber grip handle.  </li>
            <li> my dentist is pleased with me, but he&#x27;s not making the money off me that he once did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with my decision.</li>
            <li> I bought it to replace a brush that cost over $150 and it does a better job.</li>
            <li> What I like most is the two-minute indicator.  </li>
            <li> &amp; i am cavity free, and hope to stay that way as well!  </li>
            <li> Think they&#x27;ll be impressed at the dentist&#x27;s office at his next cleaning appointment!</li>
            <li> My husbands favorite brand...</li>
            <li> She said that I didn&#x27;t need to get the top of the line with all of the bells and whistles</li>
            <li> ELECTRIC TB ARE ALOT BETTER THAN MANUAL.</li>
            <li> (To be perfect, it would need to be able to handle international voltages -</li>
            <li> My gums are way better now</li>
            <li> and I would love to be able to hang it somehow to the wall so that it is not sitting on the sink.</li>
            <li> Make sure you buy the correct brushes that go with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used the more example ($100+</li>
            <li> It had been years since I used a powered toothbrush and this experience convinced me that using that a powered toothbrush will always make for an more efficient cleaning.      </li>
            <li> Like many that have reviewed this product I had never used an electric toothbrush before.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for more than a month</li>
            <li> Removes much more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely glad to have traded-up to this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> why I like my Oral B better:    </li>
            <li> I was told my gums are in much better shape than before.    </li>
            <li> some point I realized I was brushing my teeth more with my \\&quot;backup\\&quot; manual brush than with the electric one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This oral electric brush is best for me rather than the regular brush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with my toothbrush</li>
            <li> So yes, it is certainly better than doing your tooth brushing manually -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fully satisfied for now.</li>
            <li> To my surprise, I found that it works much better than the Sonicare did.</li>
            <li> Also, the circular motion of the Oral-B Vitality works and cleans much better than the back-and-forth motion of the Sonicare brush.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> I Love my Flossing Tooth Brush.</li>
            <li> I am glad I decided to buy this.</li>
            <li> I really, really love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with this rechargeable toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It has a timer so you can make sure you get your two minutes in.  </li>
            <li> Excellent pricing for this basic Oral B electric brush.</li>
            <li> This is better than i thought it was going to be.</li>
            <li> The best think about this toothbrush it does have a 2 min timer on it, and the charge last almost a week.</li>
            <li> It was gentle on my gums, no bleeding, and the bristles did a great job of leaving my mouth feeling very clean.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, so far so good!</li>
            <li> The built in timer is a nice feature because I didn&#x27;t realize how quickly I was brushing my teeth before and now spend more time on them as I</li>
            <li> VEry clean teeth after using this.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my teeth feeling very clean.  </li>
            <li> Awesome brushes can&#x27;t say enough good things about this brush...really reasonable price and</li>
            <li> Otherwise I think this is a good buy and am looking forward to good report at my next dentist appointment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very easy to clean and it holds a charge for quite a while.  </li>
            <li> They feel as clean as if I had just come from the dentist!</li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt so clean after brushing and the price is unbeatable!</li>
            <li> (ie, really clean!)</li>
            <li> I have used Oral-B power brushes for 25 yrs and cannot feel that I have clean teeth w/o one!</li>
            <li> Stay Clean My Friends!</li>
            <li> It really does work well and with a great clean feeling after brushing.</li>
            <li> This is the best clean I have ever had outside of the dentist.</li>
            <li> It was the only purpose of buying it as I already had a very good Braun brush.</li>
            <li> I like the quadrant approach for more accurate mouth care.    </li>
            <li> Purchase and Enjoy :)</li>
            <li> However, this toothbrush is GREAT in comparison to an old fashioned toothbrush or a battery-operated on.  </li>
            <li> The Oral-b Vitality Floss Action Rechargeable Power Toothbrush seems to be the happy medium between those two extremes.  </li>
            <li> The most important feature to me are teeth.  </li>
            <li> wanted to note that the instruction sheet is very thorough and gives good information on how to use the brush and how to tell if you&#x27;re brushing too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable and it functions good.</li>
            <li> Amazon also gets 5 stars for its fast and efficient service, quick shipping and great competitive prices.  </li>
            <li> Braun keeps coming up with fanciful, more costly versions of its excellent original product, but - unless you&#x27;re in love with bells and whistles - they add little but expense.</li>
            <li> - Rechargeable NiCd battery can be replaced so it is much more environmentally friendly than brushes with non replaceable batteries    </li>
            <li> This is not a bad thing!</li>
            <li> I love the clean feeling i get after I brush my teeth.  </li>
            <li> This product was easily set up and it doesn&#x27;t spray all over the place when it is on.  </li>
            <li> It is just that extra bit better than your manual toothbrush, and the two-minute-warning timer is great.</li>
            <li> AND it&#x27;s so easy to brush for 2 minutes because the electronic toothbrush notifies you when time is up.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Instructions on care and cleaning were easy to understand, too.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and easy to recharge.</li>
            <li> i have been using electric tooth brushes for years , they keep my teeth clean and oral b is the top of line in electric tooth brushes.</li>
            <li> but the toothbrush is still going strong.</li>
            <li> Still going strong after 3 years.</li>
            <li> I have had this toothbrush for almost 2 years now and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price - highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have liked the toothbrush very much.  </li>
            <li> The Oral-B Vitality Floss Action Rechargeable is a very good, basic rechargeable toothbrush at a fair price.  </li>
            <li> Its pretty amazing</li>
            <li> Tried the Oral-B Vitality with the floss action brush head and it was amazing!</li>
            <li> The new unit fairly burst from its packaging with youthful vigor, and is now in service helping preserve my ancient choppers.</li>
            <li> The grip section is not too slim so it is a comfortable hold and easy to maneuver; the rubber covering on the handle also means it is not slippery to hold.  </li>
            <li> Worked fine for about 1 min.</li>
            <li> I like it because it is light and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> These really irritated my gums the first time I used it, but it felt great afterwards</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think twice, at this price, this is an awesome buy, and a very small price to pay for clean shiny teeth!!</li>
            <li> This little tool works superbly.  </li>
            <li> Sure, it feels like you just took a belt-sander or a particularly powerful floor buffer to the inside of your mouth, but who can argue with the results?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still thinking about returning it because the sound is a bit jarring.  </li>
            <li> the sound it makes.      </li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush with soft bristles and floss action which I found to be effective.  </li>
            <li> The one feature I would wish it came with is a charging indicator light.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been happy with several generations of Oral-B electronic toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> and the lack of a charger light.</li>
            <li> The great thing about it is the smaller tip and neck.  </li>
            <li> I actually enjoy using this</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not that important to me.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I think the price and quality of this toothbrush make it a great option.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t position the brush precisely, the edges of the head batter your teeth-- sounding like a jackhammer in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> B0017KHCB2 Glister Advanced Toothbrush]].</li>
            <li> In the short term, this seemed like a great, value priced electric toothbrush, but once that odor begins (and it could be as soon as a couple months), I would advise throwing it away because there&#x27;s no getting rid of it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worked great the entire time.  </li>
            <li> More fun to use than a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product and I am here to let you know my Sonicare is now in a landfill</li>
            <li> This is important.    </li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product.  </li>
            <li> This product also needs a charging light</li>
            <li> Works well and comes with a free spare head.</li>
            <li> The suitcase was open and one of our dogs decided that her Phillips Sonicare Toothbrush would make a great chew toy.  </li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush, it&#x27;s well worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I had it filled, but the week before I had it done</li>
            <li> My teeth had a smooth, polished feeling and I felt the detailed grooves of the brush head to get into each groove in my teeth.</li>
            <li> Just keep in mind the range of brushes available.</li>
            <li> If I get the same longevity out of this one I&#x27;ll be really happy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li> However, there is dentist who suggest not to use this kind of toothbrush too much.</li>
            <li> leaves my teeth feeling almost as good as a professional dental cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The FlossAction brush head does a good job of getting near the tooth/gum line.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But, it does a good job so far and no show stopper complaints.  </li>
            <li> This one looked good with the floss action bristles.</li>
            <li> I thought it was still working fine, but compared to a nice new one, i might as well have not been brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> Luckily toothpaste cleans up easy.  </li>
            <li> Luckily toothpaste cleans up easy.  </li>
            <li> The Vitality charges quickly, the charge lasts 1 - 2 weeks using the brush 2 - 3 times a day and it is easy to keep clean.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this one so far.  </li>
            <li> My good old manual toothbrush just wasn&#x27;t doing a good enough job of removing stains.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m 80, still have a version of my original teeth, and,</li>
            <li> I bought it when it first came out, and it cost me $170.00.I love my Sonicare, but the replacement heads can cost up to $50.00.</li>
            <li> And I am glad we purchased this model over the higher end ones OralB has in their product line.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And even for those of us with no impairments, the electric motor is able to brush each tooth at a much higher rate (</li>
            <li> My one concern over this toothbrush is that the replacement heads look like they cost a significant proportion of what the brush itself costs.</li>
            <li> Still going on its original rechargable battery pack without problems.  </li>
            <li> powerful!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re concerned about keeping your teeth clean and healthy, but don&#x27;t want to devote too much time, energy or money into your routine, this product is for you!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush does a good job and has a pretty decently powered</li>
            <li> At first, it was a nice change; I felt like the new toothbrush was doing a better job cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t think my mouth felt that clean.</li>
            <li> So I used it again, my mouth felt clean, it does take some time to get used to this if you never used an electric toothbrush before..</li>
            <li> I found after a few days I dont miss either and it has done a great job on my teeth and gums keeping them clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> so I had to invest in something that would really clean my teeth.</li>
            <li> Every time I use it, my mouth and teeth feel so clean, like after I go to the dentist.  </li>
            <li> My teeth felt &#x27;dentist clean&#x27; after brushing for a couple minutes.</li>
            <li> My teeth didn&#x27;t look this clean even after a visit to the dentist.</li>
            <li> My hygienist announced that I have a&lt;br /&gt;truly clean mouth.  </li>
            <li> Just having my ten year old tooth brush run out of vibrations, I tried to duplicate it as best</li>
            <li> i had a sonic at 3 times the price,,, this one makes teeth feel clean but not sqicky clean...  </li>
            <li> Gets my teeth clean and seems to do an alright job at cleaning around my gum line.  </li>
            <li> This one is by far the best out of the different toothbrushes I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> my teeth feel so clean.</li>
            <li> Noisy, but cheap and good enough for a kid that may lose the $30+ Unit from home.</li>
            <li> It seems to really clean well.</li>
            <li> It forces you to clean one tooth at a time rather than &#x27;brushing&#x27; like I did with the Sonicare (even though they told me not to).    </li>
            <li> My teeth feel really clean after I brush and the two-minute buzzing notification ensures I don&#x27;t skimp on brushing time.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m finished brushing I feel content that  my mouth and teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li> cause they were right!</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Vitality does a much better job of cleaning your teeth, and will easily get to areas at the gum line that you would really have to work to clean effectively with a regular brush - so you won&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now I know that I was definately not brushing for the full 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I hope to get good results when I go back for my dental checkup.</li>
            <li> I thought that you could go a full 2 weeks without having to charge it up.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> may in fact save you dentist bills in the future, its that good.</li>
            <li> like to use it for the full 2 min.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t replace regular flossing but it does do a good job of getting in between your teeth.</li>
            <li> but after using this toothbrush, I am having doubts about how good I brushed!</li>
            <li> My Sonicare electric toothbrush finally gave up and wouldn&#x27;t charge anymore after a good 8 years of use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good thing it came with two brush heads, cause now my husband has claimed the second one.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is a good solid product for the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good size for my hand and the rotating head is nice and small so it doesn&#x27;t stretch my lips</li>
            <li> As most reviewers have noted, this is a solid and inexpensive unit that is aptly able to clean a person&#x27;s teeth well.</li>
            <li> I wanted a rechargeable toothbrush that would keep a consistent and strong motion.      </li>
            <li> Other than that is great</li>
            <li> Teeth and gums feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I believe that this toothbrush might have more rotations compared to my older one.</li>
            <li> Removes tartar quickly.  </li>
            <li> and my gums have adjusted to it quickly.     </li>
            <li> The one lost was an older model and this one is newer and better.  </li>
            <li> I bought one of these lost it in flight and quickly replaced it...</li>
            <li> This seems to be a very powerful brush and much more effective than the previous Oral B brush I had.  </li>
            <li> It seems to clean better, but it is pretty much</li>
            <li> It changes quickly, and holds its charge for a good long time.  </li>
            <li> This is my second Oral-B rechargeable Power toothbrush &amp; I am very pleased with the job it does.</li>
            <li> Hopefully, you&#x27;ll read this and other honest reviews and find a more reliable brand of toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I thought it might be time to try something new, and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> After trying out my Oral B Toothbrush and enjoying it, we bought this as a new toothbrush for her.  </li>
            <li> This is a great buy for the price (less than $30).  </li>
            <li> Heads are extremely easy to replace and readily available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works great so far, has a nice little stand and the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> the 2 minutes felt like forever the first time!     </li>
            <li> While it seems to clean the teeth, it is a lot rougher on them than my original choice ten or more years ago.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unique design does, indeed, give it the superior cleaning action that the packaging says it does, and it cleans my teeth better than other toothbrush heads do.</li>
            <li> Having read the reviews about mold/mildew, I have been very vigorous about rinsing it between brushings and it seems to be fine.</li>
            <li> From the first time I used it until now, I&#x27;ve felt my mouth clean.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush works perfectly fine and is much cheaper than others on the market.</li>
            <li> It does a job of keeping  my mouth pretty clean.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a great little toothbrush for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy with this product&#x27;s cleaning power, but didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars for one major reason - there is a hole in the brush head that traps water, and starts to leak and drip down onto you.  </li>
            <li> I was debating if I really wanted to spend the money on this toothbrush or just by a cheap electric one.  </li>
            <li> It would be nice to have different colored heads, like Philips provides.)</li>
            <li> It seems to hold a charge well and is quite powerful.</li>
            <li> I love that this brush is rechargeable - a real advantage over the cheapest power brushes, and the quality makes it a great alternative to more expensive ones.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Its powerful &amp; does</li>
            <li> that makes me laugh every time...</li>
            <li> I do not regret it at all - this thing is powerful and does a thorough job.</li>
            <li> it is worth it.  </li>
            <li> Its very affordable and cleans your teeth very well!&lt;br /&gt;I am glad they have a $30 toothbrush in this economy instead of just the $100 ones.&lt;br /&gt;Dr</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try the Oral-b Vitality Floss Action Rechargeable Power Toothbrush since the price fits our budget better.</li>
            <li> I have one implant, and some \\&quot;erosions\\&quot; on several teeth near the gum line that were caused by overly-vigorous manual brushing, and I find that the Oral-b does a great job in those difficult-to-brush areas.  </li>
            <li> My dentist has always recommended a toothbrush like this, because you can work the gumline effectively in hard-to-reach places like the upper-back molars (which has historically been my brushing achillies heel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but most days I will use the Floss Action Heads because I felt \\&quot;dentist clean\\&quot; afterwards.</li>
            <li> Liked the way it brushed</li>
            <li> My dentist then recommended I get one and said the cleaning is far superior to the \\&quot;old fashioned\\&quot; way.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re using a regular toothbrush, you have no idea of how really effective a toothbrush can be.  </li>
            <li> As good as I expected, which isn&#x27;t that often the case the case.</li>
            <li> This is far better then the water pick I have been using.</li>
            <li> Love the brushing action.  </li>
            <li> The handle became warm after the second charging.     </li>
            <li> It is worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I have used this new Oral-b Vitality Floss Action toothbrush for over a month now and am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> For the perfect brushing, you should get one of the models that has a pressure sensor, particularly if you have problems with your gums and/or pressing too hard.  </li>
            <li> Let it charge adequately the first time though.</li>
            <li> I recently had a re-treat root canal doen on a molar, the Endodontist told me to use an electric toothbrush to better clean my teeth, so I purchased this..</li>
            <li> - Great cleaning ability and you can change the head to either a precision clean, sensitive, pro white, dual clean, or floss action</li>
            <li> The precision did not have as smooth a feeling and took me longer to get the clean I got with floss action.</li>
            <li> so when I went to the dentist last week and got praise about how great my flossing was and how much improvement they saw, they couldn&#x27;t believe me when I said I didn&#x27;t change my dental habits, just bought a new toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Firstly, it isn&#x27;t dependent on batteries; it&#x27;s rechargeable, which is great, so you dont have to spend money buying batteries every few weeks.</li>
            <li> My teeth still feel clean, and the brush is much gentler.</li>
            <li> This brush makes my mouth feel so clean just like the one it replace that cost 3X as much.</li>
            <li> This really isn&#x27;t a problem, as when I went to the dentist after using this brush for a month, my teeth were almost perfectly clean.</li>
            <li> It works really well in getting my teeth clean-</li>
            <li> a week unplug the unit, remove the head, and clean the whole thing of any residue.  </li>
            <li> Once a week unplug the unit, remove the head, and clean the whole thing of any residue.  </li>
            <li> my dentist was surprised at how clean my teeth were!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased to know that apparently I&#x27;ve been brushing</li>
            <li> I also find the smaller, rounder floss action head to be perfect to get to the teeth in the back of my mouth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to overlook these minor sacrifices for clean and healthy teeth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a very rough-and-tumble feel to it, but it feels so good, almost like a rough massage to my teeth and gums.      </li>
            <li> Definately alot more fun than using a standard tooth brush on your teeth.  </li>
            <li> the manual says it takes) it gave a strong brushing action.  </li>
            <li> The brush power however is not as high as I was expecting, but my teeth still feel clean after brushing.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for those who like clean teeth.</li>
            <li> Amazon was great in sending me a replacement but the second one had the exact same problem.</li>
            <li> In fact, up until a week ago, my first Oral B (from the Professional Series) was still going strong.  </li>
            <li> I also very much like the timer feature.  </li>
            <li> The last powered toothbrush I owned had a very large head, too large to fit around my gum line and accurately reach all the crevices of my teeth.</li>
            <li> My recommendation is to try other brands or Oral-B&#x27;s more advanced power toothbrush models.</li>
            <li> I was about to throw out my old favorite Braun unit but now with the replacement power handle its just like new!  </li>
            <li> It, particularly, has a far reach and does a much better job than my manual toothbruch.  </li>
            <li> This gets your teeth super clean and they stay feeling clean for a long time.</li>
            <li> and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone who is looking for a new way to clean their teeth.</li>
            <li> yeah, pay no attention to that sensation after the first time you use Oral-B&#x27;s Vitality.  </li>
            <li> When I first used it, I did not like it, felt the plastic was hitting my teeth</li>
            <li> Cleans teeth VERY well!</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush ever.</li>
            <li> I first bought this a year ago, and it&#x27;s been sitting in my room idle for a variety of reasons.  </li>
            <li> When I set the power handle on the charger the first time, I just had to hope that it was working.</li>
            <li> This is my first power toothbrush</li>
            <li> My dentist say I have a healthy mouth, but I like eating foods that tend to stain the teeth, such as curry.</li>
            <li> Noticed handle gets hot to the touch when turned on (so the battery is trying operate motor) without the unit operating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it came with an extra brush head since my wife wanted to try it as well.</li>
            <li> So this is the first electric tooth brush I have ever purchased.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used the&lt;br /&gt;brush</li>
            <li> This is my first time using an electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> It gave me such great, long service, I ordered another one through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I think it does a better job cleaning teeth than a standard toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Gave it my son to use and he seemed to actually use it for more than two seconds.</li>
            <li> also love that we have a variety of heads to choose from, being as my husband does not like the same tooth brushes as me.</li>
            <li> did not get any bleeding when I first used it</li>
            <li> The first one died after two weeks and it would no longer hold a charge.</li>
            <li> Despite these differences, my wife says that it cleans better while using the same brushes as its predecessor.</li>
            <li> I found this to be pretty close to the battery life that I received.    </li>
            <li> This is my first power toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> overall, I&#x27;m quite pleased with this brush</li>
            <li> No charging light - my old Professional Oral B had a light, there was no doubt when it was plugged in and charging.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;  </li>
            <li> Old model had LED light indicating the handle was connected and receiving a charge.</li>
            <li> but you can really feel it cleaning, and also getting things out of the spaces in between your teeth as well!</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I need.</li>
            <li> With these heads i feel like this toothbrush really deepcleans my mouth!  </li>
            <li> First auto toothbrush I&#x27;ve had</li>
            <li> The first time I used the Oral-B Vitality I felt as if I had just come from the dentists office.</li>
            <li> Overall the cost will be more then this in 2 years.</li>
            <li> This is my first power brush and it excels my expectation.</li>
            <li> if I had, I would have known that this is not the first time that this has happened.  </li>
            <li> After using my first Oral B brush for 1.5 years without problems, this model wasn&#x27;t working out for me.</li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s many features they left out.</li>
            <li> We charged it as directed and it worked the first time.  </li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think it was holding a change, but it turns out that it was the plug I was using in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that the head is so small because the kids are comfortable with it too.</li>
            <li> They were never really bad, but this checkup he said they have stopped receding and looked, in his words, \\&quot;pink, healthy, and great.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It would be good to know that it is charging or is fully charged, so that electricity isn&#x27;t being wasted.    </li>
            <li> I have used this brand of tooth brush for many, many years - they last a very long time and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> so I am getting a pack of Precision heads (they are super cheap, like $14 for 3) for back ups</li>
            <li> /&gt;Details: The Oral-B Vitality is a very straightforward and simple unit.</li>
            <li> If someone had very sensitive teeth or gums, there is a sensitive teeth refill head that might work better.</li>
            <li> This is my very first rechargeable power toothbrush, and the experience has been very positive, so far.</li>
            <li> It also has the pretty much unnecessary timer (I brush longer than it times), but it is powerful and a great cleaner.</li>
            <li> No bells or whistles, but it&#x27;s just as effective as any other model sold ( I should know, - I&#x27;m a dental specialist :</li>
            <li> The flossing action does help clean between teeth and along the gumline.</li>
            <li> My teeth always feel so clean after brushing just like a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li> The precision head seem to have a better cleaning action to it, compared to the floss action head.</li>
            <li> Grandma was beeming for the ease of ordering on Amazon and fast delivery made sure it was at her house before the big day.  </li>
            <li> It cleanses my teeth &amp; gums just as good as the more expensive model.</li>
            <li> When I told her I was glad to see that she endorsed the floss action she nearly had a stroke.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works well and is compact enough for travelling but it would be good if it had dual wattage because I can bring it anywhere in the world to use it, as it is it can only be used in the US.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B power toothbrush easily cleans the hard-to-reach areas of your teeth, removing more plaque than an ordinary toothbrush.</li>
            <li> * Positive Points:</li>
            <li> As long as I brush before I dress, or drape a towel over me while brushing, all is well, but I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve started my day by changing tops or cleaning one off before going to work.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few other power toothbrushes over the years and I must say that this is one of the best.  </li>
            <li> I did much shopping before I bought the Vitality, but really, for the money especially, it does an outstanding job.</li>
            <li> Some of you might be scared with the idea of putting electric equipment in your mouth &amp; not sure if you need this or its any good.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s really good for lazy person because you don&#x27;t have to move your hand.</li>
            <li> Using the oval Floss Action brush head once a day, it does a superior job of removing calculus buildup in the most troublesome area behind my lower front teeth.  </li>
            <li> So far I really like it for getting my teeth clean without my feeling like I have to scrub.</li>
            <li> * Good speed, not too fast or slow, just feels right  </li>
            <li> That job is still best left to my manual toothbrush due to its larger head.    </li>
            <li> it holds its charge for a week for me, then i charge it overnight, and it is strong as anything the next morning.  </li>
            <li> It is still going strong after almost 2 years of daily use, with no sign of lessening power or charge.  </li>
            <li> The brush action (back and forth) is fast and powerful leaving my teeth and gums feeling very clean.  </li>
            <li> For the price and pure cleaning/shining/flossing/etc.  </li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t much info/reviews at the time, but what was out there was positive.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I love the brushing action, after first getting used to the feel of the brush against my teeth and</li>
            <li> The heads I purchased at the time worked great, but the ones I bought a year later were significantly less so.  </li>
            <li> Holds a good charge and  comes with an extra brush head and has a 2 year limited</li>
            <li> The toothbrush head is larger than the one I had been using, but that is fine.  </li>
            <li> I always wanted a rechargeable toothbrush at a low cost, and after reading so many positive reviews I purchased the oral-b vitality floss action.</li>
            <li> My husband is a HUGE fan of the timer, however I tend to stop and restart several times in my ritual</li>
            <li> Battery power is great; I can take it on a short (few days) trip without needing to take the charger with me.</li>
            <li> A great improvement over my last few that I have used.  </li>
            <li> and im used to it, my teeth have gotten much whiter as well.</li>
            <li> My teeth are whiter and my breath is fresher (too much info, I know).</li>
            <li> does the job without fanfare (timers, etc) and functions very well.  </li>
            <li> The replacement heads are reasonably price.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this because I am living away from my primary rechargeable toothbrush for several months</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much.  </li>
            <li> Reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> It seems like there should be a light that glows different colors.</li>
            <li> Except that the replacement heads are much cheaper.</li>
            <li> If I were truly intense about dental&lt;</li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> brush head is gentle yet</li>
            <li> with a gentle reminder from the device,&lt;br /&gt;which is when the unit starts to have an intermittent slowing motion.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used this brand for over 20 years and never had a real problem with any brush I bought.</li>
            <li> You really do feel like you&#x27;re come from the dentist after using this.  </li>
            <li> - Reasonable price for replacement heads (about $15 for 3).</li>
            <li> - There is no indicator light to let you know when the brush is fully charged or even to let you know when the charge is low.    </li>
            <li> This really cleans teeth well.  </li>
            <li> I really like the two minute timer feature</li>
            <li> following Oral B brush heads will fit this model:&lt;br /&gt;1.  </li>
            <li> following Oral B brush heads will fit this model:&lt;br /&gt;1.  </li>
            <li> Really.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is that it does not have a light indicating whether it is charging or not....</li>
            <li> It was too much to continue switching out brushes.  </li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> You really can.  </li>
            <li> really don&#x27;t like getting ripped off.</li>
            <li> When you brush you keep the mouth semi-closed and the brush in contact with your teeth at the border with your gums, without pushing too much.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush</li>
            <li> and it still works for him very well.</li>
            <li> Plus it arrived so fast..</li>
            <li> it cleans very well.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really feel like I needed one</li>
            <li> teeth feel much cleaner than they did when brushing with this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> you should really give this one a try.  </li>
            <li> I really like the two minute timer, and I feel that my teeth have been cleaner since switching to this brush.</li>
            <li> - wiping my rear with the $20 bill I spent for this thing would have been a much better investment.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it at the time, but it was actually still covered under a 2-yr warranty, so maybe I could have gotten a free replacement, I</li>
            <li> The only thing is that it takes more than 2 minutes for what i call complete cleaning.</li>
            <li> Does not seem to be as powerful (fast) as our old handle.  </li>
            <li> Some other bonus items I liked about this product: came with 2 brush heads, so won&#x27;t need to replace heads for at least 6 months; also liked the 2 minute timer alert, but not shutting off</li>
            <li> I was trying to be cheap and bought generic ones and they are not the same at all, they dont really seem to clean your teeth at all.  </li>
            <li> Before this, I&#x27;ve used a variety of regular toothbrushes and spent a lot of money on the latest toothpastes but my teeth didn&#x27;t feel completely clean unless I went for a cleaning at the dentist.</li>
            <li> Over the past couple weeks, I realized that my gums were becoming more irritated, so I am not sure that it works better in practice.</li>
            <li> I feel like it is really getting my teeth clean in a short time.  </li>
            <li> Finally, the original battery wore out as I was having to charge it almost daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Supposedly most of the other oral-b heads are interchangeable, but I haven&#x27;t tried that yet.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what you need the other speed for...and for 30$-40$ more than the price of the Vitality.</li>
            <li> Not sure it&#x27;s safe anymore?!</li>
            <li> On my second one now since the original one quit working for some reason.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my gum and cause the pain like other traditional toothbrushes do when pressing close to my gum to clean more thoroughly.</li>
            <li> Previously, I never spent more than $5 max for a toothbrush because \\&quot;they all do the same thing\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> But there&#x27;s a big difference in how clean your mouth will feel after using one of these for a week.</li>
            <li> The FlossAction head is slightly larger in size than the brush-head I used before (the Precision Clean).  </li>
            <li> I tried the precision clean heads after using the heads the unit shipped with above.  </li>
            <li> But if you want to have something little more delicate, I recommend you to buy the ones with a little more soft brush and more sophisticated functions.</li>
            <li> Rotary action cleans teeth and easily reaches the back of the mouth and backs of the teeth where you normally don&#x27;t brush very well.</li>
            <li> It still works fine and holds a charge for a very long time.</li>
            <li> and my only real gripe with it is that it doesn&#x27;t have a charging indicator light like my old brush.</li>
            <li> They probably could be cheaper looking at the simplicity of manufacture, but since they compete with a full toothbrush you&#x27;ll pay about the same.  </li>
            <li> (the head is smaller than a standard toothbrush) and I was able to clean the teeth all of the way in the back of my mouth with no problems.  </li>
            <li> And surprisingly, the little \\&quot;rubber pieces\\&quot; that act as \\&quot;floss action\\&quot; actually does feel like the dentist cleaning my teeth and my teeth and gums</li>
            <li> I was due to buy more refills, &amp; decided I would rather buy a new set of power brush.  </li>
            <li> Gets to, and does a great job cleaning, places that are hard to reach with a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It was delivered very timely and in new packaging.</li>
            <li> This one highlights \\&quot;floss action\\&quot; and it gets the job done even better than previous models.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s relatively quiet and the flossing action head really gets your teeth clean.  </li>
            <li> Such a fresh clean feeling, gets the job done, and i think I&#x27;ve only charged it once overnight</li>
            <li> I like this product for the price, but more expensive electric toothbrushes do work better.     </li>
            <li> Replaced an older Oral \\&quot;B\\&quot; with this, and found it to be satisfactory.  </li>
            <li> It is a decent brush</li>
            <li> dentist bothered me again during my most check-up this August, and I finally started using this electric toothbrush, and the difference between this and a regular Oral B toothbrush is night and day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The extra head it comes with is a plus too, and the timer helps, though if you have a big mouth like mine, you may need more than 2 minutes to brush.</li>
            <li> The charge last 3 - 4 weeks and the recharge is quick.</li>
            <li> But hubby thinks his teeth feels cleaner after using it, and he&#x27;s actually been flossing every night since he got it to, so it&#x27;s definitely helped in many ways.</li>
            <li> (The manufacturer&#x27;s web site has complete information on which brush heads fit the different models.)  </li>
            <li> particularly like the fact that it&#x27;s served me well all these years, and the two minute timer.</li>
            <li> This unit lasts for a few brushes still having fairly good power left and so does not require a recharge every day.</li>
            <li> Typical electric toothbrushes cost more than 2-3 times this one and they do not clean any better.  </li>
            <li> I held out for a long time in buying an electric toothbrush, wondering whether it would really make a difference, but I&#x27;m glad I finally did.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for anyone wanting a low-cost electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Sure this one does not have extra features like digital timer, 30 sec notifier, charging light indicator, etc, etc.</li>
            <li> If you have a unit that&#x27;s compatible with this replacement I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECCOMEND</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this toothbrush &amp; brush-head combination.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think my teeth have felt this clean in a long time.</li>
            <li> Maybe even better due to the flossing action of the brush head(s) that come with this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now switched to the extra sensitive brush&lt;br /&gt;heads, which seem gentler on my gums and still get my teeth just as clean.  </li>
            <li> It has only one speed which is fine because why do you really want alternate speeds?</li>
            <li> This takes the older and current heads and zips right along.</li>
            <li> I was wrong -- this one works great.</li>
            <li> I notice I don&#x27;t put near as much pressure on my teeth and gums as I used to.</li>
            <li> I would advise the sensitive brush if you tend to use too much pressure when brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that the sensitive brushes are often sold by subscription, another marketing strategy I do not like.</li>
            <li> That being said, I am pleasantly surprised by how much I like this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush itself is a great deal, though the replacement heads can be expensive.  </li>
            <li> You know how the dentist tells you to brush in circles, but almost nobody ever does that because a normal toothbrush is not designed that way?  </li>
            <li> does a good job of getting the gum line towards the back of my (small) mouth.  </li>
            <li> With this brush, my teeth are sparkling white and fresh.</li>
            <li> The timer helps me continue to brush when I might have normally stopped.</li>
            <li> and it would work well enough when the batteries were fresh.  </li>
            <li> We have a Sonicare unit that we normally use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned Oral B electric toothbrushes for over 20 years and you van count on them to last a long time and to be at the cusp of the latest technology with each new role-out.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s easy enough to take a rubber band and reduce the cord to the necessary length.</li>
            <li> have also used several different toothbrush heads with the Vitality, but the Floss Action brush is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth inside and this new brush fits a little more snugly inside my mouth, but on the plus side, this one holds slightly more</li>
            <li> My other was so worn out and this new one is fabulous.</li>
            <li> I wonder if they have a new manufacturer.</li>
            <li> We have had our Oral-B tooth brush for over 10 years and it just bit the dust 2 weeks ago, so I was on the hunt for a new tooth brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was new in box.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> They work out to about the price of a new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I should not have gotten rid of it before trying out my new one though, which broke almost immediately.  </li>
            <li> Now, I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> so I got a new one.  </li>
            <li> No indicator for battery life - It is designed with the expectation that most people will leave it plugged in all the time, but I prefer to run my batteries down between charges and I didn&#x27;t get much warning when it quit in the middle of a brush one night.    </li>
            <li> As it is, the only way to know the toothbrush is when the charging stand turns warm after a few hours plugged in.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;m a big dude), but I liked the idea of the circular action, and I wanted to spend less than 50 bucks on an upgrade, so I gave it a shot.  </li>
            <li> it hurt at first (definitely had to get used to the increased sensation vs. a normal brush)</li>
            <li> Simply the best that my meager income can manage...</li>
            <li> This product is comparable to my high end professional series model.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I felt like my teeth were very clean, except along the gum line where I was hesitant to direct the Oral-b brush since it&#x27;s a little harsher than my Sonicare</li>
            <li> This is my second Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush but first of this model.  </li>
            <li> After the first use I not only felt the difference, but could see it too.  </li>
            <li> I was totally sold on this toothbrush after the first use.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd brush but the first one made in Mexico.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve tried many other toothbrushes, but this one definitely gets the job done and is one I&#x27;d recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Out of the box, you have to charge it 16 hours before your first initial use.</li>
            <li> If and when it ever wears out or breaks, I will purchase the same exact product again.</li>
            <li> I was sceptical at first because of the mixed reviews i read</li>
            <li> First of all the overall price.</li>
            <li> From the first charge (which took only about 8 hours, as opposed to the 16</li>
            <li> Bought for my 8 year old and she loves it!</li>
            <li> What I do know is that my mouth feels extra EXTRA clean after it&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> like my old toothbrush, manifestly lack the power I had when new.)</li>
            <li> So, at some point, the batteries will get old and you&#x27;ll need to buy a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> Like the fact that replaceable brushes are readily available for it and are long lasting.</li>
            <li> everyday use this easy to brush my teeth</li>
            <li> I went to Consumer&lt;br /&gt;Reports, and the ones they really liked were pretty expensive, so I</li>
            <li> So try floss action first, others later if unsatisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Refills.</li>
            <li> I got it, charged it up for a full 16 hours just like the tiny instructions said to do, and it didn&#x27;t even operate for a second - no movement, no noise, no nothing.  </li>
            <li> This leaves my teeth so clean, I&#x27;m not sure how much cleaner a more expensive brush would even get my teeth, so this is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> The Oral-B toothbrush is powerful and works a longtime on a single charge.</li>
            <li> Even when I floss afterwards, it&#x27;s very little left (and mostly in my teeth that are very close</li>
            <li> My dentist suggested me this due to some dental issues and it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the new Oral B power toothbrush for several weeks now and much to my surprise</li>
            <li> I have almost always used less expensive electric tooth brushes, and this is among the best I have tried before.</li>
            <li> After using manual toothbrushes for our entire lives, my husband and I were very surprised how much cleaner our teeth felt.  </li>
            <li> This brush is far better than my previous one, to the point that I have to order a second one since my wife already stole mine for herself!    </li>
            <li> I had been using traditional toothbrushes which also had heads that seemed too large for my mouth.     </li>
            <li> I find the price very reasonable as long as the battery keeps working.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had read both positive and negative reviews for this Oral-b Vitality Floss Action toothbrush and decided to give it a shot because it was a different cleaning action than the sonic style, and the price seemed much more affordable (~$25).  </li>
            <li> This brush is fantastic, the Floss Action head can be a little aggressive</li>
            <li> head&lt;br /&gt;-Bristles rotate and get in between teeth fairly well, but seem a little harsh along the gum line</li>
            <li> These brushes are much softer, and should arrive as a set like this to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I do like this toothbrush, but only in conjunction with Braun&#x27;s sensitive toothbrush heads.  </li>
            <li> I clean it regularly with rubbing alcohol, soap &amp; water, and keep it dry, as well as changing the brush heads routinely, but nothing seems to stop the odor from happening.</li>
            <li> So, I decided to try the Oral-b Vitality Floss Action toothbrush.    </li>
            <li> Also, if you have sensitive teeth or gums, forget it.  </li>
            <li> However, I do not like the fact that I have to recharge the brush so frequently.</li>
            <li> Another point:  Buy replacement brush-heads from Amazon - much cheaper than local drug store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the higher-end Oral-B professional unit, and I notice almost no difference with results between the two brushes.</li>
            <li> I received the head that has floss action and I&#x27;m planning to try a couple of the others.</li>
            <li> wow when u put it in your mouth.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my 6+ year old one that I bought in the UK.</li>
            <li> My teeth can be occasionally sensitive, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems with sensitivity with the brush even though it has a lot of power.</li>
            <li> I have had no problems with it so far.</li>
            <li> B0001WXTRI Crest SpinBrush Pro, Soft Bristles (Colors May Vary)]]</li>
            <li> This tooth brush is very simular, only with out the sterilizer.</li>
            <li> did switch to the sensitive head</li>
            <li> Of all things my granddaughter (8yrs old) wanted this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> printed near the on/off switch, however.  </li>
            <li> I do have to use my old toothbrush to scrub my tongue, though, because this brush doesn&#x27;t do the job.  </li>
            <li> She tells all her clients to throw away the floss head and use the sensitive brush ...\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Product completely stopped working after 2 months.</li>
            <li> The savings can be considerable.</li>
            <li> Sonicare brush/bristles have a plastic cover for when toothbrush is not in use; Oral-b just stays exposed when not in use, much like a regular toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;-The</li>
            <li> (and I have sensitive gums already).</li>
            <li> Which I am attributing to the floss action head that we are using with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know why it says Floss action. ??</li>
            <li> Do you really need a digital timer (this one vibrates when you&#x27;re done)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (The brush comes with 2 floss action heads)    </li>
            <li> - Complete Charge takes 16 hours and this lets the brush run for about 1 week (assuming you use it for 2 minutes twice a day).  </li>
            <li> like I&#x27;ve just been to the dentist for a professional cleaning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My old Oral B did not have this, and it was slippery to hold</li>
            <li> Almost feels like a professional teeth-cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I nearly cut myself twice.  </li>
            <li> Sensitive</li>
            <li> Sensitive</li>
            <li> The unit itself is intuitive, simple to use, and works really well.  </li>
            <li> My sensitive teeth handle the brushing action without any pain.  </li>
            <li> and no issues so far.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be holding up so far (1 month).  </li>
            <li> The floss action feels like it cleans around the gum well, but does not replace flossing.  </li>
            <li> It comes with two oval Floss Action brush heads.  </li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> the &#x27;professional&#x27; one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been old school and use a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I always felt that my toothbrush couldn&#x27;t ever reach that far</li>
            <li> So far I have had no problems with it.</li>
            <li> you like your old manual toothbrush</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an old toothbrush.</li>
            <li> but I suggest getting the sensitive heads.</li>
            <li> and I like it so far.</li>
            <li> I bought this device for the so called floss action but it doesn&#x27;t have any.</li>
            <li> Definitely spend a few bucks more to get this product.</li>
            <li> You get the same high-quality head (plus a refill) that is featured in higher priced Oral-b models, but it&#x27;s attached to a bare bones but fully functional handle that keeps it priced at about the cost of 3 disposable electrics.    </li>
            <li> I was skeptical because of the lower price, but it feels so much more powerful than the others.  </li>
            <li> Nice to know if I go on a business trip and leave the charger behind.    </li>
            <li> Your teeth really do feel much cleaner and it takes much less time than a normal toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The small, rotating head easily gets to the gum line of even the rear teeth.  </li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush (Oral-B Vitality Floss Action Rechargeable Power Toothbrush, Blue and White).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a more expensive Oral-B mechanical toothbrush for many years now, but that one is wearing down, so</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s noisier and rougher (compared to the subtle \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; movement of the sonicare), and has more moving parts.</li>
            <li> Since it has the two minute timer built in, it was very simple to see the clean feeling of one over the other.  </li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this tooth</li>
            <li> Plainly put,the toothbrush delivered an efficient clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Their is a timer that after 2 minutes it stops briefly then keeps on going and repeats this cycle 2 or 3 times and then just keepes moving like normal</li>
            <li> It reaches in some of the problem areas...behind the very back teeth and really can get in there and scrub behind the front bottom and top.  </li>
            <li> The head of the Oral-b is only 1/2 to 1/3 the size of a manual toothbrush, and I always brush my entire tongue as the last part of \\&quot;tooth\\&quot; brushing to get that minty, fresh taste.  </li>
            <li> I spent hours looking for a review that told me this exact info</li>
            <li> this never worked, despite my trying twice to charge it using two different outlets in my home that normally work with no problem.  </li>
            <li> I figured a rechargeable toothbrush lasting 6-7 years (replacing the heads of course) was normal.  </li>
            <li> But it rather quickly would be less and less powerful as the batteries drained.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyhow, the only thing I don&#x27;t like about this brush, and it&#x27;s enough to make me consider using a different brush, is that they inserted these hard pieces of plastic in with the soft hairs, and it kind of rasps on your gums.  </li>
            <li> Had to get a new one after my cat knocked over my old brush &amp; it fell into the toilet.</li>
            <li> Oral-B electric toothbrushes are available with wide a range of features and at a wide range of prices, but I found that the low-cost Vitality serves me well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking at the more expensive electric toothbrushes -- Sonicare, and higher end Oral-b -- for quite some time, but could never pull the trigger when for the same price, I can practically buy a lifetime supply of manual toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> I deducted half a star because there is no indicator light telling you the battery status, though this is a minor issue.</li>
            <li> The size of the brush head is a little larger than the precision clean.</li>
            <li> toothbrush tips are easy to change so everyone in the family can have their own while using the same base.  </li>
            <li> There is no warning indicator light for low battery or a timer warning you  how long you have flossed/brushed in an area of your mouth which I have had on other simular products.</li>
            <li> Also since using it, and  using it almost exclusively during same 3-4 years, have had at least 50% less plaque/tartar deposits for my dentist&#x27;s office to clean at my regular semi-annual check-ups--a fact much appreciated by same professionals and one that more than one dental hygienist has noted on countless patients who regularly use such brushes.  </li>
            <li> I think this is important because it means you don&#x27;t have too press hard.  </li>
            <li> Thought I could get a sonicare like my sis, but it was so much more expensive and seems to be a bit high maintenance.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for people who are just starting out and then upgrade later OR just keep buying this because I know I would.  &#x3D;DDDD</li>
            <li> The base and brushes connect with metal parts that feel very secure and strong.  </li>
            <li> Users will see a clear difference within the first few brushings.    </li>
            <li> The one that has a polishing action similar to the one the dental hygienist uses looks intriguing.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Vitality Floss Action Rechargeable Power Toothbrush is relatively inexpensive, and, from my perspective, is all the toothbrush I need.</li>
            <li> I just got this toothbrush to replace my old one of a similar style that held up for about 4 years.</li>
            <li> It continues working after the two minute timer (apparently others don&#x27;t, which I read in reviews).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised its priced so low!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Added later: The sensitive brush head is circular and removes the jackhammer effect.</li>
            <li> /&gt;\\&quot;I was picking up some items from my dentist&#x27;s office yesterday and noticed that she had the Oral-B ... Toothbrush on her counter as a recommended item and that it had the same woodchuck action floss head as this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised to see all the very recent reviews that say it doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> My eight-year old model 900TX finally rusted out inside and started misbehaving, so I replaced it with this one.</li>
            <li> Needed a replacement while hospitalized as my old one was lost in transit to physical rehab.  </li>
            <li> I feel like it really gets into all of the harder to reach areas</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know if another would be better or worse than this one.</li>
            <li> Vitality model is a less expensive model than my Professional Oral B, but it seems to be just as good as far as cleaning my teeth.  </li>
            <li> If you check my other reviews, you&#x27;ll notice that I almost never give a 5-star rating, so consider this 4-star rating very high praise indeed.</li>
            <li> And this toothbrush will be a huge boon to anyone with grip or motor skill impairments since it&#x27;s practically effortless to simply move from tooth to tooth, leaving all the hard work to the electric motor.  </li>
            <li> The handle is bare bones, but you get what you need: 1) a powerful motor that loses no steam before you&#x27;re done brushing; 2) an inductive charging system which means there are no exposed electrical contacts that you need to keep dry; and 3) a timer which notifies you via a slight stutter in the motor action that 2-minutes has elapsed -- this helps you to pace how quickly to move the brush from quadrant to quadrant within your mouth.      </li>
            <li> The brush heads are much more complex: the rotating center and \\&quot;floss action\\</li>
            <li> I finally had to give the old Braun toothbrush a proper burial.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are sensitive and it&#x27;s not an exaggeration to say that every teeth-brushing experience in my life has been tinged with a discomfort that is totally absent with this toothbrush, even though it has such an aggressive feel.  </li>
            <li> It gives an extra level of cleaning, especially at the gum line, that my old Oral-B battery operated brush did not provide.  </li>
            <li> the floss action is nice because it has a small head, which makes it easier to get to the hard to reach back molars.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money on other brands - this does a fantastic job cleaning your teeth.</li>
            <li> So apparently the head does not last longer than 1.5 months.</li>
            <li> This works very similarly to the more expensive Bruan/Oral B professional series and has the luxury of being rechargeable and can theoretically last years.</li>
            <li> the first one I bought is broken in 2 days but the replacement is really convenient</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth at the gum line and my dentist said that the \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; action irritates the sensitivity and to use only once a day (use regular toothbrush on other brushings).  </li>
            <li> This Oral -B is small enough to reach behind my molars without hurting my mouth and has enough of a brush surface to do a good job of cleaning my teeth and massaging my gums.  </li>
            <li> large or heavy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;My only gripe (and it&#x27;s so minor that I&#x27;m still giving this item five stars) is that it&#x27;s hard to clean the charger</li>
            <li> and I miss that little green light telling me it is sitting correctly.</li>
            <li> However, this is a powerful little toothbrush - at least it gives you the impression you are really getting your teeth cleaned.</li>
            <li> The small head makes it easy to get into tight spaces in the mouth (especially crowded teeth) and to focus on each tooth.  </li>
            <li> So I spent about 40 minutes at the grocery store agonizing over my choice, and finally picked the Vitality due to its reasonable cost and the included replacement head.</li>
            <li> * Variety of replaceable heads - currently using the Vitality Floss Action but like the availability of other styles  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush a little louder than I expected, but remember this is my first power toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive gums, you might want this model but with other heads.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how other professional brushes compare to this one.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for the exact same model, which finally expired after at least 12 years, but I think it may have been 15+.  </li>
            <li> The motor is stronger than the previous one was when it was new.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing I have is that the new stand for it is not as sturdy as the old one</li>
            <li> The toothbrush really packs a punch for such a small head.  </li>
            <li> I like the small brush head and can really feel the bristles working deep in the grooves and crevices of my teeth.</li>
            <li> Now we don&#x27;t have to wonder if we&#x27;ve brushed long enough!</li>
            <li> I definitely wouldn&#x27;t count 120 seconds (I&#x27;ve never ever ever in my life brushed for that long).</li>
            <li> The battery seems to last forever - I stopped putting it on the charger to see how long it would last</li>
            <li> No more trying to shove a large brush head into my cheek just to get some contact with my molars.    </li>
            <li> Two weeks of use and now I have to charge it daily just to get enough time for a single brushing.</li>
            <li> so you know it&#x27;s likely been long enough&lt;</li>
            <li> Unless you have a timer, you are not brushing your teeth long enough.  </li>
            <li> Unless you have a timer, you are not brushing your teeth long enough.</li>
            <li> I waited so long to open it</li>
            <li> charging&#x27;s last a long time.  </li>
            <li> This was a replacement for one whose motor eventually turned down to near manual power.</li>
            <li> I like using electric toothbrushes because I have forearm and elbow pain from the manual tooth brushing up and down action.</li>
            <li> all out of shape while getting down near the roots.</li>
            <li> The floss heads are a little rough along the gums, sometimes causing a bit of bleeding if too much pressure and time is put to the gum areas.</li>
            <li> Hopefully it&#x27;ll last long!</li>
            <li> I have had it a few years now, and it still works as if new.</li>
            <li> If you are using to using a medium or hard brush, this will probably feel quite good to you, but I&#x27;m strictly a \\&quot;soft brush\\&quot; guy, so it is an unpleasant sensation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still think that this product accomplishes much more than a conventional toothbrush and that in the end it does not turn out to be as expensive when compared to how long these refills last.</li>
            <li> For someone who won&#x27;t use all the fancy features of an expensive rechargeable, this does a fine job of both cleaning your teeth and massaging your gums.</li>
            <li> So, depending on your bathroom sink area and outlet setup, you may run into the same problem I did, of the cord crossing the entire sink and getting in the way of the other things on the surface.</li>
            <li> I looked into other (more expensive) brands and decided to give this a try based on the reviews.</li>
            <li> only complaint I have with this toothbrush is that with the smaller head size I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m getting enough toothpaste on the first application, I have to usually add a second dab on my toothbrush to get the amount that I like to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Complain girlishly all you like, but this here new-fangled electronic toothbrush will leave your little yellowing enamel whiners looking and feeling like you&#x27;ve just had a professional cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I still may switch to the sensitive heads, though, as my gums feel a little worn after brushing.</li>
            <li> Floss Action beats the other hands down; for not only a cleaner feeling, but for getting in there without feeling like it&#x27;s going to hurt you.  </li>
            <li> It has been lasting an average of 10 days in between charges and with only 1 a day usage.  </li>
            <li> One simply has to be careful to not over-brush the gum line and all will be well with the rest of the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not saying to buy this toothbrush as an excuse to not floss,</li>
            <li> One thing to note, however, is that this toothbrush has a fairly long cord.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> However, I would not advise keeping it a long time.</li>
            <li> What a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> The floss action heads that came with this model may be a littler harsh for some, but don&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
            <li> My spare round Sensitive brush heads also work.</li>
            <li> However, within two days of using it, it began to leak grey water...</li>
            <li> I really liked how it brushed my teeth, but it couldn&#x27;t seem to hold a charge :(</li>
            <li> I will see if by using this new brush I can avoid having to have deep cleaning at least once a year.</li>
            <li> Only negative is that there is no low battery warning so it will die in the middle of a brushing episode if you don&#x27;t regularly plug in the charger-stand.</li>
            <li> have only been using this for about two weeks and have had no battery, or any other issues at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The charging stand is stable when charging yet compact enough and the plug is small enough to not get in the way - the plug is a standard plug not a transformer.  </li>
            <li> I have never used an electronic toothbrush before, so I can&#x27;t compare this one to other similar products.  </li>
            <li> when i finally went, the results were not pretty.</li>
            <li> I charge it only every other night.   </li>
            <li> The whole idea of paying the asking price just to remove the arduous task of moving your hand back and forth to drag an old-school toothbrush across your teeth manually may be as ridiculous to you as it is to me, but in this case I can really feel the difference.  </li>
            <li> A charge really does hold for several days, so one could just leave the charger behind for brief&lt;br /&gt;business or weekend trips.  </li>
            <li> Secondly, this model can be used with a few different brush attachments.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Rinse the bristles thoroughly when done, give a few shakes and perhaps even turn it on briefly in the sink (to shake off the water) before placing back on the charger.</li>
            <li> Rinse the bristles thoroughly when done, give a few shakes and perhaps even turn it on briefly in the sink (to shake off the water) before placing back on the charger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d use it three times, and then it would be dead and I&#x27;d recharge it for 24 hrs, but then it would only hold enough charge for using it two times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &quot; designation is of any particular value, but am neither excited or disappointed.</li>
            <li> It gets deep down into the gum.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m afraid my dentist will smack me upside the head or get a little too enthusiastic with one of those sharp torture instruments they are so fond of using if she finds I haven&#x27;t been using bits of string to fiddle in between my teeth because I fell for a toothbrush advert.  </li>
            <li> The small round brush of the Oral-B Vitality can get into hard-to-reach areas and to hard-to-reach surfaces that the large brush on the Sonicare couldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This is my second oral B electric toothbrush as my other one was at least 10 years old &amp; just gave out on power.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lasted an amazingly long time; the battery has just recently started having trouble keeping a charge.</li>
            <li> First off, this thing is crazy loud.  </li>
            <li> I have used a combination of regular toothbrush, Rota-Dent, and Waterpik for the past several years</li>
            <li> With these two serious problems, as to this power toothbrush model, I may not trust this brand anymore, unless they could provide me evidences to prove their high quality of their products.     </li>
            <li> Oh, btw, when it comes time to replace the brush on these little jewels try to buy same replacement from your dentist office.  </li>
            <li> only complaint is that there&#x27;s no way to tell when the power handle is charging, when it&#x27;s fully charged or when the charge is low.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on the alleged \\&quot;flossing action\\&quot; since I still floss</li>
            <li> Not too rough, but you know that something is happening.</li>
            <li> I alternate with my round brush head.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t   have it slipping from your hand.</li>
            <li> She was using mom&#x27;s base with her own brush head but wanted a unit for herself.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush has floss action in it , which mean it get&#x27;s between your teeth and get out food and plaque.</li>
            <li> Not certain the \\&quot;Floss\\</li>
            <li> If this toothbrush is anything like my previous Oral B purchases, it will be with me for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I read all review before buying this product, had a colgate spin brush before, didnt last a year before going dead, this product is a blast, like all other reviews u will say</li>
            <li> As long as you hit all the spots slowly and methodically, your teeth are going to be white.  </li>
            <li> (One small issue wroth noting: all the included tooth brush heads look the same.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t afford to spend a million dollars on some of the other electric brushes with the *fancy* features.</li>
            <li> again, as other have noted, it does irritate the gum line.</li>
            <li> After brushing with this, my teeth get that slick, super-clean feeling that you don&#x27;t always get with a regular brush.   </li>
            <li> for the past several years.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> a big box, just a small recharger.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like I said, we have never used an electric one before, so this is not a comparison of other electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> Maybe other brush heads may, I&#x27;ll try other kinds when its time to change out the head.  </li>
            <li> Will be purchasing another one for my other kid and myself.</li>
            <li> I tried Crest Spin Brush,and had to change batteries every other week.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush is quiet and well-sized for small mouths.</li>
            <li> I should have heeded the other review warnings and not ordered it, but I thought \\&quot;what are the odds of me getting a dud</li>
            <li> and I would recommend it to other people.</li>
            <li> I have to charge it every other day or so.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> After using other cheaper electric tooth brush units I decided to try this one.  </li>
            <li> The head is small enough to get around every tooth.  </li>
            <li> It is like a woodcutter (as one other reviwer put it, although maybe he said, \\&quot;Chomper&#x27;).</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it the way the directions say and every other way</li>
            <li> I thought that if I ended up with a \\&quot;bad egg\\&quot; toothbrush, Amazon would replace easily (as stated in some reviews I read).  </li>
            <li> Although I was skeptical, I purchased this battery-powered tooth brush and, to my surprise, I saw positive results almost immediately.</li>
            <li> After some 3 years of honorable service, my former Oral-B Vitality Floss Action Rechargeable Power Toothbrush had become old, tired and feeble.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used manual brushes, until my hygienist told me my gums were receding from my brushing too hard (which I definitely did) and that an electric toothbrush would help with this.</li>
            <li> The floss heads caused some pretty bad gum inflammation by my back molars</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m never sure when to recharge -- although it seems like you can go a long time (a week or so?) between charges.</li>
            <li> Sounds simple, but you&#x27;re going to do this at least once.  </li>
            <li> The negative reviews I read seemed like they were isolated instances of the toothbrush going out shortly after purchase, and was not the \\&quot;norm.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> So you don&#x27;t really need an expensive one.</li>
            <li> To avoid/slow down this process, I try to recharge it only when the brush head vibrates really slow and unplug it after an overnight recharging.</li>
            <li> One issue:  instructions call for running it down before recharging.  </li>
            <li> Since brushing with an up and down movement can wear off the enamel (as told by my dentist), the Oral-B toothbrush uses oscillating and rotating movement which dentists prefer.  </li>
            <li> I feel it&#x27;s cleaning my teeth down to a micro-level</li>
            <li> $27 down the tubes.  </li>
            <li> I did not do this with previous version and had no problems</li>
            <li> This is a total disappointment to me, the brush has no flossing action whatsoever, I still have to floss after using it.</li>
            <li> Previously I had both Sonic care and Rotadent electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> The Amazon service on this order was typically beyond reproach.</li>
            <li> Mouth feels cleaner after this brush than with my previous spinbrush    </li>
            <li> This time my hygienist broke down&lt;br /&gt;and recommended the Vitality, which I found for less than $30.  </li>
            <li> I had a previous model but the speed of this is way faster...</li>
            <li> This unit replaced a previous Oral-B that from three years ago (the \\&quot;Advance\\&quot; model?).</li>
            <li> It does not have the power controls of the previous models, nor does it have the timer function that lets you know when it&#x27;s time to move to another part of your mouth.</li>
            <li> The heads have an indicator to let you know when they need to be changed (typically every 3 months).    </li>
            <li> It was a replacement for our previous oral-b.</li>
            <li> Bought this brush to replace a previous Oral B.  </li>
            <li> but it quit working in less than 3 months.</li>
            <li> This one is less than $30 and works well, holds a charge for quite awhile and has a timer.</li>
            <li> My gums were bleeding and slightly tender.    </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I think the Sonicare experience set the bar too high and the Oral-b toothbrush did not meet my expectations.&lt;br</li>
            <li> instructions were a bit confusing, and there was no clear</li>
            <li> - The brush can make a mess and splatter toothpaste if you turn the brush on before putting it in your mouth       </li>
            <li> I have been challenged with reaching behind my back molars, due to the size of brush heads.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are extremely tight and flossing causes bleeding and swelling of my gums.  </li>
            <li> I did read some reviews that said the heads wrer a little large, I have a small mouth and while the heads are thicker than a manual brush it was by no means unmanageable or uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> It charges easy and since the charger is the base, that is the intuitive parking place.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got to admit that this little oral power tool does a hell of a job cleaning teeth.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to, but it&#x27;s a step towards healthier oral care if you don&#x27;t already use an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> the tooth brush head has little flossers in it.</li>
            <li> I think you&#x27;ll find that your teeth feel cleaner and your mouth a little bit fresher every time you brush.</li>
            <li> I sent the second one back as well, and now I&#x27;m back to using my manual brush :(</li>
            <li> Now I still use the old one and the girlfriend uses the new one and we share the base charger.</li>
            <li> But if you happen to be like me -- impatient and erratic -- then this electric toothbrush is a godsend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;One should keep in mind that the replacement heads for these toothbrushes is not cheap.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have any problems with it being too harsh.  </li>
            <li> It has vigorous cleaning action for your teeth without the uncomfortable roughness.</li>
            <li> do wish this had a charging light, with seeing that gives me comfort that it is meeting the contacts on the base</li>
            <li> so I saved a few bucks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a small inconvenience - one not worth $100</li>
            <li> approximately $6 USD, for replacement brushes for my model while our local dept. stores charge anywhere from about $17-23 USD.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that you need to be vigilant in cleaning and drying the sucker or water can collect at the recharging base and create a pretty unpleasant-smelling little science project down there, but otherwise there&#x27;s not a lot to complain about.  </li>
            <li> The head of the toothbrush is a bit stiff compared to Rota-Dent but the curved shape</li>
            <li> They were both very expensive (more than $100 each) and the replacement heads were expensive too.  </li>
            <li> 1- The heads are small and round like the dentist&#x27;s equipment.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband who has a hard time flossing, because spaces between his teeth are so tight.</li>
            <li> The only down side is that it only lasts about 4 days off the charger, so if you are going on a longer trip you would have to bring the base with.  </li>
            <li> That sucker is tightly wedged in there.  </li>
            <li> I give the Oral-B Braun lots of stars for ease of use, dependability and it gets in to those hard to reach places with the small round head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why.  </li>
            <li> It also has a small footprint so it leaves plenty of space on the countertop.  </li>
            <li> For the past five years, I have been using the Sonicare electric tooth brush with the built in sterilizer.</li>
            <li> I thought the brush head would be too small</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel small, though, when it&#x27;s running.  </li>
            <li> The bells and whistles that often fail are not present.  </li>
            <li> so I am not sure that Amazon will refund my money</li>
            <li> The brush head is so big and uncomfortable in your mouth</li>
            <li> It also holds it&#x27;s charge for a few days at a time!</li>
            <li> In comparison with the Sonicare unit, this one feels very harsh.</li>
            <li> The handle is much larger than I like on a toothbrush, and the base should be regularly cleaned for sanitary reasons as well.</li>
            <li> My dentist advised buying the least expensive toothbrush as they are all very similar.  </li>
            <li> The way I see it, a purchase of less than $30 eliminates at least $116 in annual dental costs and the price goes up every time!</li>
            <li> it is pretty much idiot proof.  </li>
            <li> We first tried to share a base using separate brushes.  </li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush because I have a tendency to brush my teeth too hard.</li>
            <li> hardly any effort from me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the only downside, i wish i could find the refills on amazon as well- from what i read in other reviews, they seem to all be counterfeit. :(</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to get used to.  </li>
            <li> The hard part of the edge keeps running into my teeth.  </li>
            <li> After I broke two of the Sonicare toothbrushes (probably by pressing too hard on them), I bought the Vitality because it was the cheapest electric toothbrush around.</li>
            <li> Then there is the brush itself, MAN this brush head is hard as a rock and beats your teeth into submission.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awkward to share between two people because the different heads look identical.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for at least a week, so I do not have to leave it</li>
            <li> * Negative Points:</li>
            <li> I brush at least 3 times a day, use whitening strips and whitening toothpaste</li>
            <li> Seems like common sense</li>
            <li> Seems like common sense</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist has been recommending the Oral B Vitality to me for at least a couple of years.</li>
            <li> I understand why your teeth get so white with this brush head, the tartar is afraid to attach itself to your teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for at least a year now</li>
            <li> I really like how it charges on a plastic base.  </li>
            <li> 2 min timer  can be confusing and no good if the charge runs out.</li>
            <li> but if you go two weeks before cleaning, you&#x27;ll do a serious &#x27;eew[...]  </li>

            <li> one star out of the five I took away for this review is because the brush has the problem with irritating gums, everything else is fine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing I would change is the design of the base.</li>
            <li> any case, to replace my broken one, I ordered this one.</li>

            <li> Why on earth does it have to be so difficult?</li>
            <li> Rather than buy an expensive replacement head</li>
            <li> The timer is weird and unexplained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like they&#x27;ll go stale in the linen closet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just seemed sort of silly to let the toothbrush do the work for me.  </li>
            <li> Sonicare has a slimmer brush head \\&quot;neck\\&quot; between the bristles and the base/handle; the Oral-b one feels awkward because it&#x27;s thicker</li>
            <li> If you go and spend 50, 75, or 100 bucks for an electric toothbrush, as I see them priced everywhere, you are crazy.</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong!</li>
            <li> Mad.</li>
            <li> The replacements through Oral B are expensive!</li>
            <li> But all in all it doesn&#x27;t feel bad using an electric tooth brush &amp;</li>
            <li> I got this upon realizing I had bad teeth and problems getting debris between the teeth.</li>
            <li> I had an issue with a couple of puffy and painful gum areas when I would floss.  </li>

            <li> charging base is convenient, and the feel of the brush is solid.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It uses inductive charging on the base so there are no contacts on the brush or the base.</li>
            <li> hate visiting my dentist.</li>
            <li> Literally, it&#x27;s a worthless piece of junk that I now have to dispose of</li>

            <li> Very poor product!!!</li>
            <li> but...I hate flossing!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> For the past seven years, I&#x27;ve used a Sonicare Elite toothbrush (like this one: [[ASIN:B003KFCFMI Philips Sonicare Essence HX5752/71 Power Toothbrush Twin Pack (2 Handles, 2 Travel Caps, 2 Chargers, 2 Cases, 2 Brushheads, and 2 Brushhead Holders)]). It&#x27;s lasted an amazingly long time; the battery has just recently started having trouble keeping a charge. (Mechanically, it still works perfectly.) So, I decided to try the Oral-b Vitality Floss Action toothbrush.    Compared to the Sonicare, the Oral-b is quite different. It&#x27;s noisier and rougher (compared to the subtle \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; movement of the sonicare), and has more moving parts. The brush heads are much more complex: the rotating center and \\&quot;floss action\\&quot; rubber points work quite differently as well. At first, it was a nice change; I felt like the new toothbrush was doing a better job cleaning my teeth. Over the past couple weeks, I realized that my gums were becoming more irritated, so I am not sure that it works better in practice. I like this product for the price, but more expensive electric toothbrushes do work better.     (One small issue wroth noting: all the included tooth brush heads look the same. It&#x27;s awkward to share between two people because the different heads look identical. It would be nice to have different colored heads, like Philips provides.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got to admit that this little oral power tool does a hell of a job cleaning teeth.  The whole idea of paying the asking price just to remove the arduous task of moving your hand back and forth to drag an old-school toothbrush across your teeth manually may be as ridiculous to you as it is to me, but in this case I can really feel the difference.  I can&#x27;t comment on the alleged \\&quot;flossing action\\&quot; since I still floss and I&#x27;m afraid my dentist will smack me upside the head or get a little too enthusiastic with one of those sharp torture instruments they are so fond of using if she finds I haven&#x27;t been using bits of string to fiddle in between my teeth because I fell for a toothbrush advert.  The things we do for oral hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yeah, pay no attention to that sensation after the first time you use Oral-B&#x27;s Vitality.  That&#x27;s just your teeth and gums howling like Westley from The Princess Bride being tortured.  Well, your teeth and gums are wimps.  They&#x27;ll get used to it and thank you later.  Complain girlishly all you like, but this here new-fangled electronic toothbrush will leave your little yellowing enamel whiners looking and feeling like you&#x27;ve just had a professional cleaning.  The secret, of course is the much-vaunted circular buffing motion.  You know how the dentist tells you to brush in circles, but almost nobody ever does that because a normal toothbrush is not designed that way?  Problem solved.  Sure, it feels like you just took a belt-sander or a particularly powerful floor buffer to the inside of your mouth, but who can argue with the results?  My only complaint is that you need to be vigilant in cleaning and drying the sucker or water can collect at the recharging base and create a pretty unpleasant-smelling little science project down there, but otherwise there&#x27;s not a lot to complain about.  If you&#x27;ve got the bucks and a hankering for oral hygiene, then you could surely do worse than to invest in Vitality.</li>
            <li> it holds its charge for a week for me, then i charge it overnight, and it is strong as anything the next morning.  it&#x27;s waterproof and worry-free.  i have not tried the floss bristles yet though.  no complaints at all.</li>
            <li> This is my second Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush but first of this model.  I am very pleased with this one so far.  The charge lasts for several days before needing recharging.  The grip section is not too slim so it is a comfortable hold and easy to maneuver; the rubber covering on the handle also means it is not slippery to hold.  I would definitely buy this model again.</li>
            <li> I had an issue with a couple of puffy and painful gum areas when I would floss.  After using this toothbrush, the problem has stopped.  The toothbrush really packs a punch for such a small head.  I love the size because it can get all around your teeth and close to the gumline.  I also love the timer.  Now I know that I was definately not brushing for the full 2 minutes.  This toothbrush save my gums and will probably save me money at the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> I recently had a re-treat root canal doen on a molar, the Endodontist told me to use an electric toothbrush to better clean my teeth, so I purchased this.. When I first used it, I did not like it, felt the plastic was hitting my teeth and I didn&#x27;t think my mouth felt that clean. I did not know you put the toothbrush on only while inside your mouth so the toothpaste doesnt splatter everywhere. So I used it again, my mouth felt clean, it does take some time to get used to this if you never used an electric toothbrush before.. Been using this for 2 weeks now and im used to it, my teeth have gotten much whiter as well. Its pretty amazing</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product. Its easy to use, and does a great clean.   There is no warning indicator light for low battery or a timer warning you  how long you have flossed/brushed in an area of your mouth which I have had on other simular products. It will take time to get use to not having these extras. I found after a few days I dont miss either and it has done a great job on my teeth and gums keeping them clean and healthy. If you are thinking of buying a cheap no frills electric toothbrush then you have found just that! This is the a great model!  Purchase and Enjoy :)</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and was amazed how superbly it does the cleaning. The only thing is that it takes more than 2 minutes for what i call complete cleaning. So apparently the head does not last longer than 1.5 months. Everything else is just great. Good value for a price.</li>
            <li> First off, this thing is crazy loud.  Haven&#x27;t they improved on this over the years?  I&#x27;m still thinking about returning it because the sound is a bit jarring.  Also, if you have sensitive teeth or gums, forget it.  You probably WON&#x27;T like the toothbrush heads that come with this brush.  Thankfully I bought another set of brushes:  Braun&#x27;s \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; toothbrush heads.  These brushes are much softer, and should arrive as a set like this to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I do like this toothbrush, but only in conjunction with Braun&#x27;s sensitive toothbrush heads.  Cleans teeth VERY well! A+</li>
            <li> I bought the product and have been using it for about 3 weeks since July 4th.  I love the clean feeling i get after I brush my teeth.  I hope to get good results when I go back for my dental checkup. Overall, I love the brushing action, after first getting used to the feel of the brush against my teeth and the sound it makes.      However, I do not like the fact that I have to recharge the brush so frequently. I charged it when I received it July 4th weekend.  The battery died like 10 days later and I had to fully charge again.  Yesterday evening, the battery died again.  I thought that you could go a full 2 weeks without having to charge it up.  It has been lasting an average of 10 days in between charges and with only 1 a day usage.  Has anyone had the same issue?</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush ever. Previously, I never spent more than $5 max for a toothbrush because \\&quot;they all do the same thing\\&quot;. Boy was I wrong! I got braces in April of this year (2011) so I had to invest in something that would really clean my teeth. I use this along with the Waterpik. I couldn&#x27;t afford to spend a million dollars on some of the other electric brushes with the *fancy* features. I think this is just as good. My teeth are whiter and my breath is fresher (too much info, I know). But it&#x27;s true. I love the 2 minute timer as well. If this is your first time purchasing an electric toothbrush, this is a great start. I even bought another one to have in my purse!</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush because I have a tendency to brush my teeth too hard. This was damaging my gums. Although I was skeptical, I purchased this battery-powered tooth brush and, to my surprise, I saw positive results almost immediately. Since then, I have been recommending them to everyone.</li>
            <li> I have had an earlier version that finally \\&quot;died\\&quot; after about 5 years.  Replaced it with this one.  Excellent price/performance point - does the job without fanfare (timers, etc) and functions very well.  One issue:  instructions call for running it down before recharging.  I&#x27;m not sure why.  I did not do this with previous version and had no problems so I don&#x27;t expect any with this one.   Another point:  Buy replacement brush-heads from Amazon - much cheaper than local drug store.</li>
            <li> Replaced an older Oral \\&quot;B\\&quot; with this, and found it to be satisfactory.  Not certain the \\&quot;Floss\\&quot; designation is of any particular value, but am neither excited or disappointed.</li>
            <li> Just about as good as going to the dentist hygenist. Rotary action cleans teeth and easily reaches the back of the mouth and backs of the teeth where you normally don&#x27;t brush very well.</li>
            <li> As most reviewers have noted, this is a solid and inexpensive unit that is aptly able to clean a person&#x27;s teeth well. It works for me and I have noticed a difference after a month of usage.&lt;br /&gt;But again, as other have noted, it does irritate the gum line. The floss heads are a little rough along the gums, sometimes causing a bit of bleeding if too much pressure and time is put to the gum areas. One simply has to be careful to not over-brush the gum line and all will be well with the rest of the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;The one star out of the five I took away for this review is because the brush has the problem with irritating gums, everything else is fine.&lt;br /&gt;The charging base is convenient, and the feel of the brush is solid.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product as a budget brush. I&#x27;ve used the higher-end Oral-B professional unit, and I notice almost no difference with results between the two brushes.</li>
            <li> This is a total disappointment to me, the brush has no flossing action whatsoever, I still have to floss after using it. It was the only purpose of buying it as I already had a very good Braun brush. It is a decent brush but again what I expected is flossing action and there is none.</li>
            <li> I hurt myself while trying to open the packaging. I still didn&#x27;t manage to open it. Why on earth does it have to be so difficult?</li>
            <li> After the first use I not only felt the difference, but could see it too.  This brush cleaned deeper between my teeth than my standard brush ever has.  It really was an impressive sight to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not saying to buy this toothbrush as an excuse to not floss, but if you do skip flossing; this brush will do a portion of that job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their is a timer that after 2 minutes it stops briefly then keeps on going and repeats this cycle 2 or 3 times and then just keepes moving like normal so you know it&#x27;s likely been long enough&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only been using this for about two weeks and have had no battery, or any other issues at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me this is a really good toothbrush that lets me get my teeth and gums cleaner than I had been.  I find the price very reasonable as long as the battery keeps working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may in fact save you dentist bills in the future, its that good.</li>
            <li> Previously I had both Sonic care and Rotadent electric toothbrushes.  They were both very expensive (more than $100 each) and the replacement heads were expensive too.  Rather than buy an expensive replacement head I bought this Oral-B Vitality and it has been superb and I am very pleased for the performance and price.  The brush action (back and forth) is fast and powerful leaving my teeth and gums feeling very clean.  The replacement heads are reasonably price.  I recommend this brush since I have been very happy with it.</li>
            <li> My dentist, who is very good, has been bothering me to use this for a couple of years now.  I first bought this a year ago, and it&#x27;s been sitting in my room idle for a variety of reasons.  Indifference.  Inertia.  Suspicion of its efficacy.  Fear of getting electrocuted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist bothered me again during my most check-up this August, and I finally started using this electric toothbrush, and the difference between this and a regular Oral B toothbrush is night and day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, if you&#x27;re an obsessive-compulsive and patient brusher, you probably don&#x27;t need this.  As long as you hit all the spots slowly and methodically, your teeth are going to be white.  But if you happen to be like me -- impatient and erratic -- then this electric toothbrush is a godsend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still need to cut back on the tea and fruit juices though.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Vitality Floss Action Rechargeable is a very good, basic rechargeable toothbrush at a fair price.  I purchased this because I am living away from my primary rechargeable toothbrush for several months and I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much.  The Vitality charges quickly, the charge lasts 1 - 2 weeks using the brush 2 - 3 times a day and it is easy to keep clean.  The charging stand is stable when charging yet compact enough and the plug is small enough to not get in the way - the plug is a standard plug not a transformer.  I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 months without any problems.</li>
            <li> Ever since I bought this product my teeth have been 10 times cleaner.  My dentist even commented that he saw improvements with my teeth.  I owe it all to the Oral B electric toothbrush. Hightly recommend</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced.  This toothbrush comes with a compact charging stand, an excellent brush-head, and good battery power.  It seems to hold a charge well and is quite powerful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned Oral B electric toothbrushes for over 20 years and you van count on them to last a long time and to be at the cusp of the latest technology with each new role-out. This one highlights \\&quot;floss action\\&quot; and it gets the job done even better than previous models. Keep in mind that the toothbrush will not actually floss your teeth as it&#x27;s simply a selling point to highlight that it reaches places that others may miss. If this toothbrush is anything like my previous Oral B purchases, it will be with me for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One should keep in mind that the replacement heads for these toothbrushes is not cheap. I would also compare them to the price you pay for cartridges as the manufacturer looks to minimize the initial outlay (as is the case with printers) while cashing in later. I still think that this product accomplishes much more than a conventional toothbrush and that in the end it does not turn out to be as expensive when compared to how long these refills last.</li>
            <li> I like Oral B electric toothbrushes - I&#x27;ve been using one for several years (that was much more expensive), and this one works just as well.  Considering the fact that it&#x27;s priced much more reasonably, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a very good product for the price.  Makes buying a good electric toothbrush much more accessible!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is fairly vigorous and does a good job cleaning.  I have used a combination of regular toothbrush, Rota-Dent, and Waterpik for the past several years so I&#x27;m no stranger to trying alternate methods.  The head of the toothbrush is a bit stiff compared to Rota-Dent but the curved shape does a good job of getting the gum line towards the back of my (small) mouth.  After brushing with this, my teeth get that slick, super-clean feeling that you don&#x27;t always get with a regular brush.   I really like how it charges on a plastic base.  The hole the charger plugs into is all plastic, and the charger itself is all plastic - no places to corrode! It also has a small footprint so it leaves plenty of space on the countertop.  Oh, and it holds a charge for over a week!    The bottom line is that this is a really good find for someone looking for an electric toothbrush and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush with soft bristles and floss action which I found to be effective.  The small head makes it easy to get into tight spaces in the mouth (especially crowded teeth) and to focus on each tooth.  The timer is great for kids and keeps them brushing longer. I love that this brush is rechargeable - a real advantage over the cheapest power brushes, and the quality makes it a great alternative to more expensive ones.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the new Oral B power toothbrush for several weeks now and much to my surprise I really like it. I&#x27;ve had a Sonicare for years and I thought nothing could compare. I was wrong -- this one works great. I received the head that has floss action and I&#x27;m planning to try a couple of the others. That&#x27;s one big advantage of the Oral B -- you can buy different heads to use for different purposes. The one that has a polishing action similar to the one the dental hygienist uses looks intriguing.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that there&#x27;s no way to tell when the power handle is charging, when it&#x27;s fully charged or when the charge is low. It seems like there should be a light that glows different colors. When I set the power handle on the charger the first time, I just had to hope that it was working. Now I&#x27;m never sure when to recharge -- although it seems like you can go a long time (a week or so?) between charges.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re concerned about keeping your teeth clean and healthy, but don&#x27;t want to devote too much time, energy or money into your routine, this product is for you! The Oral-B power toothbrush easily cleans the hard-to-reach areas of your teeth, removing more plaque than an ordinary toothbrush. Users will see a clear difference within the first few brushings.    One thing to note, however, is that this toothbrush has a fairly long cord. So, depending on your bathroom sink area and outlet setup, you may run into the same problem I did, of the cord crossing the entire sink and getting in the way of the other things on the surface. But it&#x27;s easy enough to take a rubber band and reduce the cord to the necessary length.</li>
            <li> I have never used an electronic toothbrush before, so I can&#x27;t compare this one to other similar products.  However, this toothbrush is GREAT in comparison to an old fashioned toothbrush or a battery-operated on.  Every time I use it, my mouth and teeth feel so clean, like after I go to the dentist.  It was also a snap to set up and operating it is pretty much idiot proof.  Now that I have had an electric toothbrush, I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll ever go back.</li>
            <li> I read all review before buying this product, had a colgate spin brush before, didnt last a year before going dead, this product is a blast, like all other reviews u will say wow when u put it in your mouth.</li>
            <li> This is my first power toothbrush and I love it! My sister has been using a Philips Sonicare toothbrush for years, but I didn&#x27;t jump onto the bandwagon until recently. My dentist say I have a healthy mouth, but I like eating foods that tend to stain the teeth, such as curry. My good old manual toothbrush just wasn&#x27;t doing a good enough job of removing stains. Thought I could get a sonicare like my sis, but it was so much more expensive and seems to be a bit high maintenance. Tried the Oral-B Vitality with the floss action brush head and it was amazing! It was gentle on my gums, no bleeding, and the bristles did a great job of leaving my mouth feeling very clean.</li>
            <li> This brush is good. The brush power however is not as high as I was expecting, but my teeth still feel clean after brushing. It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy with this product&#x27;s cleaning power, but didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars for one major reason - there is a hole in the brush head that traps water, and starts to leak and drip down onto you.  As long as I brush before I dress, or drape a towel over me while brushing, all is well, but I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve started my day by changing tops or cleaning one off before going to work.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a great little toothbrush for the price. The handle is much larger than I like on a toothbrush, and the base should be regularly cleaned for sanitary reasons as well. However, this is a powerful little toothbrush - at least it gives you the impression you are really getting your teeth cleaned. The extra head it comes with is a plus too, and the timer helps, though if you have a big mouth like mine, you may need more than 2 minutes to brush. I have almost always used less expensive electric tooth brushes, and this is among the best I have tried before.</li>
            <li> This is my very first rechargeable power toothbrush, and the experience has been very positive, so far. It has definitely left me feeling happier with the results of my daily brushing.    The one feature I would wish it came with is a charging indicator light. As it is, the only way to know the toothbrush is when the charging stand turns warm after a few hours plugged in.</li>
            <li> After some 3 years of honorable service, my former Oral-B Vitality Floss Action Rechargeable Power Toothbrush had become old, tired and feeble. (I&#x27;m 80, still have a version of my original teeth, and, like my old toothbrush, manifestly lack the power I had when new.) As I&#x27;m learning to my chagrin, nothing lasts forever. The new unit fairly burst from its packaging with youthful vigor, and is now in service helping preserve my ancient choppers. The Oral-B Vitality Floss Action Rechargeable Power Toothbrush is relatively inexpensive, and, from my perspective, is all the toothbrush I need. Braun keeps coming up with fanciful, more costly versions of its excellent original product, but - unless you&#x27;re in love with bells and whistles - they add little but expense. The Amazon service on this order was typically beyond reproach.</li>
            <li> Charged unit per instructions (12hrs) Worked fine for about 1 min. then stopped! Noticed handle gets hot to the touch when turned on (so the battery is trying operate motor) without the unit operating. Returning to Amazon for replacement.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my 6+ year old one that I bought in the UK. The only reason I replaced it is because the adapter for the euro plug was bugging me but the toothbrush is still going strong. Now I still use the old one and the girlfriend uses the new one and we share the base charger. We are both very happy with these brushes.</li>
            <li> I was totally sold on this toothbrush after the first use. My teeth felt &#x27;dentist clean&#x27; after brushing for a couple minutes. Before this, I&#x27;ve used a variety of regular toothbrushes and spent a lot of money on the latest toothpastes but my teeth didn&#x27;t feel completely clean unless I went for a cleaning at the dentist. With this brush, my teeth are sparkling white and fresh. The flossing action does help clean between teeth and along the gumline. It&#x27;s not a substitute for flossing, but an additional help. My teeth can be occasionally sensitive, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems with sensitivity with the brush even though it has a lot of power. If someone had very sensitive teeth or gums, there is a sensitive teeth refill head that might work better. I&#x27;m also impressed how well it removes surface stains (such as from coffee or tea). The charge lasts for about a week, depending on how often it&#x27;s used. For around $30, this powerful toothbrush is an excellent value.</li>
            <li> Good product. I have had no problems with it so far. The timer helps me continue to brush when I might have normally stopped.</li>
            <li> Never a big fan of manual toothbrushes, I have been using a [[ASIN:B0001WXTRI Crest SpinBrush Pro, Soft Bristles (Colors May Vary)]] for the past several years. I thought it might be time to try something new, and I am glad I did. This brush is far better than my previous one, to the point that I have to order a second one since my wife already stole mine for herself!    Here are the details, mostly in comparison to the Crest SpinBrush I was using before.    The good:    * Rechargeable - big plus for me. I&#x27;ve gone through a lot of batteries on the Crest brush.  * Variety of replaceable heads - currently using the Vitality Floss Action but like the availability of other styles  * 2-minute timer - automatically tells you after 2 minutes of brushing, great way to build that habit  * Good speed, not too fast or slow, just feels right  * Mouth feels cleaner after this brush than with my previous spinbrush    The Not-so-good:    * No indicator for battery life - It is designed with the expectation that most people will leave it plugged in all the time, but I prefer to run my batteries down between charges and I didn&#x27;t get much warning when it quit in the middle of a brush one night.    Other than that, I love this brush. I&#x27;m glad it came with an extra brush head since my wife wanted to try it as well. Now I just need to order one for her so that we can stop trying to share. Highly recommended for anyone wanting a low-cost electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> For the past five years, I have been using the Sonicare electric tooth brush with the built in sterilizer. I bought it when it first came out, and it cost me $170.00.I love my Sonicare, but the replacement heads can cost up to $50.00. This tooth brush is very simular, only with out the sterilizer. Except that the replacement heads are much cheaper. I like the fact that it holds a charge for a long time. I think for for the money, this is definitly a better value.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been happy with several generations of Oral-B electronic toothbrushes. This was a replacement for one whose motor eventually turned down to near manual power. This takes the older and current heads and zips right along. It also has the pretty much unnecessary timer (I brush longer than it times), but it is powerful and a great cleaner.</li>
            <li> My son is one of those children who hates to brush his teeth.  We&#x27;ve gotten him an electric toothbrush before, but he said it was \\&quot;too hard\\&quot; and he didn&#x27;t like it.  Well, he loves this toothbrush.  I thought the funky head would throw him off, but he actually likes it.     Anything that gets my son to brush his teeth is great in my book!</li>
            <li> I just got this toothbrush to replace my old one of a similar style that held up for about 4 years. I thought it was still working fine, but compared to a nice new one, i might as well have not been brushing my teeth. This gets your teeth super clean and they stay feeling clean for a long time. Whips your gums into shape too. The size of the brush head is a little larger than the precision clean. I am expecting this to last for quite a while.</li>
            <li> So this is the first electric tooth brush I have ever purchased.  I like it because it is light and easy to use.  It continues working after the two minute timer (apparently others don&#x27;t, which I read in reviews).  The only down side is that it only lasts about 4 days off the charger, so if you are going on a longer trip you would have to bring the base with.  Otherwise, so far so good!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no believer like a convert. After one 4 minute session with this toothbrush I am a happy convert. My teeth didn&#x27;t look this clean even after a visit to the dentist. Don&#x27;t think twice, at this price, this is an awesome buy, and a very small price to pay for clean shiny teeth!!</li>
            <li> This product was easily set up and it doesn&#x27;t spray all over the place when it is on.  It does a great job with the gums as well as the teeth.  Good product for the price - highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush feels so good, I have no problem brushing for the minutes or more. Everybody should have this toothbrush!!! Your mouth feels so good after brushing with this.</li>
            <li> This is my second oral B electric toothbrush as my other one was at least 10 years old &amp; just gave out on power. I am very impressed by the power that this toothbrush has.  I believe that this toothbrush might have more rotations compared to my older one. This toothbrush came with the Floss toothbrush head that I have tried but, preferred my precision head instead.  The precision head seem to have a better cleaning action to it, compared to the floss action head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used manual brushes, until my hygienist told me my gums were receding from my brushing too hard (which I definitely did) and that an electric toothbrush would help with this. So I spent about 40 minutes at the grocery store agonizing over my choice, and finally picked the Vitality due to its reasonable cost and the included replacement head. So far I really like it for getting my teeth clean without my feeling like I have to scrub. I notice I don&#x27;t put near as much pressure on my teeth and gums as I used to. I still may switch to the sensitive heads, though, as my gums feel a little worn after brushing. I like the timer too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only things I wish could be improved are the packaging (I almost cut my hand off removing the brush!) and the lack of a charger light. Otherwise I think this is a good buy and am looking forward to good report at my next dentist appointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE:**&lt;br /&gt;I did switch to the sensitive head and I like that better. My teeth still feel clean, and the brush is much gentler. I would advise the sensitive brush if you tend to use too much pressure when brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also wanted to note that the instruction sheet is very thorough and gives good information on how to use the brush and how to tell if you&#x27;re brushing too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE ON MY UPDATE:**&lt;br /&gt;I just had my six-month checkup (first checkup since switching to this brush) and my dentist went on and on about how great my gums looked. They were never really bad, but this checkup he said they have stopped receding and looked, in his words, \\&quot;pink, healthy, and great.\\&quot; So now I&#x27;m really happy I bought this brush!</li>
            <li> For twenty dollars this item is a steal!!  Its powerful &amp; does the job better than you&#x27;d think. I&#x27;m surprised its priced so low!</li>
            <li> VEry clean teeth after using this.  The great thing about it is the smaller tip and neck.  It reaches in some of the problem areas...behind the very back teeth and really can get in there and scrub behind the front bottom and top.  Removes tartar quickly.  Holds a charge for several brushings.  Another reviewer mentioned woodchucks or some animal wrestling around on your teeth...that makes me laugh every time...cause they were right!</li>
            <li> Got the toothbrush a couple of days after I ordered it. Plugged it in for a day. It worked for about 20 seconds.</li>
            <li> Of all things my granddaughter (8yrs old) wanted this toothbrush.  She was using mom&#x27;s base with her own brush head but wanted a unit for herself.  She just got braces and this brush works wonderful for all the gear in her mouth.  She said it was the best present she got for her birthday!  Grandma was beeming for the ease of ordering on Amazon and fast delivery made sure it was at her house before the big day.  Thank you Amazon.com!</li>
            <li> love it ....everyday use this easy to brush my teeth&lt;br /&gt;it is automatic.....good buy</li>
            <li> The timer is weird and unexplained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Six months ago my dental hygienist said the only way I could further&lt;br /&gt;improve my dental hygiene was to switch to a good electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;She was reluctant to recommend a specific brand except to say that it&lt;br /&gt;should definitely have a two-minute timer.  I went to Consumer&lt;br /&gt;Reports, and the ones they really liked were pretty expensive, so I&lt;br /&gt;stalled, and then forgot about it.  This time my hygienist broke down&lt;br /&gt;and recommended the Vitality, which I found for less than $30.  I was&lt;br /&gt;very glad to see that this generation of electric brushes doesn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;require a big box, just a small recharger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions were a bit confusing, and there was no clear&lt;br /&gt;indication of there being a timer or how to use it.  The word \\&quot;timer\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;is printed near the on/off switch, however.  The first time I used the&lt;br /&gt;brush I was about 75% done when the brush pulsed for a second. I&lt;br /&gt;think that&#x27;s the \\&quot;timer\\&quot;.  That has continued to happen every time I&lt;br /&gt;brush with it.  I&#x27;m pleased to know that apparently I&#x27;ve been brushing&lt;br /&gt;my teeth for well over two minutes all along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 5/7/12:  After more than six months I can say that my teeth and&lt;br /&gt;gums are definitely healthier.  My hygienist announced that I have a&lt;br /&gt;truly clean mouth.  I actually enjoy using this product.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely easier to use than a manual brush  It&#x27;s convenient,&lt;br /&gt;and came with an extra brush head.  I&#x27;ve now switched to the extra sensitive brush&lt;br /&gt;heads, which seem gentler on my gums and still get my teeth just as clean.  A charge really does hold for several days, so one could just leave the charger behind for brief&lt;br /&gt;business or weekend trips.  If I were truly intense about dental&lt;br /&gt;hygiene I could even bring the brush to work every day as it&#x27;s not at&lt;br /&gt;all large or heavy.</li>
            <li> I bought this electric toothbrush in December of 2009.  I was looking to buy an electric toothbrush when I came across this at a local store.  The price caught my eye, and so I went home to do my research.  There wasn&#x27;t much info/reviews at the time, but what was out there was positive.  So I went back the next day and got it.  After using manual toothbrushes for our entire lives, my husband and I were very surprised how much cleaner our teeth felt.  Like I said, we have never used an electric one before, so this is not a comparison of other electric toothbrushes.  My husband is a HUGE fan of the timer, however I tend to stop and restart several times in my ritual so it&#x27;s not that important to me.  I am still amazed at the length of the charge, we can go a week with two people using it twice daily.  The heads I purchased at the time worked great, but the ones I bought a year later were significantly less so.  I have found some info about defective and/or counterfit heads.  It is still going strong after almost 2 years of daily use, with no sign of lessening power or charge.  Overall, I think the price and quality of this toothbrush make it a great option.</li>
            <li> I bought this recently. Takes a while to arrive. Nice one, works well, powerful, nice price too. I will order more for others too. I hope it will last.</li>
            <li> Just having my ten year old tooth brush run out of vibrations, I tried to duplicate it as best I could with what was offered by same brand.  While it seems to clean the teeth, it is a lot rougher on them than my original choice ten or more years ago. Things change. People change.</li>
            <li> The brush head that comes with the Oral-B Vitality is oval or elliptical. If you don&#x27;t position the brush precisely, the edges of the head batter your teeth-- sounding like a jackhammer in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will replace the head with the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; style, which appear to be circular, and hope this fixes the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Added later: The sensitive brush head is circular and removes the jackhammer effect. Much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that the sensitive brushes are often sold by subscription, another marketing strategy I do not like. I prefer to buy the brush heads when I need them, rather than on the sellers&#x27; calendar schedule.</li>
            <li> With the advancement in technology now the tooth brush have become electric. Some of you might be scared with the idea of putting electric equipment in your mouth &amp; not sure if you need this or its any good. I was too... It may not be most wonderful thing in the world &amp; I love my [[ASIN:B0017KHCB2 Glister Advanced Toothbrush]]. My dentist suggested me this due to some dental issues and it&#x27;s not bad. 2 min timer  can be confusing and no good if the charge runs out. But all in all it doesn&#x27;t feel bad using an electric tooth brush &amp; this one is good I think.</li>
            <li> A good brush...but be prepared to get another in about 3 years. This is my 3rd brush but the first one made in Mexico.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush (Oral-B Vitality Floss Action Rechargeable Power Toothbrush, Blue and White).  My dentist advised buying the least expensive toothbrush as they are all very similar.  My sister&#x27;s dentist informed her the same.  She obtained this toothbrush and recommended it to me.  I have liked the toothbrush very much.  It, particularly, has a far reach and does a much better job than my manual toothbruch.  This is a great buy for the price (less than $30).  It even comes with an extra brush as they need to be changed periodically.  I have never owned another electric toothbrush to compare this one to but I am very happy with this one.</li>
            <li> My other was so worn out and this new one is fabulous. Great buy and works in top notch order.</li>
            <li> Had to get a new one after my cat knocked over my old brush &amp; it fell into the toilet. I was due to buy more refills, &amp; decided I would rather buy a new set of power brush.  This brush makes my mouth feel so clean just like the one it replace that cost 3X as much. Sure this one does not have extra features like digital timer, 30 sec notifier, charging light indicator, etc, etc. but after using this brush for several days now, I&#x27;ve come to one conclusion-I don&#x27;t miss not having the extra features. It cleanses my teeth &amp; gums just as good as the more expensive model.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using an electric toothbrush and I really like it.  Leaves my teeth feeling very clean.  I do have to use my old toothbrush to scrub my tongue, though, because this brush doesn&#x27;t do the job.  Maybe other brush heads may, I&#x27;ll try other kinds when its time to change out the head.  My walls and mirrors are splattered with toothpaste now because when I brush my front teeth it sprays out.  Overall, I like the toothbrush.  I&#x27;m willing to overlook these minor sacrifices for clean and healthy teeth.</li>
            <li> I love the Oral-B rechargeable toothbrushes, but when I tried these floss-action heads (which unfortunately came with my brush), it felt like a JACKHAMMER IN MY MOUTH. I am fairly sure this is damaging to gums and teeth. I immediately ordered the sensitive heads and am very happy with my toothbrush. These should not be sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me refer you to what is currently the top-rated review for this product. Quote:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I was picking up some items from my dentist&#x27;s office yesterday and noticed that she had the Oral-B ... Toothbrush on her counter as a recommended item and that it had the same woodchuck action floss head as this one. When I told her I was glad to see that she endorsed the floss action she nearly had a stroke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She didn&#x27;t realize that was the head that was on her demo unit and told her assistant to change it. She said she used the floss head once and was mortified by its over-exuberance. She tells all her clients to throw away the floss head and use the sensitive brush ...\\&quot;</li>
            <li> So upset....I thought it was a great price for the product. I wasn&#x27;t thinking and I threw the packaging away and it DOESN&#x27;T WORK. Recommend spending more money for a better product. Cheaper isn&#x27;t always better.</li>
            <li> It finally came time to replace my 8-year-old brush stand, and as that was also an Oral-B, I thought I&#x27;d buy another one. I do not regret it at all - this thing is powerful and does a thorough job. The two-minute timer helps - remember to use it! - and my only real gripe with it is that it doesn&#x27;t have a charging indicator light like my old brush. This really isn&#x27;t a problem, as when I went to the dentist after using this brush for a month, my teeth were almost perfectly clean. I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve tried many other toothbrushes, but this one definitely gets the job done and is one I&#x27;d recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> This works very similarly to the more expensive Bruan/Oral B professional series and has the luxury of being rechargeable and can theoretically last years. However, I would not advise keeping it a long time. I have owned two of these and I can&#x27;t for the life of me figure out why, but it develops a terrible odor within months. I clean it regularly with rubbing alcohol, soap &amp; water, and keep it dry, as well as changing the brush heads routinely, but nothing seems to stop the odor from happening. In the short term, this seemed like a great, value priced electric toothbrush, but once that odor begins (and it could be as soon as a couple months), I would advise throwing it away because there&#x27;s no getting rid of it. For a three month electric toothbrush, there are much better values out there.</li>
            <li> This is my second Oral-B rechargeable Power toothbrush &amp; I am very pleased with the job it does. My teeth always feel so clean after brushing just like a professional cleaning. Great product for the money.</li>
            <li> Product completely stopped working after 2 months. It will not take a charge anymore. What a complete waste of money. I&#x27;ll stick with manual toothbrushes after this fiasco. Stay away!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had the Oral-B Vitality for 2 1/2 years and it&#x27;s worked great the entire time.  Even on the kid&#x27;s braces.  I&#x27;m surprised to see all the very recent reviews that say it doesn&#x27;t work.  I wonder if they have a new manufacturer.</li>
            <li> i had a sonic at 3 times the price,,, this one makes teeth feel clean but not sqicky clean...  does the job though...  for price ($27) it is worth it.  better than manual tooth brush...</li>
            <li> I recommend this to my friends and to my patients. Its very affordable and cleans your teeth very well!&lt;br /&gt;I am glad they have a $30 toothbrush in this economy instead of just the $100 ones.&lt;br /&gt;Dr Joey!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have any problems with it being too harsh.  I like it alot, especially for the price! Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I have never used a power toothbrush before but I am very happy with this one. I have had it a couple of months and it works great. Having read the reviews about mold/mildew, I have been very vigorous about rinsing it between brushings and it seems to be fine. I gave it four stars because I do not have any others to compare this brand with and I don&#x27;t know if another would be better or worse than this one.</li>
            <li> I finally had to give the old Braun toothbrush a proper burial.  It gave me such great, long service, I ordered another one through Amazon.  I hoped it would be a another terrific brush and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. I give the Oral-B Braun lots of stars for ease of use, dependability and it gets in to those hard to reach places with the small round head. The only negative thing I have is that the new stand for it is not as sturdy as the old one and I miss that little green light telling me it is sitting correctly. All in all its a 5 star item.  Amazon also gets 5 stars for its fast and efficient service, quick shipping and great competitive prices.  Be sure to check out their great prices on name brand items.  The savings can be considerable.</li>
            <li> As a Sonicare toothbrush user for the past 5 years, I was often frustrated with the price of replacement heads. I thought I&#x27;d try the Oral-b Vitality Floss Action Rechargeable Power Toothbrush since the price fits our budget better. Unfortunately, I think the Sonicare experience set the bar too high and the Oral-b toothbrush did not meet my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oral-b features I liked:&lt;br /&gt;-Lightweight (lighter than the Sonicare)&lt;br /&gt;-Compact head&lt;br /&gt;-Bristles rotate and get in between teeth fairly well, but seem a little harsh along the gum line&lt;br /&gt;-Inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s how the Sonicare one is better than the Oral-b one:&lt;br /&gt;-The Sonicare has a slimmer brush head \\&quot;neck\\&quot; between the bristles and the base/handle; the Oral-b one feels awkward because it&#x27;s thicker&lt;br /&gt;-Sonicare has adjustable timing in 30 second increments up to 3 minutes, with auto shut-off; Oral-b has an alert that goes off at 2 minutes, but it doesn&#x27;t turn off and it&#x27;s not adjustable&lt;br /&gt;-The Sonicare brush/bristles have a plastic cover for when toothbrush is not in use; Oral-b just stays exposed when not in use, much like a regular toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;-The Oral-b toothbrush is louder than the Sonicare toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I felt like my teeth were very clean, except along the gum line where I was hesitant to direct the Oral-b brush since it&#x27;s a little harsher than my Sonicare (and I have sensitive gums already). I think it does a better job cleaning teeth than a standard toothbrush. It takes a little getting used to, but it&#x27;s a step towards healthier oral care if you don&#x27;t already use an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Battery is dead!!! I charged it 24 hours each time for 3 times. And every time, the battery can last no longer than 30 seconds. Very poor product!!!</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush. It has vigorous cleaning action for your teeth without the uncomfortable roughness. It is simple to use and comes with a replacement head. And with the price tag, buying this is a no-brainer.</li>
            <li> More fun to use than a manual toothbrush. Gave it my son to use and he seemed to actually use it for more than two seconds. Will be purchasing another one for my other kid and myself.</li>
            <li> We have had our Oral-B tooth brush for over 10 years and it just bit the dust 2 weeks ago, so I was on the hunt for a new tooth brush. Well, as you can guess, this one ended up being the winner! And I am glad we purchased this model over the higher end ones OralB has in their product line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the box, you have to charge it 16 hours before your first initial use. And once this baby was fired up, YOWZA! I don&#x27;t think my teeth have felt this clean in a long time. Which I am attributing to the floss action head that we are using with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish this had a charging light, with seeing that gives me comfort that it is meeting the contacts on the base and I can rest assured knowing it is charging, without it, I can only \\&quot;hope\\&quot; it&#x27;s working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that we have a variety of heads to choose from, being as my husband does not like the same tooth brushes as me.</li>
            <li> I have been challenged with reaching behind my back molars, due to the size of brush heads.  This Oral -B is small enough to reach behind my molars without hurting my mouth and has enough of a brush surface to do a good job of cleaning my teeth and massaging my gums.  It holds a charge for at least a week, so I do not have to leave it plugged in all the time.</li>
            <li> I bought this Oral-b Vitality Power toothbrush, Blue and White with Floss action&lt;br /&gt;from another site recently.&lt;br /&gt;It was on sale so I saved a few bucks.&lt;br /&gt;It was new in box.  It also comes with an extra brush head.&lt;br /&gt;I does an excellent job of brushing around all surfaces of the teeth and&lt;br /&gt; leaves my teeth feeling almost as good as a professional dental cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why it says Floss action. ??&lt;br /&gt;If you think it will go between your teeth like a string of&lt;br /&gt;floss you won&#x27;t be pleased.  It doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;The brush head is gentle yet powerful.&lt;br /&gt;I did not get any bleeding when I first used it so I guess my teeth&lt;br /&gt;and gums are in fairly good health.&lt;br /&gt;I like the gum massage and the way it cleans around the teeth&lt;br /&gt;with hardly any effort from me.&lt;br /&gt;I like to use it for the full 2 min. with a gentle reminder from the device,&lt;br /&gt;which is when the unit starts to have an intermittent slowing motion.&lt;br /&gt;There is no alarm or jingle sound which is great if you don&#x27;t want to wake up the family&lt;br /&gt;or can&#x27;t handle noises in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;The recharger comes with it and I prefer to keep it on charge just in case.&lt;br /&gt;I have no complaints, except the price of replacement heads&lt;br /&gt;which will be needed in the future.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this unit to anyone.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B toothbrush is powerful and works a longtime on a single charge. Sleek and power, great combo for a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is the best money I ever spent...and I&#x27;m not being paid to say this.  I had a previous model but the speed of this is way faster...your mouth will thank you.</li>
            <li> If you are like me and don&#x27;t even know what it feels like to use an electric toothbrush that isn&#x27;t one of those 10 to 15 dollar jobbies, you GOTTA get this thing.  It&#x27;s got a very rough-and-tumble feel to it, but it feels so good, almost like a rough massage to my teeth and gums.      I thought the brush head would be too small (I have big teeth - I&#x27;m a big dude), but I liked the idea of the circular action, and I wanted to spend less than 50 bucks on an upgrade, so I gave it a shot.  It doesn&#x27;t feel small, though, when it&#x27;s running.  My teeth are sensitive and it&#x27;s not an exaggeration to say that every teeth-brushing experience in my life has been tinged with a discomfort that is totally absent with this toothbrush, even though it has such an aggressive feel.  I&#x27;ve used it for a week now and tonight it felt so good brushing that I had to come do a review.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Awesome value and works great. Definitely spend a few bucks more to get this product. Highly recommended for those who like clean teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.  It gives an extra level of cleaning, especially at the gum line, that my old Oral-B battery operated brush did not provide.  I also very much like the timer feature.  It should NOT be a substitute for a good ole fashion manual flossing ... in my opinion.  However, I am not a dentist so what do I know?  What I do know is that my mouth feels extra EXTRA clean after it&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working very good.  This is a replacement for the last Oral-B Toothbrush.  I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I bought this model after reading the reviews. The first one died after two weeks and it would no longer hold a charge. Amazon was great in sending me a replacement but the second one had the exact same problem. Two weeks of use and now I have to charge it daily just to get enough time for a single brushing. I have used this brand for over 20 years and never had a real problem with any brush I bought. I expect Amazon has a bad batch, no more.</li>
            <li> Summary: This unit replaced a previous Oral-B that from three years ago (the \\&quot;Advance\\&quot; model?). It seems to clean better, but it is pretty much \\&quot;on/off\\&quot; for controls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Details: The Oral-B Vitality is a very straightforward and simple unit. It does not have the power controls of the previous models, nor does it have the timer function that lets you know when it&#x27;s time to move to another part of your mouth. Despite these differences, my wife says that it cleans better while using the same brushes as its predecessor. The motor is stronger than the previous one was when it was new. Her teeth feel cleaner using the same dentifrice. It&#x27;s compact, including the charger. Overall, it&#x27;s inexpensive and works well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking at the more expensive electric toothbrushes -- Sonicare, and higher end Oral-b -- for quite some time, but could never pull the trigger when for the same price, I can practically buy a lifetime supply of manual toothbrushes.  I&#x27;d also tried the under-$10, disposable electric toothbrushes, but found I could do a better cleaning job with my manual toothbrushes.    The Oral-b Vitality Floss Action Rechargeable Power Toothbrush seems to be the happy medium between those two extremes.  You get the same high-quality head (plus a refill) that is featured in higher priced Oral-b models, but it&#x27;s attached to a bare bones but fully functional handle that keeps it priced at about the cost of 3 disposable electrics.    The handle is bare bones, but you get what you need: 1) a powerful motor that loses no steam before you&#x27;re done brushing; 2) an inductive charging system which means there are no exposed electrical contacts that you need to keep dry; and 3) a timer which notifies you via a slight stutter in the motor action that 2-minutes has elapsed -- this helps you to pace how quickly to move the brush from quadrant to quadrant within your mouth.      I have one implant, and some \\&quot;erosions\\&quot; on several teeth near the gum line that were caused by overly-vigorous manual brushing, and I find that the Oral-b does a great job in those difficult-to-brush areas.  And this toothbrush will be a huge boon to anyone with grip or motor skill impairments since it&#x27;s practically effortless to simply move from tooth to tooth, leaving all the hard work to the electric motor.  And even for those of us with no impairments, the electric motor is able to brush each tooth at a much higher rate (and I assume, then, more thoroughly) than we can do manually.    Don&#x27;t throw away that manual toothbrush, though.  There is still one mouth maintenance chore that the Oral-b does not handle well -- brushing of your tongue.  The head of the Oral-b is only 1/2 to 1/3 the size of a manual toothbrush, and I always brush my entire tongue as the last part of \\&quot;tooth\\&quot; brushing to get that minty, fresh taste.  That job is still best left to my manual toothbrush due to its larger head.    That being said, I am pleasantly surprised by how much I like this toothbrush.  If you check my other reviews, you&#x27;ll notice that I almost never give a 5-star rating, so consider this 4-star rating very high praise indeed.</li>
            <li> You really do feel like you&#x27;re come from the dentist after using this.  Was skeptical about the idea of a power toothbrush - it just seemed excessive.  But there&#x27;s a big difference in how clean your mouth will feel after using one of these for a week.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t spend $100 on the \\&quot;fancier\\&quot; Oral-B toothbrushes.  This does just as good of a job at 1/5 the price.  Do you really need a digital timer (this one vibrates when you&#x27;re done)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep buying this year after year.  My dentist says my teeth look fabulous!</li>
            <li> Terrific product. I have had it a few years now, and it still works as if new. If and when it ever wears out or breaks, I will purchase the same exact product again. If you go and spend 50, 75, or 100 bucks for an electric toothbrush, as I see them priced everywhere, you are crazy. This thing costs under $20, if I remember correctly, and it is as good as any of the &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; products out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a more expensive Oral-B mechanical toothbrush for many years now, but that one is wearing down, so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it for a week, I do like it.  It is an impressively sturdy unit, especially for the price.  It changes quickly, and holds its charge for a good long time.  The toothbrush head is larger than the one I had been using, but that is fine.  My dentist has always recommended a toothbrush like this, because you can work the gumline effectively in hard-to-reach places like the upper-back molars (which has historically been my brushing achillies heel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, the only thing I don&#x27;t like about this brush, and it&#x27;s enough to make me consider using a different brush, is that they inserted these hard pieces of plastic in with the soft hairs, and it kind of rasps on your gums.  If you are using to using a medium or hard brush, this will probably feel quite good to you, but I&#x27;m strictly a \\&quot;soft brush\\&quot; guy, so it is an unpleasant sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, this is a pretty impressive product for the money.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few other power toothbrushes over the years and I must say that this is one of the best.  Your teeth really do feel much cleaner and it takes much less time than a normal toothbrush.  The icing on the cake is the low price of this brush. Typical electric toothbrushes cost more than 2-3 times this one and they do not clean any better.  This is an excellent product. 4.5 Stars    *** Positive Points: ***    - Great cleaning ability and you can change the head to either a precision clean, sensitive, pro white, dual clean, or floss action (The brush comes with 2 floss action heads)    - Reasonable price for replacement heads (about $15 for 3). The heads have an indicator to let you know when they need to be changed (typically every 3 months).    - It uses inductive charging on the base so there are no contacts on the brush or the base. You simply stick the raised portion of the charger into the end of the brush.    - Rechargeable NiCd battery can be replaced so it is much more environmentally friendly than brushes with non replaceable batteries    - Brush vibrates to let you know when you have gone over the recommended 2 minute brush time.    - 2 year warranty    *** Negative Points: ***    - Complete Charge takes 16 hours and this lets the brush run for about 1 week (assuming you use it for 2 minutes twice a day).  I found this to be pretty close to the battery life that I received.    - There is no indicator light to let you know when the brush is fully charged or even to let you know when the charge is low.    - The brush can make a mess and splatter toothpaste if you turn the brush on before putting it in your mouth       Overall:  This toothbrush cannot be beat for its price.  I deducted half a star because there is no indicator light telling you the battery status, though this is a minor issue.</li>
            <li> This really cleans teeth well.  Everytime I brush I feel like I&#x27;ve just been to the dentist for a professional cleaning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush tips are easy to change so everyone in the family can have their own while using the same base.  The base and brushes connect with metal parts that feel very secure and strong.  Nice grip, and easy on &amp; off.  It has a two minute timer so you know when you&#x27;ve brushed adequately!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I started out comparing Sonicare and Oral B electric brushes, The Oral B 5000 came out on top so I started to read reviews and noticed the 5000 had a lot of features people felt it didn&#x27;t need, so I looked at the 3000 and noticed the same thing (unneeded and even unwanted features) so that took me to the 1000 and I began to read the reviews and noticed the one feature the 1000 had over the Vitality was the pressure sensor. Almost all the reviews for the 1000 said the pressure sensor didn&#x27;t work or was innefective. So I ended up getting the Vitality ($24.99) instaed of getting the 5000 ($119-149) that I would not have been as happy with. I spent hours looking for a review that told me this exact info so, you&#x27;re welcome. This brush is fantastic, the Floss Action head can be a little aggressive so I am getting a pack of Precision heads (they are super cheap, like $14 for 3) for back ups but most days I will use the Floss Action Heads because I felt \\&quot;dentist clean\\&quot; afterwards. I did read some reviews that said the heads wrer a little large, I have a small mouth and while the heads are thicker than a manual brush it was by no means unmanageable or uncomfortable. This is a fantastic product and I am here to let you know my Sonicare is now in a landfill and I don&#x27;t miss it one bit. My wife loves the Oral B Vitality and I am logging in to get one for my kids as soon as I am done with this review.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 10-year-old -- he loves having an electric toothbrush just like mom and dad, and it seems to work just as well as the $100 model we have!</li>
            <li> This is my first power toothbrush.  The most important feature to me are teeth.  I brush at least 3 times a day, use whitening strips and whitening toothpaste but...I hate flossing!  My teeth are extremely tight and flossing causes bleeding and swelling of my gums.  My dentist has told me that I need to floss regularly since my gums are receding.  This toothbrush a little louder than I expected, but remember this is my first power toothbrush.  I really like the two minute timer feature becuase my dentist always told me that I was always \\&quot;over\\&quot; brushing.  Since brushing with an up and down movement can wear off the enamel (as told by my dentist), the Oral-B toothbrush uses oscillating and rotating movement which dentists prefer.  The brushes surround each tooth to make sure to get in between the teeth and around the gum line.  Holds a good charge and  comes with an extra brush head and has a 2 year limited warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is a nice power toothbrush.  Gets my teeth clean and seems to do an alright job at cleaning around my gum line.  It does not replace my yearly cleaning by my dentist, but hopefully the dentist will see an improvement with my gums on my next visit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start off by saying that I have never tried the more expensive models of electric toothbrushes. I have however tried cheaper versions, including crest and cheaper Oral-B&#x27;s. This one is by far the best out of the different toothbrushes I&#x27;ve tried! Firstly, it isn&#x27;t dependent on batteries; it&#x27;s rechargeable, which is great, so you dont have to spend money buying batteries every few weeks. Secondly, this model can be used with a few different brush attachments. the floss action is nice because it has a small head, which makes it easier to get to the hard to reach back molars. If it&#x27;s too small for you, you can always use one of the bigger head attachments (not sure which ones go with this model, but I&#x27;m sure you can find out on the Oral B website or somewhere here on Amazon). This leaves my teeth cleaner than any brush I&#x27;ve used. They feel as clean as if I had just come from the dentist! The battery life is great too! It will last me two weeks with 2x a day brushing before I have to charge it. This leaves my teeth so clean, I&#x27;m not sure how much cleaner a more expensive brush would even get my teeth, so this is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a while since I used an electric toothbrush instead of my regular one but I was so impressed with this Oral-B toothbrush. It works really well in getting my teeth clean-I can&#x27;t feel any plague after I brush. It won&#x27;t replace regular flossing but it does do a good job of getting in between your teeth. I also like that it tells you when two minutes have passed, which is the amount of time that dentists recommend that you brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall, I&#x27;m quite pleased with this brush and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone who is looking for a new way to clean their teeth.</li>
            <li> Great Product, would be from seller again!</li>
            <li> I tried Crest Spin Brush,and had to change batteries every other week. It also pinched my inner cheek. The Oral-B rechargeable is much better. It hasn&#x27;t pinched, and holds it&#x27;s charge. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for this type of toothbrush.</li>
            <li> For the perfect brushing, you should get one of the models that has a pressure sensor, particularly if you have problems with your gums and/or pressing too hard.  However, those models do cost a good bit more.  This model gives good value for the money -- no problems, does what it&#x27;s supposed to, battery lasts for many charge cycles.  Toothbrush heads are more expensive than I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> So glad I was able to find this.  I was about to throw out my old favorite Braun unit but now with the replacement power handle its just like new!  I&#x27;m one happy customer.  If you have a unit that&#x27;s compatible with this replacement I highly recommend it.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> EDITED:  After 5 years of constant use, this finally wore out. I purchased another today (12/9/2015).&lt;br /&gt;+++++++++&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the Oral B line of electric toothbrushes for over 8 years.  In fact, up until a week ago, my first Oral B (from the Professional Series) was still going strong.  Finally, the original battery wore out as I was having to charge it almost daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Vitality model is a less expensive model than my Professional Oral B, but it seems to be just as good as far as cleaning my teeth.  Maybe even better due to the flossing action of the brush head(s) that come with this.  The FlossAction head is slightly larger in size than the brush-head I used before (the Precision Clean).  I have a small mouth inside and this new brush fits a little more snugly inside my mouth, but on the plus side, this one holds slightly more toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do like:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;  The two minute timer is the BEST feature of all.  Unless you have a timer, you are not brushing your teeth long enough.  Trust me on this.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;  The FlossAction brush head does a good job of getting near the tooth/gum line.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;  I love the rubber grip handle.  My old Oral B did not have this, and it was slippery to hold onto.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;  Will go over a week between charges.  I keep it off the charger until it needs recharging.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;  Almost feels like a professional teeth-cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do NOT like:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;  No charging light - my old Professional Oral B had a light, there was no doubt when it was plugged in and charging.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;  The clam-shell packaging this comes in has to be the worst I&#x27;ve ever encountered.  My knife gouged into the rubber hand grip and I nearly cut myself twice.  If you have the option of choosing this with frustration-free packaging, get that one instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate visiting my dentist. Since I&#x27;ve been using these Oral B brushes, my exams are so good my dentist is pleased with me, but he&#x27;s not making the money off me that he once did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following Oral B brush heads will fit this model:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Precision Clean&lt;br /&gt;2.  ProWhite&lt;br /&gt;3.  Sensitive&lt;br /&gt;4.  Dual Clean&lt;br /&gt;5.  FlossAction (of course)leased with me, but he&#x27;s not making the money off me that he once did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following Oral B brush heads will fit this model:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Precision Clean&lt;br /&gt;2.  ProWhite&lt;br /&gt;3.  Sensitive&lt;br /&gt;4.  Dual Clean&lt;br /&gt;5.  FlossAction (of course)</li>
            <li> Opening the clamshell package is tougher than use of this toothbrush.  Really.  That sucker is tightly wedged in there.  The unit itself is intuitive, simple to use, and works really well.  Ease of use for a one handed individual (that&#x27;s me) means for anyone else this is a no brainer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before writing the review I wanted to try a second set of heads. I tried the precision clean heads after using the heads the unit shipped with above.  Floss Action beats the other hands down; for not only a cleaner feeling, but for getting in there without feeling like it&#x27;s going to hurt you.  The precision did not have as smooth a feeling and took me longer to get the clean I got with floss action. Plus on the gums the precision felt harsher and almost painful.  Since it has the two minute timer built in, it was very simple to see the clean feeling of one over the other.  So try floss action first, others later if unsatisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Refills. They work out to about the price of a new toothbrush. They probably could be cheaper looking at the simplicity of manufacture, but since they compete with a full toothbrush you&#x27;ll pay about the same.  Look for sales and stock up. It&#x27;s not like they&#x27;ll go stale in the linen closet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ease of use. I would say it is perhaps the greatest asset.  This is so very simple to use and does what it advertised to do.  It is just that extra bit better than your manual toothbrush, and the two-minute-warning timer is great. I seemed to be around two minutes of brushing time anyway but it is nice to get that heads up from the unit itself.  It charges easy and since the charger is the base, that is the intuitive parking place. I am telling you, this is that simple to use, and cleanup is equally painless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is: You take care of it and it will take care of you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hints:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not turn it on before it is in your mouth.  Unless you&#x27;re looking to redecorate the walls and mirror of your washroom.  Sounds simple, but you&#x27;re going to do this at least once.  Luckily toothpaste cleans up easy.  Hopefully this warning will buy you a month before you sleepily turn it on one morning after giving it a dot of toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once a week unplug the unit, remove the head, and clean the whole thing of any residue.  Seems like common sense but if you go two weeks before cleaning, you&#x27;ll do a serious &#x27;eew[...]  Cleanup is simple, just do it every weekend.  This is important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rinse the bristles thoroughly when done, give a few shakes and perhaps even turn it on briefly in the sink (to shake off the water) before placing back on the charger. This will make that weekend maintenance simpler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s it! Now get one for yourself and see.t once.  Luckily toothpaste cleans up easy.

            <li> This is everything you&#x27;d want in an electrical toothbrush, and for the price, it can&#x27;t be beat. I looked into other (more expensive) brands and decided to give this a try based on the reviews. I am so pleased with my decision. Don&#x27;t waste money on other brands - this does a fantastic job cleaning your teeth.</li>
            <li> This brush is great! My teeth have never felt so clean after brushing and the price is unbeatable! The only downside is that it does not have a light indicating whether it is charging or not....</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product.  Easy to use, perfect for travel.  Toothbrush is quiet and well-sized for small mouths.</li>
            <li> I feel like I take good care of my teeth- I brush, I floss, I use mouth rinse... but after using this toothbrush, I am having doubts about how good I brushed! It cleaned my teeth and gums so well- the tooth brush head has little flossers in it. These really irritated my gums the first time I used it, but it felt great afterwards (ie, really clean!) and my gums have adjusted to it quickly.     The timer feature also informed me I apparently have never brushed my teeth as long as the recommended 2 minutes... the 2 minutes felt like forever the first time!     My one concern over this toothbrush is that the replacement heads look like they cost a significant proportion of what the brush itself costs.</li>
            <li> This electric tooth brush does a fine job and is a great value.  I bought it to replace a brush that cost over $150 and it does a better job. The small, rotating head easily gets to the gum line of even the rear teeth.  Only negative is that there is no low battery warning so it will die in the middle of a brushing episode if you don&#x27;t regularly plug in the charger-stand. That&#x27;s a small inconvenience - one not worth $100+.  Just in case, on the day the Oral B is recharging, you can always use the brush given to you by your dentist at your last visit, unless you used it for cleaning grout.</li>
            <li> Good product.  It was a replacement for our previous oral-b. Does not seem to be as powerful (fast) as our old handle.  Old model had LED light indicating the handle was connected and receiving a charge. No such indicator on this model which is a drawback.  But, it does a good job so far and no show stopper complaints.  It was delivered very timely and in new packaging.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have ordered this model.  In combination with flossing and the use of a dental pic, it is all you need for great dental hygiene.  You can always find replacement brushes that are compatible.  The bells and whistles that often fail are not present.  The charge last 3 - 4 weeks and the recharge is quick. A reliable dental hygiene friend.</li>
            <li> this never worked, despite my trying twice to charge it using two different outlets in my home that normally work with no problem.  Will return to Amazon. This product also needs a charging light so you know it&#x27;s charging.</li>
            <li> My Sonicare electric toothbrush finally gave up and wouldn&#x27;t charge anymore after a good 8 years of use.  I have sensitive teeth at the gum line and my dentist said that the \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; action irritates the sensitivity and to use only once a day (use regular toothbrush on other brushings).  I like using electric toothbrushes because I have forearm and elbow pain from the manual tooth brushing up and down action. Electric toothbrushes allow for good cleaning without pain in my arms. I had read both positive and negative reviews for this Oral-b Vitality Floss Action toothbrush and decided to give it a shot because it was a different cleaning action than the sonic style, and the price seemed much more affordable (~$25).  The negative reviews I read seemed like they were isolated instances of the toothbrush going out shortly after purchase, and was not the \\&quot;norm.\\&quot;  I thought that if I ended up with a \\&quot;bad egg\\&quot; toothbrush, Amazon would replace easily (as stated in some reviews I read).  I have used this new Oral-b Vitality Floss Action toothbrush for over a month now and am very pleased with the results.  My sensitive teeth handle the brushing action without any pain.  And surprisingly, the little \\&quot;rubber pieces\\&quot; that act as \\&quot;floss action\\&quot; actually does feel like the dentist cleaning my teeth and my teeth and gums feel great and look clean after brushing.  Some other bonus items I liked about this product: came with 2 brush heads, so won&#x27;t need to replace heads for at least 6 months; also liked the 2 minute timer alert, but not shutting off so I can finish brushing when I chose to turn it off. I would recommend this toothbrush as a mid-level electric toothbrush, where you don&#x27;t have to buy replacement batteries, yet don&#x27;t value the \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot; pressure sensing, sonic, covered brush head, multiple handles, etc. of the high-level electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Once again Oral-B comes through.  I have used this brand of tooth brush for many, many years - they last a very long time and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Ordered these for my grandsons ages 5 to 13.  They seem to like them.  Hope it helps with their cavities.</li>
            <li> This product continues to work great for my family.  We first tried to share a base using separate brushes.  It was too much to continue switching out brushes.  We decided to purchase a second unit so we each could have one.  What I like most is the two-minute indicator.  Now we don&#x27;t have to wonder if we&#x27;ve brushed long enough!</li>
            <li> i went through a rough spot with dental insurance and ended up not able to see the dentist for about 3 years or so (bad, i know). when i finally went, the results were not pretty. although they were all tiny- i had 8 cavities! after dealing with that pain, i decided to purchase this brush at the suggestion of my dentist. it hurt at first (definitely had to get used to the increased sensation vs. a normal brush) but you can really feel it cleaning, and also getting things out of the spaces in between your teeth as well! i always had to floss before after eating popcorn, but this brush gets it all out no problem. a year later &amp; i am cavity free, and hope to stay that way as well!  the only downside, i wish i could find the refills on amazon as well- from what i read in other reviews, they seem to all be counterfeit. :(</li>
            <li> It was a Christmas gift for my husband and he likes it.  I don&#x27;t like it at all, it hurts my teeth.  But hubby thinks his teeth feels cleaner after using it, and he&#x27;s actually been flossing every night since he got it to, so it&#x27;s definitely helped in many ways.</li>
            <li> For someone who won&#x27;t use all the fancy features of an expensive rechargeable, this does a fine job of both cleaning your teeth and massaging your gums.</li>
            <li> Definately alot more fun than using a standard tooth brush on your teeth.  I feel like I&#x27;m at the dentist everytime I brush now.  Haven&#x27;t found any flaws or problems with the unit.</li>
            <li> Well it&#x27;s an electric brush that cleans your teeth. It works like it is supposed to. It has only one speed which is fine because why do you really want alternate speeds? I cannot think of any negatives about this product.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try out a power brush. This one looked good with the floss action bristles. Works great. I just need to recharge it once a week. Initially I was scared that it might hurt my gums, but it doesn&#x27;t. Infact you get a good tickling massage on the gums when you use it.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd electric toothbrush and also the cheapest at only $29 shipped.  I was skeptical because of the lower price, but it feels so much more powerful than the others.  Only had it for a week or so and no issues so far.  The 2 minute timer works well.  I prefer the vibrating timer instead of a beep.  Supposedly most of the other oral-b heads are interchangeable, but I haven&#x27;t tried that yet.  The floss action heads that came with this model may be a littler harsh for some, but don&#x27;t bother me.  But, I do plan on trying some different heads for comparison.  If you have sensitive gums, you might want this model but with other heads.</li>
            <li> This product is very good and useful. It is exactly what I need. The two minute timer is the BEST feature of all. Unless you have a timer, you are not brushing your teeth long enough.</li>
            <li> Just got this brush as an Xmas gift for family member so they haven&#x27;t opened it yet.  But I have a very similar model Oral-B electric/rechargable toothbrush I&#x27;ve been using pretty much religiously for the past 3-4 years.  Still going on its original rechargable battery pack without problems.  Also since using it, and  using it almost exclusively during same 3-4 years, have had at least 50% less plaque/tartar deposits for my dentist&#x27;s office to clean at my regular semi-annual check-ups--a fact much appreciated by same professionals and one that more than one dental hygienist has noted on countless patients who regularly use such brushes.  Oh, btw, when it comes time to replace the brush on these little jewels try to buy same replacement from your dentist office.  My dentist charges essentially at-cost, approximately $6 USD, for replacement brushes for my model while our local dept. stores charge anywhere from about $17-23 USD.</li>
            <li> This is a good purchase. Works well and comes with a free spare head. Let it charge adequately the first time though.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband who has a hard time flossing, because spaces between his teeth are so tight. He&#x27;s actually using it regularly now and says his teeth feel a lot cleaner. Think they&#x27;ll be impressed at the dentist&#x27;s office at his next cleaning appointment!</li>
            <li> Bought this brush to replace a previous Oral B.  Liked the way it brushed but it quit working in less than 3 months.</li>
            <li> My husbands favorite brand...</li>
            <li> I have never owned an electric tooth brush.  Just seemed sort of silly to let the toothbrush do the work for me.  My dentist then recommended I get one and said the cleaning is far superior to the \\&quot;old fashioned\\&quot; way.  She said that I didn&#x27;t need to get the top of the line with all of the bells and whistles - just get the Vitality.  I got it and I really like it.  Just leaves my mouth feeling cleaner.</li>
            <li> My wife came back from a trip and had left her toothbrush in her suitcase.  The suitcase was open and one of our dogs decided that her Phillips Sonicare Toothbrush would make a great chew toy.  After trying out my Oral B Toothbrush and enjoying it, we bought this as a new toothbrush for her.  This product is comparable to my high end professional series model.  Works great so far, has a nice little stand and the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> This does a good job for the money.  It seems to be holding up so far (1 month).  The floss action feels like it cleans around the gum well, but does not replace flossing.  It does not get between teeth, but it does a good job of working around the gums.  Not too rough, but you know that something is happening.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECCOMEND THIS PRODUCT.  FOR THE PRICE YOU JUST CANT BEAT IT.  ELECTRIC TB ARE ALOT BETTER THAN MANUAL.</li>
            <li> My eight-year old model 900TX finally rusted out inside and started misbehaving, so I replaced it with this one. The Vitality feels like it oscillates faster.  It comes with two oval Floss Action brush heads.  My spare round Sensitive brush heads also work. (The manufacturer&#x27;s web site has complete information on which brush heads fit the different models.)  Using the oval Floss Action brush head once a day, it does a superior job of removing calculus buildup in the most troublesome area behind my lower front teeth.  I alternate with my round brush head.</li>
            <li> Looked at all the reviews.  Decided this was the one.  Price.  Value.  Excellent.  Got it.  A word.  Wow.  I&#x27;ve owned all kinds of electric and battery operated toothbrushes.  I can honestly say this is the absolute best.  Why?  After brushing you can actually see the difference.  No lie.  You really can.  Made this comment to my wife and she agreed.  I&#x27;ll get her one soon.  This a no-brainer.  For the price and pure cleaning/shining/flossing/etc.  This is the one.</li>
            <li> From the first time I used it until now, I&#x27;ve felt my mouth clean.  I love this toothbrush, it&#x27;s well worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I have used Oral B toothbrushes for years without any problems.  I charged this one as directed and it worked great for a couple of days then got weaker for a couple of days and quit working all together.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re using a regular toothbrush, you have no idea of how really effective a toothbrush can be.  The Oral-B Vitality does a much better job of cleaning your teeth, and will easily get to areas at the gum line that you would really have to work to clean effectively with a regular brush - so you won&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 5 star rating is not because this is perfect, but because the results you get are well worth the price.  (To be perfect, it would need to be able to handle international voltages - but it can&#x27;t.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get one, use it, and your teeth and gums will be happy.  Go for the rechargeable version, like this one (not the battery operated version).</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to getting a replacement for my last Oral-B toothbrush since after a couple years the charge was only lasting a few minutes.  I should not have gotten rid of it before trying out my new one though, which broke almost immediately.  I waited so long to open it, I doubt I can even return it now.  I should have heeded the other review warnings and not ordered it, but I thought \\&quot;what are the odds of me getting a dud too?\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, horrible purchase -- I feel ripped off.  I am just going to go to Costco to get replacement, though I&#x27;ll probably fork over the hundred bucks to get the &#x27;professional&#x27; one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t like getting ripped off.</li>
            <li> Does a good job at brushing teeth</li>
            <li> Where has this toothbrush been all my life!!! This brush is amazing! I&#x27;ve always been old school and use a toothbrush. I also never saw the need for anyone to spend over $8 for a toothbrush since it does the same thing. UP UNTIL I went for a checkup and I was told I had 2 cavities all the way in the back of my molars of my upper jaw. My dentist showed me pics too. Eww! I always felt that my toothbrush couldn&#x27;t ever reach that far and this is what I get. TWO disgusting cavities. I had it filled, but the week before I had it done I immediately searched on amazon for this electronic toothbrush. Now, I can&#x27;t live without it. I feel it&#x27;s cleaning my teeth down to a micro-level AND it&#x27;s so easy to brush for 2 minutes because the electronic toothbrush notifies you when time is up. I definitely wouldn&#x27;t count 120 seconds (I&#x27;ve never ever ever in my life brushed for that long). THANK YOU ORAL-B!! Thank you AMAZON! I highly recommend this for people who are just starting out and then upgrade later OR just keep buying this because I know I would.  &#x3D;DDDD</li>
            <li> I opened the package , charged it for 16 Hours and when I try to switch it on, damn thing doesnt work. I think seller has sent me  a defective piece. Will return it ASAP</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist has been recommending the Oral B Vitality to me for at least a couple of years. She says regular use would allow me to extend cleaning appointments from every six months to once a year, so I actually used an Amazon gift card to get a toothbrush instead of books and music. The way I see it, a purchase of less than $30 eliminates at least $116 in annual dental costs and the price goes up every time! Easy to use. One charge lasts several days. Teeth and gums feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I had gums in really bad shape and the dentist told me that I should have flossed twice a day and used one electric toothbrush with the round brush. When you brush you keep the mouth semi-closed and the brush in contact with your teeth at the border with your gums, without pushing too much. This smaller brush allows you to get all around the molars as well. She did not specify the brand but she did say that it is not a matter of price, it is all about how you use it. So you don&#x27;t really need an expensive one. I bought this one because it gets great reviews and the price is very good. I love it! My gums are way better now and she very impressed (well...and I am very impressed as well!). When I went on vacation I brought the regular toothbrush and after a couple of days my gums were all inflamed again. I can&#x27;t leave without it! The only thing I would change is the design of the base. I have a tiny bathroom and I would love to be able to hang it somehow to the wall so that it is not sitting on the sink. Other than that is great and I would recommend it to other people.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush and it does a great job but the battery life has diminished considerably in a short amount of time. I have to charge it every other day or so.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t decide which brand or model to buy.  I am very happy with this purchase!  So happy in fact, I bought one for my Dad.</li>
            <li> My dentist has been trying to talk me into an electric toothbrush for awhile now. and all the ones they want me to buy start and $100 and go up from there.  This one is less than $30 and works well, holds a charge for quite awhile and has a timer. My husband has one he has been using for a couple years now and it still works for him very well.</li>
            <li> I was sceptical at first because of the mixed reviews i read but i feel like i have made a really great investment.  Battery inbetween charging&#x27;s last a long time.  With these heads i feel like this toothbrush really deepcleans my mouth!  You feel a pressure, and it scraps all of the dirt off your teeth with ease.  Make sure you buy the correct brushes that go with this toothbrush. I was trying to be cheap and bought generic ones and they are not the same at all, they dont really seem to clean your teeth at all.  Purchase this! You won&#x27;t regret it</li>
            <li> Love it great price great clean</li>
            <li> Needed a replacement while hospitalized as my old one was lost in transit to physical rehab.  The one lost was an older model and this one is newer and better.  Plus it arrived so fast..Only 2 days stuck w/ a manual one.  I have used Oral-B power brushes for 25 yrs and cannot feel that I have clean teeth w/o one!</li>
            <li> This works real good, and the price was just right.  I got the toothbrush in a very short time. I have been happy with everything that I have order from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I had an Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush just like this one for YEARS!  I noticed it wasn&#x27;t holding a charge as well as my husband&#x27;s newer version so I got a new one.  I figured a rechargeable toothbrush lasting 6-7 years (replacing the heads of course) was normal.  I&#x27;m still very happy with this product.  I like the circular brush heads, rather than a traditional brush head that just goes side to side. This oral-b toothbrush is a great price too. I&#x27;ve never used the more example ($100+) rechargeable toothbrushes the dentist recommends, but I can&#x27;t see a reason why that&#x27;s necessary when you have this one.</li>
            <li> Good price for a toothbrush that I have used for many years.</li>
            <li> First auto toothbrush I&#x27;ve had and it&#x27;s hard to get used to.  The hard part of the edge keeps running into my teeth.  Other than that it cleans very well.</li>
            <li> As good as I expected, which isn&#x27;t that often the case the case.</li>
            <li> Strong motor and the 2 min timer is great.</li>
            <li> So far I have had no problems with it. It works well and is compact enough for travelling but it would be good if it had dual wattage because I can bring it anywhere in the world to use it, as it is it can only be used in the US.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm. Encourages me to brush my teeth, and the timer is an excellent feature. I like the small brush head and can really feel the bristles working deep in the grooves and crevices of my teeth. Instructions on care and cleaning were easy to understand, too. Battery power is great; I can take it on a short (few days) trip without needing to take the charger with me.</li>
            <li> I would never ever go back to using a regular tooth brush. 4 people use this twice a day for three years and still works. Oral B you rock!!</li>
            <li> The last powered toothbrush I owned had a very large head, too large to fit around my gum line and accurately reach all the crevices of my teeth. I had been using traditional toothbrushes which also had heads that seemed too large for my mouth.     The first time I used the Oral-B Vitality I felt as if I had just come from the dentists office. My gums were bleeding and slightly tender.    This is not a bad thing! Plainly put,the toothbrush delivered an efficient clean. My teeth had a smooth, polished feeling and I felt the detailed grooves of the brush head to get into each groove in my teeth.It had been years since I used a powered toothbrush and this experience convinced me that using that a powered toothbrush will always make for an more efficient cleaning.      Since I keep the toothbrush in my bedroom (not enough outlets in the bathroom) I charge it only every other night.   It seems to hold the charge for the nights I forget to plug it in. Nice to know if I go on a business trip and leave the charger behind.    While it gets into the crevices in my teeth, flossing should still be a separate step for getting in between the teeth.</li>
            <li> this thing works great. ive had it 4 years and it dosent stop. my teeth feel so clean. buy generic replacement heads to save money cus they work the same</li>
            <li> This is far better then the water pick I have been using. First of all the overall price. If you even brought battery operated tooth brushes aor regular ones. Overall the cost will be more then this in 2 years. This is something you can have forever if you choose. This brush is a amazing. It gets deep down into the gum. Cleaning all plaque as well as your tyeeth. You wont be disappointed with this.</li>
            <li> Like many that have reviewed this product I had never used an electric toothbrush before.  I didn&#x27;t really feel like I needed one but this toothbrush has changed my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth feel much cleaner than they did when brushing with this toothbrush.  I feel like it really gets into all of the harder to reach areas (the head is smaller than a standard toothbrush) and I was able to clean the teeth all of the way in the back of my mouth with no problems.  The built in timer is a nice feature because I didn&#x27;t realize how quickly I was brushing my teeth before and now spend more time on them as I should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have with this toothbrush is that with the smaller head size I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m getting enough toothpaste on the first application, I have to usually add a second dab on my toothbrush to get the amount that I like to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like your old manual toothbrush you should really give this one a try.  I think you&#x27;ll find that your teeth feel cleaner and your mouth a little bit fresher every time you brush.</li>
            <li> I did much shopping before I bought the Vitality, but really, for the money especially, it does an outstanding job. My roommate has a more expensive Oral B model and the only difference between hers and mine is she has two speeds. Don&#x27;t know what you need the other speed for...and for 30$-40$ more than the price of the Vitality. Choose wisely. Stay Clean My Friends!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for more than a month and it works great. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my gum and cause the pain like other traditional toothbrushes do when pressing close to my gum to clean more thoroughly. This is my first power brush and it excels my expectation. One thing I wonder about is that if the charger will be wasted faster if I leave it plugged whole day. To avoid/slow down this process, I try to recharge it only when the brush head vibrates really slow and unplug it after an overnight recharging. I don&#x27;t know how other professional brushes compare to this one. But for just $19.77, I think this is a very good deal. I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great item at a great price.  This item was recommended by my Dentist,  as doing everything that the more expensive ones claim to do.  I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush!  It&#x27;s relatively quiet and the flossing action head really gets your teeth clean.  The toothbrush itself is a great deal, though the replacement heads can be expensive.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> After using other cheaper electric tooth brush units I decided to try this one.  A great improvement over my last few that I have used.  Removes much more.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a very powerful brush and much more effective than the previous Oral B brush I had.  I feel like it is really getting my teeth clean in a short time.  I bought it just after having deep cleaning and scaling so I will see if by using this new brush I can avoid having to have deep cleaning at least once a year.</li>
            <li> Noisy, but cheap and good enough for a kid that may lose the $30+ Unit from home.</li>
            <li> This is the best tooth brush! I bought one of these lost it in flight and quickly replaced it...Simply the best that my meager income can manage...Performs way...Over the Top! God Bless Y&#x27;all!</li>
            <li> Dentist praises my dental hygiene since purchasing this model years ago. It still works fine and holds a charge for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I had been using a Philips Sonicare toothbrush that was battery powered ([[ASIN:B000HHANVW Philips Sonicare Xtreme Sonic Toothbrush e3000, Blue 1 ea]] and it would work well enough when the batteries were fresh.  But it rather quickly would be less and less powerful as the batteries drained.  The AA batteries didn&#x27;t even last a month before you can see a noticeable drop in performance.    I wanted a rechargeable toothbrush that would keep a consistent and strong motion.      This toothbrush definitely delivers on that.  From the first charge (which took only about 8 hours, as opposed to the 16 the manual says it takes) it gave a strong brushing action.  I think this is important because it means you don&#x27;t have too press hard.  Just using regular pressure will allow the brush and head to do all the work.    I also find the smaller, rounder floss action head to be perfect to get to the teeth in the back of my mouth. No more trying to shove a large brush head into my cheek just to get some contact with my molars.    I&#x27;m definitely glad to have traded-up to this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> One of the cheaper electric toothbrushes I could find (or perhaps it was just on sale). Very good brush though, couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an old toothbrush. It seems to really clean well. I really like the two minute timer, and I feel that my teeth have been cleaner since switching to this brush.</li>
            <li> I am not the world&#x27;s best flosser so when I went to the dentist last week and got praise about how great my flossing was and how much improvement they saw, they couldn&#x27;t believe me when I said I didn&#x27;t change my dental habits, just bought a new toothbrush.  I had an electric for years, finally died.  This price on this one looked great, but I was concerned about the \\&quot;flossing\\&quot; claim on these heads.  After my dental visit I no longer doubt the claims.</li>
            <li> I just had my best checkup ever this week!  I&#x27;ve used a Sonicare for years.  My hygieneist recommended the Oral B a while back and I took her advice.    why I like my Oral B better:    1- The heads are small and round like the dentist&#x27;s equipment. It forces you to clean one tooth at a time rather than &#x27;brushing&#x27; like I did with the Sonicare (even though they told me not to).    2- It&#x27;s smaller and lighter.  The battery lasts about a week so I can put the charger away.    3- If it pops out of your mouth while it&#x27;s running, it doesn&#x27;t spray toothpaste all over the mirror.    4- It doesn&#x27;t have that chamber that loads up with disgusting muck.    5- Did I mention I had my easiest checkup ever? I was told my gums are in much better shape than before.    6- It&#x27;s cheaper.  &#x27;nough said.</li>
            <li> This model has served me so well that I&#x27;ve just ordered another, after the one I&#x27;ve been using appears to be in the process of dying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I particularly like the fact that it&#x27;s served me well all these years, and the two minute timer. Heads are extremely easy to replace and readily available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe (and it&#x27;s so minor that I&#x27;m still giving this item five stars) is that it&#x27;s hard to clean the charger (there isn&#x27;t quite enough clearance between the profusion and the guide, and toothpaste drips into the area where the toothbrush contacts the charger).</li>
            <li> I held out for a long time in buying an electric toothbrush, wondering whether it would really make a difference, but I&#x27;m glad I finally did. My teeth feel really clean after I brush and the two-minute buzzing notification ensures I don&#x27;t skimp on brushing time. It&#x27;s a good thing it came with two brush heads, cause now my husband has claimed the second one.</li>
            <li> This may be the greatest toothbrush in the world, but I&#x27;ll never know since mine didn&#x27;t work at all.  I got it, charged it up for a full 16 hours just like the tiny instructions said to do, and it didn&#x27;t even operate for a second - no movement, no noise, no nothing.  Literally, it&#x27;s a worthless piece of junk that I now have to dispose of - wiping my rear with the $20 bill I spent for this thing would have been a much better investment.  Granted, I should have read the one-star reviews BEFORE I purchased it - if I had, I would have known that this is not the first time that this has happened.  Hopefully, you&#x27;ll read this and other honest reviews and find a more reliable brand of toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Best tooth brush I have ever owned.  Still going strong after 3 years.</li>
            <li> After a gum graft my periodontist recommended an electric toothbrush and I chose this one, and I&#x27;m very happy with my choice. It&#x27;s a good size for my hand and the rotating head is nice and small so it doesn&#x27;t stretch my lips all out of shape while getting down near the roots. The battery seems to last forever - I stopped putting it on the charger to see how long it would last and its been going for 2 weeks. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this tooth brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d had an Oral B one before, and it died after about 1.5 years of daily use. I didn&#x27;t realize it at the time, but it was actually still covered under a 2-yr warranty, so maybe I could have gotten a free replacement, I dunno...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, to replace my broken one, I ordered this one. I really liked how it brushed my teeth, but it couldn&#x27;t seem to hold a charge :( I&#x27;d use it three times, and then it would be dead and I&#x27;d recharge it for 24 hrs, but then it would only hold enough charge for using it two times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At some point I realized I was brushing my teeth more with my \\&quot;backup\\&quot; manual brush than with the electric one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I returned that one, figuring it was probably only a problem with that specific unit, but my replacement brush (the same one) had the same problem. After using my first Oral B brush for 1.5 years without problems, this model wasn&#x27;t working out for me. I sent the second one back as well, and now I&#x27;m back to using my manual brush :(</li>
            <li> Sturdy and well made product.</li>
            <li> Great tooth brush. The price was great.</li>
            <li> This oral electric brush is best for me rather than the regular brush.  I would recommend it for everyone.  Just keep in mind the range of brushes available.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with my toothbrush but I suggest getting the sensitive heads. The floss heads caused some pretty bad gum inflammation by my back molars</li>
            <li> Love the brushing action.  Teeth look great.</li>
            <li> We have a Sonicare unit that we normally use. When we received this review copy of the Oral-B Vitality Floss-Action unit, we of course were comparing it against our Sonicare unit. So I&#x27;ll start by saying that we already agree that having an electronic toothbrush is a good idea. It&#x27;s now just a question of which one to get.    In comparison with the Sonicare unit, this one feels very harsh. We get zero cavities with the Sonicare unit, so it&#x27;s doing a great job. It&#x27;s not \\&quot;too mild\\&quot;. Our dentist praises us on how well our teeth are cared for. I don&#x27;t see the need for the extra agitation this unit gives.    There are no LEDs anywhere that we can see to indicate this unit is charging. It would be good to know that it is charging or is fully charged, so that electricity isn&#x27;t being wasted.    There&#x27;s similarly no battery indicator.    Finally, with the Sonicare, you get a blink every 30 seconds to change mouth quadrants. That way at the end of 2 minutes you know you&#x27;ve handled each quadrant evenly. With this one, you solely get a buzz at the end of 2 minutes to tell you you&#x27;re done. So you have to manage your time yourself. I like the quadrant approach for more accurate mouth care.    So yes, it is certainly better than doing your tooth brushing manually - but there&#x27;s many features they left out.</li>
            <li> Bought it on Aug. 3rd 2011 and received it on 5th 2011. The seller is Amazon. I used it for only 3 to 5 seconds, it suddenly stopped! I thought the battery had been out, so I charged it for around 10 hours according to the manual. Then it started to work for another 10 seconds and stopped again. The handle became warm after the second charging.     I have called Oral-B&#x27;s customer service this morning. They told me to charge toothbrush again.(Their argument is that when I was charging the unit, I was leaving it power \\&quot;on\\&quot;.) I did again with power \\&quot;off\\&quot; and this time it even does not function! The handle is become warmer!     The toothbrush did not even touch the toothpaste!     I know this problem may not be pervasive, but it indicates problems of the lower quality control of Oral-B and its unprofessional customer service. With these two serious problems, as to this power toothbrush model, I may not trust this brand anymore, unless they could provide me evidences to prove their high quality of their products.     My recommendation is to try other brands or Oral-B&#x27;s more advanced power toothbrush models. Do not even think about this model! Save your time and money!</li>
            <li> This is a perfect, affordable working machine! I always wanted a rechargeable toothbrush at a low cost, and after reading so many positive reviews I purchased the oral-b vitality floss action. I&#x27;m fully satisfied for now. Hopefully it&#x27;ll last long!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 5 weeks and love it!  Gets to, and does a great job cleaning, places that are hard to reach with a regular toothbrush.  It is very easy hold on to and maneuver around in your mouth.  It is very easy to clean and it holds a charge for quite a while.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This was our second electric toothbrush.  We have been very happy with this Oral-B product and will continue to purchase this inexpensive one over the years.</li>
            <li> When i have my teeth cleaned i always get -wonderful gums- that&#x27;s good news and it attribute it to this great and afforable tooth brush</li>
            <li> I bought the toothbrush because it&#x27;s really good value and a friend recommended it. However, within two days of using it, it began to leak grey water... Not sure it&#x27;s safe anymore?!</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for the exact same model, which finally expired after at least 12 years, but I think it may have been 15+.  If I get the same longevity out of this one I&#x27;ll be really happy.</li>
            <li> I have been using electric toothbrushes, beginning with a much more expensive Philips Sonicare toothbrush, for several years. After I broke two of the Sonicare toothbrushes (probably by pressing too hard on them), I bought the Vitality because it was the cheapest electric toothbrush around. To my surprise, I found that it works much better than the Sonicare did. The small round brush of the Oral-B Vitality can get into hard-to-reach areas and to hard-to-reach surfaces that the large brush on the Sonicare couldn&#x27;t. Also, the circular motion of the Oral-B Vitality works and cleans much better than the back-and-forth motion of the Sonicare brush. After I switched to the Oral-B Vitality my dentist was surprised at how clean my teeth were! Oral-B electric toothbrushes are available with wide a range of features and at a wide range of prices, but I found that the low-cost Vitality serves me well. The batteries of cordless electric toothbrushes eventually wear out (after several years, depending on use), but replacement of the low-priced Vitality is affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used several different toothbrush heads with the Vitality, but the Floss Action brush is by far my favorite. It&#x27;s unique design does, indeed, give it the superior cleaning action that the packaging says it does, and it cleans my teeth better than other toothbrush heads do. I highly recommend this toothbrush &amp; brush-head combination.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price! It really does work well and with a great clean feeling after brushing. I would recommend this product to anyone because you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> I got the flossing Electric Tooth Brush and I absolutely love it.  I like the grip handle because it keeps the brush in place and you don&#x27;t   have it slipping from your hand. When I&#x27;m finished brushing I feel content that  my mouth and teeth feel clean. I Love my Flossing Tooth Brush.</li>
            <li> I was debating if I really wanted to spend the money on this toothbrush or just by a cheap electric one.  It is worth the money.  It has a timer that will vibrate after 30 seconds and two minutes.  The head is small enough to get around every tooth.  It cleans wonderfully.  I am glad I decided to buy this.</li>
            <li> This little tool works superbly.  I really, really love it. The charge of the phone lasts up to a week. Great item!!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has literally changed my oral health. I got this upon realizing I had bad teeth and problems getting debris between the teeth. I love it. It is like a woodcutter (as one other reviwer put it, although maybe he said, \\&quot;Chomper&#x27;). It gets in there and gets in there good. Even when I floss afterwards, it&#x27;s very little left (and mostly in my teeth that are very close together).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cheap and I like the two minute indicator. I would definitely suggest this toothbrush and will continue to buy refills.</li>
            <li> Count me as another customer who got an Oral-B Vitality that does not work.  We charged it as directed and it worked the first time.  Then, after that it stopped working even though we have tried to charge it.  $27 down the tubes.  I threw the packaging away so I am not sure that Amazon will refund my money but I will try.  Mad.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works perfectly fine and is much cheaper than others on the market. If you&#x27;re thinking about buying an electric toothbrush, go with this one.  At first I didn&#x27;t think it was holding a change, but it turns out that it was the plug I was using in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> Bought it 2 years ago and still use it i just replace heads. It appears it is no longer for sell</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable and it functions good. I have used it over a year and I like it so far. But if you want to have something little more delicate, I recommend you to buy the ones with a little more soft brush and more sophisticated functions.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is a good solid product for the price. The speed is very good and it is not at all loud in its rotations. Then there is the brush itself, MAN this brush head is hard as a rock and beats your teeth into submission. I understand why your teeth get so white with this brush head, the tartar is afraid to attach itself to your teeth. I have had to wait about a week for my teeth and gums to adjust to the assault. The brush head is so big and uncomfortable in your mouth I almost stop using it. I will keep the handle and not re-purchase the brush head itself.</li>
            <li> Great electric toothbrush. Use it daily. On my second one now since the original one quit working for some reason. Like the fact that replaceable brushes are readily available for it and are long lasting.</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes can&#x27;t say enough good things about this brush...really reasonable price and the Floss action is the best for gum disease.</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with this rechargeable toothbrush.  Easy to use and easy to recharge.</li>
            <li> I really love this electric toothbrush!  I can keep it off the charger for a good four days so I can take it on short trips and not have to bring the charger.  It also can stay on the charger and it doesn&#x27;t ruin the battery life.  It has a timer so you can make sure you get your two minutes in.  I&#x27;ve had it for at least a year now and it&#x27;s still working well!  The replacements through Oral B are expensive! But I&#x27;ve found a substitute that works well for a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> My family has been using Oral-B electronic toothbrushes for years.  This newer model has a slightly bigger brush head and its performance is guaranteed.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this toothbrush! This is the best clean I have ever had outside of the dentist. I have to take it with my on trips because a regular toothbrush just can&#x27;t cut it for me anymore. Best toothbrush I have ever had, and I have had several electric toothbrushes. It also holds it&#x27;s charge for a few days at a time!</li>
            <li> Excellent pricing for this basic Oral B electric brush. No bells or whistles, but it&#x27;s just as effective as any other model sold ( I should know, - I&#x27;m a dental specialist :-).&lt;br /&gt;Even though it&#x27;s marketed by the mfgr. as &amp;#34;Floss Action&amp;#34;, it will NOT take the place of floss- NO brush can. Floss the teeth you want to keep, ... the rest will go away.&lt;br /&gt;My last Vitality model has been going for 4+ years, but the battery life is reaching it&#x27;s end.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, good quality and good price. It was everything I was looking for, the product met all my expectations.</li>
            <li> Bought for my 8 year old and she loves it!</li>
            <li> powerful! It&#x27;s nice that the head is so small because the kids are comfortable with it too.</li>
            <li> This is better than i thought it was going to be. this tooth brush makes me want to brush my teeth. Such a fresh clean feeling, gets the job done, and i think I&#x27;ve only charged it once overnight since I bought it 2 months ago. would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> my wife used this toothbrush every day and it works great for her, and it keeps on working good.</li>
            <li> Replaced my existing one that wore out.  I like it, use twice a day.</li>
            <li> i have been using electric tooth brushes for years , they keep my teeth clean and oral b is the top of line in electric tooth brushes.</li>
            <li> This unit is excellent and works as it should. Will last four to five days without a recharge if necessary.</li>
            <li> I have had this toothbrush for almost 2 years now and it is still going strong. It does a job of keeping  my mouth pretty clean. The toothbrush has floss action in it , which mean it get&#x27;s between your teeth and get out food and plaque. The best think about this toothbrush it does have a 2 min timer on it, and the charge last almost a week. I would recommend this toothbrush to anybody who want to maintain a good oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> This unit lasts for a few brushes still having fairly good power left and so does not require a recharge every day.</li>
            <li> I bought this device for the so called floss action but it doesn&#x27;t have any. It cleans the teeth but not between the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it the way the directions say and every other way and it still doesn&#x27;t work. I floss after every meal and use this toothbrush twice a day, and my dentist still gets on to me about not flossing.</li>
            <li> the first one I bought is broken in 2 days but the replacement is really convenient and I don&#x27;t have to pay for the shipping. the one I used now is in good condition. And it&#x27;s really good for lazy person because you don&#x27;t have to move your hand. However, there is dentist who suggest not to use this kind of toothbrush too much.</li>
            <li> منتج رائع الحقيقة يستحق الاستخدام مشكلة تكلفة الشحن ولكن المنتج ممتاز خاصة مميزةة التوقيت وهو جيد للأطفال ....&lt;br /&gt;أنصح بشرائه</li>
            <li> This toothbrush does a good job and has a pretty decently powered motor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rechargeable battery lasts a good amount of time, but is not user replaceable.  So, at some point, the batteries will get old and you&#x27;ll need to buy a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had a problem with the charging time, but when the stored power is low, the on/off switch doesn&#x27;t seem to work--it&#x27;ll just stay on until it dies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a pleasure to use this and its ease encourages me to use it!</li>
