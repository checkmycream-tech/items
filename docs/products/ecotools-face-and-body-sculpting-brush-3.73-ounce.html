            <li>nice brush.</li>
            <li>this brush is perfect for bronzer, both for sculpting or for a fast way to cover your face, neck, and chest area</li>
            <li>It immediately kind of fizzles out into a liquid when you spray it</li>
            <li>I am naturally more fair skinned</li>
            <li>Ok, I absolutely love this brush!  </li>
            <li>Perfect for blending and SO SOFT.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S HUGE!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really sure what to expect when I purchased</li>
            <li>I will be using it tonight on a client, I think it should be okay.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be able to use this brush till Summer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Buy it, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>I prefer this much more</li>
            <li>I am a makeup artist and love this brush.</li>
            <li>Love the lightweight bamboo handle, as well.</li>
            <li>It takes me maybe 5 minutes to apply it to my entire body, and it&#x27;s flawless.</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, it helps me get the job done :)</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>I love this so much !!!!</li>
            <li>The quality is excellent, no shedding and the hairs are super soft and densely packed</li>
            <li>Does has pretty good job.  </li>
            <li>This brush is great at applying everything, and it&#x27;s ridiculously soft.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really see how this could be a good face brush</li>
            <li>The soft, dense bristles are perfect for this and blends without removing too much pigment and negating my contour work.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much I&#x27;m buying more in this brand.</li>
            <li>This is a HUGE brush.</li>
            <li>This brush is huge, it should not say FACE and body sculpturing brush, defo just for body given the size.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s seriously HUGE.  </li>
            <li>The brush is HUGE.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve seen people compare it to the Becca brush) since it&#x27;s so huge.</li>
            <li>huge</li>
            <li>As an added bonus, these brushes don&#x27;t trap and breed bacteria as easily as sponges do and the brushes are easier to clean.</li>
            <li>It is great for bronzer and powder on the neck especially and overall I am so happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>Although it is soft and good quality.</li>
            <li>Buyer beware you can probably not use this for any face contouring unless you have a giant  head :P</li>
            <li>This super soft, full, and lush brush makes quick work of applying powdered makeups flawlessly.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t even have to clean between products.</li>
            <li>Wipe your brush clean again.</li>
            <li>Actually everything from this band is pretty great.</li>
            <li>Good for overall body work.</li>
            <li>Good for bronzing and highlighting the body but a bit too big for the face.  </li>
            <li>Bought it on a whim and didn&#x27;t expect much - now it&#x27;s in my top 3.</li>
            <li>and it makes it pretty easy</li>
            <li>Very soft brush and great for bronzing, a little large for detailed contouring but works amazing when u want a light bronze and contour on the face</li>
            <li>And for this type of brush, it is super affordable.</li>
            <li>those who have better skin condition than I have, highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li>It cuts down on application time and give a great finish.</li>
            <li>its really just ok, brushes are too soft, &amp;#34;bend&amp;#34; too easy and not getting the finish</li>
            <li>It has really soft, synthetic hair and is dense like a regular kabuki, but it&#x27;s a rectangular shape, which makes it great for bronzing or powdering the decollete, even around the collarbone area.  </li>
            <li>I really really like, really cool, especially for bronzers super-precise makeup stay at a super affordable price better.</li>
            <li>Good for contouring cheeks,brushing product down neck and declotte area.</li>
            <li>Though its big its so easy to work with!</li>
            <li>This is my first Eco Tools face brush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty stubborn though</li>
            <li>but this also to big for me!!anyway!i love it</li>
            <li>So soft ...very easy and fast to use...</li>
            <li>Love the soft, natural bristles!</li>
            <li>The bristles are amazingly soft and the different brushes complete their specific tasks perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Since the handle is wood and there is no ferrel, I would recommmend using a solvent based cleaner to spot clean, and shampoo it minimally due to moisture not being a good mix with the wood long term.</li>
            <li>Super soft.</li>
            <li>Well made, super soft.</li>
            <li>Super soft bristles.</li>
            <li>This brush is large, and works well for covering large areas (cheeks, jaw line).</li>
            <li>For me, I believe this brush may be too large to use solely for contouring.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find a brush like this in other brands and I am always so excited to find products like this that are Eco friendly.</li>
            <li>this brush is capable of everything BUT sculpting.</li>
            <li>Like it so much ...</li>
            <li>it so much ...</li>
            <li>I really wanted the Nars ITA brush</li>
            <li>contour/or bronzer and buff the whole lot together.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t buy this off Amazon, but it is such a fabulous brush that I just needed to add a review.</li>
            <li>I feel I don&#x27;t have to spend as much time blending with this brush because of it&#x27;s shape, size, and texture of its dense bristles.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is such a great brush-similar brushes are MUCH more expensive.  </li>
            <li>For the price, you really can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really matter.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>Apply blush with one end of the brush, wipe off your brush on the towel again if you have too much product and continue blending with that one end.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li>People with smaller features may find it&#x27;s too large, but it&#x27;s just right for</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for anyone.</li>
            <li>it would be fin for body contouring but is far too large to use on the face.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going for that carved out look, be a little more light-handed with blending.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s so densely packed, so soft, and really reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Using the other EDGE of the brush (the one you didn&#x27;t use for contouring), lightly dust on your highlight shade on the high points of your cheeks.</li>
            <li>I love ECO Tools brushes but this brush is much bigger than I expected and</li>
            <li>It is very soft.</li>
            <li>Its very soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft and picks up product well, hence the four stars.</li>
            <li>VERY SOFT</li>
            <li>For contouring or just a quick brush of loose powder all over the face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for blending harsh contouring, and has soft bristles, but it&#x27;s not good for too many things, because it was so big.</li>
            <li>This brush is incredibly soft!</li>
            <li>but it is a pretty big brush.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend it to anyone ;)</li>
            <li>Just tilt it slightly and lightly dust on the contour on the hollows of your cheeks.</li>
            <li>This has become my new foundation brush, its so much easier to use than a regular foundation brush.</li>
            <li>I use this brush to simply buff off excess powder from my face or to lightly apply setting powder, bronzer, or loose foundation powder.</li>
            <li>Works great and comparible to expensive brand brushes that are similar to this brush.</li>
            <li>So soft.</li>
            <li>Soft, though.</li>
            <li>I gave it to my 6 year old.</li>
            <li>The bristles are amazingly soft and plush.</li>
            <li>(The brush in the video was by another brand and cost ten times more--for real.)</li>
            <li>This brush is extremely soft and substantial.  </li>
            <li>It feels soft and plush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Wipe your brush on a clean towel and blend out the contour shade so there isn&#x27;t a harsh line.</li>
            <li>My face is very sensitive to how rough bristles are on brushes and this EcoTools not only is super soft but it definitely does the job!  </li>
            <li>It is super soft and I like to use it for summer time for a little bit of shimmer!</li>
            <li>just spray it right onto the brush and dot it up and down my legs or arms, then use the brush to buff it in.</li>
            <li>Very soft but didn&#x27;t expect the size of the brush to be big.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely versatile and blends makeup better than any of my other brushes of similar size (MAC, Sephora, realTechniques etc.).</li>
            <li>I bought it to contour my cheeks and its far too big.</li>
            <li>Was expecting a more thin brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of a weird consistency.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find this brush as I was having a hard time finding a brush that is for body as well as sculpting the face.  </li>
            <li>Between using this brush to set my foundation  with powder and using the other brushes for their functions,  my makeup routine is now so much easier.  </li>
            <li>This brush took a whole day to dry due to</li>

            <li> Good for contouring cheeks,brushing product down neck and declotte area.</li>
            <li> Though its big its so easy to work with!</li>
            <li> This is my first Eco Tools face brush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty stubborn though</li>
            <li> but this also to big for me!!anyway!i love it</li>
            <li> So soft ...very easy and fast to use...</li>
            <li> Love the soft, natural bristles!</li>
            <li> The bristles are amazingly soft and the different brushes complete their specific tasks perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Since the handle is wood and there is no ferrel, I would recommmend using a solvent based cleaner to spot clean, and shampoo it minimally due to moisture not being a good mix with the wood long term.</li>
            <li> Super soft.</li>
            <li> Well made, super soft.</li>
            <li> Super soft bristles.</li>
            <li> This brush is large, and works well for covering large areas (cheeks, jaw line).</li>
            <li> For me, I believe this brush may be too large to use solely for contouring.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find a brush like this in other brands and I am always so excited to find products like this that are Eco friendly.</li>
            <li> this brush is capable of everything BUT sculpting.</li>
            <li> Like it so much ...</li>
            <li> it so much ...</li>
            <li> I really wanted the Nars ITA brush</li>
            <li> contour/or bronzer and buff the whole lot together.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this off Amazon, but it is such a fabulous brush that I just needed to add a review.</li>
            <li> I feel I don&#x27;t have to spend as much time blending with this brush because of it&#x27;s shape, size, and texture of its dense bristles.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is such a great brush-similar brushes are MUCH more expensive.  </li>
            <li> For the price, you really can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really matter.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> Apply blush with one end of the brush, wipe off your brush on the towel again if you have too much product and continue blending with that one end.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li> People with smaller features may find it&#x27;s too large, but it&#x27;s just right for</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for anyone.</li>
            <li> it would be fin for body contouring but is far too large to use on the face.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going for that carved out look, be a little more light-handed with blending.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s so densely packed, so soft, and really reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Using the other EDGE of the brush (the one you didn&#x27;t use for contouring), lightly dust on your highlight shade on the high points of your cheeks.</li>
            <li> I love ECO Tools brushes but this brush is much bigger than I expected and</li>
            <li> It is very soft.</li>
            <li> Its very soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft and picks up product well, hence the four stars.</li>
            <li> VERY SOFT</li>
            <li> For contouring or just a quick brush of loose powder all over the face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for blending harsh contouring, and has soft bristles, but it&#x27;s not good for too many things, because it was so big.</li>
            <li> This brush is incredibly soft!</li>
            <li> but it is a pretty big brush.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it to anyone ;)</li>
            <li> Just tilt it slightly and lightly dust on the contour on the hollows of your cheeks.</li>
            <li> This has become my new foundation brush, its so much easier to use than a regular foundation brush.</li>
            <li> I use this brush to simply buff off excess powder from my face or to lightly apply setting powder, bronzer, or loose foundation powder.</li>
            <li> Works great and comparible to expensive brand brushes that are similar to this brush.</li>
            <li> So soft.</li>
            <li> Soft, though.</li>
            <li> I gave it to my 6 year old.</li>
            <li> The bristles are amazingly soft and plush.</li>
            <li> (The brush in the video was by another brand and cost ten times more--for real.)</li>
            <li> This brush is extremely soft and substantial.  </li>
            <li> It feels soft and plush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Wipe your brush on a clean towel and blend out the contour shade so there isn&#x27;t a harsh line.</li>
            <li> My face is very sensitive to how rough bristles are on brushes and this EcoTools not only is super soft but it definitely does the job!  </li>
            <li> It is super soft and I like to use it for summer time for a little bit of shimmer!</li>
            <li> just spray it right onto the brush and dot it up and down my legs or arms, then use the brush to buff it in.</li>
            <li> Very soft but didn&#x27;t expect the size of the brush to be big.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely versatile and blends makeup better than any of my other brushes of similar size (MAC, Sephora, realTechniques etc.).</li>
            <li> I bought it to contour my cheeks and its far too big.</li>
            <li> Was expecting a more thin brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of a weird consistency.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find this brush as I was having a hard time finding a brush that is for body as well as sculpting the face.  </li>
            <li> Between using this brush to set my foundation  with powder and using the other brushes for their functions,  my makeup routine is now so much easier.  </li>
            <li> This brush took a whole day to dry due to</li>
            <li> /&gt;That got me thinking, hey, I have that EcoTools brush that I&#x27;ve never used (other than to sit there and rub my face with it because it&#x27;s so soft), wonder</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s really applicable for the face.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this brush is HUGE so you cannot use it for contouring your face.  </li>
            <li> A lot bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li> Bigger than expected.</li>
            <li> I have used for my loose powder and matte finishing powder and not yet for cream foundation.</li>
            <li> I am not able to rate the quality of the brush itself because I didn&#x27;t even open it and asked for a return as it is to big for what I was going to use it for.</li>
            <li> I think the brush is too wide.</li>
            <li> Not really into it.</li>
            <li> disappointed that it&#x27;s so huge when I expected something smaller.  </li>
            <li> so it may not give you the sharp look you want.  </li>
            <li> No funny smell.</li>
            <li> Use the other end of the brush to apply bronzer.</li>
            <li> however it is very wide</li>
            <li> Cuts down on blending time</li>
            <li> The size was a little awkward at first</li>
            <li> It could be a little narrower</li>
            <li> I use this brush everyday to apply the liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> , so I can see why people would have trouble applying it without a brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a small round face with little cheekbones.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews on it, and one girl said that she returned it because she felt it was hard to apply, and the lady at the store showed her how to apply it with a foundation brush and it went on perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Way to thick.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I was not paying the ridiculous price for the NARS brush.  </li>
            <li> price for a brush of this quality is a serious steal.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> Plus, I don&#x27;t have weirdly orange hands when I&#x27;m done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> IT&#x27;S HUGE! A lot bigger than I expected. Not sure if it&#x27;s really applicable for the face.</li>
            <li> So soft. would buy again</li>
            <li> This brush is large, and works well for covering large areas (cheeks, jaw line). It is very soft. It&#x27;s just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> this brush is capable of everything BUT sculpting. can&#x27;t be compared to the Nars Ita brush in the slightest. Was expecting a more thin brush.</li>
            <li> I have two of these brushes, one for face and one for body. They have a great feeling of softness. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this as an actual &amp;#34;contour&amp;#34; brush. I think the brush is too wide. I&#x27;ve heard it being compared to the NARS Ita. It&#x27;s not even close. I use this brush to simply buff off excess powder from my face or to lightly apply setting powder, bronzer, or loose foundation powder.</li>
            <li> Its a great brush! I love it ! Though its big its so easy to work with! I got mines  to contour and it makes it pretty easy</li>
            <li> I did not like this brush.  It is way to big/thick to contour your face. I was expecting it to be a lot thinner.</li>
            <li> WAY bigger than I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Its very soft. Good for overall body work. I tried to contour my face with it but it&#x27;s kinda too big. U need to only use the edge of it.</li>
            <li> I had to come back and get another just in case.  I never want to be without this brush!  One of the ways I use it is actually to apply Mai Couture products rather than just use the papers.  This super soft, full, and lush brush makes quick work of applying powdered makeups flawlessly.</li>
            <li> This is a HUGE brush. It&#x27;s good for blending harsh contouring, and has soft bristles, but it&#x27;s not good for too many things, because it was so big.</li>
            <li> Good for bronzing and highlighting the body but a bit too big for the face.  Soft, though.</li>
            <li> Way to thick. And the handle is short and stubby. I gave it to my 6 year old.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really sure what to expect when I purchased but I have been very pleased. It has worked wonderfully for contouring and blending bronzer.</li>
            <li> This is listed as a face and body sculpting brush , however I believe it should only be a body sculpting brush. I am not able to rate the quality of the brush itself because I didn&#x27;t even open it and asked for a return as it is to big for what I was going to use it for.</li>
            <li> I use this to blend out my full-face contours, and to apply finishing powder, and to blend out blush.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so densely packed, so soft, and really reasonably priced. People with smaller features may find it&#x27;s too large, but it&#x27;s just right for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of my must-haves.</li>
            <li> I use it to buff in my powder makeup.  Does has pretty good job.  This is my first Eco Tools face brush.  I would buy again</li>
            <li> Like it so much ... They are really beautiful ... definitely I will ask again&lt;br /&gt;Like it so much ... They are really beautiful ... definitely I will ask againm</li>
            <li> Nice brush for bronzer.</li>
            <li> Wish I had read the reviews before I purchased. This brush is huge, it should not say FACE and body sculpturing brush, defo just for body given the size. I bought it to contour my cheeks and its far too big. Although it is soft and good quality.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I was not paying the ridiculous price for the NARS brush.  This brush feels great however it is very wide so it may not give you the sharp look you want.  I will be using it tonight on a client, I think it should be okay.</li>
            <li> I really really like, really cool, especially for bronzers super-precise makeup stay at a super affordable price better. You will not regret buying it</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush for contouring my face since it said it does face/body.  I really wanted the Nars ITA brush but it&#x27;s over $40 so I looked to this to be replacement.  Unfortunately, this brush is HUGE so you cannot use it for contouring your face.  This brush is meant for all over face to apply bronzer or a powder and probably best for applying bronzer on your body.  I actually was watching Keeping Up with the Kardashians and saw Kim pull out a brush identical to this and put bronzer around her cleavage area.  Since I&#x27;m in Michigan and it&#x27;s Winter I won&#x27;t be able to use this brush till Summer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still a good buy .... disappointed that it&#x27;s so huge when I expected something smaller.  Good for body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please make a smaller version for contouring face!!</li>
            <li> I have used for my loose powder and matte finishing powder and not yet for cream foundation. I have read online that it will work for such and will update when I get to trying that. (reviewed by Stephanie Smith)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s big. Great for the neck and body. Super soft.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this contouring brush! Well made, super soft. With a great price! Eco Tools is definitely a good brand of brushes to add to your make up collection.</li>
            <li> nice brush. bigger than expected, soft bristles.</li>
            <li> This has become my new foundation brush, its so much easier to use than a regular foundation brush. Its easier to hold and produces a flawless finish. You can dot foundation, blush. contour/or bronzer and buff the whole lot together. I love it</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this off Amazon, but it is such a fabulous brush that I just needed to add a review. This brush is exceptional for the price. No joke. The bristles are amazingly soft and plush. It&#x27;s extremely versatile and blends makeup better than any of my other brushes of similar size (MAC, Sephora, realTechniques etc.). I&#x27;ve been using it to blend my contour powder and highlighter after applying each with and angled blush brush. The soft, dense bristles are perfect for this and blends without removing too much pigment and negating my contour work. I feel I don&#x27;t have to spend as much time blending with this brush because of it&#x27;s shape, size, and texture of its dense bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price for a brush of this quality is a serious steal. Seriously. Buy it, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> Great. For contouring or just a quick brush of loose powder all over the face. I have the ita nars. I prefer this much more</li>
            <li> I bought this brush after watching a video on how to use this brush to apply bronzer. (The brush in the video was by another brand and cost ten times more--for real.) Unless you have a gigantic face or use bronzer all over your body, this brush may not be for you. I used it once and put it in my makeup drawer and forgot about it. It&#x27;s very soft and picks up product well, hence the four stars. I took a star off simply because I don&#x27;t have a face as big as any of the Mt Rushmore presidents and didn&#x27;t use it except once. I&#x27;m pretty stubborn though so I&#x27;ll try it again. Like if I have an allergic reaction to something and my face swells to triple the size it is now... Or if I decide to go for that Jersey Shore look without the tanning bed (for Halloween).</li>
            <li> This brush is labeled for &amp;#34;Face &amp; Body Contouring&amp;#34;. Well, it may work for the body but my face is just not big enough to use this as a contour brush. Returned!</li>
            <li> Not really into it. Would not re purchase. Too big. I thought I could use it to contour my cheeks but its a big body brush.</li>
            <li> I use this brush everyday to apply the liquid foundation. It cuts down on application time and give a great finish. The brush is of the highest quality. Actually everything from this band is pretty great. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Very soft but didn&#x27;t expect the size of the brush to be big. But it still works like how I want it to. It&#x27;s great for contouring on the face and neck.</li>
            <li> Good for contouring cheeks,brushing product down neck and declotte area. VERY SOFT</li>
            <li> Super soft bristles. I am a makeup artist and love this brush. Works great and comparible to expensive brand brushes that are similar to this brush.</li>
            <li> its really just ok, brushes are too soft, &amp;#34;bend&amp;#34; too easy and not getting the finish I was looking for...use with spray tan to even out color.</li>
            <li> I am the newest convert to EcoTools brushes.  The bristles are amazingly soft and the different brushes complete their specific tasks perfectly.  I also purchased the kabuki aluminum handled brush set with the concealer brush, bronzer brush,  contour brush,  and buffer brush.  Between using this brush to set my foundation  with powder and using the other brushes for their functions,  my makeup routine is now so much easier.  As an added bonus, these brushes don&#x27;t trap and breed bacteria as easily as sponges do and the brushes are easier to clean.</li>
            <li> This is such a great brush-similar brushes are MUCH more expensive.  This brush is extremely soft and substantial.  A great addition to my brush collection.</li>
            <li> the brush is way larger than anticipated. it would be fin for body contouring but is far too large to use on the face. it is probably 4 inches in length and 1.5 inches in width.</li>
            <li> LOVE this brush! Bought it on a whim and didn&#x27;t expect much - now it&#x27;s in my top 3.</li>
            <li> Ok, I absolutely love this brush!  It&#x27;s seriously HUGE.  It has really soft, synthetic hair and is dense like a regular kabuki, but it&#x27;s a rectangular shape, which makes it great for bronzing or powdering the decollete, even around the collarbone area.  I use this for bronzing my neck and chest.  Great product, like all EcoTools brushes.  Love the lightweight bamboo handle, as well.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t really impressed.</li>
            <li> Great blending brush and great transaction!~ Thank you ~</li>
            <li> Perfect for blending and SO SOFT. Highly recommend for anyone. Can also be used for contouring. No shedding. No funny smell.</li>
            <li> My face is very sensitive to how rough bristles are on brushes and this EcoTools not only is super soft but it definitely does the job!  I use it for my powder, my bronzing, and my sculting on my face and neck.  Saves me time!</li>
            <li> The picture makes it look way smaller then it actually is. The brush is HUGE. Not for your face or contouring, u can use i to highlight your jawline but defiantly not for contouring.</li>
            <li> This brush is incredibly soft! I liked it so much I&#x27;m buying more in this brand. Great for blending bronzer.</li>
            <li> After desiring a brush similar to this for ten times the price, I found this one. It is generously sized, and great for buffing your face after foundation application, blending after you have finished your powder products, or for body work. It feels soft and plush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a solvent based cleaner for the bristle tips, and then shampooed them. I shook out the excess water, and blotted the bristles. This brush took a whole day to dry due to it being so plush. Since the handle is wood and there is no ferrel, I would recommmend using a solvent based cleaner to spot clean, and shampoo it minimally due to moisture not being a good mix with the wood long term. Hint: put a rubber band around the handle and find a way to hang it upside-down while it dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: A great brush if you have use for it.</li>
            <li> I love ECO Tools brushes but this brush is much bigger than I expected and I don&#x27;t know that I have any use for it. Buyer beware you can probably not use this for any face contouring unless you have a giant  head :P</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been eyeing the Becca The One brush but finds the price so steep.  Discovered this gem instead. I love it! I use it for powder mineral foundation, bb cream, blush, bronzer, powder.  Cuts down on blending time, I don&#x27;t even have to clean between products. Hairs don&#x27;t shed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I have not given this 5 stars is because when I use this brush over my face that has eczema, the flakes seem to be highlighted and cakey in that area. I blot with my Quo blending sponge (dupe of beauty blender) to solve this problem.  I am looking for a primer that would hopefully solve this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who have better skin condition than I have, highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> Love it! Very soft brush and great for bronzing, a little large for detailed contouring but works amazing when u want a light bronze and contour on the face</li>
            <li> I did not expect the brush to be as big as it is. I probably should of looked at the dimensions but it is a pretty big brush. I wanted this brush to help me contour but it&#x27;s way too big for that. So I use this brush to highlight my face and it works great!</li>
            <li> this brush is perfect for bronzer, both for sculpting or for a fast way to cover your face, neck, and chest area</li>
            <li> You need this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this on a whim. No specific purpose, no need for it, just &#x27;cause I wanted it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, I purchase a can of Lorac Award Show Glow body bronzing mousse. I read some reviews on it, and one girl said that she returned it because she felt it was hard to apply, and the lady at the store showed her how to apply it with a foundation brush and it went on perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That got me thinking, hey, I have that EcoTools brush that I&#x27;ve never used (other than to sit there and rub my face with it because it&#x27;s so soft), wonder if that would work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I&#x27;m here to tell you that it&#x27;s THE perfect brush to apply body bronzer or self tanner! The Lorac one says its a mousse, but it&#x27;s not.  It&#x27;s kind of a weird consistency. It immediately kind of fizzles out into a liquid when you spray it, so I can see why people would have trouble applying it without a brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just spray it right onto the brush and dot it up and down my legs or arms, then use the brush to buff it in. It takes me maybe 5 minutes to apply it to my entire body, and it&#x27;s flawless. No streaks, no brush marks, even coverage. Plus, I don&#x27;t have weirdly orange hands when I&#x27;m done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used this to apply powder bronzer all over my arms and legs when I didn&#x27;t feel like being sticky and shimmery all day from the Lorac stuff, and it perfectly distributed and blended without holding onto product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really see how this could be a good face brush (I&#x27;ve seen people compare it to the Becca brush) since it&#x27;s so huge. But, it is the perfect body brush.</li>
            <li> I have a small round face with little cheekbones. For me, I believe this brush may be too large to use solely for contouring. However, I am starting to use it to help blend out my contour. Nonetheless, it helps me get the job done :)</li>
            <li> Great sculpting brush. It is great to blend out your contour.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find this brush as I was having a hard time finding a brush that is for body as well as sculpting the face.  I am naturally more fair skinned and I like to use a bronzer or self tanning spray or lotion on my neck and chest and this brush is great for applying products to that area of the body.  The size was a little awkward at first but once I got used to using it I loved it.  It is great for bronzer and powder on the neck especially and overall I am so happy with this product.  I couldn&#x27;t find a brush like this in other brands and I am always so excited to find products like this that are Eco friendly.</li>
            <li> amazing brush, contours the face brilliantly</li>
            <li> I bought this brush thinking it would be smaller. Well it&#x27;s *huge*! I&#x27;m not complaining though. This brush is great at applying everything, and it&#x27;s ridiculously soft. For the price, you really can&#x27;t beat it. You can use this brush to do your entire face. If you&#x27;re skeptical, continue reading and you&#x27;ll see what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Apply foundation using either one end of the brush or the entire brush. It doesn&#x27;t really matter.&lt;br /&gt;2. Set your foundation with powder unless you&#x27;re using powder foundation. Wipe off your brush on a towel if you&#x27;re concerned with product buildup.&lt;br /&gt;3. Apply contour with one EDGE of the brush. Do not use the entire brush to do this. Just tilt it slightly and lightly dust on the contour on the hollows of your cheeks. Wipe your brush on a clean towel and blend out the contour shade so there isn&#x27;t a harsh line. If you&#x27;re going for that carved out look, be a little more light-handed with blending.&lt;br /&gt;4. Apply blush with one end of the brush, wipe off your brush on the towel again if you have too much product and continue blending with that one end.&lt;br /&gt;5. Use the other end of the brush to apply bronzer. Blend. Wipe your brush clean again. If you&#x27;re concerned with product buildup, spritz with a daily brush cleaner or alcohol solution and wipe clean.&lt;br /&gt;6. Using the other EDGE of the brush (the one you didn&#x27;t use for contouring), lightly dust on your highlight shade on the high points of your cheeks. If you&#x27;re concerned with color contamination, use the sides of the brush entirely and not just the edge. Basically like a fan brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Done! You&#x27;ve done your entire face with ONE brush!</li>
            <li> Love the soft, natural bristles! And for this type of brush, it is super affordable. I would definitely recommend it to anyone ;)</li>
            <li> It could be a little narrower but I use it daily for contouring and all over bronzing. I just had to learn how to make it work for my face. The quality is excellent, no shedding and the hairs are super soft and densely packed</li>
            <li> I love this so much !!!!but this also to big for me!!anyway!i love it</li>
            <li> It is super soft and I like to use it for summer time for a little bit of shimmer!</li>
