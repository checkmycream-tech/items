            <li>now I understand all the rave reviews and ppl stocking up...best color ever, ez, and discontinued...searching for more...</li>
            <li>Loreal told me they stoped making it because they did not have many request for this color</li>
            <li>Just glad it&#x27;s still available!</li>
            <li>I am so pleased to be able to buy this on line</li>
            <li>When I use whispersoft blonde, my hair color turns out perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find it in the store anymore and was glad to find it with Amazon.</li>
            <li>I getallot of nice comments on this color shame it is being discontinued and I was lucky to find these three ,</li>
            <li>Loved the idea, didn&#x27;t really work for me</li>
            <li>this product is easy to use, the most beautiful blonde hair coloring i have ever used.</li>
            <li>The order came fine and it was the product I had always used.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend it to anyone wanting a light ash blond look.  </li>
            <li>The price is good and I will continue to order as long as it is still available to purchase.  </li>
            <li>The delivery was quick.  </li>
            <li>I am sure I will be purchasing more in the future.  </li>
            <li>If L&#x27;oreal knew how many compliments I get on my hair color from other women, they would reconsider making it more available I think.</li>
            <li>Whispersoft Blonde is the best to color grey I have ever found.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite color, can&#x27;t find it in the retail stores I frequent.  </li>
            <li>First let me say you will probably ONLY get the color results on the box if you have bleached hair or very very light hair. !</li>
            <li>but obviously it is worth it.</li>
            <li>Not bad for boxed hair color, certainly beats the price for a root touch-up at the salon.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Whispersoft Blonde for years and it is my favorite color.  </li>
            <li>This is really great hair color by Loreal...as usual!  </li>
            <li>very toxic, i was dizzy for two nights after dying hair with this color.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the fast service.</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t appear to do much for my hair.</li>
            <li>Might want to add an anti-red packet from the beauty supply, if your hair pulls warm or gold, as the developer in this product is not much greater than 10 volume.</li>
            <li>and I had to pay alot more for it that usual.  </li>
            <li>and looks more natural than the other blonde hair coloring i have used.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite hair color - I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so hard to find.  </li>
            <li>I was delighted to find it on this site as it has been difficult to find.</li>
            <li>FROM AMAZON.&lt;br /&gt;IT&#x27;S A VERY NATURAL SHADE OF BLONDE</li>
            <li>I have used this color and brand for years and apparently they don&#x27;t sell it any longer in the stores</li>
            <li>It takes out the red and grey in my hair and gives me a natural blonde look.  </li>

            <li> I am so sad as it is the only color I enjoy</li>
            <li> so hope supply lasts as long as she does.</li>
            <li> , IT&#x27;S A LOTTLE DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER SHADES.</li>
            <li> remotely that color when I put It on.</li>
            <li> I used it to touch up my roots and tone down my hair.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if it is manufacturing problem or something else , but never had any problem like this with the previous dies for blonds</li>
            <li> I have been using this color for a few years.  </li>

            <li> I ALWAYS USE THIS PRODUCT AND SHADE AND THEN I COULD NO LONGER FIND IT IN THE STORES.I AM SO GLAD THAT AMAZON HAS IT IN STOCK, SO I&#x27;M GOING TO PURCHASE IT EVERY MONTH NOW FROM AMAZON.&lt;br /&gt;IT&#x27;S A VERY NATURAL SHADE OF BLONDE, IT&#x27;S A LOTTLE DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER SHADES. I RECEIVE ALOT OF COMPLIMENTS. THANK YOU,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUE FROM NORTH WALES, PA</li>
            <li> Best color that I have found for being blond.....L&#x27;Oreal has wonderful blond colors and my hair stays in decent condition using this product.  Since I do my roots every 2 weeks, it can get expensive but obviously it is worth it.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t make this anymore so I&#x27;ve had to get it on Amazon.  It&#x27;s a very natural, pale blonde.. The  best blonde I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve used &amp;#34;quite a few&amp;#34;.  Wish they would start making this again!</li>
            <li> .this is hard to find...they always change my favorite shades</li>
            <li> I love this color. I receive many compliaments every day from people I don&#x27;t know. Would recommend it to anyone wanting a light ash blond look.  I have used this product for many years and my hair always looks healthy and soft----never burned or frizzed. I was delighted to find it on this site as it has been difficult to find. It seems to have been discontinued. I am so sad as it is the only color I enjoy wearing----and others love it on me. I am hoping that L&#x27;Oreal will decide to reinstate this color.</li>
            <li> This product is my favorite hair color.  It is one that has been discontinued by L&#x27;Oreal and this is the only place that I can purchase this product.  It has worked for me and I get many compliments on my hair color.  The price is good and I will continue to order as long as it is still available to purchase.  I have no answer as to why L&#x27;Oreal discontinued this color.  If anyone knows, please post.  This is the second time that I have had to make changes because of this. As I said, I am so happy to have found a source.</li>
            <li> this product is easy to use, the most beautiful blonde hair coloring i have ever used. and looks more natural than the other blonde hair coloring i have used. I Recommend this product.</li>
            <li> now I understand all the rave reviews and ppl stocking up...best color ever, ez, and discontinued...searching for more...any tips?</li>
            <li> Love this color!!!  Alas, L&#x27;Oreal does not have it anymore.  :(</li>
            <li> Its to bad Loreal quit making this product i use to use this all the time and had to go to another color i do not like Loreal told me they stoped making it because they did not have many request for this color they are wrong but i hope you have plenty in stock i will be buying again in a few weeks Thank you</li>
            <li> she loves it thank you.</li>
            <li> Not bad for boxed hair color, certainly beats the price for a root touch-up at the salon.  Might want to add an anti-red packet from the beauty supply, if your hair pulls warm or gold, as the developer in this product is not much greater than 10 volume.</li>
            <li> So tired of trying to find another color, have tried the 9 1/2&#x27;s 9&#x27;s, 10&#x27;s Going to just start ordering this online again. I agree it is one of the best colors! Just frustrated that it isn&#x27;t on the shelves anymore. I am just a person that likes to pull it off the shelf. Just glad it&#x27;s still available!</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for</li>
            <li> I am so pleased to be able to buy this on line&lt;br /&gt;it is no longer in stores and L&#x27;oreal does not say which new&lt;br /&gt;color it replaces.  I get so tired of finding a color and the&lt;br /&gt;manufactures just take it off the market.</li>
            <li> it was exactly what I wanted very happy</li>
            <li> When I use whispersoft blonde, my hair color turns out perfectly.  It takes out the red and grey in my hair and gives me a natural blonde look.  I can&#x27;t find it in the store anymore and was glad to find it with Amazon.</li>
            <li> The gray is gone. Hooray!</li>
