            <li>They are light in my hand.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So nice to own a pair of tweezers that allows me to utilize the Entire Tip and not just the portions where the blades happen to come</li>
            <li>These are a good sized tweezers (3.8&amp;#34; long) and are really cute.  </li>
            <li>These are better than anything I&#x27;ve every bought in a drug store and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>Most tweezers are much thinner, so they aren’t as easy to grip as these.</li>

            <li>The grip is really good and its sleek ergonomic design makes it easy to keep holding it for a long time without having a hand ache.</li>
            <li>I was concerned that these tweezers wouldn&#x27;t be able to get a good hold on the short hairs because of the wider, more flattened tip, but again, I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>The fish shape is really cool</li>

            <li>They grasp the hair the first time around!</li>
            <li>Well designed, easy to use, generally good all round tweezers.</li>

            <li>The shipping was pretty fast.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>These tweezers have a wider tip and makes the shaping up eye brows faster especially the upper part of both eye brows takes much more time because have more hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>cute and unique fish design isn&#x27;t just merely a design but an effective way to handle the tweezers comfortably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These tweezers come to a nice, sharp edge.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re one of those ladies that uses the flimsy tweezers that come in manicure sets PLEASE throw those away and get yourself a decent pair like these from KlipPro!</li>
            <li>They grab and hold hairs, even small, fine ones easily.</li>
            <li>They are stainless steel</li>
            <li>Here is a summary of what I thought about the KlipPro Stainless Steel Fish</li>
            <li>is really cute.&lt;br /&gt;**I</li>
            <li>These tweezers are really neat.</li>
            <li>I have had absolutely no problem with gripping onto hairs.</li>
            <li>and they are made from stainless steel so they won&#x27;t get rusty.</li>
            <li>It is so much easier to use these tweezers because of the fish design.</li>
            <li>really like KlipPro products and have tried their nail clippers and tweezer/comb combo already.</li>
            <li>I definitely don&#x27;t know anyone else who has tweezers as unique as these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- high quality stainless steel which grips eyebrow hair effectively.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;- the wide design of the body makes this easy to grip and hold when pulling out unwanted eyebrow</li>
            <li>come in a decent packaging.</li>
            <li>was lucky enough to get these tweezers as part of promotion in exchange of an unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>highly recommend these tweezers for their convenience and performance.</li>
            <li>These are really high quality tweezers.</li>
            <li>If you pluck at home,  I highly recommend these tweezers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, these are great for eyebrows, chin hairs, and even for applying false eyelashes!</li>
            <li>After trying out several cheap retail types, I know I do not want to go back</li>
            <li>will be keeping this pair in my makeup case to use daily, and relegating my other favorite pair to an overnight bag to carry when traveling.</li>
            <li>The  3.8&amp;#34; x 0.6&amp;#34; x 0.5&amp;#34; dimensions make them Easier to Manipulate without the frustration of slipping or twisting that I have experienced with shorter, thinner tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;The Slanted Tips of these tweezers allows for a Firm Hold of my eyebrow hairs, and I appreciate that they Sit Flush along the entire tip.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am one of those people who have joined eyebrows, and I have to keep on plucking them between professional threading so that 2 eyebrows do not become one.  </li>
            <li>was pleasantly surprised:</li>
            <li>No other form of compensation was received.</li>
            <li>As someone who has those pesky thick chin hair that look like they belong on an old man, having tweezers easily accessible is a must&lt;br</li>
            <li>I own around 15 pairs of tweezers but only use two, this one and my expensive pair from Tweezerman.</li>
            <li>These tweezers are just as high quality as their other items.</li>
            <li>only thing that makes want to give it a 4 star is the price; it is way too high compared to any other tweezer I have ever used.</li>

            <li> These are a good sized tweezers (3.8&amp;#34; long) and are really cute.  They are stainless steel so they won&#x27;t rust.  The tip is beveled and the edges match nicely for good &amp;#34;grabbing&amp;#34;.  The fish design is very cute.  A nice addition to any bathroom!  *I received a sample of this item in return for an honest and</li>
            <li> These cute fish eyebrow tweezers by KlipPro are so fun and practical. The design is so unique and cheerful, and the quality of this product is top-notch. These eyebrow tweezers are easy to use and comfortable to grasp. The wide body makes these tweezers so much easier to use than the narrow pair that I have been using for the past few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used an expensive pair of tweezers by a competing brand for the past few years. I found that these eyebrow tweezers performed just as well as the more expensive pair, while only costing a fraction of the price. Combined with the more comfortable grip, I have made these my go to tweezers and keep them in my make up bag at all times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these tweezers for their convenience and performance. I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. Any opinions expressed here are my own.</li>
            <li> I always shape up and do my eye brows at home. I always look for sharp tweezers. These tweezers shape like a fish and works perfectly for me.&lt;br /&gt;It has great grip to control the tweezers and shape up my eye brows within few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;These come in a decent packaging. The shipping was pretty fast.&lt;br /&gt;I have at least 4-6 tweezers which I have recently tried. Few have tiny tip which barely pucks 1 hair lol. These tweezers have a wider tip and makes the shaping up eye brows faster especially the upper part of both eye brows takes much more time because have more hair.&lt;br /&gt;I can have a good hold of the tweezers while in use. These do not slip.&lt;br /&gt;These are so far my favorite tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky enough to get these tweezers as part of promotion in exchange of an unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:b03b9acac0ea8a9b66272b7837d3adc3]] Here is a summary of what I thought about the KlipPro Stainless Steel Fish Tweezers:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- high quality stainless steel which grips eyebrow hair effectively.&lt;br /&gt;- the wide design of the body makes this easy to grip and hold when pulling out unwanted eyebrow hair.&lt;br /&gt;- cute and unique fish design isn&#x27;t just merely a design but an effective way to handle the tweezers comfortably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- a bit heavier compared to my recent eyebrow tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I received a free sample to try and review however, all opinions are unbiased, honest and my own. No other form of compensation was received.</li>
            <li> These work great! Best pair of tweezers I&#x27;ve had for a long time. Easy to grip also with its unique design. Also makes it harder for my daughter to steal them since they are easy to identify. :)</li>
            <li> Well designed, easy to use, generally good all round tweezers.</li>
            <li> I am one of those people who have joined eyebrows, and I have to keep on plucking them between professional threading so that 2 eyebrows do not become one.  It is a laborious task to pluck all the tiny hair with the pointed tweezers and they even poke my skin. This is why I always prefer slanted head tweezers because they are easier to use when plucking eyebrows and even a few whiskers that I get.&lt;br /&gt;The KlipPro Fish Shaped Eyebrow Tweezers are one of those that make the task of eyebrow plucking easy. The grip is really good and its sleek ergonomic design makes it easy to keep holding it for a long time without having a hand ache. Comparing to the one slanted head tweezer I already have at home, the KlipPro tweezers head is not sharp and does not cut the hair in the center while trying to pluck it. The tweezer is also light weight compared to the one I have and hence I can keep it holding between my fingers longer. The Tweezers are made with stainless steel which makes it rust free and are well made too. It even comes nicely packed in a box ready to be gifted.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that makes want to give it a 4 star is the price; it is way too high compared to any other tweezer I have ever used. I misplace my tweezers so often that I go through at least 3-5 tweezers in a year. But I will still give it a 5 star because it is of a great quality and the fish shape is really cute.&lt;br /&gt;**I received the product in exchange of my unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I received my Fish shaped tweezers from KlipPro, they were made of very sturdy metal not the flimsy kind you get from the Store. They were easy to use and grab hairs great. My daughters uses them for her eyebrows and said they were good for plucking them and they were a lot better than any age has used before.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are really neat. The fish shape is really cool and they fit into your hands nicely. I have had absolutely no problem with gripping onto hairs. These things will grip onto the tiniest little hairs no problem, actually. The hole in the middle is great for hanging in on a chain to carry with you. They are a little wider than most tweezers I own which is helpful and they are made from stainless steel so they won&#x27;t get rusty. Definitely a really great quality pair of tweezers. I definitely don&#x27;t know anyone else who has tweezers as unique as these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product received for testing and review. All thoughts and opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> It took me decades to realize that not all tweezers are the same.  I&#x27;m cheap, so always bought the least expensive I could find.  Mistake! Several years ago I bought a pair of more expensive tweezers by accident because they were in the wrong spot on the shelf.  I kicked myself when I got home and saw my receipt and how much I&#x27;d actually paid for them.  My disappointment was short lived, though, and when I found out how much better they were than those I&#x27;d used earlier, I was hooked!  A good pair of tweezers is an essential item in any woman&#x27;s makeup bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this pair of Eyebrow Tweezers by KlipPro for an honest review and am happy to report that they are every bit as good as my other favorite pair.  I would have thought that these wider tweezers would have been more cumbersome to hold and use comfortably, but that&#x27;s not the case.  I love the wider handle part; it gives a much better grip.  The business end is not as pointy as some I&#x27;ve used, but surprisingly, they&#x27;re very functional and grip the hairs well.  I&#x27;m post-menopausal so have to deal with stray hairs on my chin, and I was concerned that these tweezers wouldn&#x27;t be able to get a good hold on the short hairs because of the wider, more flattened tip, but again, I was pleasantly surprised.  They work great!  Not sure what the significance of the fish shape is, but it&#x27;s cute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be keeping this pair in my makeup case to use daily, and relegating my other favorite pair to an overnight bag to carry when traveling.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re one of those ladies that uses the flimsy tweezers that come in manicure sets PLEASE throw those away and get yourself a decent pair like these from KlipPro! I own around 15 pairs of tweezers but only use two, this one and my expensive pair from Tweezerman. I love these because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Zero hand fatigue! I have lots of wanted hairs that require tweezing and it doesn&#x27;t take long before my hand starts to cramp up. Not the case with these KlipPro tweezers. The wide design and brushed finish make these ergonomically one of the best tweezers I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;- They grasp the hair the first time around! I don&#x27;t have to keep trying to get a grasp of short hairs over and over. This considerably cuts down on my grooming time&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to keep track of! I get a little anxious when I can&#x27;t find my tweezers. However,  you might say these stick out like a fish out of water....sorry, that was corny. As someone who has those pesky thick chin hair that look like they belong on an old man, having tweezers easily accessible is a must&lt;br /&gt;- They&#x27;re just so darn cute!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, these are great for eyebrows, chin hairs, and even for applying false eyelashes! If you&#x27;re looking to get ingrown hairs then these won&#x27;t work. You&#x27;ll need fine tip slant tweezers for that. These are better than anything I&#x27;ve every bought in a drug store and the price is very reasonable. If you own a pair of tweezers but don&#x27;t absolutely love them, give these a shot.</li>
            <li> These are really high quality tweezers. They feel nice in your hands, have a comfortable grip, have a super cute design, and the slant tip helps you really grip hairs…what more can I say? It is so much easier to use these tweezers because of the fish design. Most tweezers are much thinner, so they aren’t as easy to grip as these. I am very picky with tweezers and these are great. I honestly don’t have one complaint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We really like KlipPro products and have tried their nail clippers and tweezer/comb combo already. These tweezers are just as high quality as their other items. All of the products have a nice hand feel and these ones are also stainless steel for easy cleaning. I used these a couple of times and I showed them to my husband and he loved how they felt, so we got another pair for him. He’s a big fan, so they’re perfect for men or women.</li>
            <li> Love the ease of squeezing these.  Very easy for someone who has arthritis.  Plucks even barely visible hairs with ease.very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful tweezers.  They work well and feel just right in my hand.</li>
            <li> Just what I have been needing! These tweezers come to a nice, sharp edge. They grab and hold hairs, even small, fine ones easily. They are light in my hand. The engraved fish face isn&#x27;t just for looks, it allows some extra grip to keep them from slipping. I appreciate that these were well made and the design is well thought out. After trying out several cheap retail types, I know I do not want to go back, I need something like these, that are substantial enough to actually tweeze, not cause extra frustration.&lt;br /&gt;[Tried Discounted Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]</li>
            <li> My first review was not the most positive but I take that back. I had received a defective product before.&lt;br /&gt;The item was replaced by Whole Health Supply company, without any request from my part, free of any charges, promptly.&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised: great customer service by Laura Manning, the customer care rep, so professional!&lt;br /&gt;The item arrived yesterday and it did its job fine, the tips were aligned well, captured every eyebrow hair I wanted&lt;br /&gt;to pluck out. And, it felt comfortable when gripping it, which is important for my arthritis ridden right thumb.&lt;br /&gt;Woohoo for great customer service! I hope you get lots of customers ahead.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> I must have at least 5 pair of tweezers in my house, but each pair presents it&#x27;s own downside when using them.&lt;br /&gt;When I was offered the opportunity to receive these KlipPro Personal Care Products Eyebrow Tweezers in exchange for testing and review,&lt;br /&gt;I accepted in hopes that I would finally own a quality pair of easy to use Eyebrow Tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;So Happy To Report That KlipPro Did Not Disappoint!&lt;br /&gt;The Ergonomic Design of these Eyebrow Tweezers make them so Easy to Grip! I have arthritis in my fingers and I am so pleased to finally own a pair of tweezers that allow me to hold them Comfortably for the duration of time it takes to pluck my unruly brows.&lt;br /&gt;I love that these KlipPro Tweezers are Longer and Wider than other tweezers I own. The  3.8&amp;#34; x 0.6&amp;#34; x 0.5&amp;#34; dimensions make them Easier to Manipulate without the frustration of slipping or twisting that I have experienced with shorter, thinner tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;The Slanted Tips of these tweezers allows for a Firm Hold of my eyebrow hairs, and I appreciate that they Sit Flush along the entire tip.&lt;br /&gt;So nice to own a pair of tweezers that allows me to utilize the Entire Tip and not just the portions where the blades happen to come together.&lt;br /&gt;I also love that these KlipPro Tweezers are made of Rust and Tarnish Resistant Stainless Steel. I expect them to last a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;These KlipPro Eyebrow Tweezers are without a doubt the Best pair of tweezers I have ever owned and I am happy to give them a well deserved 5 Star Rating.</li>
            <li> I loved these tweezers thier so nice and have such a nice gripe and the cute thing about them is that it looks like a fish that&#x27;s so cute I love it and so worth your money so if your looking for tweezers that are nice then you should buy thses they are super nice</li>
            <li> Adorable fishy tweezers. The size is nice, fits great in my hand, easy to grip. The end pieces close together perfectly creating a flawless grip.&lt;br /&gt;Gets all the little,  hard to see hairs too, just lay it against your brown and tweeze and you&#x27;ll pull the little, hard to get hairs right out.&lt;br /&gt;Not painful, doesn&#x27;t tug and release, it actually grabs the hairs and holds them and you are able to pull them out on the first try. I added photos of standard tweezers so you can compare the size of the whimsical fish tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;I love my little fish tweezers and they work wonderfully. You can&#x27;t find something this adorable at your beauty store.  If you pluck at home,  I highly recommend these tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a promotional discount to purchase,  test and review these tweezers. My opinions are 100 % my own.</li>
