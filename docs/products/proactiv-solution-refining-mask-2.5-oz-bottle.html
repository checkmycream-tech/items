            <li>I love EVERYTHING about this product!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Product works amazing when applied at night.</li>
            <li>The price is amazing here.</li>
            <li>Huge amount of product for a great price.</li>
            <li>It shipped fast, it is a great price for the size of the tube (70 gram) &amp; it does miracles!</li>
            <li>However, it is still a great face mask, and my face always feels exfoliated and fresh.</li>
            <li>Shipping was very quick!</li>
            <li>If you have any questions, please feel free to comment below!</li>
            <li>I love this product because it helps with the faster clearing of those unwanted pimples and blemishes.  </li>
            <li>and my skin feels and looks better.  </li>
            <li>This is why Amazon remains our favorite place to shop.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite face mask</li>
            <li>Since it was formulated to work as a set, it is better to use it that way in the end.</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t sting like most spot treatments do either, which is another plus.</li>
            <li>I think it works best as an overnight facial mask.</li>
            <li>I have never had skin issues until after 21 and most products I have used don&#x27;t work..</li>
            <li>After trying it even though it is OK in my opinion.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>It arrived in good shape and very fast time.  </li>
            <li>I would suggest this item just because it&#x27;s so cheap (and free shipping!).</li>
            <li>I love to use this mask because you can look at a radiant skin free of acne.</li>
            <li>My package arrived before the day expected and in perfect condition..</li>
            <li>I purschased for my fifteen year old daughter and she is happy with the way her face feels after using the mask.</li>
            <li>Lucky for me, my testing paid off!</li>
            <li>Very fast and very easy...</li>
            <li>Very well pleased and will order more.</li>
            <li>I only have mild acne, &amp; I decided to give this a try because of all the great buzz I&#x27;ve heard about this product.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the entire set, but this is by far the best product for blemishes and acne!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing because if the Proactiv wash doesn&#x27;t clear all of your face, the refining mask does!</li>
            <li>It has done a good job of controlling my teenage daughter&#x27;s acne.  </li>
            <li>This is such a good deal.  </li>
            <li>And this is such a good deal</li>
            <li>Im used to paying full price for this through Proactive...</li>
            <li>Still though, as a brand, Proaciv offers highly effective acne treatments.</li>
            <li>the free shipping is such a nice Bonus.</li>
            <li>So, folks looking for a quick solution to their problem (i.e. - clearing up your skin in time for prom or a wedding, for example) will be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall I love this product!  </li>
            <li>And let me tell you the sooner the better because now I am rocking some clear skin.</li>
            <li>If its worth paying $50 for then its DEFIANTLY worth paying under $10 for.    </li>
            <li>Used 2 bottles worth with no results.</li>
            <li>Clear skin is about more than just using the right brands....</li>
            <li>I thought that since it was just Benzole peroxide which we&#x27;ve tried in other products that it was all advertising and hype but a friend suggested the mask and repairing lotion and his face hasn&#x27;t looked this good in 2 years.</li>
            <li>Just placed another order for (hopefully) the right product.</li>
            <li>I first started using this mask as part of proactiv kits.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for several years and love it.</li>
            <li>and i have tried probably 20 different brands some costing more then $50</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say use this product if you can afford to consistently buy it.</li>
            <li>It was really inexpensive here and shipped within days!</li>
            <li>if it works great, if not, at least its inexpensive.</li>
            <li>There are more natural and cheap ways to help problem skin, such as honey.</li>
            <li>really - you just HAVE to be consistent and give it time.</li>
            <li>well, it still work for my large pores</li>
            <li>Thanks, and</li>
            <li>sending/charging me stuff when I may or may not be ready to receive them.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for making me the \\&quot;total\\</li>
            <li>and it would be really drying.</li>
            <li>Used it for a bit, i really worked</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t help improve my skin at all and believe it drys my skin to much.</li>
            <li>It was very sticky, and it was sticking to my face.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much improvement.</li>
            <li>It helps dry up your blemishes super fast, within days they will be gone!</li>
            <li>The face wash made my skin extremely irritated and since it left a greasy residue it caused me to break out even more!</li>
            <li>I was suffering through a breakout like it was high school again and did not want to pay the outrages prices of Proactive again at those kiosks.</li>
            <li>and this has improved the look of it by far!!</li>
            <li>Is this normal?</li>
            <li>Firstly, it takes a few weeks before you see significant results.</li>
            <li>it came in a very large tube, a lot larger than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>The manufacturer said that it would replace the screen with a refurbished one which I refused since the TV was so new.  </li>
            <li>It is way cheaper to order it on Amazon than from Proactiv directly!</li>
            <li>I just tried this for the first time last night.</li>
            <li>: I had a tough time rinsing it off with warm water this morning.</li>
            <li>having clear skin is about understanding skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I got a complete refund, plus</li>
            <li>, I think it really works to minimize my acne and has made my pores look so much smaller.  </li>
            <li>Gets rid of unexpected zits overnight.</li>
            <li>As an adult with acne</li>
            <li>I was on the search for something that would help clear my skin and fight off adult acne.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would seriously recommend this product to those of you who are experiencing acne bumps or any other kind of acne you might have!</li>
            <li>I was very curious to see if these little items worked better then the whole system.</li>
            <li>My face is back to normal.</li>
            <li>and his confidence is back which is worth every cent spent.</li>
            <li>I have very particular skin and not much works with it.</li>
            <li>The green tea works pretty well, but</li>
            <li>It worked fine and then, one day, when we turned it on, there was a thin red line running vertically in the screen.  </li>
            <li>It dried the hell out of my face and although it did make my pimples a bit smaller after leaving it overnight on certain spots, the pimples always grow back.</li>

            <li> I was very curious to see if these little items worked better then the whole system.</li>
            <li> My face is back to normal.</li>
            <li> and his confidence is back which is worth every cent spent.</li>
            <li> I have very particular skin and not much works with it.</li>
            <li> The green tea works pretty well, but</li>
            <li> It worked fine and then, one day, when we turned it on, there was a thin red line running vertically in the screen.  </li>
            <li> It dried the hell out of my face and although it did make my pimples a bit smaller after leaving it overnight on certain spots, the pimples always grow back.</li>
            <li> Also, If you only buy the proactive refining mask anywhere else you will pay twice as much if not more.</li>
            <li> It really is a spot treatment - I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it as a face mask, only because it&#x27;s a small tube</li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly, it is not a magic potion capable of \\&quot;curing\\&quot; acne.</li>
            <li> When I bought this bottle, it did not only come faster than I expected, but it was bigger than I expected as well.</li>
            <li> Sulphur makes it a little smelly, but not really a big deal since I only sleep w it on.</li>
            <li> This stuff does dry out your skin quite a bit, so using it as a mask (10 minutes)</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, I probably wouldn&#x27;t use it all over as a mask.</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t, understand the ways to help keep your skin healthy since, if you don&#x27;t take those steps, it is HIGHLY likely be disappointed</li>
            <li> My cousin had purchased pro active (which came with the refining mask and green tea lotion) and I decided one night to put a dab of the Refining Mask on all my big stress pimples, and once I woke up the very next morning my pimples were minimized and the redness dramatically reduced!</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s not a big deal because I&#x27;ll give it a try anyway, but I ordered the Refining Mask and got the Green Tea Moisturizer instead.</li>
            <li> Once you stop using the product, your acne will return unless you take active steps to maintain the health of your skin.</li>
            <li> I am an African-American teenage guy, with extremely oily skin and hard to control acne.</li>

            <li> I can feel coming on or even existing blemishes, &amp; they are both lightened &amp; cured 3x&#x27;s faster than other spot treatments vie used in the past</li>

            <li> Well, now that they been selling the 3-step system with the refining mask and green tea lotion</li>
            <li> A little dab will do ya!</li>

            <li> The only bad thing is the smell, sulfur of course isn&#x27;t the nicest thing to the nose... but other than that</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s also hard to wash off my face after letting it stay on my face all night or even&lt;br</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s probably because it was soooo cold outside</li>
            <li> I find it not only has an&lt;br /&gt; unpleasant smell</li>
            <li> We probably all tried Pro Active 3-step system and for some (or should I say few) it showed drastic improvement in their skin, and well for others it only made it worst!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a good product.  It has done a good job of controlling my teenage daughter&#x27;s acne.  She says she needs to apply it daily for it to have it&#x27;s best results.</li>
            <li> I first started using this mask as part of proactiv kits.  The rest of the proactiv kit products didn&#x27;t suit my skin, however this mask worked wonders.  I continue to keep a tube of this mask on hand as it soothes and cleanses my skin.  During a breakout phase this mask can be used on a daily basis.  Sometimes keeping it on even longer than the recommended 10 mins helps ease skin that feels like it might breakout.</li>
            <li> Hey guys,   I bought this product like 2 weeks ago and let me tell you how amazing it is! We probably all tried Pro Active 3-step system and for some (or should I say few) it showed drastic improvement in their skin, and well for others it only made it worst! I happen to fall under the category of the worst signs of improvement. The face wash made my skin extremely irritated and since it left a greasy residue it caused me to break out even more! Well, now that they been selling the 3-step system with the refining mask and green tea lotion I was very curious to see if these little items worked better then the whole system. My cousin had purchased pro active (which came with the refining mask and green tea lotion) and I decided one night to put a dab of the Refining Mask on all my big stress pimples, and once I woke up the very next morning my pimples were minimized and the redness dramatically reduced!! I was SHOCKED! So I had to check on Amazon.com to see if they even sold the product separately, and they DID! I would seriously recommend this product to those of you who are experiencing acne bumps or any other kind of acne you might have! The green tea works pretty well, but I use SCAR ZONE A, and it works WONDERS on my acne scars! (You can also purchase that on amazon $7.98). If you have any questions, please feel free to comment below! Thanks, and I hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I love this product because it helps with the faster clearing of those unwanted pimples and blemishes.  I put it on once or twice a week and my skin feels and looks better.  I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I bought the Proactive Refining Mask from Amazon and the price was excellent and the product is amazing!!!  A great buy from Amazon.com!!!</li>
            <li> This mask can be really expensive at mall kiosks! Thank you, Amazon for this great deal. Product works amazing when applied at night. You wake up and all blemishes are gone!</li>
            <li> This stuff does dry out your skin quite a bit, so using it as a mask (10 minutes) once a week is plenty. It works best for overnight spot treatment.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years and love it. It is way cheaper to order it on Amazon than from Proactiv directly!</li>
            <li> I think the refining mass is great!  It helps to resolve your acne problem.  It lightens the skin and gets rid of the oil and dirt that can become troublesome to the skin.</li>
            <li> We had this TV for all of 6 weeks before it went bad.  It worked fine and then, one day, when we turned it on, there was a thin red line running vertically in the screen.  It changed color about halfway down and became green.  The manufacturer said that it would replace the screen with a refurbished one which I refused since the TV was so new.  I call Amazon and the customer service rep was terrific.  Even though it was outside the 30 day return policy, she said she would see about a replacement.  The TV was not in stock so I got a complete refund, plus Amazon paid for shipping it back.  This is why Amazon remains our favorite place to shop.</li>
            <li> This is such a good deal.  I used to be a member of Proactiv, but did not want to be tied down to them sending/charging me stuff when I may or may not be ready to receive them.  So I quit, but missed the Refining mask.  And this is such a good deal, I think it really works to minimize my acne and has made my pores look so much smaller.  I have combination skin and I just use it every other day and have no problems with dry skin.  I would suggest this item just because it&#x27;s so cheap (and free shipping!).</li>
            <li> Excellent product, it works like a miracle! The price is amazing here. It came sealed.  Also, If you only buy the proactive refining mask anywhere else you will pay twice as much if not more. It was shipped immediately. And let me tell you the sooner the better because now I am rocking some clear skin. Thanks for making me the \\&quot;total\\&quot;  package from your total package service. Happy customer :)</li>
            <li> If its worth paying $50 for then its DEFIANTLY worth paying under $10 for.    Its really simple, just put it on your face, go to sleep, take it off in the morning, skin looks healthier.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!!!! It helps dry up your blemishes super fast, within days they will be gone! Also, this seller is unbelievable, you can&#x27;t beat the price and the free shipping is such a nice Bonus. Do yourself a favor and get this product. You will Not regret it!!!!</li>
            <li> Im used to paying full price for this through Proactive...and I got this at an awesome price!  This is my favorite face mask and i have tried probably 20 different brands some costing more then $50 and this works the best. Shipping was very quick!</li>
            <li> This product shrinks the pores.  I orignal bought it thinking it was the blemish control from proactive but amazon sent this.  Oh! well, it still work for my large pores</li>
            <li> Overall I love this product!  Personally it did not \\&quot;reduce redness overnight\\&quot; as the commercials said, but I also have very difficult skin so I did not expect it to.  However, it is still a great face mask, and my face always feels exfoliated and fresh.</li>
            <li> I love to use this mask because you can look at a radiant skin free of acne. Just place it over the pimples at night and the next day you got nothing.</li>
            <li> I found the mask to be so-so. Still though, as a brand, Proaciv offers highly effective acne treatments. But, here&#x27;s the catch - you have to keep at it. Firstly, it takes a few weeks before you see significant results. This is the case for any acne treatment product really - you just HAVE to be consistent and give it time. So, folks looking for a quick solution to their problem (i.e. - clearing up your skin in time for prom or a wedding, for example) will be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, it is not a magic potion capable of \\&quot;curing\\&quot; acne. Once you stop using the product, your acne will return unless you take active steps to maintain the health of your skin. It is often believed that merely using a product can be the only change made to help your skin. Clear skin is about more than just using the right brands.... having clear skin is about understanding skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say use this product if you can afford to consistently buy it. If you can&#x27;t, understand the ways to help keep your skin healthy since, if you don&#x27;t take those steps, it is HIGHLY likely be disappointed once you stop using Proactiv.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: Do use all three components of the set if you can. Since it was formulated to work as a set, it is better to use it that way in the end.</li>
            <li> I bought this plus the 3 step system from Proactiv. While the 3 step wasn&#x27;t superb, I ALWAYS used the mask. If I had a pimple on my chin or on my shoulder, I would put a dot of the mask on before I go to bed and they would shrink by the next morning! It&#x27;s amazing because if the Proactiv wash doesn&#x27;t clear all of your face, the refining mask does!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the entire set, but this is by far the best product for blemishes and acne!</li>
            <li> This product is definitely a must have! I only have mild acne, &amp; I decided to give this a try because of all the great buzz I&#x27;ve heard about this product. I love EVERYTHING about this product! It shipped fast, it is a great price for the size of the tube (70 gram) &amp; it does miracles! I apply this product on acne I can feel coming on or even existing blemishes, &amp; they are both lightened &amp; cured 3x&#x27;s faster than other spot treatments vie used in the past I especially have redness on my nose and chin from blackhead and this has improved the look of it by far!! This product doesn&#x27;t sting like most spot treatments do either, which is another plus. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This product works well. This refineing mask is a nessesary step in the proactive pimple treatmemt program.Too bad its not always included.</li>
            <li> For the price, this product is probably the best on the market in my opinion. I think it works best as an overnight facial mask. Put it on a pimple before you go to bed and the next morning its significantly smaller. It is definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> The Proactiv website can be expensive sometimes, so I decided to test my wits out on Amazon. Lucky for me, my testing paid off! I am an African-American teenage guy, with extremely oily skin and hard to control acne. I knew that the Refining mask would be, the only thing that would work for me, but I didn&#x27;t want to pay an arm and leg for it. When I bought this bottle, it did not only come faster than I expected, but it was bigger than I expected as well. This one is almost twice the size you would get shipped in the box. Now I just apply the stuff on my face every night before I go to bed, and I wake up with beautiful smooth skin!</li>
            <li> I have never had skin issues until after 21 and most products I have used don&#x27;t work.. I have finally found that by using the mask when needed, Biore cleansing wipes, and drinking Pearl Barley water as often as possible my skin is clearing up and glowing like never before!! My package arrived before the day expected and in perfect condition.. well it was frozen but that&#x27;s probably because it was soooo cold outside and I didn&#x27;t get to check my mail until 10 hours after it was delivered.</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t seem to hurt my skin at all, but doesn&#x27;t help my acne either.  Used 2 bottles worth with no results.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason everyone raves about this product - it truly helps with those stubborn acne spots! The directions say to leave it on for 10 minutes - I like to use it overnight. It really is a spot treatment - I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it as a face mask, only because it&#x27;s a small tube and it would be really drying.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical since we&#x27;ve tried prescription drugs for my son with no results. I thought that since it was just Benzole peroxide which we&#x27;ve tried in other products that it was all advertising and hype but a friend suggested the mask and repairing lotion and his face hasn&#x27;t looked this good in 2 years. His breakouts were really bad, we had to at least try it. I&#x27;m really impressed and his confidence is back which is worth every cent spent.</li>
            <li> Ordered product as the area I am now in cannot find product sold alone.  It arrived in good shape and very fast time.  Very well pleased and will order more.</li>
            <li> I was suffering through a breakout like it was high school again and did not want to pay the outrages prices of Proactive again at those kiosks. It was really inexpensive here and shipped within days! Thank you. My face is back to normal.</li>
            <li> I placed the order, and it was here within 3 days. Very fast and very easy... it came in a very large tube, a lot larger than I thought it would be. It&#x27;s giving me really great results. I would recommend this product to anyone who suffers from acne. The only bad thing is the smell, sulfur of course isn&#x27;t the nicest thing to the nose... but other than that, it is a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Simple review. It&#x27;s not a big deal because I&#x27;ll give it a try anyway, but I ordered the Refining Mask and got the Green Tea Moisturizer instead. The packaging says that the Refining Mask is inside, but it&#x27;s not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little annoyed, but not a big deal. Just placed another order for (hopefully) the right product.</li>
            <li> Used it for a bit, i really worked</li>
            <li> Great skin care product. Don&#x27;t need the rest of the treatments- this mask is the good stuff that make the rest of the stuff seem like its working!</li>
            <li> Love this product! A little dab will do ya! If you have dry skin, I probably wouldn&#x27;t use it all over as a mask.</li>
            <li> I use this with 10% benzoyl peroxide creme and it dries out the pimples when used overnight.&lt;br /&gt;try it, its only 4 bucks. if it works great, if not, at least its inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I put this on red, inflamed pimples before bed and leave it on all night. The inflammation and redness is reduced BIG TIME in the morning!</li>
            <li> Great product! Gets rid of unexpected zits overnight. Sulphur makes it a little smelly, but not really a big deal since I only sleep w it on.</li>
            <li> Huge amount of product for a great price. I will have this product well into the following year! Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> The Proactiv products are overpriced and undersized. There are more natural and cheap ways to help problem skin, such as honey.</li>
            <li> Proactiv&#x27;s Refining Mask is always a great product to keep handy. Whether you suffer from really bad acne or just the occasional pimple every now and then, it works wonders. Also the price here is unbeatable considering the retail price.</li>
            <li> As an adult with acne I was on the search for something that would help clear my skin and fight off adult acne.&lt;br /&gt; I read all the good reviews and thought this may be it. After trying it even though it is OK in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt; It didn&#x27;t help improve my skin at all and believe it drys my skin to much. I&#x27;ve tried the mask and tried dabbing&lt;br /&gt; it on acne spots at night before bed. I wake up and didn&#x27;t find any improvement. I find it not only has an&lt;br /&gt; unpleasant smell but it&#x27;s also hard to wash off my face after letting it stay on my face all night or even&lt;br /&gt; only for 10 minutes. For me giving it 3 stars is generous and I thought there brand and product was suppose&lt;br /&gt; to be one of the best. Well maybe it is for others but not for me. I will not buy it again. You might consider&lt;br /&gt; passing yourself and buy something else.</li>
            <li> I just tried this for the first time last night. As soon as I put this on, I felt the tingling sensation going through my face. In addition, I had a surprise pimple when I woke up 2 days ago, and now it has got smaller overnight. So it seems to be working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One frustrating thing (the reason for -1 star), and I hope someone could help me with this: I had a tough time rinsing it off with warm water this morning. It was very sticky, and it was sticking to my face. I ended up using a issue to wipe it off, and I could see still some residual on my face. Is this normal?</li>
            <li> It dried the hell out of my face and although it did make my pimples a bit smaller after leaving it overnight on certain spots, the pimples always grow back. Proactiv is overrated.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this product and it was a fair price. I purschased for my fifteen year old daughter and she is happy with the way her face feels after using the mask.</li>
            <li> I have very particular skin and not much works with it. This product was no exception. I didn&#x27;t see much improvement.</li>
