    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I love this face mask!!!</li>
            <li>Shipment was excellent, but you have to use a lot of the product to get a good peel.</li>
            <li>it does hurt a bit to pull of if you don&#x27;t wax your face XD but still a great buy</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;m happy with it - hopefully it will help me with my not-very-attractive-to-other-women problem...</li>
            <li>I love this!!</li>
            <li>However, not too good.</li>
            <li>good for clearing up blackheads</li>
            <li>I love this face mask, it works so good.</li>
            <li>this product was okay -</li>
            <li>You need to be able to withstand pain.</li>
            <li>and it still wont pull out blackheads on the top front of my nose like strips do.</li>
            <li>Pores shrink more and more with each use.</li>
            <li>I like the face peel off a lot more.</li>
            <li>I use it twice a week with my Clarisonic, so my nose and face are just wonderfully clean!</li>
            <li>It came a week earlier than expected,so that was great :).</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Pore strips work better, but this is still fun, cute packaging</li>
            <li>But it does speak to the Korean makeup trend right now, so if you are putting together a basket as a gift, I suggest including it because it is kind of cool to use.</li>
            <li>Unless you have huge pores, do not buy this.  </li>
            <li>did not remove blackheads as much as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>I thought it did a fantastic job.</li>
            <li>I did not find this one to be as effective, therefore I tend to not grab it as much.</li>
            <li>It is not that good to help with my blackheads, but it is soft.</li>
            <li>Great to use in place of those plaster type nose masks as it is much softer and conforms to any nose shape as well as t zone and chin if needed and at a decent price.</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>but regardless, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>it took those babies right out.</li>
            <li>Seems to work pretty well, put it on evenly and</li>
            <li>i know use have a hot shower</li>
            <li>This tube well last you up to three usage the most.</li>
            <li>it pretty much is glue.</li>
            <li>This pore strip paste works very well</li>
            <li>Also it hurts so much when you peel it off .</li>
            <li>: this did a decent  job with getting the &amp;#34;strawberry nose&amp;#34;,  I tried it on my check with blackheads and whiteheads</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t dare try putting this on any facial area, and the instructions say only to apply at most twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I picked up this super pore cleaner up to help cut back on the blackhead and oil that collects in my nose over the week.  </li>
            <li>I use it biweekly along with my normal face wash</li>
            <li>Even with thick even coverage, there were still a few leftover blk heads which I wasn&#x27;t to happy about.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see big effect.</li>
            <li>make sure that you use a lot of this because a thin layer won&#x27;t clear them out.</li>
            <li>It does not work at all, and mine came with only half full content.</li>
            <li>It only does great if you have really BIG pores, so if you have medium/small size pores you really can&#x27;t see a difference :(.</li>
            <li>should of they barely had any directions like so.</li>
            <li>I probably needed to use right after a shower or something.. not sure.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> There were some pros and cons with this product so here I go- pro: this did a decent  job with getting the &amp;#34;strawberry nose&amp;#34;,  I tried it on my check with blackheads and whiteheads it took those babies right out. Cons - the smell, constant reapplying when applying,  make sure that you use a lot of this because a thin layer won&#x27;t clear them out. Even with thick even coverage, there were still a few leftover blk heads which I wasn&#x27;t to happy about. I had to apply 3 times to fully reduce them fully.</li>
            <li> I thought this was going to out-do all other blackhead removal peels I&#x27;ve done after reading the description. It doesn&#x27;t. It is still a peel though.</li>
            <li> This pore strip paste works very well it does hurt a bit to pull of if you don&#x27;t wax your face XD but still a great buy</li>
            <li> I love this!! it works wonders. i feel my blackheads disappearing with every use. I thought it would be bigger but regardless, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> this product was okay - did not remove blackheads as much as I would have liked. I probably needed to use right after a shower or something.. not sure.</li>
            <li> I love this face mask!!! I&#x27;ll definitely continue using it, my black heads are going away before my eyes!! xD</li>
            <li> Not sure...difficult to peel off, and a bit &#x27;rough&#x27;.  It makes me wonder if it will damage my skin.  Nose became red after peeling off that area.</li>
            <li> I just threw it in the trash.  It did go on messy, get everywhere and hurt really bad when I peeled it off....so if any of that appeals to you, by all means purchase this stuff.</li>
            <li> The bottle came only half full, i had to actually roll the tube to get some out, messy, sticky, and hurts peeling off and it didn&#x27;t even do anything for my nose... still the same blackheads.</li>
            <li> Unless you have huge pores, do not buy this.  It does not work at all, and mine came with only half full content.</li>
            <li> It came a week earlier than expected,so that was great :). It&#x27;s just like the photo so their is no English words. It only does great if you have really BIG pores, so if you have medium/small size pores you really can&#x27;t see a difference :(. Also it hurts so much when you peel it off . You need to be able to withstand pain.</li>
            <li> It is not that good to help with my blackheads, but it is soft. I must wait for long time to get out the white stuff.</li>
            <li> Made me break out, seems like it is made out of white glue.</li>
            <li> Trying to get rid of my ugly backheads, I decided to try this product from Japan.  Seems to work pretty well, put it on evenly and a short time later you peel it off.  It&#x27;s almost like taking elmers glue to your face (not that I&#x27;ve done this...) and peeling it off.... I wouldn&#x27;t dare try putting this on any facial area, and the instructions say only to apply at most twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;m happy with it - hopefully it will help me with my not-very-attractive-to-other-women problem...</li>

            <li> it Doesn&#x27;t work like all the reviews says</li>
            <li> It contains parabens :( It smells feels and looks like white elmers glue. it pretty much is glue. you peel it off and it hurts just like any peel off mask. It only removes the little black heads on the corners of my nose. i know use have a hot shower and it still wont pull out blackheads on the top front of my nose like strips do. i&#x27;m using it since i purchased it, so it&#x27;s not that bad. It makes me nose feel and look cleaner and less clogged.</li>
            <li> Great to use in place of those plaster type nose masks as it is much softer and conforms to any nose shape as well as t zone and chin if needed and at a decent price.</li>
            <li> Not bad. However, not too good. I don&#x27;t really see big effect. I got a small nose and it seems that I can use this for a long time.</li>
            <li> I thought it did a fantastic job. Pores shrink more and more with each use. Easy to use. I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> good for clearing up blackheads</li>
            <li> I like the face peel off a lot more. I did not find this one to be as effective, therefore I tend to not grab it as much.</li>
