    <ol>
            <li>But it comes out that their moisturizer is the BEST for me.</li>
            <li>I have always struggled with my skin and this is the best it has ever looked.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the best moisturizer ever!  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer is great at mattifying your skin and making you look like you have some type of desire to bleach your skin.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer lasts all work day, though it smells so good</li>
            <li>It would work perfect for people with light skin.</li>
            <li>but I would imagine under an oil free foundation, this would be awesome.</li>
            <li>Put it on right after a shower to get the best results.</li>
            <li>and I am in love!  </li>
            <li>This is effective to use in the summer months to maintain a matte complexion.</li>
            <li>It is the absolute best moisturizer to wear under makeup, and it works fabulously all on its own as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked this one better than Formula 10-0-6.</li>
            <li>If you liked this, please contact the company (easy to do via their Facebook pages) and plead for its return.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it had to do with my acne and oily skin.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t going to wait it out and see if things got better.</li>
            <li>and I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>This product is absolutely phenomenal.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this.  </li>
            <li>I thought maybe I should use more</li>
            <li>It controls oil better and has a nice light coverage.  </li>
            <li>and my skin is still shine free!</li>
            <li>I just started using this product yesterday and I am already in love with it</li>
            <li>Any more than that</li>
            <li>Love this lotion, it helps with my oily skin.  </li>
            <li>It looked like they kept the rice-idea for oil-absorbtion but mostly in a wash.</li>
            <li>This product does the job mattify and good oil control, I have a very oily skin and using this helped me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think can do much good, because they aren&#x27;t really something you apply to stay on your face long-term.</li>
            <li>it gave me a nice matte finish mixed with a foundation for good light coverage.</li>
            <li>I never had huge problems but this improved the condition of my skin</li>
            <li>It smells like a cheap air freshener, also.</li>
            <li>Amazingly smooth and</li>
            <li>it goes smoothly on your skin</li>
            <li>It literally keeps my face ahine free all day.</li>
            <li>and it does it right on an average budget rather than that of a makeup artist or something.&lt;br /&gt;Not that makeup artists are more well-off or anything, just that they are the pros at beautiful faces and most convenient oil control solutions</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for having this!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried pretty much everything to control my oily skin and this is by far the best!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this moisturizer and wish it wasn&#x27;t discontinued in stores, but as long as amazon carries it, I&#x27;m good.</li>
            <li>No matte lotion is better even the higher priced one&#x27;s can&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li>My face is fair already, this lotion highlights my fairmess especially in the Summer where I have a bit of a tan on my face/neck.</li>
            <li>and i love the rosy scent, the scent is not irritating and the lotion keeps your face moisturize, but not oily feeling..</li>
            <li>I REALLY wanted to love it</li>
            <li>I had been looking for a good mattifying moisturizer when I found this at Big Lots for $3.80.</li>
            <li>Thanks :)</li>
            <li>the finishing color is absolutely gorgeous as long as you have medium to light skin tone.</li>
            <li>This is seriously one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever found.  </li>
            <li>This product makes my face feel clean and look fresh.</li>
            <li>Such a bummer as it had such great reviews when I bought it!</li>
            <li>On the plus side, it didn&#x27;t have a very strong scent and came of easily with facial cleanser and water.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li>First time&#x27;s a charm!</li>
            <li>Make sure to exfoliate any dry patches as it will make those more noticeable and to rub in well.</li>
            <li>The true test will be hot weather.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes after reading so many positive reviews on this site.</li>
            <li>so I bought this because of all thge other great reviews on how it worked really well to get rid of shine and give a matte effect.</li>
            <li>IT REALLY WORKS!</li>
            <li>but it only worked okay.  </li>
            <li>When I first out it on I couldn&#x27;t get it to sink into my skin.</li>
            <li>5 - stars for Clean &amp; Clear Mattifying Moisturizer.</li>
            <li>a normally oily-faced person, I just realized that mattifying moisturizers exist and decided to try out this product because the price is right, I already use the Clean &amp; Clear astringent</li>
            <li>I still was using Clean &amp; Clear oil absorbing sheets by 10:00am.  </li>
            <li>Its nothing like the Clean and Clear Pore Minimizing Moisturizer (which I highly recommend for those looking for an inexpensive moisturizer).</li>
            <li>I did not ecpect much from a Big Lots or Clean and Clear product but this product had not disappointed me.</li>
            <li>It completley covers my oil for the whole day</li>
            <li>I am very upset this item is discontinued and worried I will never find a close match for the price.</li>
            <li>This seemed to fit the bill, but when applied to my face after showering, it doesn&#x27;t blend in causing my face to have a white hue.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to everyone who posted that they can&#x27;t find it</li>
            <li>and she said this made her look very ashy..</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really see a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I bought this to use primarily as moisturizer, because that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s initially advertised as,</li>
            <li>Also, being something that I keep on my face to control oil, I am positive that this product has been the main reason my acne is under control.</li>
            <li>Yes it may seem white at first, but it will soak in especially if you put foundation on top of it.  </li>
            <li>But overall not bad for the price and time</li>
            <li>but it does the job, and actually makes my make up look TEN times better</li>
            <li>, I wear it everyday under my matte foundation, and it actually blends very easily and leaves your skin feeling fresh and moisturized and matte.</li>
            <li>am actually saddened that Clean &amp; Clear did not think enough of people of color to tint it, test it better, or just market it for specific complexions.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product</li>
            <li>When I looked at Clean and Clear&#x27;s facebook pages, it looked as if they are doing marketing targeted to different countries and</li>
            <li>That was a real deal, but even at the regular price I think this is an awesome product--it has such a specific job that is hard to carry out</li>
            <li>The only thing i will say is that it does make your face look paler so you would definatle need to apply at least a tinted moisturizer over it but other than that it is perfect.</li>
            <li>Clearly this was a very good line -- I have also tried and liked the \\&quot;Finishes\\&quot; pump-bottle cleanser -- that was not on the market for long enough to find its niche.  :(</li>
            <li>Ok, so I&#x27;m not going crazy that I can&#x27;t find this lotion any more.  </li>
            <li>(not sure what a better way to describe it would be).  </li>
            <li>This is the only SPF cream I have ever WANTED to have on my skin, which is relentlessly greasy at the times of year when one really wants SPF on.</li>
            <li>I had problems for years always looking very shiny and extra shiny</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought several extras to stock up, but I really will be heartbroken if they discontinued it.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer made my skin a chalky white and didn&#x27;t &#x27;sink in&#x27; at all, as much as I tried to rub it in.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nearly 8:30 PM &amp; my face is still holding up well despite the humid day we&#x27;ve had today.</li>
            <li>--I bought it once at Walmart to try, loved it, and saw it randomly at Ross and stocked up.</li>
            <li>First, I think this is just a really simple product that got the oil-control down right with the rice powder in it.</li>
            <li>can still see dry skin in certain areas</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find it on their official site or in any major retailer. :&#x27;-(</li>
            <li>Amazingly, it actually delivers as promises, and &#x27;mattifies&#x27; -- and sinks right into the skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll start by saying, I&#x27;m 46 years old &amp; have had extremely oily skin my whole life.</li>
            <li>I have used all of it, made it last a really long time since you don&#x27;t need to use that much.  </li>
            <li>use this under the eyes, especially if you have sensitive skin there.</li>
            <li>I still looked ashy.&lt;br /&gt;Clean &amp; Clear obviously wasn&#x27;t thinking of African Americans when they made this&lt;</li>
            <li>this product is likely not for those with bad acne or very dark skin, but it is perfect for my medium tone and oil.</li>
            <li>I only use a pea sized drop or less and it spreads very well.</li>
            <li>No matter how little you put on or how much you rub in</li>
    </ol>

            <li> No matter how little you put on or how much you rub in</li>
            <li> so if you are like me you end up looking very ashy and pale</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect a moisturizer to eliminate shine all day, and this one does a decent job of reducing shine until late morning (when applied in the early morning).</li>
            <li> However, it takes too long to absorb and my face is left looking way too white.</li>
            <li> That being said what I can remember is that I disliked this so much that I threw it out after two tries.</li>
            <li> After it dries my skin actually gets really dry and ashy!</li>
            <li> This product should come with a big red nose and a fluffy wig to go with the WHITE face it leaves you with!</li>
            <li> and I was initially worried that the moisturizer wouldn&#x27;t \\&quot;sink\\&quot; or blend with my skin tone as other reviewers had happen to them.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin and troughout the day it would become shiny an gross looking.</li>
            <li> Does control shine, for a while anyway, the problem I&#x27;m having with it is my face is really dry after washing my face and when done rubbing this lotion in I</li>
            <li> I was bummed because I spent money on this and didn&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of returning it</li>
            <li> What it doesn&#x27;t say is that if you are a skin tone other than pale white you will look ashy-pale or ghostly-white!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s texture is a little thicker but it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a weird feeling on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews I opted to try out SKIN79 BB cream</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to continue using it, but keep looking for other mattifying moisturizers.</li>
            <li> While this has more of a matte finish than typical moisturizer, my face still have a sheen after application. :(</li>
            <li> If you have a dark complexion, this moisturizer will make you look ashy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can see why it may not be for dark skin.</li>
            <li> This product was a complete game changer for me.</li>
            <li> I swear up and down and sideways by it.</li>
            <li> The less you use the less chalky looking it is.</li>
            <li> tried using less.</li>
            <li> It did tend to give me a slightly palish look</li>
            <li> so now I just mix a little of this with another matte moisturizer I have</li>
            <li> No matter if you use a little, a lot, or wear under foundation, if you are caramel, cocoa, brown, tanned, your face will look painted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It does not break me out although the product scent is a little harsh and unpleasant at first, it goes away after applied in the face.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for an inexpensive, matte moisturizer for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I have always had oily skin that would feel heavy on my face.</li>
            <li> I am mad that you cannot get it in the store and have to pay high prices for it here.</li>
            <li> The product does mattify your skin, but it does leave it a scary white.</li>
            <li> My skin is about the same complexion as tennis player Venus Williams, and after using this I looked like a ghost (or a bad imitation of one).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Rather unhappily this has recently been discontinued.</li>
            <li> This stinks as I finally found something that works!</li>
            <li> It gets the job done with moisturizing and protection, but it makes my skin look sickly and pale.</li>
            <li> I am so sad its discontinued and nervous to spend money on products that wont satisfy me.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t say how well this product moisturizes or mattifies, because I had to wash it off within minutes of putting it on.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s somewhat difficult to blend</li>
            <li> Now I have, and I am crazy about this product.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed it is difficult to find - stock up when you can!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Leaves a white residue or ends up making you look like a ghost. It smells like a cheap air freshener, also.</li>
            <li> This is the only SPF cream I have ever WANTED to have on my skin, which is relentlessly greasy at the times of year when one really wants SPF on. Amazingly, it actually delivers as promises, and &#x27;mattifies&#x27; -- and sinks right into the skin. The effect lasts and lasts, but you don&#x27;t feel a thing on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this came in a miniature glass jar for $60 I would grumble and moan about the price, but keep purchasing. I have never found anything else that works so well, despite years of hunting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather unhappily this has recently been discontinued. If you liked this, please contact the company (easy to do via their Facebook pages) and plead for its return. Clearly this was a very good line -- I have also tried and liked the \\&quot;Finishes\\&quot; pump-bottle cleanser -- that was not on the market for long enough to find its niche.  :(</li>
            <li> This totally saves my oily skin. Amazingly smooth and the finishing color is absolutely gorgeous as long as you have medium to light skin tone. I have used Clean&amp;Clear for years and tried to find something else to replace it. But it comes out that their moisturizer is the BEST for me. Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s discontinued... very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is seriously one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever found.  It may have been discontinued, which just about breaks my heart!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is a life saver! It completley covers my oil for the whole day, I wear it everyday under my matte foundation, and it actually blends very easily and leaves your skin feeling fresh and moisturized and matte. My matte foundation can leave my skin feeling oily but with the two products together you can&#x27;t see any oil for over 12 hours! even if I feel it, i can&#x27;t see it. I only use a pea sized drop or less and it spreads very well. I WILL not go without it even on days I don&#x27;t wear makeup. I had problems for years always looking very shiny and extra shiny if I wore makeup that day. I am very upset this item is discontinued and worried I will never find a close match for the price. Also the 1.7 oz bottle has literally lasted me a year, I have used this product for four years now and only gone through 4 bottles! Yes it may seem white at first, but it will soak in especially if you put foundation on top of it.  This product was a complete game changer for me. I am so sad its discontinued and nervous to spend money on products that wont satisfy me. STOCK UP if you can! this product is likely not for those with bad acne or very dark skin, but it is perfect for my medium tone and oil.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for an inexpensive, matte moisturizer for everyday use. This seemed to fit the bill, but when applied to my face after showering, it doesn&#x27;t blend in causing my face to have a white hue.  My face is fair already, this lotion highlights my fairmess especially in the Summer where I have a bit of a tan on my face/neck. Such a bummer as it had such great reviews when I bought it!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even remember what I didn&#x27;t like about this. I&#x27;m sure it had to do with my acne and oily skin. That being said what I can remember is that I disliked this so much that I threw it out after two tries. I wasn&#x27;t going to wait it out and see if things got better.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this moisturizer and wish it wasn&#x27;t discontinued in stores, but as long as amazon carries it, I&#x27;m good. This is effective to use in the summer months to maintain a matte complexion. I use it under makeup. Make sure to exfoliate any dry patches as it will make those more noticeable and to rub in well.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done with moisturizing and protection, but it makes my skin look sickly and pale. I will not be buying this again. Its nothing like the Clean and Clear Pore Minimizing Moisturizer (which I highly recommend for those looking for an inexpensive moisturizer).</li>
            <li> When I couldn&#x27;t find these in stores any longer, I started stocking up on all I could find to purchase.  Controls excess oil all day, minimizes the appearance of open pores, and has SPF of 15.  I recommend this to anyone with oily skin/open pores - IT REALLY WORKS!</li>
            <li> I am Jamaican (brown skin) and I love this lotion. I am mad that you cannot get it in the store and have to pay high prices for it here. It does leave a chalky esq color on browner skin but it does the job, and actually makes my make up look TEN times better so it works kinda of like a primer. No matte lotion is better even the higher priced one&#x27;s can&#x27;t compare. The less you use the less chalky looking it is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried pretty much everything to control my oily skin and this is by far the best! Put it on right after a shower to get the best results.</li>
            <li> I have always had super-oily skin (t-zone) and have never found a product that truly kept my forehead and nose oil-free through out the day.  Now I have, and I am crazy about this product.  I have noticed it is difficult to find - stock up when you can!</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely phenomenal. I swear up and down and sideways by it. It is the absolute best moisturizer to wear under makeup, and it works fabulously all on its own as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But where did it go?! Nobody but Amazon carries it anymore, which makes me fear they&#x27;ve discontinued it. I&#x27;ve bought several extras to stock up, but I really will be heartbroken if they discontinued it. I can&#x27;t find it on their official site or in any major retailer. :&#x27;-(</li>
            <li> I like this product it goes smoothly on your skin and i love the rosy scent, the scent is not irritating and the lotion keeps your face moisturize, but not oily feeling..</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this.  I REALLY wanted to love it but it only worked okay.  I still was using Clean &amp; Clear oil absorbing sheets by 10:00am.  I thought maybe I should use more but then it \\&quot;pilled&#x27; on my face (not sure what a better way to describe it would be).  After reading other reviews I opted to try out SKIN79 BB cream and I am in love!  It controls oil better and has a nice light coverage.  I</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a good mattifying moisturizer when I found this at Big Lots for $3.80. I did not ecpect much from a Big Lots or Clean and Clear product but this product had not disappointed me. I applied it six hours aho and my skin is still shine free! I wish the line had not been discontinued. I have always struggled with my skin and this is the best it has ever looked.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t say how well this product moisturizes or mattifies, because I had to wash it off within minutes of putting it on. My skin is about the same complexion as tennis player Venus Williams, and after using this I looked like a ghost (or a bad imitation of one). The moisturizer made my skin a chalky white and didn&#x27;t &#x27;sink in&#x27; at all, as much as I tried to rub it in. I even tried to use a tiny amount and hide it under my foundation, but my skin still had an ashy undertone. All in all very disappointing - I had high hopes after reading so many positive reviews on this site. On the plus side, it didn&#x27;t have a very strong scent and came of easily with facial cleanser and water.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product yesterday and I am already in love with it (why is it discontinued?!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a normally oily-faced person, I just realized that mattifying moisturizers exist and decided to try out this product because the price is right, I already use the Clean &amp; Clear astringent so I figured the product won&#x27;t clash with the others that I use and it has an SPF of 15. First time&#x27;s a charm! This product is wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m Asian with a medium tan and I was initially worried that the moisturizer wouldn&#x27;t \\&quot;sink\\&quot; or blend with my skin tone as other reviewers had happen to them. That is not the case at all with me. The key is to using a pearl-sized amount. Any more than that and you will probably find a white film over your face. The moisturizer lasts all work day, though it smells so good I want to just lather it on all the time!</li>
            <li> ...but doesn&#x27;t eliminate it. I didn&#x27;t expect a moisturizer to eliminate shine all day, and this one does a decent job of reducing shine until late morning (when applied in the early morning). I paired it with the Mattifying cleanser, which seemed to increase the time it worked. I liked this one better than Formula 10-0-6. It&#x27;s texture is a little thicker but it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a weird feeling on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t use this under the eyes, especially if you have sensitive skin there. I would recommend this, yes, but don&#x27;t expect miracles, because there is no &amp;#34;oil eliminator&amp;#34; out there. Unfortunately. The true test will be hot weather.</li>
            <li> it gave me a nice matte finish mixed with a foundation for good light coverage. i will likely buy again.</li>
            <li> Does control shine, for a while anyway, the problem I&#x27;m having with it is my face is really dry after washing my face and when done rubbing this lotion in I can still see dry skin in certain areas so I may have to use a different moisturizer before or after I use this. It helps if I use a different moisturizer BEFORE, then apply this and it will still leave a matte effect, but of course it wears off after a while. But overall not bad for the price and time being..I&#x27;m going to continue using it, but keep looking for other mattifying moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I&#x27;m not going crazy that I can&#x27;t find this lotion any more.  I have used all of it, made it last a really long time since you don&#x27;t need to use that much.  Thanks to everyone who posted that they can&#x27;t find it, I&#x27;m going to write C&amp;C asking if they&#x27;ll bring it back.  Love this lotion, it helps with my oily skin.  Thanks Amazon for having this!!!</li>
            <li> Still trying to figure out why this was discontinued in California...  it&#x27;s the best moisturizer ever!  Amazon, please dont discontinue it too..... Thanks :)</li>
            <li> I saw a review on this from a woman with darker skin and she said this made her look very ashy..I didn&#x27;t believe her. How could a moisturizer make you look ashy?&lt;br /&gt;SHE WAS RIGHT!&lt;br /&gt;I have Tyra Banks skin color and my skin is oily so I bought this because of all thge other great reviews on how it worked really well to get rid of shine and give a matte effect. When I first out it on I couldn&#x27;t get it to sink into my skin. It DID make me look INSANELY ashy because this does NOT sink into your skin at all. No matter how little you put on or how much you rub in it doesn&#x27;t snk into skin and this is white so if you are like me you end up looking very ashy and pale and it&#x27;s gross. And for some reason on my skin it doesn&#x27;t even moisturize. After it dries my skin actually gets really dry and ashy! I was bummed because I spent money on this and didn&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of returning it so now I just mix a little of this with another matte moisturizer I have and it works a bit.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be buying this trash again. Darker skinned females beware.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer does what it says, it absorbs the oil for hours. What it doesn&#x27;t say is that if you are a skin tone other than pale white you will look ashy-pale or ghostly-white!!!! No matter if you use a little, a lot, or wear under foundation, if you are caramel, cocoa, brown, tanned, your face will look painted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am actually saddened that Clean &amp; Clear did not think enough of people of color to tint it, test it better, or just market it for specific complexions.</li>
            <li> While this has more of a matte finish than typical moisturizer, my face still have a sheen after application. :(</li>
            <li> was disappointed didnt deliver what product said it would do and doesnt go well over make up. when putting on foundation it&lt;br /&gt;felt like it was rubing or flaking off.</li>
            <li> This product does the job mattify and good oil control, I have a very oily skin and using this helped me. It does not break me out although the product scent is a little harsh and unpleasant at first, it goes away after applied in the face.</li>
            <li> This product actually works and leave your face matte.  I only give it 4 stars because I have a tan skin and the product goes on white. It would work perfect for people with light skin.</li>
            <li> If the clown look is what you&#x27;re after this is your stuff! This product should come with a big red nose and a fluffy wig to go with the WHITE face it leaves you with!</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin and troughout the day it would become shiny an gross looking. Now that i have discovered this product i dont even need powder anymore. The only thing i will say is that it does make your face look paler so you would definatle need to apply at least a tinted moisturizer over it but other than that it is perfect. It literally keeps my face ahine free all day. I dont have to do touch up or anything. I HIGHLY recommend this product</li>
            <li> First, I think this is just a really simple product that got the oil-control down right with the rice powder in it. And being a moisturizer it keeps your skin from overreacting once you&#x27;ve washed it. Oil Control washes I don&#x27;t think can do much good, because they aren&#x27;t really something you apply to stay on your face long-term. When I looked at Clean and Clear&#x27;s facebook pages, it looked as if they are doing marketing targeted to different countries and skin care needs according to ethnicity. It looked like they kept the rice-idea for oil-absorbtion but mostly in a wash. I didn&#x27;t really see a moisturizer. Also, being something that I keep on my face to control oil, I am positive that this product has been the main reason my acne is under control. I never had huge problems but this improved the condition of my skin a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t know they had discontinued--I bought it once at Walmart to try, loved it, and saw it randomly at Ross and stocked up. That must be the reason it was at Ross though. It was four dollars. That was a real deal, but even at the regular price I think this is an awesome product--it has such a specific job that is hard to carry out and it does it right on an average budget rather than that of a makeup artist or something.&lt;br /&gt;Not that makeup artists are more well-off or anything, just that they are the pros at beautiful faces and most convenient oil control solutions are a more difficult task.&lt;br /&gt;As for the whitening, I would agree. I suppose there would be a way they could change that, but face sunscreens can tend to leave white residue, and the rice powder might play into the whitening too.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use primarily as moisturizer, because that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s initially advertised as, it being sunscreen as well was just an extra. However, it takes too long to absorb and my face is left looking way too white. I wish they made just a mattifying moisturizer.</li>
            <li> If you have a dark complexion, this moisturizer will make you look ashy.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is caramel colored and when I applied this, I ended up looking like a ghost.&lt;br /&gt;I tried using less. I also tried mixing it with water. I still looked ashy.&lt;br /&gt;Clean &amp; Clear obviously wasn&#x27;t thinking of African Americans when they made this&lt;br /&gt;product.</li>
            <li> The product does mattify your skin, but it does leave it a scary white. It&#x27;s somewhat difficult to blend so you have white marks all over your face. People think I&#x27;m sick every time I wear it.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is great at mattifying your skin and making you look like you have some type of desire to bleach your skin. I&#x27;m an African-American and you could definitely tell that I was wearing this moisturizer! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone with any type of skin pigment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying, I&#x27;m 46 years old &amp; have had extremely oily skin my whole life. I&#x27;m from South Louisiana - - humid doesn&#x27;t even describe it. I put this moisturizer on at 12:30 PM &amp; headed out to the rodeo. It&#x27;s nearly 8:30 PM &amp; my face is still holding up well despite the humid day we&#x27;ve had today. I can see why it may not be for dark skin. I&#x27;m outdoors 12 months out of the year &amp; my face stays tanned. It did tend to give me a slightly palish look but I would imagine under an oil free foundation, this would be awesome. 5 - stars for Clean &amp; Clear Mattifying Moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have always had oily skin that would feel heavy on my face. I would rub my fingers on my face and could see the shine. But not after using this product. But only Amazon has it and the manufacturers website does not even list it. I think its been discontinued. I&#x27;m going to stock up. This stinks as I finally found something that works!</li>
            <li> This product makes my face feel clean and look fresh. I will order it again. I hope it does not run out.</li>
