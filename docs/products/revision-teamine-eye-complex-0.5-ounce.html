            <li>Quality of the product was superb, and I am very satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li>It works great</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d say 80% which is great.</li>
            <li>It is pricey, if I find something else that works as well for cheaper I may switch, but I know where I can get pricey but great results (Teamine).  </li>
            <li>but i find it works great for everything and even under makeup.</li>

            <li>Great product.</li>

            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>After using this product for a month I see a remarkable difference.  </li>
            <li>I no longer have to wear under eye concealer and it is remarkable for puffy eyes.  </li>
            <li>great product, really good for hung-over eyes</li>
            <li>I do not treat my own customers this way!</li>
            <li>love this eye cream its awesome .</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s that good.  </li>
            <li>So continues my never ending quest for a good eye cream.</li>
            <li>I received sample packs from my dermatologist and I loved the results.</li>
            <li>Good results</li>
            <li>Good product--recommended by a NY plastic surgeon.</li>
            <li>Good luck, all.</li>
            <li>I used this for years and loved it.  </li>
            <li>Good Eye Product.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this was a good product since it was advertised in a dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>I tried to give it a fair chance of 6 weeks</li>
            <li>I used this for a good 6 months before deciding it doesnt do diddly.</li>
            <li>This cream is amazing and the best thing about it is you can get a free sample from Sephora.</li>
            <li>I am well over 50; this creme took months to show any improvement, but since I bought it from my dermatologist I stayed with it and am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>My wife has been using this product for a couple of years now, and is very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Great feel, texture and appealing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the product and will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure this works great</li>
            <li>I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Works great and price is better than at the dermatologist.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this many times before and was happy to procure it at a reduced price.</li>
            <li>After about a week of using this product, I seemed to have more noticeable lines (wrinkles!)</li>
            <li>Maybe even better than the eye creme!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for years and still love how it works!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!  </li>
            <li>I use Estee Lauder creams, but this cream for the eyes is even better!  </li>
            <li>Better!</li>
            <li>glad that you asked how this product worked for me!</li>
            <li>amazon&#x27;s customer service was great and the return was easy.</li>
            <li>My circle are hereditary so this product is really amazing.  </li>
            <li>So my puffiness or \\&quot;bags\\&quot; were greatly improved, but the surface of the skin wasn&#x27;t quite as smooth or \\&quot;plumped up.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>Does an amazing job on face wrinkles and crows feet.  </li>
            <li>Elsewhere, on my face and forehead, amazing (but, of course, temporary -- need</li>
            <li>Amazing a cream that works at all.</li>
            <li>Go into it with a good attitude and know that it may take time, but for many it works.</li>
            <li>Tried sample and really liked it.  </li>
            <li>It feels good and refreshing when applied to the eye area.  </li>
            <li>Quite effective.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled with the price.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve ever used for eye creams, highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Nothing&#x27;s perfect, but for me, Teamine works very well.</li>
            <li>and I thought I liked it</li>
            <li>I have used this exact eye cream for years and loved it!</li>
            <li>but it just isn&#x27;t suitable for me.</li>
            <li>I have tried dozens of eye creams (Origins, Arbonne, DHC, and practically everything at the drugstore) and this is the most effective cream for me.</li>
            <li>diminished.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also very happy to know the ingredients are potent &amp; natural</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great and I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>Works beautifully, you can really see a difference.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a nice eye cream this is fine.</li>
            <li>, things look MUCH better.  </li>
            <li>love this eye cream...</li>
            <li>In fact my eyes look more puffy.  </li>
            <li>It works okay for wrinkles</li>
            <li>More of a lighter redish.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>and I am glad I did.     </li>
            <li>It also does not burn or sting my eyes like many eye creams do.</li>
            <li>I have tried many eye creams and they all broke me out.</li>
            <li>a healthy hue is supposed to appear.</li>
            <li>I have tried sooooo many eye creams.  </li>
            <li>I am really very happy to find something that finally works!</li>
            <li>i liked the light fragrance and nongreasy texture of the cream</li>
            <li>i tried the product a couple more times but always got the rash within a day or so.</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t find this at most any department store.</li>
            <li>and I use only the best products</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s top on my list.</li>
            <li>I think it is a gradual change, but any change is better than nothing.  </li>
            <li>I do think given more time</li>
            <li>That product is supposed to be even better with more antioxidants giving better results.  </li>
            <li>I AM SOOOO GLAD</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t stop me from buying again though.</li>
            <li>and if the circles go away, I will buy more.</li>
            <li>I love this eye cream.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even put makeup over the top of it.  </li>
            <li>my neck is clearer and tighter, will order more.</li>
            <li>Mine started peeling because it&#x27;s so potent.</li>
            <li>I guess it worked ok under my eyes</li>
            <li>better than most eye creams</li>
            <li>My skin gal prescribed this to me years before I could get it online for MUCH more money.  </li>
            <li>The longer I use it, the more results I see.</li>
            <li>Some worked better than others but nothing was ever what I wanted it to be til this.</li>
            <li>but it is the best thing I have personally used.</li>
            <li>I layed off the product for a week and it started to get better.</li>
            <li>and it has REALLY made a great improvement.</li>
            <li>:) Enjoy!</li>
            <li>and I really do love that</li>
            <li>Shipped fast and great condition</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I would love for my wrinkles to vanish like hers.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this eye cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hopeful to continue to see more improvement as time progresses.</li>
            <li>This cream claims to work magic on circles and bags, but I have been using it for a month now</li>
            <li>I have had bags under my eyes for many years now</li>
            <li>i have used the real product before to great results.</li>
            <li>as soon as i opened the package the scent was overwhelming</li>
            <li>However since it had been more than 30 days Amazon wouldn&#x27;t let me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now and the under eye circles are noticeably better.</li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>And more moisturizing and lifting too.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I am pleased the improvement was within a couple of days.  </li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended it many tears ago</li>
            <li>EXACTLY WHAT I AM SAYING!!!</li>
            <li>supposidly after 3 months there are very significant results</li>
            <li>This cream made me very excited because its reputation had preceded it</li>
            <li>Teamine Eye Complex is wonderful and the results are amazing!</li>
            <li>I guess I wanted an overnight fix, but I still have 5 weeks to the event I am trying to look good for, so I feel certain, there is improvement and looking for more.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and will break out using most creams, but this one is quite nice!</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for over a year , it smoothes out the fine lines under your eyes &amp; eyelids , I love Revision Teamine</li>
            <li>There are several out there on the market; but this is ideal.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products over the years to reduce under eye puffiness, primarily but also, darkness.</li>
            <li>and she is not all that satisfied as there&#x27;s not any significant difference.</li>
            <li>Thank you to the company who makes it for creating such a good product!</li>
            <li>I bought it on Amazon, I was even more excited because it was way cheaper than I had seen in stores.</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use and lasts forever.</li>
            <li>more effective and a whole lot cheaper.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product for lightening the dark eye circles.</li>
            <li>Best eye cream ever for dark circles.</li>
            <li>So perhaps if you started with this cream when the puffiness first started it would be effective.</li>
            <li>It also reduced the appearance of the fine \\&quot;smile\\&quot; lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>It reduces puffiness and fine lines.  </li>
            <li>In just one week, I noticed a reduction in the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, including crow&#x27;s feet.</li>
            <li>Works fine as an under eye moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I have some fine lines around my eyes and was searching for a cure.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I even have rosacea of the eyelids, and am tolerating it just fine.  </li>
            <li>Expiration date and storage conditions are all fine.</li>
            <li>Fine lines- gone.  </li>
            <li>Even the fine wrinkles are disappearing.</li>
            <li>The very first day I used it my husband noticed that the bags and puffiness had disappeared!  </li>
            <li>For the price, it was a huge disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the product.  </li>
            <li>Their Necktifirm (sp?) is also FANTASTIC for sagging in the jowl area and neck wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>, I think it&#x27;s doing a fantastic</li>
            <li>I will continue using until my dermatologist lets me know that another product by Dior is available.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used for several years and works great.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I tried a free sample one time and thought it worked well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Its light in weight and no smell.</li>
            <li>[...] ; that page states that \\&quot;Anywhere you can buy the Revision Skincare Advanced Skincare Line of products</li>
            <li>The product is good,its smooth ,its not oily,great price.</li>
            <li>and i knew i did not receive a genuine product.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work for everybody, but for 87% of us this stuff is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>It obviously works for some people, so that&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>While they were selling and informing of the product, I did some due diligence on my own to determine if this would be good for</li>
            <li>I have tried to settle this with the seller, but they are VERY UNCOOPERATIVE!!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the same cream that I used successfully for many years, but I found it at a more reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I make my own eye serum that is more effective at fading dark circles than this.</li>
            <li>Amazing results well worth the money because you don&#x27;t have to use very much.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t work overnight, but it absolutely works for me and the improvement continues for many months, with the skin gradually looking more and more smooth and much lighter in color.</li>
            <li>If you are constantly applying under eye concealer, this could be your new best friend.</li>
            <li>It was originally recommended to me by my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>It is funny that it caused more puffiness because of the sensitivity.</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews before trying it, and was excited to try it.</li>
            <li>I was really excited about this cream.</li>
            <li>Always a great cream - but took a long time to arrive.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the exact same product and through Amazon I was able to save a fair amount of money.</li>
            <li>Okay, it goes on smoothly and feels nice, but I&#x27;ve not noticed any improvement in puffiness, fine lines or dark under eye areas.</li>
            <li>Just be sure not to use too much at one time as it may cause the skin under your eyes to become scaly or flaky.     </li>
            <li>As in, buy anything in the whole world because whatever it is will be better than this.</li>
            <li>if constantly used but, takes a good two weeks.</li>
            <li>I noticed a good chunk of people had issues with it drying out their skin and getting red and irritated, but I ordered anyway hoping it would work for me.</li>
            <li>I learned the true character and integrity of this company when there was a problem caused by a product they sold.  </li>
            <li>take the &amp;#34;tea&amp;#34; out of Teamine and use cool tea bags on those areas....</li>
            <li>Its OK as a moisturizer but don&#x27;t expect much change in appearance</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad eye cream, I like it.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>, it soaks in quickly and works well under makeup.    </li>
            <li>WOULDN&#x27;T BE SUPER PUFFY IN THE MORNING.</li>
            <li>i ordered from amazon which is NOT an authorized retailer of the product, but i wanted to see if maybe i would get lucky.</li>
            <li>heard that Teamine Eye Complex was the best, so I bought it right</li>
            <li>For wrinkle its great and dark circle.</li>
            <li>So happy to get this product here, for much less than I get it at my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to most creams and lotions, and this one has never irritated my skin.</li>
            <li>THAT REALLY WORKS!!</li>
            <li>NOBODY ages that FAST in a course of THREE weeks!!  </li>
            <li>I have used this several times and have always been pleased with the result of firmer eyes and reduced circles!</li>
            <li>The product really does brighten the under eye area and plump up fine lines.  </li>
            <li>works great, but caused an allergic reaction after a few weeks</li>
            <li>so I won&#x27;t get my money&#x27;s worth out of it..</li>
            <li>However, buying it through Amazon is even better as I save a fortune over buying it directly from her doctor.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be fading, but I have really noticed my lines around my eyes are softening,  I also use cream on my lip lines, top and bottom, and have really noticed an improvement.  </li>
            <li>It is worth the investment.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t have crows feet if I didn&#x27;t smile.</li>
            <li>I returned the product because I&#x27;ve heard too many stories about people selling a fraudulent product in the original containers of the actual product.  </li>
            <li>and if it&#x27;s working pay the $50-$75 for the pot, don&#x27;t go for it right away because it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone.</li>
            <li>hey! anything for youth looking skin, right?</li>
            <li>If I am ever able to find a product that worked even better on my dark circles, I would switch.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m at the bottom of my first jar right now, and am online to buy another.</li>
            <li>so I am going to try restalin silk since boost is really just a quick fix.  </li>
            <li>Nice texture, not greasy but did nothing for my dry under eye skin.</li>
            <li>The product was shipped very fast.</li>
            <li>It will do exactly as it promises over time.</li>
            <li>I really love this stuff and will only use this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for an eye cream for over a year, since my first eye wrinkle came in.</li>
            <li>in my personal opinion, I looked a *lot* better without the bags.  </li>
            <li>First off, Revision (who makes Teamine) does not test on animals.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this since I feel like I am working at my problems double time</li>
            <li>Because I started to put it together that most eye creams say to wear at night, which means the cream will always end up rubbing on your pillow and ultimately rubbing off on the rest of your face.</li>
            <li>It truly doesn&#x27;t take much!  </li>
            <li>I first bought this in a dermatologists office many years ago and have used it daily every since.  </li>
            <li>FOR THE FIRST TIME AT NIGHT BEFORE GOING TO BED</li>
            <li>Also, during the first two or three weeks of using the product, my eyes burned and were watery, but that problem went away.</li>
            <li>But Teamine worked like a charm, first time, every time.</li>
            <li>My recommendation is try some samples first</li>
            <li>It was pretty pricey for no results.</li>
            <li>Hydrates great but as far as dark circles and puffiness....</li>
            <li>The skin around my eyes is finally starting to look and fee better.  </li>
            <li>I used it twice a day at first, and saw improvement in about two weeks.</li>
            <li>and I want to ask you if you have two or more kinds of teaming for eyes or you have only one kind?&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also apply a moisturizer first.</li>
            <li>I am so very upset!</li>
            <li>When I first started using this</li>
            <li>, it works without giving me bags and really works on fine lines and keeps your skin looking young longer, I recommend it of people all the time!</li>
            <li>Therefore, I was willing to accept a few more fine lines to get rid of the bags.  </li>
            <li>So, when the routine goes from 2 concealers (one that covers and one that holds) or from a strong coverage product like Dermablend, to just a routine of this and Bare Minerals/Bisque....then it deserves attention.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to creams and allergic to a lot of things but have had no bad reaction to this cream.</li>
            <li>There seemed to be a few more \\&quot;fine lines\\&quot; than before.  </li>
            <li>First:  They indicated that their product is \\&quot;primarily for dark circles and fine lines and wrinkles\\&quot; even though their website states it works for puffy circles.    </li>
            <li>Please dont get carried away by the anonymous positive reviews here like i was.</li>
            <li>but I have used it before and did not get positive results.  </li>
            <li>Im unsure if this product I ordered is the genuine item listed, Ive purchased Teamine at a doctors office before and the cream was more white than this yellow color that was sent to me.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t found an eye cream as effective with dark circles as Teamine.</li>
            <li>I highly encourage you to try Teamine, if you are consistent in using it, it really works!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually been able to cut back on the amount of concealer required for my under eye area (which is great because concealer just settles into fine lines making them look worse).    </li>
            <li>and they said to use a hydrating boost, after two weeks they have gotten better but one eye still is not back to normal</li>
            <li>Reduction of the \\&quot;bags\\&quot; greatly improved the appearance of the dark circles, but I still had a problem with the black-and-blue color beneath the skin, so I went back to Hylexin which in my case reduces the black-and-blue effect.  </li>
            <li>Am doing only one eye so that I can easily compare.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll waste any more money on this!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend testing in an inconspicuous area first.  </li>
            <li>was more than I expected but reasonable for products of this type.</li>
            <li>Nothing really seemed to help.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>You only need a light touch and It keeps the darkness at bay.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind using both products since they both work really well for me.)</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li>I used this product for 3 months and saw a real difference.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the real deal.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t moisturizer-yet unwilling still need to use a moisturizer or gentle eye cream.  </li>
            <li>MAYBE NOT THAT FAST</li>
            <li>It seems to really work for under eye circles.</li>
            <li>Not too much luck for me for under-the-eye circles</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a drastic difference in my under eye circles yet as I just started using it, but it&#x27;s a lightweight cream that really moisturizes.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper on Amazon&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li>why I question the quality of the product and if its the real Teamine.</li>
            <li>Expected more from this product.</li>
            <li>Product just as shown, fast shipping, will buy again.</li>
            <li>Really seems to help the appearance under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really realize what a miracle it was until I ran out, now I will not let that happen ever again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but you must be reasonable.</li>
            <li>Perhaps I&#x27;m just hoping for too much?</li>
            <li>I only had to pat a light layer of concealer today, and I hope that eventually I can get to the point at which I don&#x27;t need concealer anymore.  </li>
            <li>I really regret buying it</li>
            <li>It arrived on time, and is reasonably priced considering how well it works.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for over a year now and can really see a difference when I don&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li>The company didn&#x27;t offer to send a replacement, but readily offered to take it back-postage paid.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This product sounded promising.</li>
            <li>if you are looking for the real product, visit the manufacturer website to find an authorized retailer in your area.</li>
            <li>I read that some reviewers didn&#x27;t have much improvement.  </li>
            <li>After having read the reviews, that this stuff really works, I gave it a try.</li>
            <li>Heard quite a lot of good things about this form common friends, Decided to purchase on for my Mom.</li>
            <li>I may try purchasing it directly from the manufacturer, even if it costs more, because I know that the &amp;#34;real thing&amp;#34; actually works.  </li>
            <li>I am extremely satisfied with this product and can honestly say that I&#x27;m starting to see visible results especially with my dark circles.</li>
            <li>After using Teamine for several weeks I noticed my under eye skin was becoming super crepey, saggy, and new deep wrinkles were developing.  </li>
            <li>This was recommended to me by a Dermatologist, so naturally I came on Amazon to see the reviews first.</li>
            <li>I bought it mostly for the puffiness under my eyes although I do have dark circles as well.</li>
            <li>I will have more improvement, although I do not think it will eliminate the dark circles.  </li>
            <li>It is OK moist, and for concealment, don&#x27;t see that it covers dark or puffiness under the eyes..</li>
            <li>In all fairness, I do not think any product can diminish my dark circles, but I had hoped to see less fine lines/wrinkles and better skin texture with this higher end product -</li>
            <li>I noticed my under eyes look more even and less puffy.  </li>
            <li>I love Revision products and wanted to love this one too, but unfortunately I must be allergic to some ingredient in it and can&#x27;t use it at all.</li>
            <li>Definitely feel it has done wonders for wrinkles and texture, leaving them soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>, my eyes looked &#x27;older&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Tried one more time this week, but the red blotches came back immediately.  </li>
            <li>I saw that the overall rating was 3 stars (most left before the product even had the time to take effect)</li>
            <li>Nice enough, but haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference with my dark circles</li>
            <li>, so I trusted Teamine would be at least safe to try!</li>
            <li>I purchased this eye cream and had high hopes for wrinkle reduction.  </li>
            <li>i had high hopes for this product, which was recommended by my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This was highly recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it to any one looking to reduce lines.</li>
            <li>The price is high for the size and quality.</li>
            <li>and I have seen it in some high end skin spas.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had them since high school and am now 58.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I recommend highly.</li>
            <li>It worked great for  about a week, and I did feel like I had less bags under my eyes, but shortly thereafter, the red blotchiness appeared.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s all natural, no smells, super gentle and actually puffs up skin to reduce wrinkes...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and last for a long time.</li>
            <li>I do apply a little bit more than is recommended though.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a difference, but want to give it a little more time.  </li>
            <li>I love this eye cream, since i started using it my dark puffy circles are gone!  </li>
            <li>I saw a slight change at first but nothing significant.  </li>
            <li>that I had to use hydrocortisone cream to calm the irritation for several days.</li>
            <li>I could go out without make-up (which may as well be the 7th deadly sin, I suppose it is already one - Vanity :).</li>
            <li>It helped make my under eye skin a lot more firm.</li>
            <li>this product lasts a very long time, really works and is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It has caused the skin under and around my eyes to become red and dry and more wrinkled.</li>
            <li>I am only on my first jar and love it, begin to tell a little the difference on my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I started using it about a year ago, and my fine lines, puffiness and dark circles have dramatically improved.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if dark circles are as faded as I would like, but am happy with how it makes my eye area feel.  </li>
            <li>It took a few months to take full effect, but it did exactly as it promised.</li>
            <li>My darkness is actually the hollow that develops with age- can&#x27;t expect a cream to give me an eye lift :)</li>
            <li>I have very fine lines and they are still there, which is why I gave the product 4 out of 5, but I have never seen a product actually reduce puffiness and dark circles like this product does.  </li>
            <li>I like how it feels once you apply it, and didn&#x27;t get any reactions I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Teamine eye cream irritated my eyes as they are very sensitive.  </li>
            <li>After using this product for 3-4 wks the underneath of my eyes became very sensitive and red/blotchy.</li>
            <li>I have tried many eye creams with very little satisfaction.  </li>
            <li>So far, no miracles have occurred!</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin beware!</li>
            <li>After using this product consistently for the last 4 months I have a one word summary.....</li>
            <li>First the area around my eyes started to look bruised then a day later the burning sensation started.</li>
            <li>It definitely is designed to use over time, morning and night consistently.</li>
            <li>I give it a 3 stars because I don&#x27;t see that it does much different than many other creams.  </li>
            <li>I won my first one at an open house at a cosmetic surgery office.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s great to find it at this price , it works slowly but does help my dark circles</li>
            <li>tried it several months ago and while I&#x27;ve used a pinky swab and tap underneath both eyes, I have recognized that this eye cream does reduce the appearance of the darkness, allowing me to appear more well rested and using less</li>
            <li>I do NOT have sensitive skin, and the Teamine left me with large \\&quot;burn\\&quot; areas around the eyes.  </li>
            <li>and I can clearly see a difference in the disappearance of undereye darkness.</li>
            <li>that will wow you overnight.</li>
            <li>Big savings on Amazon for a high quality product!</li>
            <li>and I can really see the darkening starting to go away.</li>
            <li>Think about an old balloon that has deflated...without the inflation, the surface looks wrinkly.  </li>
            <li>Also, don&#x27;t expect miracles, they won&#x27;t go away completely</li>
            <li>Before that, makeup wouldn&#x27;t even cover them completely.</li>
            <li>They could be old, or not even our products.\\&quot;    </li>
            <li>Very puffy and starting to have circles as well.   </li>
            <li>The reason I give it only 4 stars is the price is a bit much.</li>
            <li>And I also do not have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re sensitive, start with just twice a week until you can use it once a day.  </li>
            <li>I have somewhat sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I felt so old.</li>
            <li>but I have sensitive skin and after a week I started to get a rash.</li>
            <li>I finally found an eye team that really does improve the wrinkles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I am 35 years old &amp; have puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li>It must be hereditary because I&#x27;m already noticing them on my four year old daughter.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the potency of it or what, but i do not have sensitive skin and have never had a reaction like this to eye cream.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and helps dark circles.</li>
            <li>I have had super dark circles &amp; puffiness under my eyes for years.  </li>
            <li>It may cost a little more but it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>use it twice a day as recommended and it definitely lightens dark circles right away.&lt;br /&gt;Puffiness is reduced but not as much as I would like.  </li>
            <li>I honestly have seen a dramatic difference since using this cream.</li>
            <li>I also had puffiness and small bags under my eyes, along with fine wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a week and my dark circles are going away, my wrinkles are not noticeable except for when I smile now, and the skin under my eyes has never been this soft.</li>
            <li>(I do think this product helps with firmness and elasticity, but with older skin there&#x27;s a limit to how much a topical cream can do.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used this product for several years and it does a fantastic job reducing dark rings or circles under your eyes.  </li>
            <li>I had such high hopes when I started using this product.  </li>
            <li>I am surprised at many negative reviews, but we all have different skin types.  </li>
            <li>Worth a try for puffiness, wrinkles and dark circles.  </li>
            <li>If you use a large amount, it will cause the skin to be dry and peely.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended this to me for puffiness, and was very explicit that just a light dab each day was enough - and despite the small bottle it should last over a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are young and have tight skin but dark circles, you may be safe.  </li>
            <li>I am a big fan of most of the Revision products but not this one, as others have said, it left my eyelids raw and sore.</li>
            <li>There are many products that cause a bad reaction for me, but this, fortunately, isn&#x27;t one of them.  </li>
            <li>It is also a very moisturizing cream that has helped the dry skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li>For the first time in almost 30 years, I can go without under eye conceler and not feel self conscious about my dark circles.  </li>
            <li>I am only 31 years old and look young everywhere except for my eyes.</li>
            <li>It seems like a good eye cream, but no better than the eye creams I usually use.  </li>
            <li>and it is very apparent the improvement.</li>
            <li>I use it twice per day every single day very sparingly.  </li>
            <li>No more!! :-)</li>
            <li>He told me that it was a tad pricey and that it may or may not work for me, but that he had heard positive comments from other patients.  </li>
            <li>I am 60 years old and have had puffy bags under my eyes for several years.</li>
            <li>and then my eyes developed red patches below.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I did a side by side comparison by using it on one side of my face and there was a noticeable difference in the dark circles within two weeks</li>
            <li>I have tried a few products and normally would never spend this much money on anything for my skin, but I was feeling generous to myself the day I bought it</li>
            <li>It was a small but full jar and for the amount of money</li>
            <li>After two weeks, I developed what appeared to be three small growths (protruding bumps) underneath my right eye.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never not use it again, as my dark circles came RIGHT back!  </li>
            <li>very moisturizing- lasts a very long time as you only need the smallest dab.</li>
            <li>, it felt great, I recommend this product, just a little expensive, but</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time as it only takes a tiny bit for the whole eye area.</li>
            <li>THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE DAY THAT MY EYES</li>
            <li>This is what social media is all about.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I would wear eye creams and the slightest bit would get into my eyes and cause them to get all puffy, red and watery making them worse</li>
            <li>Frankly, I am pleasantly surprised as I have used more expensive products without the results.</li>
            <li>I really like it, didn&#x27;t get rid of 100% of the dark circles</li>
            <li>However it did absolutely nothing for my dark circles.</li>
            <li>Search \\&quot;Dark eye circle cream\\&quot; and tons of products will pop up promising to help.</li>
            <li>I also have dark circles (not so much anymore since the Teamine).   </li>
            <li>Really works to remove dark circles.</li>
            <li>I have not seen any real difference in my dark rings and puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li>It really reduces dark circles and puffiness.</li>
            <li>I have dark circles and the cream really lightens the area and smooths it out.  </li>
            <li>This eye cream works very well at diminishing those dark circles I have under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried numerous others, some much more expensive, but none work nearly as well.</li>
            <li>You have to be consistent (morning and night) for a few weeks in order to see improvement.</li>
            <li>I have incredibly pale, sensitive skin and have used the Teamine Eye Complex for more than a year.  </li>
            <li>I developed a dry patch on my lid and under eye after using it for a week</li>
            <li>Maybe because of less breakage, I don&#x27;t know and really don&#x27;t care…it works.  </li>
            <li>It REALLY does reduce the dark circles and baggy look under my eyes; with regular use.  </li>
            <li>This is the only eye cream I&#x27;ve ever bought that I feel like it really diminishes my dark circles.  </li>
            <li>not so much.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need to use but a tiny bit, but for the money, not sure if it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Have used other Revision facial products and I highly recommend this product line.</li>
            <li>I am in my early 50&#x27;s and being black and hispanic have this hue of darkness around my eyes, which is sometimes cultural.  </li>
            <li>I decided to purchase it mainly to diminish my dark undereye circles.</li>
            <li>I am still on my first jar and use this twice a day so a little does go a long way.</li>

            <li> Good Eye Cream!  </li>
            <li> Good product!</li>
            <li> It does a beautiful job of lightening and eliminating them, as well as improving the texture of the skin.  </li>
            <li> Quality of the product was superb, and I am very satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> It works great</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d say 80% which is great.</li>
            <li> It is pricey, if I find something else that works as well for cheaper I may switch, but I know where I can get pricey but great results (Teamine).  </li>
            <li> but i find it works great for everything and even under makeup.</li>
            <li> It dries great</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> The smell and consistency is great, but I cannot recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great cream</li>
            <li> My eyes looked great and then used this</li>
            <li> I am so happy with it.</li>
            <li> This product works great.</li>
            <li> Great under make up.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> I am happy I can now order it through Amazon and have it in two days.  </li>
            <li> This cream does wonders, my eyes looked great</li>
            <li> My Doctor is very honest, which is why I go to her.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> After using this product for a month I see a remarkable difference.  </li>
            <li> I no longer have to wear under eye concealer and it is remarkable for puffy eyes.  </li>
            <li> great product, really good for hung-over eyes</li>
            <li> I do not treat my own customers this way!</li>
            <li> love this eye cream its awesome .</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s that good.  </li>
            <li> So continues my never ending quest for a good eye cream.</li>
            <li> I received sample packs from my dermatologist and I loved the results.</li>
            <li> Good results</li>
            <li> Good product--recommended by a NY plastic surgeon.</li>
            <li> Good luck, all.</li>
            <li> I used this for years and loved it.  </li>
            <li> Good Eye Product.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this was a good product since it was advertised in a dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> I tried to give it a fair chance of 6 weeks</li>
            <li> I used this for a good 6 months before deciding it doesnt do diddly.</li>
            <li> This cream is amazing and the best thing about it is you can get a free sample from Sephora.</li>
            <li> I am well over 50; this creme took months to show any improvement, but since I bought it from my dermatologist I stayed with it and am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> My wife has been using this product for a couple of years now, and is very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Great feel, texture and appealing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the product and will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sure this works great</li>
            <li> I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Works great and price is better than at the dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this many times before and was happy to procure it at a reduced price.</li>
            <li> After about a week of using this product, I seemed to have more noticeable lines (wrinkles!)</li>
            <li> Maybe even better than the eye creme!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and still love how it works!</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  </li>
            <li> I use Estee Lauder creams, but this cream for the eyes is even better!  </li>
            <li> Better!</li>
            <li> glad that you asked how this product worked for me!</li>
            <li> amazon&#x27;s customer service was great and the return was easy.</li>
            <li> My circle are hereditary so this product is really amazing.  </li>
            <li> So my puffiness or \\&quot;bags\\&quot; were greatly improved, but the surface of the skin wasn&#x27;t quite as smooth or \\&quot;plumped up.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> Does an amazing job on face wrinkles and crows feet.  </li>
            <li> Elsewhere, on my face and forehead, amazing (but, of course, temporary -- need</li>
            <li> Amazing a cream that works at all.</li>
            <li> Go into it with a good attitude and know that it may take time, but for many it works.</li>
            <li> Tried sample and really liked it.  </li>
            <li> It feels good and refreshing when applied to the eye area.  </li>
            <li> Quite effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled with the price.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve ever used for eye creams, highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Nothing&#x27;s perfect, but for me, Teamine works very well.</li>
            <li> and I thought I liked it</li>
            <li> I have used this exact eye cream for years and loved it!</li>
            <li> but it just isn&#x27;t suitable for me.</li>
            <li> I have tried dozens of eye creams (Origins, Arbonne, DHC, and practically everything at the drugstore) and this is the most effective cream for me.</li>
            <li> diminished.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also very happy to know the ingredients are potent &amp; natural</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great and I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Works beautifully, you can really see a difference.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a nice eye cream this is fine.</li>
            <li> , things look MUCH better.  </li>
            <li> love this eye cream...</li>
            <li> In fact my eyes look more puffy.  </li>
            <li> It works okay for wrinkles</li>
            <li> More of a lighter redish.</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> and I am glad I did.     </li>
            <li> It also does not burn or sting my eyes like many eye creams do.</li>
            <li> I have tried many eye creams and they all broke me out.</li>
            <li> a healthy hue is supposed to appear.</li>
            <li> I have tried sooooo many eye creams.  </li>
            <li> I am really very happy to find something that finally works!</li>
            <li> i liked the light fragrance and nongreasy texture of the cream</li>
            <li> i tried the product a couple more times but always got the rash within a day or so.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t find this at most any department store.</li>
            <li> and I use only the best products</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s top on my list.</li>
            <li> I think it is a gradual change, but any change is better than nothing.  </li>
            <li> I do think given more time</li>
            <li> That product is supposed to be even better with more antioxidants giving better results.  </li>
            <li> I AM SOOOO GLAD</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t stop me from buying again though.</li>
            <li> and if the circles go away, I will buy more.</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even put makeup over the top of it.  </li>
            <li> my neck is clearer and tighter, will order more.</li>
            <li> Mine started peeling because it&#x27;s so potent.</li>
            <li> I guess it worked ok under my eyes</li>
            <li> better than most eye creams</li>
            <li> My skin gal prescribed this to me years before I could get it online for MUCH more money.  </li>
            <li> The longer I use it, the more results I see.</li>
            <li> Some worked better than others but nothing was ever what I wanted it to be til this.</li>
            <li> but it is the best thing I have personally used.</li>
            <li> I layed off the product for a week and it started to get better.</li>
            <li> and it has REALLY made a great improvement.</li>
            <li> :) Enjoy!</li>
            <li> and I really do love that</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and great condition</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I would love for my wrinkles to vanish like hers.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this eye cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hopeful to continue to see more improvement as time progresses.</li>
            <li> This cream claims to work magic on circles and bags, but I have been using it for a month now</li>
            <li> I have had bags under my eyes for many years now</li>
            <li> i have used the real product before to great results.</li>
            <li> as soon as i opened the package the scent was overwhelming</li>
            <li> However since it had been more than 30 days Amazon wouldn&#x27;t let me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now and the under eye circles are noticeably better.</li>
            <li> I just love it.</li>
            <li> And more moisturizing and lifting too.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I am pleased the improvement was within a couple of days.  </li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended it many tears ago</li>
            <li> EXACTLY WHAT I AM SAYING!!!</li>
            <li> supposidly after 3 months there are very significant results</li>
            <li> This cream made me very excited because its reputation had preceded it</li>
            <li> Teamine Eye Complex is wonderful and the results are amazing!</li>
            <li> I guess I wanted an overnight fix, but I still have 5 weeks to the event I am trying to look good for, so I feel certain, there is improvement and looking for more.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and will break out using most creams, but this one is quite nice!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year , it smoothes out the fine lines under your eyes &amp; eyelids , I love Revision Teamine</li>
            <li> There are several out there on the market; but this is ideal.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products over the years to reduce under eye puffiness, primarily but also, darkness.</li>
            <li> and she is not all that satisfied as there&#x27;s not any significant difference.</li>
            <li> Thank you to the company who makes it for creating such a good product!</li>
            <li> I bought it on Amazon, I was even more excited because it was way cheaper than I had seen in stores.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use and lasts forever.</li>
            <li> more effective and a whole lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for lightening the dark eye circles.</li>
            <li> Best eye cream ever for dark circles.</li>
            <li> So perhaps if you started with this cream when the puffiness first started it would be effective.</li>
            <li> It also reduced the appearance of the fine \\&quot;smile\\&quot; lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> It reduces puffiness and fine lines.  </li>
            <li> In just one week, I noticed a reduction in the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, including crow&#x27;s feet.</li>
            <li> Works fine as an under eye moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have some fine lines around my eyes and was searching for a cure.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I even have rosacea of the eyelids, and am tolerating it just fine.  </li>
            <li> Expiration date and storage conditions are all fine.</li>
            <li> Fine lines- gone.  </li>
            <li> Even the fine wrinkles are disappearing.</li>
            <li> The very first day I used it my husband noticed that the bags and puffiness had disappeared!  </li>
            <li> For the price, it was a huge disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the product.  </li>
            <li> Their Necktifirm (sp?) is also FANTASTIC for sagging in the jowl area and neck wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> , I think it&#x27;s doing a fantastic</li>
            <li> I will continue using until my dermatologist lets me know that another product by Dior is available.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used for several years and works great.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I tried a free sample one time and thought it worked well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Its light in weight and no smell.</li>
            <li> [...] ; that page states that \\&quot;Anywhere you can buy the Revision Skincare Advanced Skincare Line of products</li>
            <li> The product is good,its smooth ,its not oily,great price.</li>
            <li> and i knew i did not receive a genuine product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for everybody, but for 87% of us this stuff is fabulous.  </li>
            <li> It obviously works for some people, so that&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> While they were selling and informing of the product, I did some due diligence on my own to determine if this would be good for</li>
            <li> I have tried to settle this with the seller, but they are VERY UNCOOPERATIVE!!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same cream that I used successfully for many years, but I found it at a more reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I make my own eye serum that is more effective at fading dark circles than this.</li>
            <li> Amazing results well worth the money because you don&#x27;t have to use very much.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work overnight, but it absolutely works for me and the improvement continues for many months, with the skin gradually looking more and more smooth and much lighter in color.</li>
            <li> If you are constantly applying under eye concealer, this could be your new best friend.</li>
            <li> It was originally recommended to me by my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> It is funny that it caused more puffiness because of the sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews before trying it, and was excited to try it.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this cream.</li>
            <li> Always a great cream - but took a long time to arrive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the exact same product and through Amazon I was able to save a fair amount of money.</li>
            <li> Okay, it goes on smoothly and feels nice, but I&#x27;ve not noticed any improvement in puffiness, fine lines or dark under eye areas.</li>
            <li> Just be sure not to use too much at one time as it may cause the skin under your eyes to become scaly or flaky.     </li>
            <li> As in, buy anything in the whole world because whatever it is will be better than this.</li>
            <li> if constantly used but, takes a good two weeks.</li>
            <li> I noticed a good chunk of people had issues with it drying out their skin and getting red and irritated, but I ordered anyway hoping it would work for me.</li>
            <li> I learned the true character and integrity of this company when there was a problem caused by a product they sold.  </li>
            <li> take the &amp;#34;tea&amp;#34; out of Teamine and use cool tea bags on those areas....</li>
            <li> Its OK as a moisturizer but don&#x27;t expect much change in appearance</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad eye cream, I like it.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> , it soaks in quickly and works well under makeup.    </li>
            <li> WOULDN&#x27;T BE SUPER PUFFY IN THE MORNING.</li>
            <li> i ordered from amazon which is NOT an authorized retailer of the product, but i wanted to see if maybe i would get lucky.</li>
            <li> heard that Teamine Eye Complex was the best, so I bought it right</li>
            <li> For wrinkle its great and dark circle.</li>
            <li> So happy to get this product here, for much less than I get it at my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to most creams and lotions, and this one has never irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> THAT REALLY WORKS!!</li>
            <li> NOBODY ages that FAST in a course of THREE weeks!!  </li>
            <li> I have used this several times and have always been pleased with the result of firmer eyes and reduced circles!</li>
            <li> The product really does brighten the under eye area and plump up fine lines.  </li>
            <li> works great, but caused an allergic reaction after a few weeks</li>
            <li> so I won&#x27;t get my money&#x27;s worth out of it..</li>
            <li> However, buying it through Amazon is even better as I save a fortune over buying it directly from her doctor.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be fading, but I have really noticed my lines around my eyes are softening,  I also use cream on my lip lines, top and bottom, and have really noticed an improvement.  </li>
            <li> It is worth the investment.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have crows feet if I didn&#x27;t smile.</li>
            <li> I returned the product because I&#x27;ve heard too many stories about people selling a fraudulent product in the original containers of the actual product.  </li>
            <li> and if it&#x27;s working pay the $50-$75 for the pot, don&#x27;t go for it right away because it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone.</li>
            <li> hey! anything for youth looking skin, right?</li>
            <li> If I am ever able to find a product that worked even better on my dark circles, I would switch.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m at the bottom of my first jar right now, and am online to buy another.</li>
            <li> so I am going to try restalin silk since boost is really just a quick fix.  </li>
            <li> Nice texture, not greasy but did nothing for my dry under eye skin.</li>
            <li> The product was shipped very fast.</li>
            <li> It will do exactly as it promises over time.</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff and will only use this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an eye cream for over a year, since my first eye wrinkle came in.</li>
            <li> in my personal opinion, I looked a *lot* better without the bags.  </li>
            <li> First off, Revision (who makes Teamine) does not test on animals.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this since I feel like I am working at my problems double time</li>
            <li> Because I started to put it together that most eye creams say to wear at night, which means the cream will always end up rubbing on your pillow and ultimately rubbing off on the rest of your face.</li>
            <li> It truly doesn&#x27;t take much!  </li>
            <li> I first bought this in a dermatologists office many years ago and have used it daily every since.  </li>
            <li> FOR THE FIRST TIME AT NIGHT BEFORE GOING TO BED</li>
            <li> Also, during the first two or three weeks of using the product, my eyes burned and were watery, but that problem went away.</li>
            <li> But Teamine worked like a charm, first time, every time.</li>
            <li> My recommendation is try some samples first</li>
            <li> It was pretty pricey for no results.</li>
            <li> Hydrates great but as far as dark circles and puffiness....</li>
            <li> The skin around my eyes is finally starting to look and fee better.  </li>
            <li> I used it twice a day at first, and saw improvement in about two weeks.</li>
            <li> and I want to ask you if you have two or more kinds of teaming for eyes or you have only one kind?&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also apply a moisturizer first.</li>
            <li> I am so very upset!</li>
            <li> When I first started using this</li>
            <li> , it works without giving me bags and really works on fine lines and keeps your skin looking young longer, I recommend it of people all the time!</li>
            <li> Therefore, I was willing to accept a few more fine lines to get rid of the bags.  </li>
            <li> So, when the routine goes from 2 concealers (one that covers and one that holds) or from a strong coverage product like Dermablend, to just a routine of this and Bare Minerals/Bisque....then it deserves attention.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to creams and allergic to a lot of things but have had no bad reaction to this cream.</li>
            <li> There seemed to be a few more \\&quot;fine lines\\&quot; than before.  </li>
            <li> First:  They indicated that their product is \\&quot;primarily for dark circles and fine lines and wrinkles\\&quot; even though their website states it works for puffy circles.    </li>
            <li> Please dont get carried away by the anonymous positive reviews here like i was.</li>
            <li> but I have used it before and did not get positive results.  </li>
            <li> Im unsure if this product I ordered is the genuine item listed, Ive purchased Teamine at a doctors office before and the cream was more white than this yellow color that was sent to me.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t found an eye cream as effective with dark circles as Teamine.</li>
            <li> I highly encourage you to try Teamine, if you are consistent in using it, it really works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually been able to cut back on the amount of concealer required for my under eye area (which is great because concealer just settles into fine lines making them look worse).    </li>
            <li> and they said to use a hydrating boost, after two weeks they have gotten better but one eye still is not back to normal</li>
            <li> Reduction of the \\&quot;bags\\&quot; greatly improved the appearance of the dark circles, but I still had a problem with the black-and-blue color beneath the skin, so I went back to Hylexin which in my case reduces the black-and-blue effect.  </li>
            <li> Am doing only one eye so that I can easily compare.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll waste any more money on this!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend testing in an inconspicuous area first.  </li>
            <li> was more than I expected but reasonable for products of this type.</li>
            <li> Nothing really seemed to help.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> You only need a light touch and It keeps the darkness at bay.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind using both products since they both work really well for me.)</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I used this product for 3 months and saw a real difference.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the real deal.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t moisturizer-yet unwilling still need to use a moisturizer or gentle eye cream.  </li>
            <li> MAYBE NOT THAT FAST</li>
            <li> It seems to really work for under eye circles.</li>
            <li> Not too much luck for me for under-the-eye circles</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a drastic difference in my under eye circles yet as I just started using it, but it&#x27;s a lightweight cream that really moisturizes.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper on Amazon&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li> why I question the quality of the product and if its the real Teamine.</li>
            <li> Expected more from this product.</li>
            <li> Product just as shown, fast shipping, will buy again.</li>
            <li> Really seems to help the appearance under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really realize what a miracle it was until I ran out, now I will not let that happen ever again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but you must be reasonable.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I&#x27;m just hoping for too much?</li>
            <li> I only had to pat a light layer of concealer today, and I hope that eventually I can get to the point at which I don&#x27;t need concealer anymore.  </li>
            <li> I really regret buying it</li>
            <li> It arrived on time, and is reasonably priced considering how well it works.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year now and can really see a difference when I don&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li> The company didn&#x27;t offer to send a replacement, but readily offered to take it back-postage paid.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product sounded promising.</li>
            <li> if you are looking for the real product, visit the manufacturer website to find an authorized retailer in your area.</li>
            <li> I read that some reviewers didn&#x27;t have much improvement.  </li>
            <li> After having read the reviews, that this stuff really works, I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> Heard quite a lot of good things about this form common friends, Decided to purchase on for my Mom.</li>
            <li> I may try purchasing it directly from the manufacturer, even if it costs more, because I know that the &amp;#34;real thing&amp;#34; actually works.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely satisfied with this product and can honestly say that I&#x27;m starting to see visible results especially with my dark circles.</li>
            <li> After using Teamine for several weeks I noticed my under eye skin was becoming super crepey, saggy, and new deep wrinkles were developing.  </li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by a Dermatologist, so naturally I came on Amazon to see the reviews first.</li>
            <li> I bought it mostly for the puffiness under my eyes although I do have dark circles as well.</li>
            <li> I will have more improvement, although I do not think it will eliminate the dark circles.  </li>
            <li> It is OK moist, and for concealment, don&#x27;t see that it covers dark or puffiness under the eyes..</li>
            <li> In all fairness, I do not think any product can diminish my dark circles, but I had hoped to see less fine lines/wrinkles and better skin texture with this higher end product -</li>
            <li> I noticed my under eyes look more even and less puffy.  </li>
            <li> I love Revision products and wanted to love this one too, but unfortunately I must be allergic to some ingredient in it and can&#x27;t use it at all.</li>
            <li> Definitely feel it has done wonders for wrinkles and texture, leaving them soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> , my eyes looked &#x27;older&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Tried one more time this week, but the red blotches came back immediately.  </li>
            <li> I saw that the overall rating was 3 stars (most left before the product even had the time to take effect)</li>
            <li> Nice enough, but haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference with my dark circles</li>
            <li> , so I trusted Teamine would be at least safe to try!</li>
            <li> I purchased this eye cream and had high hopes for wrinkle reduction.  </li>
            <li> i had high hopes for this product, which was recommended by my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This was highly recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it to any one looking to reduce lines.</li>
            <li> The price is high for the size and quality.</li>
            <li> and I have seen it in some high end skin spas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had them since high school and am now 58.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I recommend highly.</li>
            <li> It worked great for  about a week, and I did feel like I had less bags under my eyes, but shortly thereafter, the red blotchiness appeared.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s all natural, no smells, super gentle and actually puffs up skin to reduce wrinkes...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light and last for a long time.</li>
            <li> I do apply a little bit more than is recommended though.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a difference, but want to give it a little more time.  </li>
            <li> I love this eye cream, since i started using it my dark puffy circles are gone!  </li>
            <li> I saw a slight change at first but nothing significant.  </li>
            <li> that I had to use hydrocortisone cream to calm the irritation for several days.</li>
            <li> I could go out without make-up (which may as well be the 7th deadly sin, I suppose it is already one - Vanity :).</li>
            <li> It helped make my under eye skin a lot more firm.</li>
            <li> this product lasts a very long time, really works and is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It has caused the skin under and around my eyes to become red and dry and more wrinkled.</li>
            <li> I am only on my first jar and love it, begin to tell a little the difference on my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I started using it about a year ago, and my fine lines, puffiness and dark circles have dramatically improved.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if dark circles are as faded as I would like, but am happy with how it makes my eye area feel.  </li>
            <li> It took a few months to take full effect, but it did exactly as it promised.</li>
            <li> My darkness is actually the hollow that develops with age- can&#x27;t expect a cream to give me an eye lift :)</li>
            <li> I have very fine lines and they are still there, which is why I gave the product 4 out of 5, but I have never seen a product actually reduce puffiness and dark circles like this product does.  </li>
            <li> I like how it feels once you apply it, and didn&#x27;t get any reactions I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Teamine eye cream irritated my eyes as they are very sensitive.  </li>
            <li> After using this product for 3-4 wks the underneath of my eyes became very sensitive and red/blotchy.</li>
            <li> I have tried many eye creams with very little satisfaction.  </li>
            <li> So far, no miracles have occurred!</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin beware!</li>
            <li> After using this product consistently for the last 4 months I have a one word summary.....</li>
            <li> First the area around my eyes started to look bruised then a day later the burning sensation started.</li>
            <li> It definitely is designed to use over time, morning and night consistently.</li>
            <li> I give it a 3 stars because I don&#x27;t see that it does much different than many other creams.  </li>
            <li> I won my first one at an open house at a cosmetic surgery office.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s great to find it at this price , it works slowly but does help my dark circles</li>
            <li> tried it several months ago and while I&#x27;ve used a pinky swab and tap underneath both eyes, I have recognized that this eye cream does reduce the appearance of the darkness, allowing me to appear more well rested and using less</li>
            <li> I do NOT have sensitive skin, and the Teamine left me with large \\&quot;burn\\&quot; areas around the eyes.  </li>
            <li> and I can clearly see a difference in the disappearance of undereye darkness.</li>
            <li> that will wow you overnight.</li>
            <li> Big savings on Amazon for a high quality product!</li>
            <li> and I can really see the darkening starting to go away.</li>
            <li> Think about an old balloon that has deflated...without the inflation, the surface looks wrinkly.  </li>
            <li> Also, don&#x27;t expect miracles, they won&#x27;t go away completely</li>
            <li> Before that, makeup wouldn&#x27;t even cover them completely.</li>
            <li> They could be old, or not even our products.\\&quot;    </li>
            <li> Very puffy and starting to have circles as well.   </li>
            <li> The reason I give it only 4 stars is the price is a bit much.</li>
            <li> And I also do not have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re sensitive, start with just twice a week until you can use it once a day.  </li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I felt so old.</li>
            <li> but I have sensitive skin and after a week I started to get a rash.</li>
            <li> I finally found an eye team that really does improve the wrinkles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I am 35 years old &amp; have puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li> It must be hereditary because I&#x27;m already noticing them on my four year old daughter.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the potency of it or what, but i do not have sensitive skin and have never had a reaction like this to eye cream.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and helps dark circles.</li>
            <li> I have had super dark circles &amp; puffiness under my eyes for years.  </li>
            <li> It may cost a little more but it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> use it twice a day as recommended and it definitely lightens dark circles right away.&lt;br /&gt;Puffiness is reduced but not as much as I would like.  </li>
            <li> I honestly have seen a dramatic difference since using this cream.</li>
            <li> I also had puffiness and small bags under my eyes, along with fine wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a week and my dark circles are going away, my wrinkles are not noticeable except for when I smile now, and the skin under my eyes has never been this soft.</li>
            <li> (I do think this product helps with firmness and elasticity, but with older skin there&#x27;s a limit to how much a topical cream can do.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and it does a fantastic job reducing dark rings or circles under your eyes.  </li>
            <li> I had such high hopes when I started using this product.  </li>
            <li> I am surprised at many negative reviews, but we all have different skin types.  </li>
            <li> Worth a try for puffiness, wrinkles and dark circles.  </li>
            <li> If you use a large amount, it will cause the skin to be dry and peely.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this to me for puffiness, and was very explicit that just a light dab each day was enough - and despite the small bottle it should last over a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are young and have tight skin but dark circles, you may be safe.  </li>
            <li> I am a big fan of most of the Revision products but not this one, as others have said, it left my eyelids raw and sore.</li>
            <li> There are many products that cause a bad reaction for me, but this, fortunately, isn&#x27;t one of them.  </li>
            <li> It is also a very moisturizing cream that has helped the dry skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li> For the first time in almost 30 years, I can go without under eye conceler and not feel self conscious about my dark circles.  </li>
            <li> I am only 31 years old and look young everywhere except for my eyes.</li>
            <li> It seems like a good eye cream, but no better than the eye creams I usually use.  </li>
            <li> and it is very apparent the improvement.</li>
            <li> I use it twice per day every single day very sparingly.  </li>
            <li> No more!! :-)</li>
            <li> He told me that it was a tad pricey and that it may or may not work for me, but that he had heard positive comments from other patients.  </li>
            <li> I am 60 years old and have had puffy bags under my eyes for several years.</li>
            <li> and then my eyes developed red patches below.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I did a side by side comparison by using it on one side of my face and there was a noticeable difference in the dark circles within two weeks</li>
            <li> I have tried a few products and normally would never spend this much money on anything for my skin, but I was feeling generous to myself the day I bought it</li>
            <li> It was a small but full jar and for the amount of money</li>
            <li> After two weeks, I developed what appeared to be three small growths (protruding bumps) underneath my right eye.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never not use it again, as my dark circles came RIGHT back!  </li>
            <li> very moisturizing- lasts a very long time as you only need the smallest dab.</li>
            <li> , it felt great, I recommend this product, just a little expensive, but</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time as it only takes a tiny bit for the whole eye area.</li>
            <li> THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE DAY THAT MY EYES</li>
            <li> This is what social media is all about.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I would wear eye creams and the slightest bit would get into my eyes and cause them to get all puffy, red and watery making them worse</li>
            <li> Frankly, I am pleasantly surprised as I have used more expensive products without the results.</li>
            <li> I really like it, didn&#x27;t get rid of 100% of the dark circles</li>
            <li> However it did absolutely nothing for my dark circles.</li>
            <li> Search \\&quot;Dark eye circle cream\\&quot; and tons of products will pop up promising to help.</li>
            <li> I also have dark circles (not so much anymore since the Teamine).   </li>
            <li> Really works to remove dark circles.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any real difference in my dark rings and puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li> It really reduces dark circles and puffiness.</li>
            <li> I have dark circles and the cream really lightens the area and smooths it out.  </li>
            <li> This eye cream works very well at diminishing those dark circles I have under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous others, some much more expensive, but none work nearly as well.</li>
            <li> You have to be consistent (morning and night) for a few weeks in order to see improvement.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly pale, sensitive skin and have used the Teamine Eye Complex for more than a year.  </li>
            <li> I developed a dry patch on my lid and under eye after using it for a week</li>
            <li> Maybe because of less breakage, I don&#x27;t know and really don&#x27;t care…it works.  </li>
            <li> It REALLY does reduce the dark circles and baggy look under my eyes; with regular use.  </li>
            <li> This is the only eye cream I&#x27;ve ever bought that I feel like it really diminishes my dark circles.  </li>
            <li> not so much.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need to use but a tiny bit, but for the money, not sure if it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Have used other Revision facial products and I highly recommend this product line.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 50&#x27;s and being black and hispanic have this hue of darkness around my eyes, which is sometimes cultural.  </li>
            <li> I decided to purchase it mainly to diminish my dark undereye circles.</li>
            <li> I am still on my first jar and use this twice a day so a little does go a long way.</li>
            <li> I stuck with it though as a part of my daily regimen, and a little over a year later, I think my eyes actually look older.  </li>
            <li> I cannot  recommend this product, please consider other eye creams that do not irritate the sensitive area around the eyes.</li>
            <li> but I have really dark circles and it lighted them quite a bit, enough that I could cover them up completely with makeup.</li>
            <li> It definitely feels stronger but I am not sure if I can really see a difference the coloring.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a few years as per the advice of a highly distinguish dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I have natural dark circles under my eyes -</li>
            <li> this product says it takes 1-2 months for a reduction of dark circles and puffiness, its been over a month and so far nothing has changed.</li>
            <li> so it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it, perhaps I have not used it long enough.</li>
            <li> You have to use it regularly for couple of months to see minor improvements.</li>
            <li> I am giving it another try as maybe I didn&#x27;t use it long enough</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no longer using heavy concealers under my eyes, just my normal foundation.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, I have quite oily skin &amp; after only a week of using this, I developed all these teeny little bumps under the skin around my eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My under eye area turned dry and red after using this product.</li>
            <li> I ended up with the dry, red latches under my eyes after about 3 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> The skin under my eyes became very red, dry, scaly, and itchy.</li>
            <li> It makes the skin around my eyes dry and red.</li>
            <li> I used it day and night, and after about a week I started seeing dry patches above, and under my eye.</li>
            <li> Really wanted to like this, but after 6 weeks of twice a day application my dark circles are still dark and the puffiness is still puffy.</li>
            <li> EVERY SINGLE REVIEW I COULD POSSIBLY FIND.</li>
            <li> I am very pale and have dark circles due to my skin being so light.</li>
            <li> It takes a few months, but this cream actually makes the dark circles much lighter.  </li>
            <li> When it came, the packaging was similar, but the jar had a silver lid instead of the black one which is on the more expensive product.  </li>
            <li> In April 2014 I bought this product at my dermatologist office for $75...hoping that it could reduce the blue tinge under my right eye, as well as minimally at least tighten up some of the &amp;#34;baggies&amp;#34; or puffiness that has appeared over the last few years.  </li>
            <li> - now I question if what I ordered is a knock off of the real Teamine Eye Complex?</li>
            <li> but it does definitely reduce puffiness around the eye and brightens(not eliminate) dark circles, only bummer about it</li>
            <li> I am 27 with moderate dark circles and puffiness, and.. still 27 with moderate circles and puffiness!</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of different eye creams for dark circles and this is the only one that works.</li>
            <li> This is the one and only eye cream I&#x27;ve ever used that actually works on my dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Also, it goes a long way unlike some creams.</li>
            <li> So I will keep using as long as it lasts</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product as long as I can get it for an affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Amazon</li>
            <li> The jar lasts a long time if you use it sparingly.  </li>
            <li> I tried this product with hopes that it would diminish the darkness under my eyes (not completely take them away).</li>
            <li> The price was reasonable and perhaps a bit less than the few times I bought it through my doctor.  </li>
            <li> So my final review of my product is that I ended up in the other 50% that it doesn&#x27;t work for.  </li>
            <li> I requested a return  - similar to what other Amazon vendors do when there are problems.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re obviously allergic as I am to other products.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happier that buying other creams that are supposed to do the same thing, but they&#x27;re inferior to the Teamine product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference within the first two weeks, and after the first two weeks, the skin under my eyes started burning really badly.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin</li>
            <li> It is now wrinkly, dry, and irritated.</li>
            <li> I have dry eye syndrome</li>
            <li> After much persuading, she finally revealed her secret.</li>
            <li> HAVE used this product in the past for dark circles under the eyes and it really works.  </li>
            <li> I am a 28 year old female and naturally have dark circles under my eyes that I was tired of covering up with concealer.</li>
            <li> But, other brands (more and less expensive) have worked just as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 weeks now and am actually seeing results - my dark circles are lightening</li>
            <li> The cream has definitely reduced the dark coloring under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Just a short time since I&#x27;ve been using this product &amp; the bags as well as dark circle under my eyes are already well</li>
            <li> I had droopy upper lids and dark under circles.</li>
            <li> Also, I havent had any progress with my dark circles, they have appeared to worsen and the product irritates my skin and causes redness and deep lines.</li>
            <li> I have deep dark circles.</li>
            <li> As a kid, I always had them, and at age 12 I started using concealer and would never leave the house without my under eye concealer for the next 10 years, and during that period of time I tried EVERY PRODUCT ON THE PLANET to try to reduce my dark circles, and nothing worked.</li>
            <li> Filming and moisturizing at the same time,  my dark circles seem to be laughter as well.  </li>
            <li> It does enhance the undereye area rather than drawing attention to the dark circles that are actually improving.</li>
            <li> It has a tiny bit of glimmer to it which seems to brighten dark circles under eyes.</li>
            <li> The only down side is the price(expensive!)and</li>
            <li> This is one of the very few beauty products I&#x27;m completely sold on.  </li>
            <li> It is the only thing that has made them much less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I have only used one half of the jar</li>
            <li> (so I gave it 3 stars), but I think any moisterizer (for a lot less money) could do the same.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews where the reviewers said this product made their wrinkles worse, but I went ahead and purchased the product based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> Sure enough, after a week goes by or I have a night of bad sleep, I wake up looking all puffy and dark under the eyes.  </li>
            <li> suffer from puffiness and dark circles due to constant allergy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but you only have to use a little bit twice a day</li>
            <li> me.&lt;br /&gt;I used this for a month and it actually broke my face out instead of removing the dark spots under my eyes!</li>
            <li> It comes in a small bottle but last long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for roughly a month and am seeing encouraging results.</li>
            <li> and it made ABSOLUTELY no difference in the puffy circles under my eyes.    </li>
            <li> So for me this was a BIG WASTE of money.    </li>
            <li> The product arrived as expected.  </li>
            <li> It makes you look like you&#x27;ve lived a lot harder and longer than some may believe.  </li>
            <li> It may cause crepey, dried out, saggy skin, bags, and deep wrinkles under your eyes.  </li>
            <li> waste your money on this product, the company&#x27;s money back</li>
            <li> A dear friend at work has absolutely NO wrinkles around her eyes.</li>
            <li> After using it for a month I saw absolutely no changes.</li>
            <li> and I have read that the longer you have them the harder it is to reduce them.</li>
            <li> I believe in using as few words as possible to communicate what I wnt to say.</li>
            <li> The skin under my eyes is actually rough feeling.</li>
            <li> Made my lids look less droopy and has tightened and improved slight red discoloring there as well.</li>
            <li> I resumed use of Teamine, and the dark circles have already stated to dissipate after only a few days.</li>
            <li> The eye complex doesn&#x27;t take the dark circles away completely but it does help even with the puffiness.</li>
            <li> I ordered the .5 ounce jar and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Actually saw results in a few days, much less redness and crepiness.  </li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try it anyway because I was so fed up with my lifelong dark circles.</li>
            <li> It has lightened the dark circles but never really took away the puffiness.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I&#x27;ve read other reviews that say it hasn&#x27;t worked for them, it has for me.</li>
            <li> overall I like the product, but I&#x27;m not sure if I have noticed a difference around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I would suggest looking at other options before picking this product.</li>
            <li> I may look for some other eye cream,</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think that it did anything different than usual over the counter creams.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the actual product.</li>
            <li> have not tried other products to compare.&lt;br /&gt;Cost</li>
            <li> I use it  morning and night after washing my face and before I put on my other skin care products.  </li>
            <li> the last two times I have ordered this eye cream there is like a air pocket in the jar where you end up only getting half a jar of eye cream and with the cost of it that is not good.</li>
            <li> (In other words, I need both products - Teamine for the puffiness bags and Hylexin for the dark circles.  </li>
            <li> A very, very little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I am 52 and had minimal wrinkles but very dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> The dark circles look just like they did before.</li>
            <li> one of which made any difference on my dark circles, puffiness, and eye wrinkles.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s advertised for dark circles</li>
            <li> This product has done nothing to improve dark circles or to even the skin tone around by eyes.</li>
            <li> I used this product in the hopes it would diminish the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> and I see no difference in the dark circles.</li>
            <li> My mother said it took away here dark circles in like 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have hereditary dark</li>
            <li> This worked so well that I forgot I had dark circles and stopped using it.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this for dark circles caused by allergies and sinus issues.</li>
            <li> but I have not seen any change in my dark circles</li>
            <li> Puffiness and dark circles ( which my dark circles are minimum) stay under control.</li>
            <li> how well it works for dark circles, since mine were never that bad.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is the one product that gets rid of my dark circles.  </li>
            <li> AS WELL FOR WRINKLES OR DARK CIRCLES</li>
            <li> I have really really dark circles and have been using this product for almost 4 months.</li>
            <li> I doubted that anything would help my dark circles.</li>
            <li> I have dark circles that are inherited and which nothing seems to work on.</li>
            <li> I have hereditary dark circles and a hereditary wrinkle under my eyes (been there since I was a kid) that puffs up often.  </li>
            <li> Also, saw no improvements in dark circles at all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the dark circle issue</li>
            <li> Not really worth the amount of money.</li>
            <li> I have had dark circles and puffy eyes since I was a child because of heredity and allergies.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for one year - immediately started seeing an improvement in dark circles and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> A beauty blogger recommended this for dark circles and bags</li>
            <li> My dermatologist promised this would work miracles on my dark circles, but I have seen no improvement at all.  </li>
            <li> nothing for dark circles&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li> I ordered this cream to get rid of dark spots under my eyes.</li>
            <li> When I was comparing the two Teamine Eye Complex producs offered by Amazon, the containers looked the same.  </li>
            <li> you have dark circles</li>
            <li> $70, over a year of use and still at least 1/3 left.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to remove my panda eyes like dark circles with this pricey stuff.</li>
            <li> IT DOES NOT REMOVE DARK CIRCLES as it claimes.</li>
            <li> And, unfortunately, it did absolutely nothing for my under eye circles.  </li>
            <li> I have hereditary dark circles.  </li>
            <li> The skin under my eyes was sunken and dark, with a pronounced ridge where my cheek bones started.  </li>
            <li> It does what it says: reduces the under eye bags and dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Teamine is not worth the money.does not do what promises to do.pricey stuff</li>
            <li> , besides, I did not see any improvement in my dark circles which are hereditary.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 20&#x27;s and have dealt with dark circles under my eyes for my entire life.</li>
            <li> It was recommended by my dermatologist for dark under eye circles.  </li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this cream for my dark circles.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had dark circles under my eyes since using this product.</li>
            <li> the product will:&lt;br /&gt;*Visibly diminishes dark under-eye circles</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend if you have dry skin, this will only make it worse.</li>
            <li> Less under eye wrinkles and less dark circles.  </li>
            <li> Other eye creams (since they are so heavy I assume) would cause me to break out.</li>
            <li> At some point after a few years I stopped... and started trying other things again, probably just to see if technology had improved since I stopped looking around, and I found myself piling on the concealer again.  </li>
            <li> I still have half a jar of Teamine</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t look like I have a black eye.    </li>
            <li> I typically use epionce renewal eye cream, but decided to buy this product as a change for the summer months.  </li>
            <li> If they don&#x27;t disappear, then I can re-review and give it one star or less.</li>
            <li> if a beauty regime  product allows me to use less of another cosmetic product, then I have to give props.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And previously I had tried everything else on the market like Garnier, Neutrogena,</li>
            <li> The jar had a black lid.  </li>
            <li> I started using Teamine a year and a half ago</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too late for me to get my money back so please don&#x27;t waste yours.</li>
            <li> and it hasn&#x27;t even slightly improved my under eye situation.</li>
            <li> For a lot less money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money, did nothing for the dark circles.</li>
            <li> A few things about me, I am poor and a major skeptic.</li>
            <li> The circles are still there and still very dark, but I believe they are receding, slightly.</li>
            <li> New Olay Regenerist Derma-Pod Eye Anti-Aging Triple Response System]], and found it useless.</li>
            <li> I am a little unsure about this product.</li>
            <li> I did notice a little bit.</li>
            <li> I use it 2 times a day and have seen little to no results.  </li>
            <li> The nectifirm cause little bumps all over the neck area too.  </li>
            <li> Within a week, I started to notice a little rash at the corners of my eyes.</li>
            <li> But, in my opinion, Teamine is not worth the risk on aging skin!  </li>
            <li> At first I thought, unfortunately, I was just developing some aging skin and absolutely felt sick about it.  </li>
            <li> I have very dark circles under my eyes at all times, and although this does not eliminate them, it does reduce them</li>
            <li> dried my undereye area.</li>
            <li> I found it to be a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Wife has been using it everyday for ~ 3 weeks</li>
            <li> After a few days off of the product, the bumps went away.</li>
            <li> I have been using this creme for a few years (on &amp; off).</li>
            <li> If not, then I&#x27;ve wasted over $50.00 on hype.</li>
            <li> i think i wasted $50.00.</li>
            <li> but after a few days of use it caused itching and some sort of allergic reaction around my eyes, so i had to discontinue using it.  </li>
            <li> After a few weeks, i noticed results.  </li>
            <li> It takes a few weeks to notice a difference.  </li>
            <li> I stored it in the cabinet for a few months and tried adding it to my regimen again.</li>
            <li> I bought teaming eye a few weeks ago</li>
            <li> I am 45, she is quite a few years my senior.</li>
            <li> and I feel as if this purchase was a waste of time and money for my issue.</li>
            <li> I have been using this eye cream for a few years</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t do anything for my dark circles and I just finished my third jar.  </li>
            <li> After running out of it recently, I decided to try some high-end drugstore creams that were much less expensive.  </li>
            <li> I still have a little dryness but no irritation!</li>
            <li> I have never had such a problem when ordering through Amazon and think the company was wrong in this accusation.    </li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended so I will give it a few months!</li>
            <li> eye cream&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizer temporarily helps small lines</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> You are paying alot for this small bottle which doesnt help .</li>
            <li> My current results with Teamine are scary and upsetting. .</li>
            <li> It did help the puffiness, but it has completely dried out my eyes!</li>
            <li> I started using it for the dark circles, but I&#x27;m not a good judge of this sort of thing.</li>
            <li> This cream is unbelievable and does what it claims.  </li>
            <li> My problem is that I have sunken eyes (which Teamine can&#x27;t help), but I was really upset because years of using heavy useless eye creams had made the skin underneath my eyes resemble chicken skin (almost like a bunch of little pimples).</li>
            <li> I am so sorry I tired this product, I&#x27;ll take dark circles over deep wrinkles any day.</li>
            <li> A silver lid on the less expensive product would have indicated to me that the products were not exactly the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, once I started using the cream, it immediately made my dark circles worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a small fortune on all kinds of expensive ones from Stivectin to Dr. Denese, not</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s nice to know that Revision does not support such stupid, cruel and psychotic methods such as animal testing.     </li>
            <li> My sister used this as well and her dry patches were even worse!</li>
            <li> and it was really hard on my skin.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m in my late 40s and my skin doesn&#x27;t have the elasticity it once did.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll finish the jar (too expensive to throw away)and hope by the time the jar is empty</li>
            <li> AFRAID TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND FIND OUT THAT THE BAGS ARE BACK!</li>
            <li> I have purchased Teamine Eye Complex before from my physician&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> Now I am desperately trying to hydrate my skin, as was suggested in someones else&#x27;s review, and hoping to at least get it back to how it was before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> had skimmed the negative reviews before purchasing but still wanted to try it because my dermatologist had recommended it.  </li>
            <li> eye complex 👍</li>
            <li> doctor said it&#x27;s because the cream is too thick for my skin</li>
            <li> I am seeing slow improvement under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I was so frustrated because it made me look so much older and tired.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so the price isn&#x27;t so bad.  </li>
            <li> guarantee doesn&#x27;t mean a thing.</li>
            <li> I have this advice for use; pat a very small amount under the eyes.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this false advertisement, but there is a silver lining: it is a luscious cream that I enjoy using for moisturizer on my face.</li>
            <li> The silver lid was not displayed on the less expensive product on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Another added bonus for those of you that are like me that are not a teen anymore but still have bad break outs</li>
            <li> This product is not good in my opinion.</li>
            <li> mom)that get even worse with lack of sleep, allergies etc.</li>
            <li> and I no longer have tired looking bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li> But i am not happy with the product.in one line</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only saying I hate it because of MY experience.</li>
            <li> and I have not found it to be irritating at all.</li>
            <li> I have always had really bad dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Those of us with dark circles just need to accept it :(</li>
            <li> I saw some lightening but that has not increased so a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> I may have had a bad batch of the product, or some weird allergic reaction, but for both reasons I would not recommend to this product to anyone--at least anyone my age that would like to avoid a product that seemed to cause premature wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product twice a day, without fail, for 5 weeks.</li>
            <li> This made my eyes swell up and get itchy and weird.</li>
            <li> Too expensive and will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is the one expensive skin product I will not go without.</li>
            <li> Not the look I was hoping for with this expensive cream.</li>
            <li> I have awful allergies, allergic conjunctivitis that affects me on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> The reviewer thought it was expensive</li>
            <li> Since I use every skin product on the market, I was skeptical that this would make a difference under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Since it was so expensive I decided to try it again</li>
            <li> I started using this product and within 3 days I had such a terrible reaction</li>
            <li> It is very painful and I&#x27;ve never had a reaction to any other creams before.</li>
            <li> After using this product for less then one week I had a terrible skin reaction from this product!</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s my theory about the users who were unhappy with the wrinkle situation:  </li>
            <li> I get severe cystic acne, so I am so afraid to put anything on my face.</li>
            <li> but I was afraid to use it after the peeling.</li>
            <li> but I was so unhappy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely unhappy.</li>
            <li> Sad!</li>
            <li> Color me sad!</li>
            <li> Your threat of bad review is ahs</li>
            <li> I,too, had a bad reaction to this cream.</li>
            <li> I used the product twice a day for a week and had a really bad reaction.</li>
            <li> IF I WAS SICK</li>
            <li> :-(  </li>
            <li> Really disappointed</li>
            <li> I re-introduced it again and both of my eyelids started to itch and swell within a couple of days. :-(</li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> I am very unhappy with this eye cream.</li>
            <li> MY WORSE NIGHTMARE!!!</li>
            <li> I stopped using it and after it healed I stupidly thought that maybe it wasn&#x27;t the lotion and tried it again...</li>
            <li> I hate to give up on it &amp; am considering using it along with another eye cream, but I&#x27;m not feeling too hopeful.</li>
            <li> I ignored the burning (which wasn&#x27;t very bad) because I wanted the results and boy did I pay the price.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product from my dermatologist and was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Terrible allergic reaction to this bottle.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the cream for years, but when I got this bottle, I used it twice and had an awful reaction.</li>
            <li> Awful product.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> It is working.  I noticed a difference immediately.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly pale, sensitive skin and have used the Teamine Eye Complex for more than a year.  My under-eye circles are gone and the crows feet that I&#x27;d started to develop have been frozen in their tracks.  The BEST news?  I still have half a jar of Teamine - it&#x27;s that good.  I use it twice per day every single day very sparingly.  I cannot emphasize enough - do not over apply this product.  It will do exactly as it promises over time.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use and lasts forever. Absorbs quickly and helps dark circles.I recommend.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 years - i still like it.</li>
            <li> I have had super dark circles &amp; puffiness under my eyes for years.  After using this product for a month I see a remarkable difference.  I would definitely recommend to this everyone.</li>
            <li> did not work for me . dried my undereye area.</li>
            <li> I have natural dark circles under my eyes - I was \\&quot;lucky\\&quot; to be born with them. I&#x27;ve been using this product for roughly a month and am seeing encouraging results. I&#x27;ve actually been able to cut back on the amount of concealer required for my under eye area (which is great because concealer just settles into fine lines making them look worse).    This is not a miracle cream that will wow you overnight. You have to be consistent (morning and night) for a few weeks in order to see improvement.</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff and will only use this.  I noticed my under eyes look more even and less puffy.  I have very fine lines and they are still there, which is why I gave the product 4 out of 5, but I have never seen a product actually reduce puffiness and dark circles like this product does.  I can feel it working too!  Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Nice enough, but haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference with my dark circles</li>
            <li> works great, but caused an allergic reaction after a few weeks so I can&#x27;t use it anymore.  noticeable improvement even in just 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at the doctor&#x27; office. I found it to be a waste of money. The product did not work for me at all.</li>
            <li> I tried Teamine because my dermatologist recommended it. He did warn me that in his experience, only 50% of users got results from the product, and that it could take up to 4 months to see results. I thought I&#x27;d try it anyway because I was so fed up with my lifelong dark circles. I&#x27;ve used Teamine twice a day for 4 months now, and have seen no results. The dark circles look just like they did before.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended I try this for my undereye circles.  It is the only thing that has made them much less noticeable.  Now I don&#x27;t always look like I never sleep!  My circle are hereditary so this product is really amazing.  Would recommend it!  I&#x27;m 40 and have had this problem for years.  No more!! :-)</li>
            <li> Wife has been using it everyday for ~ 3 weeks and she is not all that satisfied as there&#x27;s not any significant difference.</li>
            <li> Product is not the be all end all but it does definitely reduce puffiness around the eye and brightens(not eliminate) dark circles, only bummer about it is I developed a dry patch on my lid and under eye after using it for a week so I won&#x27;t get my money&#x27;s worth out of it..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an eye cream for over a year, since my first eye wrinkle came in. I&#x27;ve spent a small fortune on all kinds of expensive ones from Stivectin to Dr. Denese, not one of which made any difference on my dark circles, puffiness, and eye wrinkles. I bought this from my doctor&#x27;s office two weeks ago when she raved about it and told me the manufacturer guaranteed the product or would refund it. I noticed the difference in puffiness immediately. It&#x27;s been a week and my dark circles are going away, my wrinkles are not noticeable except for when I smile now, and the skin under my eyes has never been this soft. I will never use another cream ever again. This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by a Dermatologist, so naturally I came on Amazon to see the reviews first. Although it seemed like the product had mixed reviews, I went ahead and tried it for myself. I am a 28 year old female and naturally have dark circles under my eyes that I was tired of covering up with concealer. After about a week of using this product, I seemed to have more noticeable lines (wrinkles!) under my eyes than before I started using it. After two weeks, I developed what appeared to be three small growths (protruding bumps) underneath my right eye. I contacted my dermatologist who told me to immediately stop using the product. After a few days off of the product, the bumps went away. I may have had a bad batch of the product, or some weird allergic reaction, but for both reasons I would not recommend to this product to anyone--at least anyone my age that would like to avoid a product that seemed to cause premature wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Big savings on Amazon for a high quality product!</li>
            <li> This eye cream actually gave me wrinkles.  I used it for two weeks twice a day and one morning I looked at the skin under my eyes and had deep wrinkles.  I called the company and they said to use a hydrating boost, after two weeks they have gotten better but one eye still is not back to normal (there still is a crease where there wasn&#x27;t one before using this eye cream).  DO NOT USE IF IT BURNS AT ALL.  I ignored the burning (which wasn&#x27;t very bad) because I wanted the results and boy did I pay the price.  I don&#x27;t know if my skin under my eyes will ever be back to the way it was.  I am so sorry I tired this product, I&#x27;ll take dark circles over deep wrinkles any day.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this product for me, and this purchase was my second container.    I have very dark circles under my eyes at all times, and although this does not eliminate them, it does reduce them so I don&#x27;t look like I have a black eye.    It also reduced the appearance of the fine \\&quot;smile\\&quot; lines around my eyes.  I like the texture of the cream, it soaks in quickly and works well under makeup.    Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the product.  If I am ever able to find a product that worked even better on my dark circles, I would switch.  At this time, this is the best I have found.</li>
            <li> Recommend by my doctor,.  It works great and I continue to order it on a regular basis,</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this. I really like it, didn&#x27;t get rid of 100% of the dark circles but I&#x27;d say 80% which is great.</li>
            <li> I have always had really bad dark circles under my eyes. Nothing really seemed to help. I&#x27;ve used a bunch of different products that either irritated my skin or just didn&#x27;t work. I decided to buy Teamine and I have seen noticeable results!! It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but you only have to use a little bit twice a day so it will last a long time. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3-4 weeks and I can really see the darkening starting to go away. It&#x27;s also smoothing the skin under my eyes and just making them look brighter overall. I would definitely recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> Seems to be working okay.&lt;br /&gt;I like the consistency of it.&lt;br /&gt;Good under makeup.</li>
            <li> I have been using this creme for a few years (on &amp; off). I don&#x27;t like using a lot of products, so sometimes I slack off in the usage. Sure enough, after a week goes by or I have a night of bad sleep, I wake up looking all puffy and dark under the eyes.  I reach for my Teamine and within a day or 2, things look MUCH better.  I am surprised at many negative reviews, but we all have different skin types.  There are many products that cause a bad reaction for me, but this, fortunately, isn&#x27;t one of them.  I am well over 50; this creme took months to show any improvement, but since I bought it from my dermatologist I stayed with it and am very pleased with the results.  It is pricey, if I find something else that works as well for cheaper I may switch, but I know where I can get pricey but great results (Teamine).  Their Necktifirm (sp?) is also FANTASTIC for sagging in the jowl area and neck wrinkles.  Maybe even better than the eye creme!</li>
            <li> love this eye cream... it&#x27;s advertised for dark circles but i find it works great for everything and even under makeup.</li>
            <li> I love Revision products and wanted to love this one too, but unfortunately I must be allergic to some ingredient in it and can&#x27;t use it at all.</li>
            <li> Of course it may be too soon, but this product did not work for me.  In fact my eyes look more puffy.  Perhaps, I&#x27;m allergic to the ingredents.</li>
            <li> I typically use epionce renewal eye cream, but decided to buy this product as a change for the summer months.  The product totally reversed all of the wonders that epionce did, plus it severely exacerbated all of the things that it claims to &amp;#34;reduce.&amp;#34;.  I have tried to settle this with the seller, but they are VERY UNCOOPERATIVE!!!  Do not buy this product, or use this seller!</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this product for a couple of years now, and is very pleased with the results. However, buying it through Amazon is even better as I save a fortune over buying it directly from her doctor. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;Work&#x27;s well by reducing my puffy eyes &amp; reducing my wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product twice a day, without fail, for 5 weeks. I see no difference at all. Sad! I am 27 with moderate dark circles and puffiness, and.. still 27 with moderate circles and puffiness! So continues my never ending quest for a good eye cream.</li>
            <li> Awesome porduct.  Worth the price.  I use it nightly. You only need a light touch and It keeps the darkness at bay.</li>
            <li> I used this eye cream for a month twice a day and it help with puffiness. However it did absolutely nothing for my dark circles. I am currently using Murad lighten and brighten and it is working for me. This cream is amazing and the best thing about it is you can get a free sample from Sephora. The sample will last you a week which is enough time to see results.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews where the reviewers said this product made their wrinkles worse, but I went ahead and purchased the product based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews.  Here&#x27;s my theory about the users who were unhappy with the wrinkle situation:  in my case, I have puffiness or \\&quot;bags\\&quot; under my eyes, and the Teamine shrank/smoothed the puffiness dramatically.  But I&#x27;m in my late 40s and my skin doesn&#x27;t have the elasticity it once did.  Think about an old balloon that has deflated...without the inflation, the surface looks wrinkly.  So my puffiness or \\&quot;bags\\&quot; were greatly improved, but the surface of the skin wasn&#x27;t quite as smooth or \\&quot;plumped up.\\&quot;  There seemed to be a few more \\&quot;fine lines\\&quot; than before.  Bottom line:  in my personal opinion, I looked a *lot* better without the bags.  Therefore, I was willing to accept a few more fine lines to get rid of the bags.  (I do think this product helps with firmness and elasticity, but with older skin there&#x27;s a limit to how much a topical cream can do.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given the product 5 stars if it had also improved the black-and-blue \\&quot;circles\\&quot; underneath the inner corners of my eyes.  Reduction of the \\&quot;bags\\&quot; greatly improved the appearance of the dark circles, but I still had a problem with the black-and-blue color beneath the skin, so I went back to Hylexin which in my case reduces the black-and-blue effect.  (In other words, I need both products - Teamine for the puffiness bags and Hylexin for the dark circles.  I don&#x27;t mind using both products since they both work really well for me.)</li>
            <li> This product has done nothing to improve dark circles or to even the skin tone around by eyes.</li>
            <li> I used this product in the hopes it would diminish the dark circles under my eyes. I have used it daily for over a year now and I see no difference in the dark circles. It works okay for wrinkles so I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. I could have saved a lot of money. My recommendation...try something else.</li>
            <li> I tried this product after reading several rave reviews.  It works!  This is what social media is all about.</li>
            <li> I am a little unsure about this product. My mother said it took away here dark circles in like 2 weeks. I have been using it non stop for about a month. Granted at times I don&#x27;t get a lot of sleep. I did notice a little bit. It&#x27;s not as purple under my eyes. More of a lighter redish. I will continue to use this until it&#x27;s gone to fully see its effects. It dries great and I use under my make up. And Amazon had is cheaper then what my mom paid. So it&#x27;s a steal!!!!! Give it a try and see if it works for you. I hope to see results!</li>
            <li> Great feel, texture and appealing sent. Seemed to accomplish the stated effects but only for a short lived time. If you are looking for a nice eye cream this is fine. But, other brands (more and less expensive) have worked just as well.</li>
            <li> Love the product. Have used other Revision facial products and I highly recommend this product line.</li>
            <li> Dermatologist recommended this! It was a small but full jar and for the amount of money, I think it&#x27;s doing a fantastic Job!&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> They say Hope Springs Eternal but after almost three weeks I&#x27;ve seen no change in under eye puffiness.  I&#x27;ll finish the jar (too expensive to throw away)and hope by the time the jar is empty some of the puffiness is gone.  If not, then I&#x27;ve wasted over $50.00 on hype.</li>
            <li> lone it.thank you Very good for a.m. use</li>
            <li> Finally a product that works as advertised!  For the first time in almost 30 years, I can go without under eye conceler and not feel self conscious about my dark circles.  The product really does brighten the under eye area and plump up fine lines.  I&#x27;m at the bottom of my first jar right now, and am online to buy another.</li>
            <li> I have hereditary dark circles(thanks mom)that get even worse with lack of sleep, allergies etc. I used this product for 3 months and saw a real difference. You have to stick with it, it took a month before I started to see a difference. Also, don&#x27;t expect miracles, they won&#x27;t go away completely but I have really dark circles and it lighted them quite a bit, enough that I could cover them up completely with makeup. Before that, makeup wouldn&#x27;t even cover them completely. The only down side is the price(expensive!)and if you stop using it the circles will come back.</li>
            <li> This worked so well that I forgot I had dark circles and stopped using it. Within a month they were back and I was ordering a second jar. This stuff is the real deal.</li>
            <li> I purchased this eye cream and had high hopes for wrinkle reduction.  I use it 2 times a day and have seen little to no results.  I recently went to a class and they suggest Emu Oil.  Bought it at a health food store for $9 and have seen GREAT results!  I&#x27;d buy the Emu next time, it&#x27;s all natural, no smells, super gentle and actually puffs up skin to reduce wrinkes...</li>
            <li> This is without a doubt the best eye cream that I have ever used.  I have tried lots and lots and they do not work like Teamine.  It reduces puffiness and fine lines.  It may cost a little more but it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this product (from Amazon) because I saw literature about it in my eye doctor&#x27;s office.    I have been using it now going on 4 weeks and it made ABSOLUTELY no difference in the puffy circles under my eyes.    So I contacted Revisions Skin Care to ask what their return policy was.    First:  They indicated that their product is \\&quot;primarily for dark circles and fine lines and wrinkles\\&quot; even though their website states it works for puffy circles.    Second:  They indicated that they do not guarantee the product if bought on Amazon. And I quote:  \\&quot;We do guarantee our products when they are purchased through a physician&#x27;s office, but not through Amazon as they are not a customer of ours.   Amazon is considered a public auction and we have no control over the products that are sold on that site. They could be old, or not even our products.\\&quot;    I have never had such a problem when ordering through Amazon and think the company was wrong in this accusation.    So for me this was a BIG WASTE of money.    Please consider this before you buy any of the Revisions Skin Care products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and still love how it works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 weeks now and am actually seeing results - my dark circles are lightening and I thought nothing short of an eye-lift would help.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the product and will continue to use it.  Also, it goes a long way unlike some creams.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any change yet but I am not giving up yet. I am only 31 years old and look young everywhere except for my eyes. Very puffy and starting to have circles as well.   My dermatologist recommended so I will give it a few months!</li>
            <li> First off, Revision (who makes Teamine) does not test on animals. I refuse to buy from companies that support cruelty so it&#x27;s nice to know that Revision does not support such stupid, cruel and psychotic methods such as animal testing.     A few things about me, I am poor and a major skeptic. I always look at reviews online thinking to myself that people from the company or those that are paid wrote them. Search \\&quot;Dark eye circle cream\\&quot; and tons of products will pop up promising to help. I have tried a few products and normally would never spend this much money on anything for my skin, but I was feeling generous to myself the day I bought it and I am glad I did.     This product is excellent! I have been using this for about a year now and it has drastically improved my under eye area. My problem is that I have sunken eyes (which Teamine can&#x27;t help), but I was really upset because years of using heavy useless eye creams had made the skin underneath my eyes resemble chicken skin (almost like a bunch of little pimples). I was so frustrated because it made me look so much older and tired. I thought that there was nothing I could do about but the Teamine has worked wonders. I also have dark circles (not so much anymore since the Teamine).   I honestly have seen a dramatic difference since using this cream. It also does not burn or sting my eyes like many eye creams do. I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I would wear eye creams and the slightest bit would get into my eyes and cause them to get all puffy, red and watery making them worse then they did before. I also like how I can wear the cream 2 times a day. I LOVE this since I feel like I am working at my problems double time and I like the way it feels under my eyes.       Another added bonus for those of you that are like me that are not a teen anymore but still have bad break outs, this product is for you. I have tried many eye creams and they all broke me out. Why? Because I started to put it together that most eye creams say to wear at night, which means the cream will always end up rubbing on your pillow and ultimately rubbing off on the rest of your face. I get severe cystic acne, so I am so afraid to put anything on my face. Other eye creams (since they are so heavy I assume) would cause me to break out. Not Teamine though, since I have been using it for several months now, it has not caused any extra breakouts.     Basically, this is an excellent product. Go into it with a good attitude and know that it may take time, but for many it works.</li>
            <li> this product says it takes 1-2 months for a reduction of dark circles and puffiness, its been over a month and so far nothing has changed. a healthy hue is supposed to appear. if there is a hue i can&#x27;t see it.   supposidly after 3 months there are very significant results and then you have to go on a maintenance regimen.  in the end i think i wasted $50.00.</li>
            <li> I have tried many eye creams with very little satisfaction.  Teamine seems to reduce wrinkles and puffiness so you look refreshed in the morning.  It has a wonderful silky texture.  I definitely would recommend it.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this for dark circles caused by allergies and sinus issues. I&#x27;ve used it for over ten years.  It does a beautiful job of lightening and eliminating them, as well as improving the texture of the skin.  I stopped using it for a few months and the dark circles came back full force. I have this advice for use; pat a very small amount under the eyes. It truly doesn&#x27;t take much!  Think of it as a therapeutic cream rather than a moisturizer.  If you use a large amount, it will cause the skin to be dry and peely. After application I always apply a moisturizer over it.  This isn&#x27;t moisturizer-yet unwilling still need to use a moisturizer or gentle eye cream.  This doesn&#x27;t work overnight, but it absolutely works for me and the improvement continues for many months, with the skin gradually looking more and more smooth and much lighter in color. If you are constantly applying under eye concealer, this could be your new best friend.</li>
            <li> The product arrived as expected.  Quality of the product was superb, and I am very satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Teamine Eye Complex is wonderful and the results are amazing! In just one week, I noticed a reduction in the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, including crow&#x27;s feet. Just be sure not to use too much at one time as it may cause the skin under your eyes to become scaly or flaky.     My mother, whom I hadn&#x27;t seen in about 2 to 3 months, came to visit me about 5 days after I started using Teamine and she asked me if I had recently had a face lift! Nope, I had just started using Teamine! It&#x27;s great and I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I have been using Teamine for about 5 months. I bought it mostly for the puffiness under my eyes although I do have dark circles as well. It has lightened the dark circles but never really took away the puffiness. I am still on my first jar and use this twice a day so a little does go a long way.</li>
            <li> I no longer have to wear under eye concealer and it is remarkable for puffy eyes.  Amazing results well worth the money because you don&#x27;t have to use very much.</li>
            <li> Love it!  The cream has definitely reduced the dark coloring under my eyes.  I use it 2-3 times per day.</li>
            <li> I have tried sooooo many eye creams.  This one was recommended to me by my dermatologist.  For some reason it thickens my eyelashes.  Maybe because of less breakage, I don&#x27;t know and really don&#x27;t care…it works.  It is not a miracle, just the best eye cream out here.  Scour the internet for price points and  you will find the best here.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad eye cream, I like it.&lt;br /&gt;But I had a big expectation for this &amp;#34;miraculous&amp;#34; eye cream, and it didn&#x27;t lived up to it.</li>
            <li> I am extremely satisfied with this product and can honestly say that I&#x27;m starting to see visible results especially with my dark circles.</li>
            <li> So far, no miracles have occurred! But I do see some firming. I have extremely dry skin so it is not quite moisturizing enough for me.</li>
            <li> It some what worked for 4 days on the puffy under eyes and then it stopped working. I have continued to use it, but it has done nothing.</li>
            <li> I have only used one half of the jar but I have not seen any change in my dark circles</li>
            <li> I have had puffiness and bags under my eyes for years and I have tried alot of eye creams but no changes. I had given up until I saw this recommended on Maskcara,com blog and decided to try it. Ladies, all my puffiness is gone, I cannot even believe this. I do apply a little bit more than is recommended though. I am really very happy to find something that finally works!</li>
            <li> i had high hopes for this product, which was recommended by my dermatologist.  i liked the light fragrance and nongreasy texture of the cream but after a few days of use it caused itching and some sort of allergic reaction around my eyes, so i had to discontinue using it.  therefore can&#x27;t speak about any results.  i tried the product a couple more times but always got the rash within a day or so.</li>
            <li> I have used it for years..always got it through a plastic surgeons office at $80..you can&#x27;t find this at most any department store. I went without it for 3 mons and my eye area went downhill. I am back to stay. Ladies ( and men too)  this is the best eye cream I have even found and I use only the best products and it&#x27;s top on my list. Puffiness and dark circles ( which my dark circles are minimum) stay under control. It lasts a long time as it only takes a tiny bit for the whole eye area.</li>
            <li> Waste of money, did nothing for the dark circles. Works fine as an under eye moisturizer. Those of us with dark circles just need to accept it :(</li>
            <li> I have used this exact eye cream for years and loved it! I have always bought it from the dermatologist office. This bottle if Teamine must have been expired. It burned the skin under my eyes. It made them red, swollen, itchy and took weeks to heal. As I said, I&#x27;ve used Teamine for years without ANY problems.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using the product but for about one month.  I have noticed a difference, but want to give it a little more time.  I think it is a gradual change, but any change is better than nothing.  I do think given more time I will have more improvement, although I do not think it will eliminate the dark circles.  I will continue using until my dermatologist lets me know that another product by Dior is available.  That product is supposed to be even better with more antioxidants giving better results.  Will I buy the Teamine again...yes.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this to me for puffiness, and was very explicit that just a light dab each day was enough - and despite the small bottle it should last over a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I&#x27;ve read other reviews that say it hasn&#x27;t worked for them, it has for me. It does not work instantaneously (but then again - I&#x27;m on the \\&quot;dab will do\\&quot; plan.  But after a week what had become perpetual puffiness because of allergies, etc. are virtually gone! Wake up each day now - and think, gee - it&#x27;s working.  I can actually feel a difference in the texture of the skin around my eyes.  Don&#x27;t know how well it works for dark circles, since mine were never that bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say I tried the [[ASIN:B000NQ8F9Y New Olay Regenerist Derma-Pod Eye Anti-Aging Triple Response System]], and found it useless. So, this has definitely beaten that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: Worth a try for puffiness, wrinkles and dark circles.  Works for some, and it&#x27;s worked for me. But don&#x27;t expect miracles in a day.</li>
            <li> this is the one product that gets rid of my dark circles.  I first bought this in a dermatologists office many years ago and have used it daily every since.  Probably about 14 years now.</li>
            <li> IF YOUR PROBLEM IS PUFFY EYES, THIS IS IT!!! I&#x27;VE READ EVERY SINGLE REVIEW I COULD POSSIBLY FIND. IT TOOK ME A WHILE TO FINALLY DECIDE TO GIVE IT A TRY. I AM SOOOO GLAD I DID. I&#x27;VE STRUGLED WITH PUFFY EYES FOR THE LAST 3 YEARS AND IT WAS GETTING OUT OF HAND. I WORK EVENINGS BUT IF I HAD TO LEAVE THE HOUSE IN THE MORNING, PEOPLE WOULD ALWAYS ASK ME WHAT HAPPENED, IF I WAS SICK OR IF I HAD CRIED...  THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE DAY THAT MY EYES WOULDN&#x27;T BE SUPER PUFFY IN THE MORNING. OFTENLY, EVEN IN THE EVENINGS MY EYES WOULD STILL BE PUFFY AND PEOPLE WOULD ASK ME IF I HAD JUST WOKEN UP. IT&#x27;S THE SAME AS TELLING YOU THAT YOU LOOK BAAAD!!!! WHAT A BUMMER!!! I TRIED TEAMINE FOR THE FIRST TIME AT NIGHT BEFORE GOING TO BED AND WHEN I WOKE UP THE NEXT MORNING...  SHOCKING!!!!NO PUFFY EYES!!!! OF COURSE I LOOKED LIKE I HAD JUST WOKEN UP BUT THERE WAS NO BAGS UNDER MY EYES!!! I COULDN&#x27;T BELIEVE IT! I STILL WAKE UP EVERY MORNING AFRAID TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND FIND OUT THAT THE BAGS ARE BACK! MY WORSE NIGHTMARE!!! BUT NOOOO, THEY ARE NOT BACK!!! IF YOU HAVE THIS PROBLEM YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I AM SAYING!!! I&#x27;VE BEEN USING IT FOR A WEEK NOW AND NO PUFFY EYES IN THE MORNING!!! I STILL CAN&#x27;T BELIEVE I FOUND SOMETHING THAT REALLY WORKS!!! I DON&#x27;T KNOW IF IT WORKS AS WELL FOR WRINKLES OR DARK CIRCLES YET... MAYBE NOT THAT FAST BUT... I AM SURE IT WORKS ON PUFFY EYES!!! I HOPE THIS REVIEW HELPS!!! GOOD LUCK!!</li>
            <li> Just a short time since I&#x27;ve been using this product &amp; the bags as well as dark circle under my eyes are already well diminished.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also very happy to know the ingredients are potent &amp; natural</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It seems to really work for under eye circles. The reason I give it only 4 stars is the price is a bit much. I&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t stop me from buying again though.</li>
            <li> Really works to remove dark circles. Great product.</li>
            <li> I am only on my first jar and love it, begin to tell a little the difference on my eyes.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought this about a year ago and I&#x27;m still using it. It comes in a small bottle but last long. I like how it feels once you apply it, and didn&#x27;t get any reactions I have very sensitive skin. overall I like the product, but I&#x27;m not sure if I have noticed a difference around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Does an amazing job on face wrinkles and crows feet.  Not too much luck for me for under-the-eye circles -- it does lighten them for me a bit, but doesn&#x27;t seem to minimize them.  :-(  Elsewhere, on my face and forehead, amazing (but, of course, temporary -- need 2 use it daily).</li>
            <li> I have really really dark circles and have been using this product for almost 4 months. The circles are still there and still very dark, but I believe they are receding, slightly. So I will keep using as long as it lasts and if the circles go away, I will buy more. If they don&#x27;t disappear, then I can re-review and give it one star or less. Also, during the first two or three weeks of using the product, my eyes burned and were watery, but that problem went away.</li>
            <li> This product did not do what I was hoping it would do, so therefore I will not be ordered it again, when a person buys for a purpose, it should do the trick, this time it didn&#x27;t work fo me</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years and when i run out, i know it..it is the best eye cream for circles, wrinkles and puffiness and does all three.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 50&#x27;s and being black and hispanic have this hue of darkness around my eyes, which is sometimes cultural.  It makes you look like you&#x27;ve lived a lot harder and longer than some may believe.  In any event, I saw my ob/gyn had brochures for this product in her office.  While they were selling and informing of the product, I did some due diligence on my own to determine if this would be good for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it several months ago and while I&#x27;ve used a pinky swab and tap underneath both eyes, I have recognized that this eye cream does reduce the appearance of the darkness, allowing me to appear more well rested and using less concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s key to me...if a beauty regime  product allows me to use less of another cosmetic product, then I have to give props.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I use this and my BM Honey Bisque, it covers the darkness and brightens my entire face.  So, when the routine goes from 2 concealers (one that covers and one that holds) or from a strong coverage product like Dermablend, to just a routine of this and Bare Minerals/Bisque....then it deserves attention.</li>
            <li> great product, really good for hung-over eyes hehe</li>
            <li> I bought this product on the recommendation of my dermatologist because I have eye bags.  And previously I had tried everything else on the market like Garnier, Neutrogena, you name it, nothing worked.  But Teamine worked like a charm, first time, every time.</li>
            <li> I have noticed no difference in my droopy baggy eyes.  I will continue to use it, perhaps I have not used it long enough.</li>
            <li> A very, very little bit goes a long way. this product lasts a very long time, really works and is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for lightening the dark eye circles. I received sample packs from my dermatologist and I loved the results.</li>
            <li> I doubted that anything would help my dark circles. Then I received a sample of this product and in 5 days, I could tell a difference. I ordered the .5 ounce jar and a little goes a long way. I have stopped using concealer and that says a lot. It worked for me!</li>
            <li> My under eye area turned dry and red after using this product. I stopped using it weeks ago and I still trying get rid of the redness. Try Murad or Arbonne instead.</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream. I haven&#x27;t noticed a drastic difference in my under eye circles yet as I just started using it, but it&#x27;s a lightweight cream that really moisturizes. I&#x27;d recommend it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  I started using it about a year ago, and my fine lines, puffiness and dark circles have dramatically improved.  I&#x27;m a lifer!</li>
            <li> I had droopy upper lids and dark under circles. I&#x27;ve used it over the last year, Almost 2 jars and it is very apparent the improvement. Oh, yeah, I&#x27;m a man.</li>
            <li> Bought this and could tell no difference with twice daily use for one month. I have dark circles that are inherited and which nothing seems to work on.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of most of the Revision products but not this one, as others have said, it left my eyelids raw and sore. I am still trying to treat them with baby oil. And I also do not have sensitive skin. I cannot  recommend this product, please consider other eye creams that do not irritate the sensitive area around the eyes.</li>
            <li> This made my eyes swell up and get itchy and weird. Please save your money and purchase something -- indeed, anything -- else. As in, buy anything in the whole world because whatever it is will be better than this.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product as long as I can get it for an affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Amazon</li>
            <li> I have hereditary dark circles and a hereditary wrinkle under my eyes (been there since I was a kid) that puffs up often.  I saw a slight change at first but nothing significant.  I stuck with it though as a part of my daily regimen, and a little over a year later, I think my eyes actually look older.  I switched back the neutrogena eye boost at 1/5 of teamine&#x27;s price and my eyes looked 5 years younger in minutes. I do need something for the aging I am seeing though so I am going to try restalin silk since boost is really just a quick fix.  So my final review of my product is that I ended up in the other 50% that it doesn&#x27;t work for.  My recommendation is try some samples first and if it&#x27;s working pay the $50-$75 for the pot, don&#x27;t go for it right away because it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone.</li>
            <li> Heard quite a lot of good things about this form common friends, Decided to purchase on for my Mom. She claims that it worked, nothing instantaneous but it does get the job done.</li>
            <li> Revision Teamine  Eye cream works, visible results.  Friends have asked what have you done?</li>
            <li> I have not seen any real difference in my dark rings and puffiness under my eyes. It was pretty pricey for no results.</li>
            <li> Best eye cream ever for dark circles. I have tried lots of different eye creams for dark circles and this is the only one that works. I used to buy it from a plastic surgeon&#x27;s spa. Much cheaper on Amazon&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li> After 3 uses of this cream, the skin underneath and at the corners of my eyes was burning and red, almost wrinkled looking.  A co-worker of mine had purchased it for his wife around the same time and told me that the same thing happened to her. The smell and consistency is great, but I cannot recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I do NOT have sensitive skin, and the Teamine left me with large \\&quot;burn\\&quot; areas around the eyes.  I can&#x27;t even put makeup over the top of it.  I&#x27;m just waiting for it to heal.  I used it three days.  I highly recommend testing in an inconspicuous area first.  The nectifirm cause little bumps all over the neck area too.  This product is not good in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Great cream my neck is clearer and tighter, will order more.</li>
            <li> Saw this product in dermatologist office.  Tried sample and really liked it.  Not sure if dark circles are as faded as I would like, but am happy with how it makes my eye area feel.  I have very sensitive skin and this is a product I can use without my eyes tearing.  Definitely feel it has done wonders for wrinkles and texture, leaving them soft and smooth.  Made my lids look less droopy and has tightened and improved slight red discoloring there as well.</li>
            <li> Im unsure if this product I ordered is the genuine item listed, Ive purchased Teamine at a doctors office before and the cream was more white than this yellow color that was sent to me. Also, I havent had any progress with my dark circles, they have appeared to worsen and the product irritates my skin and causes redness and deep lines. The product sold to me initially at the doctor&#x27;s office improved my darkness and helped me, this item is the opposite thats why I question the quality of the product and if its the real Teamine.</li>
            <li> Nice texture, not greasy but did nothing for my dry under eye skin. Also, saw no improvements in dark circles at all. I&#x27;ve been using it for about two months now. Too expensive and will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> It takes a few months, but this cream actually makes the dark circles much lighter.  Amazing a cream that works at all.</li>
            <li> Expected more from this product. I will not reorder.  Will continue to use cerave under my eyes because it produced the same result.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. After running out of it recently, I decided to try some high-end drugstore creams that were much less expensive.  Withn about a week, my eyes looked &#x27;older&#x27;. So, I am back to Teamine. I don&#x27;t have the dark circle issue so cannot comment on its ability to diminish those, but it seem to moisterize well and reduce puffiness.  I am very sensitive to most creams and lotions, and this one has never irritated my skin. It was originally recommended to me by my dermatologist.  I would also recommend it.</li>
            <li> Hydrates great but as far as dark circles and puffiness.... not so much.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need to use but a tiny bit, but for the money, not sure if it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before.  It does the job for helping puffy eyes.</li>
            <li> I have some fine lines around my eyes and was searching for a cure.&lt;br /&gt;I heard that Teamine Eye Complex was the best, so I bought it right away.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I have quite oily skin &amp; after only a week of using this, I developed all these teeny little bumps under the skin around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;My doctor said it&#x27;s because the cream is too thick for my skin type.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure this works great but it just isn&#x27;t suitable for me.</li>
            <li> Not really worth the amount of money. Good results if constantly used but, takes a good two weeks. I would suggest looking at other options before picking this product.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, but had to make an exception for this product.  I have had dark circles and puffy eyes since I was a child because of heredity and allergies.  My dermatologist gave me some samples of this to try.  I had only used it 3 days, and upon returning to work, someone who doesn&#x27;t even like me commented on how \\&quot;well-rested\\&quot; I looked.  I haven&#x27;t told anyone I was using this product, but I can tell a difference.  It feels good and refreshing when applied to the eye area.  I even have rosacea of the eyelids, and am tolerating it just fine.  Thank you to the company who makes it for creating such a good product!</li>
            <li> I paid $70 at a dermatologist for this product so it&#x27;s great to find it at this price , it works slowly but does help my dark circles</li>
            <li> Over the course of a week or two this product gave me a chemical burn under both of my eyes. I stopped using it and after it healed I stupidly thought that maybe it wasn&#x27;t the lotion and tried it again...same result. I would avoid this product if I were you.</li>
            <li> Quite effective. You have to use it regularly for couple of months to see minor improvements. I have been using it for 3+ months and can see improvements.</li>
            <li> Terrible allergic reaction to this bottle.  I&#x27;ve used the cream for years, but when I got this bottle, I used it twice and had an awful reaction.</li>
            <li> My eyes looked great and then used this and they are swollen and red.  It is almost like this burned underneath my eyes.  I am throwing it away.</li>
            <li> Do NOT put this cream on your eyelids!  Mine started peeling because it&#x27;s so potent. I guess it worked ok under my eyes but I was afraid to use it after the peeling. If you have sensitive skin beware!</li>
            <li> Wife loves and reorders it.</li>
            <li> the last two times I have ordered this eye cream there is like a air pocket in the jar where you end up only getting half a jar of eye cream and with the cost of it that is not good. I may look for some other eye cream,</li>
            <li> This is one of the very few beauty products I&#x27;m completely sold on.  It REALLY does reduce the dark circles and baggy look under my eyes; with regular use.  My skin was noticeably improved after about a month of use.  This is the one expensive skin product I will not go without.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I was one of the many that are allergic to this product.  It worked great for  about a week, and I did feel like I had less bags under my eyes, but shortly thereafter, the red blotchiness appeared.  I quit using the product and the redness went away after about a week.  Tried one more time this week, but the red blotches came back immediately.  ARRRGGHHH  I read the reviews and hoped it wouldn&#x27;t happen to me, but now this is going in the trash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for one year - immediately started seeing an improvement in dark circles and wrinkles.  For about one month, I tried another, more expensive product, and noticed it did not help the way this one does.  That is when I found it on Amazon and immediately ordered it.  Once again, an immediate improvement.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, I was crossing my fingers that this stuff would work. I am very pale and have dark circles due to my skin being so light. A beauty blogger recommended this for dark circles and bags and I came over to Amazon to read reviews. I noticed a good chunk of people had issues with it drying out their skin and getting red and irritated, but I ordered anyway hoping it would work for me. I ended up with the dry, red latches under my eyes after about 3 weeks of use. Really disappointed so I returned it for a refund.</li>
            <li> This product burned the skin under my eyes.  2 days later my under eye area is still burned and swollen.  I requested a return  - similar to what other Amazon vendors do when there are problems.  This was their response \\&quot;Opened and used skin care products are not returnable. Expiration date and storage conditions are all fine. Your threat of bad review is ahs no merit.\\&quot;  I learned the true character and integrity of this company when there was a problem caused by a product they sold.  I do not treat my own customers this way!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist promised this would work miracles on my dark circles, but I have seen no improvement at all.  It seems like a good eye cream, but no better than the eye creams I usually use.  For the price, it was a huge disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Emollient eye cream&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizer temporarily helps small lines&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Does nothing for dark circles&lt;br /&gt;No better than most eye creams&lt;br /&gt;Expensive</li>
            <li> Been using this for about 17 years.  For those who are having a reaction, don&#x27;t use it!  You&#x27;re obviously allergic as I am to other products.  This is not over the counter stuff.  My skin gal prescribed this to me years before I could get it online for MUCH more money.  I&#x27;m thrilled with the price.  I stopped using it ONCE.  I&#x27;ll never not use it again, as my dark circles came RIGHT back!  If you&#x27;re sensitive, start with just twice a week until you can use it once a day.  Fine lines- gone.  Darkness and puffiness- gone.</li>
            <li> In April 2014 I bought this product at my dermatologist office for $75...hoping that it could reduce the blue tinge under my right eye, as well as minimally at least tighten up some of the &amp;#34;baggies&amp;#34; or puffiness that has appeared over the last few years.  After using this product consistently for the last 4 months I have a one word summary.....worthless!!&lt;br /&gt;Instead.....take the &amp;#34;tea&amp;#34; out of Teamine and use cool tea bags on those areas....more effective and a whole lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> This was highly recommended by my dermatologist. It makes me feel rejuvinated. There are several out there on the market; but this is ideal.</li>
            <li> I ordered this cream to get rid of dark spots under my eyes. Seems to be fading, but I have really noticed my lines around my eyes are softening,  I also use cream on my lip lines, top and bottom, and have really noticed an improvement.  I would definitely buy this eye cream again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for almost three weeks and I do notice the skin around my eyes brightening.  The darkest spots have not lightened yet, but I have seen enough change to be motivated to continue to use it.  It is also a very moisturizing cream that has helped the dry skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have purchased Teamine Eye Complex before from my physician&#x27;s office. The jar had a black lid.  When I was comparing the two Teamine Eye Complex producs offered by Amazon, the containers looked the same.  All the info was the same that I could determine. So - I bought the cheaper one.  When it came, the packaging was similar, but the jar had a silver lid instead of the black one which is on the more expensive product.  The silver lid was not displayed on the less expensive product on Amazon.  A silver lid on the less expensive product would have indicated to me that the products were not exactly the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So - now I question if what I ordered is a knock off of the real Teamine Eye Complex?</li>
            <li> Good product--recommended by a NY plastic surgeon.</li>
            <li> Product just as shown, fast shipping, will buy again.</li>
            <li> After using this product for less then one week I had a terrible skin reaction from this product! First the area around my eyes started to look bruised then a day later the burning sensation started. Then my skin started the peel like after a sun- burn! I could barely open my eyes.  The skin around my eyes is finally starting to look and fee better.  I would not use this product or recommend it to anyone. I guess I am o.k. with my skin after all!</li>
            <li> Really seems to help the appearance under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think that it did anything different than usual over the counter creams.</li>
            <li> My eye care provider recommended this.  I&#x27;ve used for several years and works great.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes when I started using this product.  Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t do anything for my dark circles and I just finished my third jar.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll waste any more money on this!</li>
            <li> I have tried dozens of eye creams (Origins, Arbonne, DHC, and practically everything at the drugstore) and this is the most effective cream for me. I noticed it at my dermatologists office and they recommended it. Amazon had it a lot cheaper so I bought it here. After a few weeks, i noticed results.  It really reduces dark circles and puffiness. The longer I use it, the more results I see. It definitely is designed to use over time, morning and night consistently.</li>
            <li> Teamine eye cream irritated my eyes as they are very sensitive.  It is funny that it caused more puffiness because of the sensitivity.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended Teamine for the dark circles I am getting from the damaged capillaries that leak around the eye as a normal part of aging. A tiny jar has lasted over a year. I used it twice a day at first, and saw improvement in about two weeks. I usually use it once nightly, but if I forget for a day or two, I can really tell the difference! This eye cream also hydrates the skin around the eye leaving the skin smoother and softer. I didn&#x27;t really realize what a miracle it was until I ran out, now I will not let that happen ever again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have dark circles I highly encourage you to try Teamine, if you are consistent in using it, it really works!</li>
            <li> I,too, had a bad reaction to this cream. I have used it for four days and my skin around my eyes appears burned and baggy. Not the look I was hoping for with this expensive cream. Beware your aging skin!</li>
            <li> My Doctor is very honest, which is why I go to her. I have awful allergies, allergic conjunctivitis that affects me on a daily basis. She introduced this product to me and said it was the only product she has ever recommended. It took a few months to take full effect, but it did exactly as it promised. I could go out without make-up (which may as well be the 7th deadly sin, I suppose it is already one - Vanity :). I am so happy with it. It has been over a year and I am still using the same jar. I saw that the overall rating was 3 stars (most left before the product even had the time to take effect) and I had to add my review. Gals, the puffiness and darkness didn&#x27;t occur overnight, and took way longer than 2 months as well. Patience! It works and well. $70, over a year of use and still at least 1/3 left. If you want results, this product is the treatment but you must be reasonable.</li>
            <li> Okay, it goes on smoothly and feels nice, but I&#x27;ve not noticed any improvement in puffiness, fine lines or dark under eye areas. Perhaps I&#x27;m just hoping for too much? I&#x27;ve been using the product for three months now.</li>
            <li> After 2 jars, I see no difference.  Its OK as a moisturizer but don&#x27;t expect much change in appearance</li>
            <li> When I received the creamed, it looked as if it had been opened already. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the actual product. The product was shipped very fast.</li>
            <li> I am seeing slow improvement under my eyes.  I guess I wanted an overnight fix, but I still have 5 weeks to the event I am trying to look good for, so I feel certain, there is improvement and looking for more.</li>
            <li> I am 60 years old and have had puffy bags under my eyes for several years. I started using Teamine a year and a half ago and I no longer have tired looking bags under my eyes. My friends keep asking me if I had work done on my face. My middle school students think I am 40. I love this product!!! It lasts me about 8 months because I use it twice a day.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products over the years to reduce under eye puffiness, primarily but also, darkness. Some worked better than others but nothing was ever what I wanted it to be til this. My daughter read a review and suggested I try it. The reviewer thought it was expensive but I have used products double this cost that did not work as well. I have been u sing it a month now and still need some work but it is the best thing I have personally used. I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> So happy to get this product here, for much less than I get it at my dermatologist.  I have used it for a year and noticed a difference since about 6 weeks in.</li>
            <li> This is the best eye cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  I have dark circles and the cream really lightens the area and smooths it out.  Wears well under makeup too.  It&#x27;s also the perfect size to carry along and reapply during the day.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a few years as per the advice of a highly distinguish dermatologist. It&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve ever used for eye creams, highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I used to use the cream bought from my dermatologist at almost twice the price. It&#x27;s the same cream that I used successfully for many years, but I found it at a more reasonable price. I&#x27;m happier that buying other creams that are supposed to do the same thing, but they&#x27;re inferior to the Teamine product.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I tried a free sample one time and thought it worked well.&lt;br /&gt;I suffer from puffiness and dark circles due to constant allergy problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it twice a day as recommended and it definitely lightens dark circles right away.&lt;br /&gt;Puffiness is reduced but not as much as I would like.  Of course I want perfect but perhaps that product doesnt exist out there.&lt;br /&gt;I have not tried other products to compare.&lt;br /&gt;Cost was more than I expected but reasonable for products of this type.</li>
            <li> Received samples from my skin care office and it worked well so I decided to order online. Within a week, I started to notice a little rash at the corners of my eyes. I layed off the product for a week and it started to get better. I re-introduced it again and both of my eyelids started to itch and swell within a couple of days. :-(</li>
            <li> I can feel a different in the skin under my eyes. It definitely feels stronger but I am not sure if I can really see a difference the coloring. I was hoping it would help lighten the darker pigment and I&#x27;m not sure it has/ will.</li>
            <li> This product works great. I have been using it for a couple of months and I can clearly see a difference in the disappearance of undereye darkness.</li>
            <li> My husband and I use this product twice a day and it has REALLY made a great improvement. Less under eye wrinkles and less dark circles.  People have noticed the improvement.  It is worth the investment.  You have to be consistent and put on a small amount in the morning and at night before bedtime.  I am very sensitive to creams and allergic to a lot of things but have had no bad reaction to this cream. It takes a few weeks to notice a difference.  We have used it for 3 months now and have noticed a BIG change.  The jar lasts a long time if you use it sparingly.  We both use it and it should last us 4 months.  My husband calls it, Ponce de Leon, the fountain of youth!! :) Enjoy!</li>
            <li> This is some of the best eye cream I have every used. Highly recommend it to any one looking to reduce lines.</li>
            <li> I have deep dark circles. I got to know about this product from my dermatologist office.I was hoping to remove my panda eyes like dark circles with this pricey stuff. But i am not happy with the product.in one line IT DOES NOT REMOVE DARK CIRCLES as it claimes. Please dont get carried away by the anonymous positive reviews here like i was. You are paying alot for this small bottle which doesnt help . Its light in weight and no smell.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin and it was really hard on my skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> My current results with Teamine are scary and upsetting. . .I am praying my skin will recover.  I am 52 and had minimal wrinkles but very dark circles under my eyes.  After using Teamine for several weeks I noticed my under eye skin was becoming super crepey, saggy, and new deep wrinkles were developing.  At first I thought, unfortunately, I was just developing some aging skin and absolutely felt sick about it.  But soon it became obvious, NOBODY ages that FAST in a course of THREE weeks!!  I could not believe a product that was supposed to do just the OPPOSITE could be causing this, but IT DID!  Now I am desperately trying to hydrate my skin, as was suggested in someones else&#x27;s review, and hoping to at least get it back to how it was before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had skimmed the negative reviews before purchasing but still wanted to try it because my dermatologist had recommended it.  Also, I use the Revision Nectafirm and I really do love that, so I trusted Teamine would be at least safe to try! I feel differently now, Teamine needs to have a warning regarding the damage it can cause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned if you have aging skin!!  It may cause crepey, dried out, saggy skin, bags, and deep wrinkles under your eyes.  And, unfortunately, it did absolutely nothing for my under eye circles.  In fact, they started to look ruddy red! If you are young and have tight skin but dark circles, you may be safe.  But, in my opinion, Teamine is not worth the risk on aging skin!  Good luck, all.</li>
            <li> I give it a 3 stars because I don&#x27;t see that it does much different than many other creams.  It is OK moist, and for concealment, don&#x27;t see that it covers dark or puffiness under the eyes..</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and it does a fantastic job reducing dark rings or circles under your eyes.  I use it at night before bed.</li>
            <li> I have hereditary dark circles.  As a kid, I always had them, and at age 12 I started using concealer and would never leave the house without my under eye concealer for the next 10 years, and during that period of time I tried EVERY PRODUCT ON THE PLANET to try to reduce my dark circles, and nothing worked. I started using Teamine around age 22 when I read a pamphlet on it in my derma&#x27;s office.  I can&#x27;t remember when I saw the improvement but I didn&#x27;t have to use concealer anymore after some time.  I used this for years and loved it.  At some point after a few years I stopped... and started trying other things again, probably just to see if technology had improved since I stopped looking around, and I found myself piling on the concealer again.  I resumed use of Teamine, and the dark circles have already stated to dissipate after only a few days. I only had to pat a light layer of concealer today, and I hope that eventually I can get to the point at which I don&#x27;t need concealer anymore.  I&#x27;m scratching my head as to why I ever stopped using it.  It&#x27;s the only product that works, and trust me I have tried them ALL.</li>
            <li> Awful product. Worked for about a week and then my eyes developed red patches below. I stopped using it and they went away. When I tried again they come out immediately. It is very painful and I&#x27;ve never had a reaction to any other creams before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for some time now and haven&#x27;t seen any difference.  It&#x27;s too late for me to get my money back so please don&#x27;t waste yours.</li>
            <li> love this eye cream its awesome . Dermatologist told me about this product. Shipped fast and great condition</li>
            <li> I bought this product from my dermatologist and was very disappointed. I used the product twice a day for a week and had a really bad reaction. The skin under my eyes became very red, dry, scaly, and itchy. I stopped using the product and waited for my skin to heal and then tried the product again. I had the same reaction the second time after only using the product for two days. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I understand that some products will cause an allergic reaction in some people. But I expect that for a product that claims a money back guarantee and costs $50 that I could return the product if I had a problem. Neither my dermatologist or the company would give me my money back. I wrote to the company several times describing the problem and offerig to return the unused portion of the product, but the company never responded. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product, the company&#x27;s money back guarantee doesn&#x27;t mean a thing.</li>
            <li> Since I use every skin product on the market, I was skeptical that this would make a difference under my eyes.  The skin under my eyes was sunken and dark, with a pronounced ridge where my cheek bones started.  I felt so old. I consulted a cosmetic surgeon, who suggested I try this product before doing anything drastic.  When my hair dresser took me aside to ask me if I&#x27;d had work done on my eyes (\\&quot;They look fabulous!\\&quot;) I knew I&#x27;d found something that worked.  I&#x27;m no longer using heavy concealers under my eyes, just my normal foundation.  Nothing&#x27;s perfect, but for me, Teamine works very well.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this product at all. The price is high for the size and quality. I really regret buying it</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product; HOWEVER, .......Before placing an order or before you pass this product by for another one, go to the mfg&#x27;s web site and read the following page: [...] ; that page states that \\&quot;Anywhere you can buy the Revision Skincare Advanced Skincare Line of products online is unauthorized\\&quot; . Amazon.com is one of the sites listed.</li>
            <li> Have used it for 3 months twice a day but zero difference. I guess these products are hit or miss!</li>
            <li> Good Eye Cream!  I use Estee Lauder creams, but this cream for the eyes is even better!  Purchased from Dermatologist, then from Amazon.  Good product!</li>
            <li> I am a fan of quality eye creams, always have been. This was recommended by my esthestician. I was optimistic after reading reviews, but it did not work well for me. It makes the skin around my eyes dry and red. After I used it for a couple of days my skin started to peel. I stored it in the cabinet for a few months and tried adding it to my regimen again. It did the same thing. I discontinued use.</li>
            <li> I bought teaming eye a few weeks ago and I use it about one weeks and around my eyes appear redness skin what can I do&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i suspend the cream and I want to ask you if you have two or more kinds of teaming for eyes or you have only one kind?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to contact which the seller or the manager of teamine Revision&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please contact me as soon as possible</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. A dear friend at work has absolutely NO wrinkles around her eyes. She is retiring this year. After much persuading, she finally revealed her secret. This eye cream is the answer to my crows feet prayers.  I wouldn&#x27;t have crows feet if I didn&#x27;t smile. I am 45, she is quite a few years my senior. I have seen some improvement since I started using the eye cream. I would love for my wrinkles to vanish like hers. It only takes a dab of eye cream. A little goes a long way so the price isn&#x27;t so bad.  I have only been using it a few weeks now, and there really is some improvement.</li>
            <li> Works great and price is better than at the dermatologist.</li>
            <li> This eye cream works very well at diminishing those dark circles I have under my eyes. It arrived on time, and is reasonably priced considering how well it works.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year now and can really see a difference when I don&#x27;t use it.  It does what it says: reduces the under eye bags and dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product !!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this eye cream. Works beautifully, you can really see a difference. Use am and pm. Great under make up.</li>
            <li> Had a sample from my dermatologist&#x27;s office.. and it seemed to work in a week&#x27;s application. Now that it&#x27;s been 3 months... I can see a that the darkness under my eyes have lightened... I&#x27;m hopeful to continue to see more improvement as time progresses.</li>
            <li> The product is good,its smooth ,its not oily,great price. For wrinkle its great and dark circle.Yes I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Teamine is not worth the money.does not do what promises to do.pricey stuff</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by my dermatologist and I thought I liked it but I have sensitive skin and after a week I started to get a rash.</li>
            <li> I finally found an eye team that really does improve the wrinkles under my eyes.  Filming and moisturizing at the same time,  my dark circles seem to be laughter as well.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use the product.  It was mailed in a flimsy envelope and the box (along with the seal) was smashed and opened.  I returned the product because I&#x27;ve heard too many stories about people selling a fraudulent product in the original containers of the actual product.  The company didn&#x27;t offer to send a replacement, but readily offered to take it back-postage paid.&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE used this product in the past for dark circles under the eyes and it really works.  IF you actually get the &amp;#34;real thing&amp;#34; in the container.  I may try purchasing it directly from the manufacturer, even if it costs more, because I know that the &amp;#34;real thing&amp;#34; actually works.  The first time I used it, I did a side by side comparison by using it on one side of my face and there was a noticeable difference in the dark circles within two weeks so I immediately began using it on both sides of my face.  Almost a scientific study :D  I&#x27;d get this product but avoid the seller.</li>
            <li> please do not buy this product. Left me with deeper circles and fissures under the eyes that took 2 weeks to heal, once I stopped it.</li>
            <li> I am 35 years old &amp; have puffiness under my eyes. I bought this after seeing it recommended on the Maskcara blog. It did help the puffiness, but it has completely dried out my eyes! It is now wrinkly, dry, and irritated. I started using it once a day instead of twice, but still the same. I hate to give up on it &amp; am considering using it along with another eye cream, but I&#x27;m not feeling too hopeful. :( Update: I am using only a tiny dab now and only in the morning. I also apply a moisturizer first. I still have a little dryness but no irritation! Better!</li>
            <li> This cream made me very excited because its reputation had preceded it and I have seen it in some high end skin spas. I bought it on Amazon, I was even more excited because it was way cheaper than I had seen in stores. However, once I started using the cream, it immediately made my dark circles worse. I woke up the next day looking like I hadn&#x27;t gotten any sleep at all. This cream claims to work magic on circles and bags, but I have been using it for a month now and it hasn&#x27;t even slightly improved my under eye situation. I am very disappointed in this false advertisement, but there is a silver lining: it is a luscious cream that I enjoy using for moisturizer on my face. My skin is very sensitive and will break out using most creams, but this one is quite nice!</li>
            <li> I like the way this feels on my skin.  It does enhance the undereye area rather than drawing attention to the dark circles that are actually improving.</li>
            <li> This product sounded promising. I read all the reviews before trying it, and was excited to try it. I used it day and night, and after about a week I started seeing dry patches above, and under my eye. I have since stopped using it, besides, I did not see any improvement in my dark circles which are hereditary. I don&#x27;t recommend if you have dry skin, this will only make it worse. My sister used this as well and her dry patches were even worse! she is still recovering. This cream is horrible. DO NOT RECOMMEND!!</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this cream. I didn&#x27;t notice any difference within the first two weeks, and after the first two weeks, the skin under my eyes started burning really badly. I used it for another couple of days because I thought maybe it was my allergies making my eyes water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nope.  The skin under my eyes was flaking off and had become so red, irritated, and wrinkly that I had to use hydrocortisone cream to calm the irritation for several days.</li>
            <li> I am so...glad that you asked how this product worked for me! I have been trying to get my money refunded back to me.&lt;br /&gt;I used this for a month and it actually broke my face out instead of removing the dark spots under my eyes! The darkness became even darker and puffiness even  puffier. I called the company and was told that they couldn&#x27;t give me a refund, because I didn&#x27;t buy it from them. I went to the doctor that recommended me to get it from amazon, and was told also that they couldn&#x27;t give me a refund! I was told to contact Amazon! In which I am in the process of doing now! I am so very upset! I have to walk around with my eye&#x27;s looking like they were burned underneath. So Upset!!!!</li>
            <li> I am in my late 20&#x27;s and have dealt with dark circles under my eyes for my entire life. It must be hereditary because I&#x27;m already noticing them on my four year old daughter. I tried this product with hopes that it would diminish the darkness under my eyes (not completely take them away). After using it for a month I saw absolutely no changes. There was no difference whatsoever and I feel as if this purchase was a waste of time and money for my issue.</li>
            <li> This is the one and only eye cream I&#x27;ve ever used that actually works on my dark circles under my eyes. I&#x27;ve tried numerous others, some much more expensive, but none work nearly as well. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Really wanted to like this, but after 6 weeks of twice a day application my dark circles are still dark and the puffiness is still puffy. I have had bags under my eyes for many years now and I have read that the longer you have them the harder it is to reduce them. So perhaps if you started with this cream when the puffiness first started it would be effective.</li>
            <li> Good Eye Product. Meets expectations.</li>
            <li> After using this product for 3-4 wks the underneath of my eyes became very sensitive and red/blotchy. then my skill started to flake. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the potency of it or what, but i do not have sensitive skin and have never had a reaction like this to eye cream. I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It works well and does not irritate.  I believe in using as few words as possible to communicate what I wnt to say.</li>
            <li> i have used the real product before to great results. i ordered from amazon which is NOT an authorized retailer of the product, but i wanted to see if maybe i would get lucky. as soon as i opened the package the scent was overwhelming and i knew i did not receive a genuine product. amazon&#x27;s customer service was great and the return was easy. if you are looking for the real product, visit the manufacturer website to find an authorized retailer in your area.</li>
            <li> Very good product. The eye complex doesn&#x27;t take the dark circles away completely but it does help even with the puffiness. My husband has only been using this product for about 3 weeks &amp; has noticed a difference. I will purchase this product again for him.</li>
            <li> This product caused red scaling in an area under each eye.  Have discontinued use.  I was hoping this was a good product since it was advertised in a dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> Been using for about a month.  It was recommended by my dermatologist for dark under eye circles.  He told me that it was a tad pricey and that it may or may not work for me, but that he had heard positive comments from other patients.  I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> very moisturizing- lasts a very long time as you only need the smallest dab. I started using it for the dark circles, but I&#x27;m not a good judge of this sort of thing. My darkness is actually the hollow that develops with age- can&#x27;t expect a cream to give me an eye lift :) For the price, for the result- I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> I have used this several times and have always been pleased with the result of firmer eyes and reduced circles!</li>
            <li> I am very unhappy with this eye cream. It has caused the skin under and around my eyes to become red and dry and more wrinkled. I tried to give it a fair chance of 6 weeks but I was so unhappy I tried to return it. However since it had been more than 30 days Amazon wouldn&#x27;t let me. Since it was so expensive I decided to try it again but I had the same problems. The skin under my eyes is actually rough feeling. I&#x27;m extremely unhappy.</li>
            <li> When I first started using this I saw some lightening but that has not increased so a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this cream for my dark circles.  I&#x27;ve had them since high school and am now 58.  I also had puffiness and small bags under my eyes, along with fine wrinkles.  This cream is unbelievable and does what it claims.  The very first day I used it my husband noticed that the bags and puffiness had disappeared!  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now and the under eye circles are noticeably better. Even the fine wrinkles are disappearing. This cream will be part of my daily regimen until I die!  I read that some reviewers didn&#x27;t have much improvement.  It doesn&#x27;t work for everybody, but for 87% of us this stuff is fabulous.  I never post reviews, but had to comment on this excellent eye cream.</li>
            <li> Made my eyes swell, itch and flake.&lt;br /&gt;Trying to return.</li>
            <li> Always a great cream - but took a long time to arrive.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 6 months. I just love it. The skin around my eyes has no wrinkles. Also works to get rid of puffiness.</li>
            <li> I used this for a good 6 months before deciding it doesnt do diddly. I make my own eye serum that is more effective at fading dark circles than this. And more moisturizing and lifting too. For a lot less money. Pass.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this many times before and was happy to procure it at a reduced price. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This product may work for some people but I don&#x27;t think it works for people whose under eye darkness is genetic.</li>
            <li> I started using this product and within 3 days I had such a terrible reaction I couldn&#x27;t use it.  I&amp;#34;m thinking it&#x27;s the titanium in it.  I&#x27;m only saying I hate it because of MY experience.</li>
            <li> I had used samples of this eye cream before purchasing from Amazon. It&#x27;s the exact same product and through Amazon I was able to save a fair amount of money. It helped make my under eye skin a lot more firm.</li>
            <li> This is the only eye cream I&#x27;ve ever bought that I feel like it really diminishes my dark circles.  It works!!!  This is my 2nd jar.  I won my first one at an open house at a cosmetic surgery office.  I used it all and just couldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream, since i started using it my dark puffy circles are gone!  Finally something that works!  :)</li>
            <li> I have been using this eye cream for a few years and I will not change to anything else, it works without giving me bags and really works on fine lines and keeps your skin looking young longer, I recommend it of people all the time! It&#x27;s very light and last for a long time.</li>
            <li> Recently, I heard about Teamine on Doctor Radio.  My experience is it dramatically improved my red puffy area in the corner of one eye.  I am pleased the improvement was within a couple of days.  Frankly, I am pleasantly surprised as I have used more expensive products without the results.</li>
            <li> Soaks into skin well, made my eyes feel well hydrated. Makeup could be put over without flaking.  I recommend highly.</li>
            <li> Actually saw results in a few days, much less redness and crepiness.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year , it smoothes out the fine lines under your eyes &amp; eyelids , I love Revision Teamine eye complex 👍❤️</li>
            <li> Buy this because it is proven to be the best for circles under the eyes.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had dark circles under my eyes since using this product. I have faithfully used it for 6 years!</li>
            <li> After having read the reviews, that this stuff really works, I gave it a try. Am still working it, and will till the end of the jar. Am doing only one eye so that I can easily compare. Have been using it for a month, twice a day. No difference at all between eyes. Color me sad! It obviously works for some people, so that&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> It has a tiny bit of glimmer to it which seems to brighten dark circles under eyes. I like it.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this eye cream and gave me some samples. I decided to purchase it mainly to diminish my dark undereye circles. I have been using it for 2 months morning and night. The Revision website states the product will:&lt;br /&gt;*Visibly diminishes dark under-eye circles&lt;br /&gt;*Smooths the look of fines lines and wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;*Firms and brightens skin and provides antioxidant benefits&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product did none of these things for me. The only benefit was softer undereye skin (so I gave it 3 stars), but I think any moisterizer (for a lot less money) could do the same.  In all fairness, I do not think any product can diminish my dark circles, but I had hoped to see less fine lines/wrinkles and better skin texture with this higher end product - I did not. I do not recommend this product and will not be repurchasing it.</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended this but I have used it before and did not get positive results.  I am giving it another try as maybe I didn&#x27;t use it long enough but I think that I did.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended it many tears ago and I haven&#x27;t found an eye cream as effective with dark circles as Teamine. I use it  morning and night after washing my face and before I put on my other skin care products.  I have dry eye syndrome and I have not found it to be irritating at all. I am happy I can now order it through Amazon and have it in two days.  The price was reasonable and perhaps a bit less than the few times I bought it through my doctor.  Thank you for  carrying a great product!</li>
            <li> This cream does wonders, my eyes looked great, it felt great, I recommend this product, just a little expensive, but hey! anything for youth looking skin, right?</li>
