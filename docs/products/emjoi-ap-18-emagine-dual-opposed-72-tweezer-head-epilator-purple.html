            <li>Awesome!</li>
            <li>awesome.</li>
            <li>wish you all the best of luck, and I hope you&#x27;ll be able to handle it!</li>
            <li>It was amazingly hair-free!  </li>
            <li>There are kinds that are soothing (kind of like the oil for after waxing) and then there are the kind meant for reducing the regrowth of hair.</li>
            <li>Decided to go with the 72 tweezers this time and it really is much better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely better than my Remington epilator</li>
            <li>Way better than waxing.</li>
            <li>These days I even epilate my arms, even though they&#x27;re not especially hairy, just because I can - LOL!  </li>
            <li>Instead of pulling the hair from the root, it broke it at the skin and required many passes to even grab it at all.</li>
            <li>I love it......  </li>
            <li>The best part about using an epilator is that you can go at your own pace because even if you use it only on your legs there will always be more sensitive spots.</li>
            <li>The old one was AWESOME, this one, not so much.</li>
            <li>I actually quit waxing and love it, love it, love it!  </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t comfortable with the product.</li>
            <li>Fantastic for bikini area.</li>
            <li>Epilators leave my arms and legs hairless for 2-3 weeks and the regrowth is always smooth and not prickly.</li>
            <li>The Emjoi AP-18 has significantly reduced the number of hair breakage and missed spots.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>This is my fourth epilator (they do wear out) and this is the best by far.  </li>
            <li>Closer inspection with bright light found three hairs, obviously pulled from root, in unit.</li>
            <li>Well, that isn&#x27;t true for me.  </li>
            <li>but once u get used to it its not bad.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>My old one finally died after years of faithful service, and I am happy to announce that I LOVE THIS NEW EPILATOR!!!  </li>
            <li>For the first time in 30 years, I am achieving shave-smooth legs with this fantastic epilator.</li>
            <li>I went over freshly epilated skin with my old model, just for the light, to better see just how hair-free my skin was.  </li>
            <li>would give this a stellar 5 star review - if it had a light.  </li>
            <li>With time the hair will be thinner and more sparse, and because of hair growth cycles it will never hurt as much as the first time if you keep up on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used to pay to have full Brazilians done, but now I can do it for free with minimal pain in my own bathroom.</li>
            <li>This does exactly what is says it will do!  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>It will hurt but I find the pain is well worth it.</li>
            <li>My previous model did have a light, which I really liked.  </li>
            <li>It does the job quicker than an older model Panasonic and definitely removes hair more easily.  </li>
            <li>My legs felt smoother after the first use.</li>
            <li>This is my third epilator in the past 10 years and it seems to be the best.</li>
            <li>The reason for this is because your first time you will have the highest volume of hair on your leg per pass.</li>
            <li>Also, you may not get all of the hairs the first day.</li>
            <li>One brand that I like is Kalo, but keep in mind that this will burn a bit after you put it on the first of three times after epilating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Product does exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>It misses most of the facial hair regardless of length.</li>
            <li>it pains like hell for the first time.</li>
            <li>I am a seasoned epilator...</li>
            <li>The app was free and could easily be off, but maybe the pitch of this model just sounds louder than other models?&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>for everything else, this model is far superior to any other epilator I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>But even if I have to buy a new one every year, it would still be worth it.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>This product works very well.  </li>
            <li>VERY UNSANITARY.</li>
            <li>Do this for the whole</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already recommended this product to all my friends, haha.</li>
            <li>This product is really for body hair....</li>
            <li>I can even use it on my MOST sensitive and private of areas.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ve developed a higher tolerance to the pain</li>
            <li>As the user manual indicates, it&#x27;s best to use one of the two &amp;#34;heads&amp;#34; for the face - but one head has few tweezers that are spread apart, so it was not effective - even though perhaps combined there are 72.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>: I highly recommend you get a Post Epilating cream.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>1: Before you even start, make sure you&#x27;ve grown your hair out a bit so that it is long enough for the epilator to grab onto.</li>
            <li>It is better than the other brand I bought, that barely pulls the hair out.</li>
            <li>I saw that other reviewers found they didn&#x27;t miss not having a light on this model.  </li>
            <li>Well, I miss the light, especially when removing unwanted facial hair.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why it doesn&#x27;t works as well as the old one.</li>
            <li>Yes it hurts, but at least it&#x27;s bearable now :).</li>
            <li>Granted, the new hair growth is barely noticeable, but there is growth!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>You legs should be clean and dry, but not so dry that you appear to need lotion.</li>
            <li>I was ready for something new, so recently tried but returned the Philips; I didn&#x27;t like it for the same reason as the Emjoi:&lt;br /&gt;I tested the Emjoi on my upper lip and armpits.</li>
            <li>: Starting on the inner front of your leg (least sensitive part) do several fast, brief passes until you&#x27;ve gotten most of the hair from that area.</li>
            <li>I was surprised when the app said both models were equally noisy.  </li>
            <li>I have previously had two Braun epilators which died and required replacement - I found them both effective, although they were slow.</li>
            <li>Anyway, it takes 3-4 passes over the same stop to remove the hair and it definitely doesn&#x27;t pull it out all the way because it grows back a lot quicker than when I used the old one.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;d buy it in a heartbeat, even though I&#x27;ve only had this one for barely 2 months.</li>
            <li>I only hope this one lasts as long as my old one did.</li>
            <li>It is a bit uncomfortable at first, but certainly worth it.</li>

            <li> My old model was decent, except for the underarms - and that just plain hurt!  </li>
            <li> I was able to remove facial hair and underarm hair fairly quickly with my old model, but it did an awful job on my legs.  </li>
            <li> Did not work as expected, the product barely trimmed any of the hairs.</li>
            <li> I agonized for a long time before finally ordering this.  </li>
            <li> As for noise, I thought this was a little louder than my old model, but my husband tested it with an app he had on his cell phone.  </li>
            <li> Item did not appear &amp;#34;New&amp;#34; with many scratches and dirty looking so item was returned.</li>
            <li> Shaving inevitably leads to nicks which are way more painful and last longer.</li>
            <li> It pulls out more hair in less time so the whole ordeal is a less painful experience.</li>
            <li> This is far more convenient, faster and less painful than waxing.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it came with two sensitive covers and no protective covers, rather than one of each cover as described in instructions.</li>
            <li> Is painful, though, for the first few times, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> leg will be covered in red dots, and will be irritated for a few days.</li>
            <li> I also recommend doing what is known as a Dry Brush so that the skin is slightly exfoliated and the hairs are lifted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a quarter Italian and my leg hair is course and thick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really nice product very painful.</li>
            <li> on my legs and under arms than my previous two.</li>
            <li> but it also doesn&#x27;t sting as much as my previous Emjoi.</li>
            <li> I have epilated for years, and even though I&#x27;ve often heard that the longer you epilate, the less often you have to.  </li>
            <li> If this was your first time using an epilator like it was for me, I have some tips for you.&lt;br /&gt;First, know that it will hurt like crazy.</li>
            <li> For me, there is little to no pain epilating anywhere - face, underarms, bikini line and legs.  </li>
            <li> However, I was unable to rate product as only the device was delivered without charging cord or other accessories.</li>
            <li> It is awkwardly shaped, and the tweezer head(s) is small, so it&#x27;s hard to keep the device at the right angle to grip the hairs.</li>
            <li> which just plain sucks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Slightly painful at first</li>
            <li> It took me an hour to do both of my legs the first time because of how painful it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This will be far less painful since there are less hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But even I had areas that I felt were too painful to go over with my old epilator.  </li>
            <li> I mean they are tweezers.</li>
            <li> Waxing is a long and messy process, and just as painful.</li>
            <li> It works more efficiently and faster, and even less painful (though I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very painful anyway)</li>
            <li> Bad packaging.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Was looking forward to trying Emjoi. Delivery was fast. However, I was unable to rate product as only the device was delivered without charging cord or other accessories. Item did not appear &amp;#34;New&amp;#34; with many scratches and dirty looking so item was returned.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Slightly painful at first but once u get used to it its not bad.Definitely worth it.The hairs grow back thinner and eventually dont grow back at all. I recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> This product works very well.  It does the job quicker than an older model Panasonic and definitely removes hair more easily.  My legs felt smoother after the first use.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement to the ol&#x27;school emjoi that died after &amp;#62;10yrs of use. The old one was AWESOME, this one, not so much. I don&#x27;t understand why it doesn&#x27;t works as well as the old one. Why does technology keep getting cheaper and unreliable. Anyway, it takes 3-4 passes over the same stop to remove the hair and it definitely doesn&#x27;t pull it out all the way because it grows back a lot quicker than when I used the old one. It is better than the other brand I bought, that barely pulls the hair out. I guess I will deal.</li>
            <li> This is my fourth epilator (they do wear out) and this is the best by far.  I am a quarter Italian and my leg hair is course and thick. The Emjoi AP-18 has significantly reduced the number of hair breakage and missed spots.  And imagine... 72 tweezers!  For the first time in 30 years, I am achieving shave-smooth legs with this fantastic epilator.</li>
            <li> One star only as it is required. Suspected it was USED upon receipt as the clear tape at top of box was dirty and not sticking. Closer inspection with bright light found three hairs, obviously pulled from root, in unit. VERY UNSANITARY.</li>
            <li> This is my third epilator in the past 10 years and it seems to be the best. It works more efficiently and faster, and even less painful (though I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very painful anyway) on my legs and under arms than my previous two. This is far more convenient, faster and less painful than waxing. I highly recommend it. My only complaint is that it came with two sensitive covers and no protective covers, rather than one of each cover as described in instructions.</li>
            <li> Had to return it. Bad packaging. Wasn&#x27;t comfortable with the product.</li>
            <li> If this was your first time using an epilator like it was for me, I have some tips for you.&lt;br /&gt;First, know that it will hurt like crazy. The reason for this is because your first time you will have the highest volume of hair on your leg per pass. Since hair grows in cycles this won&#x27;t be the case for future, continued use of the epilator. It took me an hour to do both of my legs the first time because of how painful it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip 1: Before you even start, make sure you&#x27;ve grown your hair out a bit so that it is long enough for the epilator to grab onto. You legs should be clean and dry, but not so dry that you appear to need lotion. I also recommend doing what is known as a Dry Brush so that the skin is slightly exfoliated and the hairs are lifted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip 2: Starting on the inner front of your leg (least sensitive part) do several fast, brief passes until you&#x27;ve gotten most of the hair from that area. Just take deep breaths, focusing your thoughts on something else and treat it like ripping off a band-aid. After that, go back and go slower with a circular pattern to get the remaining hairs. Do this for the whole leg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your leg will be covered in red dots, and will be irritated for a few days. Also, you may not get all of the hairs the first day. Go back the following day and get any of the spare hairs that it missed or didn&#x27;t pull out fully. This will be far less painful since there are less hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip 3: I highly recommend you get a Post Epilating cream. There are kinds that are soothing (kind of like the oil for after waxing) and then there are the kind meant for reducing the regrowth of hair. One brand that I like is Kalo, but keep in mind that this will burn a bit after you put it on the first of three times after epilating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip 4: Don&#x27;t give up just because it hurts. My legs are definitely smoother compared to shaving, though there are still tiny hairs felt when I run my hand up my leg even after 2 uses (reasonfor 4/5 stars). With time the hair will be thinner and more sparse, and because of hair growth cycles it will never hurt as much as the first time if you keep up on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish you all the best of luck, and I hope you&#x27;ll be able to handle it!</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.  Product does exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Did not work as expected, the product barely trimmed any of the hairs.</li>
            <li> Product works as advertised</li>
            <li> Fantastic for bikini area. I used to pay to have full Brazilians done, but now I can do it for free with minimal pain in my own bathroom. The best part about using an epilator is that you can go at your own pace because even if you use it only on your legs there will always be more sensitive spots. I&#x27;ve already recommended this product to all my friends, haha.</li>
            <li> This product is really for body hair....not for face. It misses most of the facial hair regardless of length.</li>
            <li> Had a smaller one and used it until it stopped working. Decided to go with the 72 tweezers this time and it really is much better. It pulls out more hair in less time so the whole ordeal is a less painful experience. Maybe I&#x27;ve developed a higher tolerance to the pain but it also doesn&#x27;t sting as much as my previous Emjoi. It&#x27;s definitely better than my Remington epilator which just plain sucks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product. It will hurt but I find the pain is well worth it. Shaving inevitably leads to nicks which are way more painful and last longer. Waxing is a long and messy process, and just as painful. Epilators leave my arms and legs hairless for 2-3 weeks and the regrowth is always smooth and not prickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really nice product very painful.I mean they are tweezers.</li>
            <li> This product does justice to what it says. I&#x27;m not going to lie..it pains like hell for the first time. You get used to the pain eventually. Way better than waxing. Worth the money!</li>
            <li> It came without instructions on how to use it and care for it. I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Works well!  I actually quit waxing and love it, love it, love it!  No rash or bumps either.  Is painful, though, for the first few times, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> I agonized for a long time before finally ordering this.  My previous model did have a light, which I really liked.  I saw that other reviewers found they didn&#x27;t miss not having a light on this model.  Well, I miss the light, especially when removing unwanted facial hair.  As for noise, I thought this was a little louder than my old model, but my husband tested it with an app he had on his cell phone.  I was surprised when the app said both models were equally noisy.  The app was free and could easily be off, but maybe the pitch of this model just sounds louder than other models?&lt;br /&gt;As for everything else, this model is far superior to any other epilator I have ever used.  I went over freshly epilated skin with my old model, just for the light, to better see just how hair-free my skin was.  It was amazingly hair-free!  For me, there is little to no pain epilating anywhere - face, underarms, bikini line and legs.  My old model was decent, except for the underarms - and that just plain hurt!  It also took a fraction of the time to use.  I was able to remove facial hair and underarm hair fairly quickly with my old model, but it did an awful job on my legs.  These days I even epilate my arms, even though they&#x27;re not especially hairy, just because I can - LOL!  I have epilated for years, and even though I&#x27;ve often heard that the longer you epilate, the less often you have to.  Well, that isn&#x27;t true for me.  Even with this model, I have to epilate facial hair weekly, and I can get by with epilating my underarms and legs once every two weeks.  Granted, the new hair growth is barely noticeable, but there is growth!&lt;br /&gt;I would give this a stellar 5 star review - if it had a light.  Should Emjoi come out with a model, I&#x27;d buy it in a heartbeat, even though I&#x27;ve only had this one for barely 2 months.</li>
            <li> I have previously had two Braun epilators which died and required replacement - I found them both effective, although they were slow. I was ready for something new, so recently tried but returned the Philips; I didn&#x27;t like it for the same reason as the Emjoi:&lt;br /&gt;I tested the Emjoi on my upper lip and armpits. It is awkwardly shaped, and the tweezer head(s) is small, so it&#x27;s hard to keep the device at the right angle to grip the hairs. Instead of pulling the hair from the root, it broke it at the skin and required many passes to even grab it at all. As the user manual indicates, it&#x27;s best to use one of the two &amp;#34;heads&amp;#34; for the face - but one head has few tweezers that are spread apart, so it was not effective - even though perhaps combined there are 72. I didn&#x27;t bother using it on my legs, given that the hair simply broke on my face and armpits. I&#x27;ll be returning this product.</li>
            <li> Facial hair must have grown enough for the product to detect it.  I have had to reach for the tweezers to remove hairs that the Emjoi glided over.</li>
            <li> I love it......  got rid of hair where ever I wanted it gone. Once you&lt;br /&gt;get used to the tweezer pulling of the hair..... everything else is great.&lt;br /&gt;The hair on the back of the neck.... gone.  The peach fuzz on the face,&lt;br /&gt;gone.  Hair on the arms.... gone.  Hair on the legs... gone. Bikini line&lt;br /&gt;hair..... gone. Where has this thing been all my life. It&#x27;s been over a&lt;br /&gt;week and I&#x27;m waiting for some hair to grow back in so I can do it&lt;br /&gt;again. Sideburn hair..... gone.</li>
            <li> I am a seasoned epilator... But even I had areas that I felt were too painful to go over with my old epilator.  No complaints where I could use it. My old one finally died after years of faithful service, and I am happy to announce that I LOVE THIS NEW EPILATOR!!!  I can even use it on my MOST sensitive and private of areas. Yes it hurts, but at least it&#x27;s bearable now :). I only hope this one lasts as long as my old one did. But even if I have to buy a new one every year, it would still be worth it.</li>
            <li> This does exactly what is says it will do!  It is a bit uncomfortable at first, but certainly worth it.</li>
            <li> awesome. I&#x27;ll never have to shave again!</li>
