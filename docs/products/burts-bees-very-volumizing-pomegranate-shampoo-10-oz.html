    <ol>
            <li>I can&#x27;t condition every day, but it&#x27;s perfect to use on the days I do condition.</li>
            <li>and I think shampoo, but since I switched to Burt&#x27;s Bees, I have had awesome hair and no dandruff!</li>
            <li>this is one of the best products i&#x27;ve ever used for adding volume to my hair.  </li>
            <li>Smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product and will be buying it again.</li>
            <li>have been so impressed with this product.</li>
            <li>Great shampoo!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s actually a very nice result!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s also very good.</li>
            <li>I think the shampoo is incredible....</li>
            <li>It does a great job cleaning, just without all the bubbles.  </li>
            <li>I bumped into this at the drug store and it smelled great</li>
            <li>It washed out wonderfully, felt really clean, lathered wonderfully, AND put a ton of life into my otherwise stringy, bodiless hair.  </li>
            <li>The smell is very nice.</li>
            <li>I need good cleaning shampoo mind you...</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>Which is good.</li>
            <li>The first shampoo was great but then for a while I wasn&#x27;t too impressed but don&#x27;t lose faith!  </li>
            <li>It does not smell as good as the grapefruit one, but it is still nice smelling.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stop touching it!</li>
            <li>I now love the shampoo!</li>
            <li>i LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li>I did not find the smell to be anything more than pleasant.</li>
            <li>hair looks amazing.</li>
            <li>The smell is reallllly nice.</li>
            <li>i think this cleans hair well, but that&#x27;s about all that i liked about it</li>
            <li>I have been using this shampoo as a hand soap, and it does smell nice, but do not like it for a shampoo.</li>
            <li>I had used Burt&#x27;s Bees Grapefruit Shampoo before and liked it a lot, so decided to try this one too.</li>
            <li>It smelled really nice</li>
            <li>its like washing my hair with Crisco or some kind of lard.  </li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t notice a change in my hair until my oblivious boyfriend (who would never notice something like this) commented on how shiny my hair was</li>
            <li>Worth the $$!!!</li>
            <li>Even the fragrance is pleasant and best yet the natural ingredients are better for your body.</li>
            <li>Got my hair super clean, felt wonderful.</li>
            <li>It has a really nice scent and lathers well, but I prefer the Aubrey Camomile Luxurious Volumizing shampoo, as it gives my hair more body and bounce.  </li>
            <li>The old version of this shampoo was awesome.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and was looking for a shampoo to give my hair some volume.</li>
            <li>Not as great as I thought, smells great, nt enough lather, and you need quite a handfull to lather.</li>
            <li>, fortunately is good for your hair, offers good cleansing, and is non stripping.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about a quarter-way through both bottles of Shampoo and Conditioner and am still on the fence about buying more.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve had too many days where I couldn&#x27;t get all the conditioner out and had to deal with greasy-looking</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products, I&#x27;m on the fence about the shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
            <li>, so I had a bit of a hair cut, and switched over to this shampoo (and matching conditioner) from the Paul Mitchell product I had been using and was relatively  pleased with.  </li>
            <li>I love all things berry, and this Burt&#x27;s Bees shampoo is no exception.  </li>
            <li>I really love this shampoo because it improves your hairs health and bounce.</li>
            <li>Well, not only does this shampoo not irritate my skin, it is truly wonderful on my hair!  </li>
            <li>Gentle, fresh and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to change my review to five stars, with the caveat that you should give your hair some time to adjust (as in more than 3 or 4 washes...</li>
            <li>time did not make it any better.  </li>
            <li>you know what i like better?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not so sure it does :</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>I tried it twice more before giving up on it.</li>
            <li>The smell is great, and the non-chemical formula felt great on my sensitive scalp, but after the first use it just made my hair greasy.</li>
            <li>On the one hand, there are a couple of products that are great go-to options for me (for example the classic lip balm and the garden tomato toner), and then there are ones that seem like nobody even tested out before slapping a logo on them and putting them out on the shelves.</li>
            <li>The shampoo makes her hair nice and full.</li>
            <li>My husband, who has great hair, has developed dandruff.</li>
            <li>It smells good and works really well for volumizing.</li>
            <li>shampoo (with a pleasant smell) and Highly Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>shampoo (with a pleasant smell) and Highly Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JTG</li>
            <li>(The conditioner, however, was pretty nice.</li>
            <li>EXCELLENT lather (as compared to other sulfate free brands I&#x27;ve tried)&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shampoo does help the volume of someone with fine hair, like mine.  </li>
            <li>I can just run my fingers through and notice how strong and smooth it&#x27;s become.</li>
            <li>very natural and GOOD.</li>
            <li>This shampoo, which we found at our local grocery store, has a great fruity pomegranate fragrance that is not too strong and doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling like an overturned produce barrow.</li>
            <li>The shampoo does not make huge lather.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Vaseline type petroleum is dirt cheap to sell</li>
            <li>/&gt;To re-iterate what others say about this product--because it is sulfate free and does not foam up like one is used to don&#x27;t get fooled into thinking it&#x27;s not working.  </li>
            <li>I was really happy with the results and while I still feel irritation here and there from my scalp acting up, it&#x27;s not flaking at all!  </li>
            <li>(well, not so much anymore)these products give my hair thickness, depth &amp; a nice shine.  </li>
            <li>I bought this shampoo in an effort to go sulfate free.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still a good shampoo, but please, Burt&#x27;s Bees, go back to the original formula!</li>
            <li>Really, I settle for clean, nice smelling, and &#x27;please don&#x27;t make it flatter&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>The result is great, healthy hair that isn&#x27;t stripped down by chemicals.  </li>
            <li>(First, I&#x27;ll note that Burt&#x27;s Bees Moisturizing Raspberry and Brazil Nut is my favorite shampoo</li>
            <li>also, the smell is delightful in small doses but over time it seems to be too rich.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>but it is of very fine texture, an unusual combination.  </li>
            <li>and it too rinses out clean.</li>
            <li>I like that both products rinse clean</li>
            <li>Everything washes out clean.</li>
            <li>I heard this shampoo would not dry out my hair and was good for waves and curls.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll probably use the rest of the bottle since it smells great, but there&#x27;s no way I can use it every day (or even every other day) since my fine hair just gets greasy.</li>
            <li>every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company can proudly boast their products are always free of sulfates, parabens, phthalates, and petrochemicals.  </li>
            <li>and he was right!</li>
            <li>I thought my hair would shine more, did not do much but safer than shampoo with sls.</li>
            <li>I think my hair just needs sulfates because this really just sat on top of my hair</li>
            <li>Every time I get my haircut somewhere the stylist says \\&quot;you are lucky at your age</li>
            <li>(Tip: I&#x27;ve learned that adding a bit of tea tree oil to the shampoo when you use it can help solve this problem - and I rub some of the oil into my scalp at night to help as well which helps tremendously).</li>
            <li>The conditioner sealed the deal and made it easy to comb and very lustrous.</li>
            <li>I wash with this everyday and have experienced no buildup or dryness.</li>
            <li>smell nice, it actually ended up drying my hair out and leaving</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;ve definitely gotten a clean as good or better with different products with a much better total outcome.  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s interesting about this is that it washes out so well, and makes your hair feel so clean that you&#x27;d think there wouldn&#x27;t be anything left to make your hair fuller</li>
            <li>Yes, you read this right...</li>
            <li>I have super thick hair, and the conditioner is great for removing tangles in the shower.</li>
            <li>The only positive thing I can say is that it does smell nice.</li>
            <li>It has a more \\&quot;runny\\&quot; composition than other shampoo, but you don&#x27;t use any more than normal!</li>
            <li>As far as volume, I have fine hair and wasn&#x27;t blown away by the volume I got from the shampoo</li>
            <li>The first time I used the Shampoo/Conditioner set</li>
            <li>It is volumizing as advertised, making my hair fluff up nicely</li>
            <li>If the product were a bit thicker, or for that matter if more product was included for the same price, it would be a 4 star review.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t think to use that body wash on my hair, so why would I want to use the shampoo (granted only the top two ingredients</li>
            <li>I have tried so many shampoos in my teenage years</li>
            <li>I noticed the difference after my first shampoo...</li>
            <li>The only way I could keep my hair managable (shiny, strong, and most importantly tangle free w/out greasiness) was if I rotated between 3-4 different types of shampoos daily.</li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair, and I&#x27;ve been looking for a shampoo that leaves it clean and manageable.</li>
            <li>but it brushed through very easily with no complaint from her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Americans equate foaming with clean so those that foam less, even if they work better, don&#x27;t sell as well...</li>
            <li>I was surprised after the first try at 2 things that have stayed consistent throughout its use: 1) it doesn&#x27;t clean very well at all</li>
            <li>Using very little, it will work into a rich lather that rinses easily and leaves you hair squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li>It not only smells good enough to eat, it leaves hair soft, full, and shiny.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair a bit more managable -- and also a lot less full.  </li>
            <li>Because most large companies sell to other countries they had to buy more expensive, but more healthy ingredients.</li>
            <li>the world&#x27;s finest/flat hair when it gets any length to it, and I have pretty much given up on ever finding a product that delivers on the &#x27;volumizing&#x27; concept.  </li>
            <li>Body Works shower gel someone gave me ( and foams tremendously while washing) also has the sulfate-laureth-whatever ingredient as my old shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Meaning I didn&#x27;t work for any cosmetic companies specifically, but sold the ingredients to large manufacturers through a broker.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to ANYONE especially women with thinning or fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have very fine somewhat thin hair, and I really had high hopes for this product, especially after having read good reviews on this site and elsewhere.</li>
            <li>learned much about Burt&#x27;s Bees during this time because of their lip balm.</li>
            <li>Sulfate free shampoos will help not only retain moisture, but color as well because there is no stripping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>but since I switched to BB&#x27;s shampoo my hair is much silkier and</li>
            <li>my hair looks and feels much healthier.  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t notice too much of a difference.</li>
            <li>and I dont think it makes much difference.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very conflicted about Burt&#x27;s Bees line.</li>
            <li>She doesn&#x27;t really like the smell of pomegranate but</li>
            <li>Not too heavy, nice texture, smells</li>
            <li>Ive bought up as many bottles of the old version to just prolong the inevitable.  </li>
            <li>(which is remarkable when down brushing or even teasing at the back) ...</li>
            <li>well, after using that much of the shampoo and making sure my hair was clean, it actually *really does* add volume, or at least the appearance of thickness.</li>
            <li>I used the Burt&#x27;s Bees consistently for several months (then bought more on Amazon) and had another haircut to a similar length as when I started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i did give my hair time to get used to the product as some other users/reviewers had suggested in hopes that i&#x27;d get better results but</li>
            <li>and I dont feel like it got clean enough.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, I just tried it for myself and my long highlighted fine (but tons of it)</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even need to use an iron after blow drying to smooth the ends, which is unheard of as my hair, which i&#x27;ve spent thousands on from root to tip, was looking pretty beat in lieu of all of the proclaimed miracle products in my collection.</li>
            <li>I actually have tons of grey underneath this dark brown.\\&quot; and they say \\&quot;but your hair is in incredible shape and is really shiny.</li>
            <li>but the feel is not soft or clean, as if it&#x27;s coating my hair, so I really don&#x27;t like this shampoo as much as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li>I still suffer from &#x27;flat&#x27; hair--this isn&#x27;t magic after all, but my hair definitely holds what little volume it owns better and even at the same cut length the &#x27;volume&#x27; looks to be just a tad more than with the old product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far, it is better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Bottom line: if you have a big problem with getting volume for your very fine hair which is dry to normal, this may be the shampoo for you.  </li>
            <li>hair is still fine (am I the only one who wants more grey hair because they heard it&#x27;s thicker?), but the overall condition of my hair has definitely improved.  </li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this shampoo, but as far as volume</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair that sometimes wants to curl.</li>
            <li>My hair has been soft and shiny whether I wear it straight or curled.</li>
            <li>right after I rinse the shampoo out and prior to using the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I continued to use it since I didn&#x27;t want to waste my money and was surprised to see that with time and more usage my hair began to fell fuller and have a little bit more volume at the roots.</li>
            <li>Once I found Burt&#x27;s Bees new Pomegrante &amp; Soy I decided to give it try since that line has never had a volumizing shampoo before</li>
            <li>I wanted to try a different sulphate-free product as I&#x27;ve tried Organix and those are very gentle and detangling, but Burt&#x27;s Bees is maybe for another type of hair, maybe hair that&#x27;s not chemically processed.</li>
            <li>I was very interested in trying this product after reading about its various awards, and it felt like a definite treat when I bought it for myself as I do not usually spend this much money on shampoos.</li>
            <li>Plus, I have a very sensitive scalp that tends to feel greasy and waxy, and flakes as well and sometimes these chemical-laden products would irritate it.  </li>
            <li>, did you know almost every acne medication is the exact same thing if it&#x27;s over the counter?</li>
            <li>These are the exact same stripping agents used in FLOOR CLEANER.</li>
            <li>However, in the past two years I have seen more knowledge in the US on this</li>
            <li>The other ingredients only make it better...</li>
            <li>This shampoo has enough lather to give a hair a deep clean.</li>
            <li>It has more bounce because they only use natural things so my hair isn&#x27;t weighed down by chemicals.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sulfates completely strip your hair and cause breakage.</li>
            <li>Once I started going to Whole Foods or Central Market and buying my shampoos without it, I never stopped...</li>
            <li>However, my hair is starting to look really stringy and oily.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft as soon as I use it</li>
            <li>Only prob is u really have to WORK it in.</li>
            <li>My old shampoo made my head itch</li>
            <li>so I was very pleasantly surprised when I started using it.  </li>
            <li>However, once I condition, it feels soft and residue-free.</li>
            <li>Pleasantly  surprised.</li>
            <li>very voluminizing &amp; just bought my 2nd bottle.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have high expectations for this shampoo at all, but decided to give it a try, as many of the \\&quot;volumizing\\&quot; shampoos I had been using were irritating to my skin.  </li>
            <li>Vaseline, which we slather on our babies, cannot be sold in most other countries due to the petrol based products found to be carcinogenic.</li>
            <li>expensive for that much needed, and I have very fine hair.</li>
            <li>The cons of this shampoo are that I don&#x27;t love the smell of it, and also it doesn&#x27;t give a rich lather (at least not in hard water - in soft water, the lather is richer).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very fluid, not thick</li>
            <li>I love all Burt&#x27;s Bees products, but unfortunately this shampoo didn&#x27;t do much in the way of volumizing.</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant and from someone who suffers from migraines</li>
            <li>I am older and with mostly grey hair.  </li>
            <li>Because of the stripping properties, your hair dye, if you use it, will last a far shorter amount of time with shampoos containing sodium lauryl sulfate or sodium laureth sulfate.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about two weeks, and my hair is soft, shiny, and actually looks thicker.  </li>
            <li>I have very thin, fine baby hair which I&#x27;ve always loathed - I&#x27;ve tried numerous products to try to puff it up a little but many of them had chemicals that I couldn&#x27;t even pronounce.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 18 years old and fine, thin hair runs in the family.</li>
            <li>For all of you who say that lots of lather is good, your wrong!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Negative? Still hard for me to track this stuff down at many grocery stores.oos that measure up to my knowledge</li>
            <li>Still hard for me to track this stuff down at many grocery stores.</li>
            <li>i enjoy using natural products, but this simply is not a very good one.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair which is also color-treated.  </li>
            <li>i have thin, baby fine hair...</li>
            <li>I decided to try to finish the bottle to free up room in the shower, and needless to say, I was quite surprised when my hair seemed to grow accustomed to the product and started to feel stronger and look nicer.  </li>

            <li> I think the shampoo is incredible....</li>
            <li> It does a great job cleaning, just without all the bubbles.  </li>
            <li> I bumped into this at the drug store and it smelled great</li>
            <li> It washed out wonderfully, felt really clean, lathered wonderfully, AND put a ton of life into my otherwise stringy, bodiless hair.  </li>
            <li> The smell is very nice.</li>
            <li> I need good cleaning shampoo mind you...</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Which is good.</li>
            <li> The first shampoo was great but then for a while I wasn&#x27;t too impressed but don&#x27;t lose faith!  </li>
            <li> It does not smell as good as the grapefruit one, but it is still nice smelling.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stop touching it!</li>
            <li> I now love the shampoo!</li>
            <li> i LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li> I did not find the smell to be anything more than pleasant.</li>
            <li> hair looks amazing.</li>
            <li> The smell is reallllly nice.</li>
            <li> i think this cleans hair well, but that&#x27;s about all that i liked about it</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo as a hand soap, and it does smell nice, but do not like it for a shampoo.</li>
            <li> I had used Burt&#x27;s Bees Grapefruit Shampoo before and liked it a lot, so decided to try this one too.</li>
            <li> It smelled really nice</li>
            <li> its like washing my hair with Crisco or some kind of lard.  </li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t notice a change in my hair until my oblivious boyfriend (who would never notice something like this) commented on how shiny my hair was</li>
            <li> Worth the $$!!!</li>
            <li> Even the fragrance is pleasant and best yet the natural ingredients are better for your body.</li>
            <li> Got my hair super clean, felt wonderful.</li>
            <li> It has a really nice scent and lathers well, but I prefer the Aubrey Camomile Luxurious Volumizing shampoo, as it gives my hair more body and bounce.  </li>
            <li> The old version of this shampoo was awesome.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and was looking for a shampoo to give my hair some volume.</li>
            <li> Not as great as I thought, smells great, nt enough lather, and you need quite a handfull to lather.</li>
            <li> , fortunately is good for your hair, offers good cleansing, and is non stripping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about a quarter-way through both bottles of Shampoo and Conditioner and am still on the fence about buying more.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve had too many days where I couldn&#x27;t get all the conditioner out and had to deal with greasy-looking</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products, I&#x27;m on the fence about the shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
            <li> , so I had a bit of a hair cut, and switched over to this shampoo (and matching conditioner) from the Paul Mitchell product I had been using and was relatively  pleased with.  </li>
            <li> I love all things berry, and this Burt&#x27;s Bees shampoo is no exception.  </li>
            <li> I really love this shampoo because it improves your hairs health and bounce.</li>
            <li> Well, not only does this shampoo not irritate my skin, it is truly wonderful on my hair!  </li>
            <li> Gentle, fresh and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to change my review to five stars, with the caveat that you should give your hair some time to adjust (as in more than 3 or 4 washes...</li>
            <li> time did not make it any better.  </li>
            <li> you know what i like better?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so sure it does :</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> I tried it twice more before giving up on it.</li>
            <li> The smell is great, and the non-chemical formula felt great on my sensitive scalp, but after the first use it just made my hair greasy.</li>
            <li> On the one hand, there are a couple of products that are great go-to options for me (for example the classic lip balm and the garden tomato toner), and then there are ones that seem like nobody even tested out before slapping a logo on them and putting them out on the shelves.</li>
            <li> The shampoo makes her hair nice and full.</li>
            <li> My husband, who has great hair, has developed dandruff.</li>
            <li> It smells good and works really well for volumizing.</li>
            <li> shampoo (with a pleasant smell) and Highly Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> shampoo (with a pleasant smell) and Highly Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JTG</li>
            <li> (The conditioner, however, was pretty nice.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT lather (as compared to other sulfate free brands I&#x27;ve tried)&lt;br</li>
            <li> This shampoo does help the volume of someone with fine hair, like mine.  </li>
            <li> I can just run my fingers through and notice how strong and smooth it&#x27;s become.</li>
            <li> very natural and GOOD.</li>
            <li> This shampoo, which we found at our local grocery store, has a great fruity pomegranate fragrance that is not too strong and doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling like an overturned produce barrow.</li>
            <li> The shampoo does not make huge lather.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Vaseline type petroleum is dirt cheap to sell</li>
            <li> /&gt;To re-iterate what others say about this product--because it is sulfate free and does not foam up like one is used to don&#x27;t get fooled into thinking it&#x27;s not working.  </li>
            <li> I was really happy with the results and while I still feel irritation here and there from my scalp acting up, it&#x27;s not flaking at all!  </li>
            <li> (well, not so much anymore)these products give my hair thickness, depth &amp; a nice shine.  </li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo in an effort to go sulfate free.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still a good shampoo, but please, Burt&#x27;s Bees, go back to the original formula!</li>
            <li> Really, I settle for clean, nice smelling, and &#x27;please don&#x27;t make it flatter&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> The result is great, healthy hair that isn&#x27;t stripped down by chemicals.  </li>
            <li> (First, I&#x27;ll note that Burt&#x27;s Bees Moisturizing Raspberry and Brazil Nut is my favorite shampoo</li>
            <li> also, the smell is delightful in small doses but over time it seems to be too rich.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> but it is of very fine texture, an unusual combination.  </li>
            <li> and it too rinses out clean.</li>
            <li> I like that both products rinse clean</li>
            <li> Everything washes out clean.</li>
            <li> I heard this shampoo would not dry out my hair and was good for waves and curls.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably use the rest of the bottle since it smells great, but there&#x27;s no way I can use it every day (or even every other day) since my fine hair just gets greasy.</li>
            <li> every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company can proudly boast their products are always free of sulfates, parabens, phthalates, and petrochemicals.  </li>
            <li> and he was right!</li>
            <li> I thought my hair would shine more, did not do much but safer than shampoo with sls.</li>
            <li> I think my hair just needs sulfates because this really just sat on top of my hair</li>
            <li> Every time I get my haircut somewhere the stylist says \\&quot;you are lucky at your age</li>
            <li> (Tip: I&#x27;ve learned that adding a bit of tea tree oil to the shampoo when you use it can help solve this problem - and I rub some of the oil into my scalp at night to help as well which helps tremendously).</li>
            <li> The conditioner sealed the deal and made it easy to comb and very lustrous.</li>
            <li> I wash with this everyday and have experienced no buildup or dryness.</li>
            <li> smell nice, it actually ended up drying my hair out and leaving</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;ve definitely gotten a clean as good or better with different products with a much better total outcome.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s interesting about this is that it washes out so well, and makes your hair feel so clean that you&#x27;d think there wouldn&#x27;t be anything left to make your hair fuller</li>
            <li> Yes, you read this right...</li>
            <li> I have super thick hair, and the conditioner is great for removing tangles in the shower.</li>
            <li> The only positive thing I can say is that it does smell nice.</li>
            <li> It has a more \\&quot;runny\\&quot; composition than other shampoo, but you don&#x27;t use any more than normal!</li>
            <li> As far as volume, I have fine hair and wasn&#x27;t blown away by the volume I got from the shampoo</li>
            <li> The first time I used the Shampoo/Conditioner set</li>
            <li> It is volumizing as advertised, making my hair fluff up nicely</li>
            <li> If the product were a bit thicker, or for that matter if more product was included for the same price, it would be a 4 star review.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t think to use that body wash on my hair, so why would I want to use the shampoo (granted only the top two ingredients</li>
            <li> I have tried so many shampoos in my teenage years</li>
            <li> I noticed the difference after my first shampoo...</li>
            <li> The only way I could keep my hair managable (shiny, strong, and most importantly tangle free w/out greasiness) was if I rotated between 3-4 different types of shampoos daily.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair, and I&#x27;ve been looking for a shampoo that leaves it clean and manageable.</li>
            <li> but it brushed through very easily with no complaint from her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Americans equate foaming with clean so those that foam less, even if they work better, don&#x27;t sell as well...</li>
            <li> I was surprised after the first try at 2 things that have stayed consistent throughout its use: 1) it doesn&#x27;t clean very well at all</li>
            <li> Using very little, it will work into a rich lather that rinses easily and leaves you hair squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li> It not only smells good enough to eat, it leaves hair soft, full, and shiny.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair a bit more managable -- and also a lot less full.  </li>
            <li> Because most large companies sell to other countries they had to buy more expensive, but more healthy ingredients.</li>
            <li> the world&#x27;s finest/flat hair when it gets any length to it, and I have pretty much given up on ever finding a product that delivers on the &#x27;volumizing&#x27; concept.  </li>
            <li> Body Works shower gel someone gave me ( and foams tremendously while washing) also has the sulfate-laureth-whatever ingredient as my old shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Meaning I didn&#x27;t work for any cosmetic companies specifically, but sold the ingredients to large manufacturers through a broker.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to ANYONE especially women with thinning or fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have very fine somewhat thin hair, and I really had high hopes for this product, especially after having read good reviews on this site and elsewhere.</li>
            <li> learned much about Burt&#x27;s Bees during this time because of their lip balm.</li>
            <li> Sulfate free shampoos will help not only retain moisture, but color as well because there is no stripping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> but since I switched to BB&#x27;s shampoo my hair is much silkier and</li>
            <li> my hair looks and feels much healthier.  </li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice too much of a difference.</li>
            <li> and I dont think it makes much difference.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very conflicted about Burt&#x27;s Bees line.</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t really like the smell of pomegranate but</li>
            <li> Not too heavy, nice texture, smells</li>
            <li> Ive bought up as many bottles of the old version to just prolong the inevitable.  </li>
            <li> (which is remarkable when down brushing or even teasing at the back) ...</li>
            <li> well, after using that much of the shampoo and making sure my hair was clean, it actually *really does* add volume, or at least the appearance of thickness.</li>
            <li> I used the Burt&#x27;s Bees consistently for several months (then bought more on Amazon) and had another haircut to a similar length as when I started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i did give my hair time to get used to the product as some other users/reviewers had suggested in hopes that i&#x27;d get better results but</li>
            <li> and I dont feel like it got clean enough.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, I just tried it for myself and my long highlighted fine (but tons of it)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even need to use an iron after blow drying to smooth the ends, which is unheard of as my hair, which i&#x27;ve spent thousands on from root to tip, was looking pretty beat in lieu of all of the proclaimed miracle products in my collection.</li>
            <li> I actually have tons of grey underneath this dark brown.\\&quot; and they say \\&quot;but your hair is in incredible shape and is really shiny.</li>
            <li> but the feel is not soft or clean, as if it&#x27;s coating my hair, so I really don&#x27;t like this shampoo as much as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> I still suffer from &#x27;flat&#x27; hair--this isn&#x27;t magic after all, but my hair definitely holds what little volume it owns better and even at the same cut length the &#x27;volume&#x27; looks to be just a tad more than with the old product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far, it is better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Bottom line: if you have a big problem with getting volume for your very fine hair which is dry to normal, this may be the shampoo for you.  </li>
            <li> hair is still fine (am I the only one who wants more grey hair because they heard it&#x27;s thicker?), but the overall condition of my hair has definitely improved.  </li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this shampoo, but as far as volume</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair that sometimes wants to curl.</li>
            <li> My hair has been soft and shiny whether I wear it straight or curled.</li>
            <li> right after I rinse the shampoo out and prior to using the conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I continued to use it since I didn&#x27;t want to waste my money and was surprised to see that with time and more usage my hair began to fell fuller and have a little bit more volume at the roots.</li>
            <li> Once I found Burt&#x27;s Bees new Pomegrante &amp; Soy I decided to give it try since that line has never had a volumizing shampoo before</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a different sulphate-free product as I&#x27;ve tried Organix and those are very gentle and detangling, but Burt&#x27;s Bees is maybe for another type of hair, maybe hair that&#x27;s not chemically processed.</li>
            <li> I was very interested in trying this product after reading about its various awards, and it felt like a definite treat when I bought it for myself as I do not usually spend this much money on shampoos.</li>
            <li> Plus, I have a very sensitive scalp that tends to feel greasy and waxy, and flakes as well and sometimes these chemical-laden products would irritate it.  </li>
            <li> , did you know almost every acne medication is the exact same thing if it&#x27;s over the counter?</li>
            <li> These are the exact same stripping agents used in FLOOR CLEANER.</li>
            <li> However, in the past two years I have seen more knowledge in the US on this</li>
            <li> The other ingredients only make it better...</li>
            <li> This shampoo has enough lather to give a hair a deep clean.</li>
            <li> It has more bounce because they only use natural things so my hair isn&#x27;t weighed down by chemicals.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sulfates completely strip your hair and cause breakage.</li>
            <li> Once I started going to Whole Foods or Central Market and buying my shampoos without it, I never stopped...</li>
            <li> However, my hair is starting to look really stringy and oily.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft as soon as I use it</li>
            <li> Only prob is u really have to WORK it in.</li>
            <li> My old shampoo made my head itch</li>
            <li> so I was very pleasantly surprised when I started using it.  </li>
            <li> However, once I condition, it feels soft and residue-free.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly  surprised.</li>
            <li> very voluminizing &amp; just bought my 2nd bottle.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have high expectations for this shampoo at all, but decided to give it a try, as many of the \\&quot;volumizing\\&quot; shampoos I had been using were irritating to my skin.  </li>
            <li> Vaseline, which we slather on our babies, cannot be sold in most other countries due to the petrol based products found to be carcinogenic.</li>
            <li> expensive for that much needed, and I have very fine hair.</li>
            <li> The cons of this shampoo are that I don&#x27;t love the smell of it, and also it doesn&#x27;t give a rich lather (at least not in hard water - in soft water, the lather is richer).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s very fluid, not thick</li>
            <li> I love all Burt&#x27;s Bees products, but unfortunately this shampoo didn&#x27;t do much in the way of volumizing.</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant and from someone who suffers from migraines</li>
            <li> I am older and with mostly grey hair.  </li>
            <li> Because of the stripping properties, your hair dye, if you use it, will last a far shorter amount of time with shampoos containing sodium lauryl sulfate or sodium laureth sulfate.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about two weeks, and my hair is soft, shiny, and actually looks thicker.  </li>
            <li> I have very thin, fine baby hair which I&#x27;ve always loathed - I&#x27;ve tried numerous products to try to puff it up a little but many of them had chemicals that I couldn&#x27;t even pronounce.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 18 years old and fine, thin hair runs in the family.</li>
            <li> For all of you who say that lots of lather is good, your wrong!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Negative? Still hard for me to track this stuff down at many grocery stores.oos that measure up to my knowledge</li>
            <li> Still hard for me to track this stuff down at many grocery stores.</li>
            <li> i enjoy using natural products, but this simply is not a very good one.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair which is also color-treated.  </li>
            <li> i have thin, baby fine hair...</li>
            <li> I decided to try to finish the bottle to free up room in the shower, and needless to say, I was quite surprised when my hair seemed to grow accustomed to the product and started to feel stronger and look nicer.  </li>
            <li> since it&#x27;s all natural, it&#x27;s got a different type of lather than other shampoos.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> The new bottle, by the way, is to prevent you from seeing the goop inside that wont rinse down the sink.  </li>
            <li> At first it feels a little different than what you&#x27;re probably used to, due to the lack of sulfates.  </li>
            <li> This product seemed to fix almost all my flat hair/scalp problems</li>
            <li> My hair is completely flat by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo overdries my relaxed hair dry and coarse</li>
            <li> It is now moderate to dry in its oil production.  </li>
            <li> If you have thick relaxed African American hair, or you&#x27;re a natural with low porosity</li>
            <li> The hunt for a sulfate free shampoo that works continues (sadly).</li>
            <li> Because of this, I learned a wealth of information that I&#x27;ve taken with me though that career has long since</li>
            <li> Petrol cosmetic products are expected to be removed in the US in the upcoming years as they are currently being re-tested by the FDA.</li>
            <li> But this shampoo leaves my long, normal-to-dry hair rather sticky.</li>
            <li> I was unable to sell petroleum based ingredients to large manufacturers because petrol ingredients (yes, such as vaseline) are illegal in many countries as they&#x27;ve been found to be a carcinogen.</li>
            <li> I live in the Northeast, where winters make for horrible hair days (especially the dry static problem), but my hair hasn&#x27;t been flyaway or staticky since I started using this shampoo, even after wearing a fleece hat!  </li>
            <li> (Expect the lather to also be different from what you&#x27;re used to, due to the lack of chemical foaming agents.)  </li>
            <li> A nickle sized amount emulsified in your hand washed her long hair!</li>
            <li> I proved this theory with myself when I used a different brand one day and back to Burt&#x27;s the next, my hair was flat, lifeless and dull again.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shampoo to anyone, especially those facing dry, cold winters with thin, fine hair!</li>
            <li> Another plus would be that it seems to last a very long time, I&#x27;ve been using it exclusively for a few weeks now and have only made it through a quarter of each bottle.</li>
            <li> Do you not blow dry it or use a curling iron?\\&quot;</li>

            <li> (it&#x27;s been over a month now) and by the end of the day my hair might get a little flat and but not enough to dissapoint me any.</li>
            <li> this shampoo left my hair feeling a little dry and unmanageable and certainly not soft.  </li>
            <li> Shampoo has a very thin consistency and it rinses out clean.</li>
            <li> This new stuff sucks.</li>

            <li> It only takes a little.</li>

            <li> you&#x27;re used to not having to use that much shampoo expect to use about 6 tbsp of this to get the job done (I have medium length hair, a bit below the shoulders); the consistency of the product is surprisingly thin.</li>

            <li> I doubt it does much for thin hair, however.  </li>

            <li> It left my hair feeling heavy and after a few hours looked unwashed and greasy.</li>
            <li> sulfate-free shampoos actually make my scalp itch, but this one doesn&#x27;t do that to me, or at least, it is less itchy than with other sulfate-free shampoos I have tried.</li>
            <li> I gave this product a rating of three, because it weighs my hair down.  </li>
            <li> My hair was flat and dull.</li>
            <li> Therefore, I am changing my previous 5 star review to 3.5 stars.  </li>

            <li> and seeing little to no results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, I tried it on my little one at bed time.  </li>
            <li> Hands down, this product is a 5 star!</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t like the way the shampoo makes my hair feel while washing or that it takes quite a few washes to start to see results.</li>
            <li> Being left with thin hair after my pregnancy, I decided to give yet another volumizing shampoo a try.</li>

            <li> These are very heavy on buried treasures and hidden gems.</li>
            <li> give it three stars--it may work well for you, but for me it is not a pleasant product due to the stickiness</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Not as great as I thought, smells great, nt enough lather, and you need quite a handfull to lather. expensive for that much needed, and I have very fine hair. so if you have course hair . not a good idea</li>
            <li> (First, I&#x27;ll note that Burt&#x27;s Bees Moisturizing Raspberry and Brazil Nut is my favorite shampoo but I buy this one when I can&#x27;t get my hands on the other...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years ago I was a sales rep for a cosmetic ingredient company. Meaning I didn&#x27;t work for any cosmetic companies specifically, but sold the ingredients to large manufacturers through a broker. Because of this, I learned a wealth of information that I&#x27;ve taken with me though that career has long since past&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(for example, did you know almost every acne medication is the exact same thing if it&#x27;s over the counter? Even the expensive proactive ones. You can only put 2% salicylic acid in it per law over the counter. They are all this with other inert ingredients or 10% benzoyl peroxide and inert ingredients. Just buy the cheapest and read the labels. Proactive, for example, has the same active ingredients as the two buck grocery store acne meds...but I digress.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I learned much about Burt&#x27;s Bees during this time because of their lip balm. I was unable to sell petroleum based ingredients to large manufacturers because petrol ingredients (yes, such as vaseline) are illegal in many countries as they&#x27;ve been found to be a carcinogen. Because most large companies sell to other countries they had to buy more expensive, but more healthy ingredients. Vaseline type petroleum is dirt cheap to sell so it&#x27;s still used and fought for widely in the US...to make a buck. Petrol cosmetic products are expected to be removed in the US in the upcoming years as they are currently being re-tested by the FDA. Unfortunately, this is a fight and takes many years. Yes, you read this right...Vaseline, which we slather on our babies, cannot be sold in most other countries due to the petrol based products found to be carcinogenic. Because of this, even though I don&#x27;t use lip balm, I tell my friends who do not to use chapstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for shampoos, what I learned from the cosmetic scientists and companies changed how I buy them forever. Did you know we are the ONLY country who buys shampoos with Sodium Laryl Sulfate or Sodium Laureth Sulfate in them in such mass quantities? These are the exact same stripping agents used in FLOOR CLEANER. But it&#x27;s for marketing. Americans equate foaming with clean so those that foam less, even if they work better, don&#x27;t sell as well...so the majority of companies add them in because they are big foamers. But they are HORRID for your hair. However, in the past two years I have seen more knowledge in the US on this and finally I&#x27;m beginning to see \\&quot;sulfate free!\\&quot; on some bottles and on commercials. People are finding out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sulfates completely strip your hair and cause breakage. Once I started going to Whole Foods or Central Market and buying my shampoos without it, I never stopped...even though it&#x27;s been years since I learned this. Every time I get my haircut somewhere the stylist says \\&quot;you are lucky at your age you don&#x27;t have to dye your hair\\&quot; or something to that effect. I always say \\&quot;but I do dye my hair. I actually have tons of grey underneath this dark brown.\\&quot; and they say \\&quot;but your hair is in incredible shape and is really shiny. Do you not blow dry it or use a curling iron?\\&quot; and I tell em I do that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference is I don&#x27;t strip out all the moisture with my shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if I travel and use a shampoo with sulfates I will see my dye run out of my hair that the sulfate-free shampoos kept in. Because of the stripping properties, your hair dye, if you use it, will last a far shorter amount of time with shampoos containing sodium lauryl sulfate or sodium laureth sulfate. Sulfate free shampoos will help not only retain moisture, but color as well because there is no stripping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I need good cleaning shampoo mind you...I work out hard 6 days a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This, fortunately is good for your hair, offers good cleansing, and is non stripping. The other ingredients only make it better...very natural and GOOD. My hair gleams. I&#x27;ve found a handful of shampoos that measure up to my knowledge and this does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negative? Still hard for me to track this stuff down at many grocery stores.oos that measure up to my knowledge and this does.      Negative? Still hard for me to track this stuff down at many grocery stores.</li>
            <li> This shampoo overdries my relaxed hair dry and coarse the minute it touches it, and so tangled it&#x27;s unbelievable. This is the 1st time ever a shampoo does this to me. I wanted to try a different sulphate-free product as I&#x27;ve tried Organix and those are very gentle and detangling, but Burt&#x27;s Bees is maybe for another type of hair, maybe hair that&#x27;s not chemically processed.</li>
            <li> My husband and I started using this shampoo (and conditioner) two weeks ago. I did not find the smell to be anything more than pleasant. However, my hair is starting to look really stringy and oily. My husband, who has great hair, has developed dandruff. When I saw those flakes I started looking for something else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about a quarter-way through both bottles of Shampoo and Conditioner and am still on the fence about buying more. The first time I used the Shampoo/Conditioner set I was very disappointed. My hair was flat and dull. I continued to use it since I didn&#x27;t want to waste my money and was surprised to see that with time and more usage my hair began to fell fuller and have a little bit more volume at the roots. I proved this theory with myself when I used a different brand one day and back to Burt&#x27;s the next, my hair was flat, lifeless and dull again. I am now sticking with Burt&#x27;s and the volume is starting to come back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shampoo has a very thin consistency and it rinses out clean. What I don&#x27;t like about it is that it makes my hair feel like straw while washing it. I can&#x27;t run my fingers through my hair while using the shampoo! I also advise to use the matching conditioner since it compliments the shampoo. It makes my hair soft as soon as I use it and it too rinses out clean. I usually use Aveda brand Volumizing but I&#x27;ve had too many days where I couldn&#x27;t get all the conditioner out and had to deal with greasy-looking hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products, I&#x27;m on the fence about the shampoo &amp; conditioner. I like that both products rinse clean but I don&#x27;t like the way the shampoo makes my hair feel while washing or that it takes quite a few washes to start to see results. Another plus would be that it seems to last a very long time, I&#x27;ve been using it exclusively for a few weeks now and have only made it through a quarter of each bottle.</li>
            <li> This shampoo, which we found at our local grocery store, has a great fruity pomegranate fragrance that is not too strong and doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling like an overturned produce barrow. That&#x27;s good. And it&#x27;s sulfate-free, meaning it doesn&#x27;t use Sodium Lauryl or Laureth Sulfate detergent to cleanse your hair. Sulfate detergents are supposed to be harmful to you and the environment. (Mutagen of bacteria, for example, so supposed to be potentially carcinogenic, by extrapolation.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most sulfate-free shampoos actually make my scalp itch, but this one doesn&#x27;t do that to me, or at least, it is less itchy than with other sulfate-free shampoos I have tried. Which is good. But this shampoo leaves my long, normal-to-dry hair rather sticky. It is volumizing as advertised, making my hair fluff up nicely but the feel is not soft or clean, as if it&#x27;s coating my hair, so I really don&#x27;t like this shampoo as much as I&#x27;d hoped. The shampoo does not make huge lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it three stars--it may work well for you, but for me it is not a pleasant product due to the stickiness and I won&#x27;t be repurchasing it.</li>
            <li> I was very interested in trying this product after reading about its various awards, and it felt like a definite treat when I bought it for myself as I do not usually spend this much money on shampoos. Being left with thin hair after my pregnancy, I decided to give yet another volumizing shampoo a try. The smell is pleasant and from someone who suffers from migraines it&#x27;s not overwhelming. I was surprised after the first try at 2 things that have stayed consistent throughout its use: 1) it doesn&#x27;t clean very well at all *if* you&#x27;re used to not having to use that much shampoo expect to use about 6 tbsp of this to get the job done (I have medium length hair, a bit below the shoulders); the consistency of the product is surprisingly thin. 2) well, after using that much of the shampoo and making sure my hair was clean, it actually *really does* add volume, or at least the appearance of thickness. When used in conjunction with the Sonia Kashuk \\&quot;mason pearson look-alike\\&quot; [[ASIN:B000P4CAEK Kashuk Tools® Bristle Hair Brush]] (which is remarkable when down brushing or even teasing at the back) ... it&#x27;s actually a very nice result! If the product were a bit thicker, or for that matter if more product was included for the same price, it would be a 4 star review. But for the greasiness factor, I give it 3-stars.</li>
            <li> I have been burned by organic products before but this was everything I heared it would be. Got my hair super clean, felt wonderful. Only prob is u really have to WORK it in. It only takes a little. Worth the $$!!!</li>
            <li> I got this at Wal-Mart of all places! I really like it. The smell is reallllly nice. I also use the Burt&#x27;s Bees grapefruit shampoo and it&#x27;s also very good. As far as volume, I have fine hair and wasn&#x27;t blown away by the volume I got from the shampoo but since I switched to BB&#x27;s shampoo my hair is much silkier and I can&#x27;t stop touching it! It has more bounce because they only use natural things so my hair isn&#x27;t weighed down by chemicals. My old shampoo made my head itch but the itch is minimal now (dry skin). I had no problems with lathering at all!</li>
            <li> I was in search of a non-sulfate containing shampoo and decided to give Burt&#x27;s Bees a try after a recommendation.  I have (just about) the world&#x27;s finest/flat hair when it gets any length to it, and I have pretty much given up on ever finding a product that delivers on the &#x27;volumizing&#x27; concept.  Really, I settle for clean, nice smelling, and &#x27;please don&#x27;t make it flatter&#x27;.  I was hoping for an improvement by going sulfate free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to be &#x27;organized&#x27; about this, so I had a bit of a hair cut, and switched over to this shampoo (and matching conditioner) from the Paul Mitchell product I had been using and was relatively  pleased with.  I used the Burt&#x27;s Bees consistently for several months (then bought more on Amazon) and had another haircut to a similar length as when I started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair is still fine (am I the only one who wants more grey hair because they heard it&#x27;s thicker?), but the overall condition of my hair has definitely improved.  Even though I&#x27;m going through the &#x27;dry&#x27; moths my hair looks and feels much healthier.  I still suffer from &#x27;flat&#x27; hair--this isn&#x27;t magic after all, but my hair definitely holds what little volume it owns better and even at the same cut length the &#x27;volume&#x27; looks to be just a tad more than with the old product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To re-iterate what others say about this product--because it is sulfate free and does not foam up like one is used to don&#x27;t get fooled into thinking it&#x27;s not working.  It does a great job cleaning, just without all the bubbles.  I noticed the bottle of Bath and Body Works shower gel someone gave me ( and foams tremendously while washing) also has the sulfate-laureth-whatever ingredient as my old shampoo.  I wouldn&#x27;t think to use that body wash on my hair, so why would I want to use the shampoo (granted only the top two ingredients were identical--the water and the sulfate--but, ugh)?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, read the directions and don&#x27;t worry that lack of foam equates to lack of cleaning, or product quality/concentration or anything other than that it&#x27;s a reflection of being made without the harmful sulfates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great shampoo (with a pleasant smell) and Highly Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JTGt quality/concentration or anything other than that it&#x27;s a reflection of being made without the harmful sulfates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great shampoo (with a pleasant smell) and Highly Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JTG</li>
            <li> I have very thin, fine baby hair which I&#x27;ve always loathed - I&#x27;ve tried numerous products to try to puff it up a little but many of them had chemicals that I couldn&#x27;t even pronounce.  Plus, I have a very sensitive scalp that tends to feel greasy and waxy, and flakes as well and sometimes these chemical-laden products would irritate it.  Not so with Burt&#x27;s Bees!  This product seemed to fix almost all my flat hair/scalp problems so I was very pleasantly surprised when I started using it.  What&#x27;s interesting about this is that it washes out so well, and makes your hair feel so clean that you&#x27;d think there wouldn&#x27;t be anything left to make your hair fuller - I thought it would go back to being feather thin again but no!  It washed out wonderfully, felt really clean, lathered wonderfully, AND put a ton of life into my otherwise stringy, bodiless hair.  I was really happy with the results and while I still feel irritation here and there from my scalp acting up, it&#x27;s not flaking at all!  (Tip: I&#x27;ve learned that adding a bit of tea tree oil to the shampoo when you use it can help solve this problem - and I rub some of the oil into my scalp at night to help as well which helps tremendously). No more Head and Shoulders or harsh chemicals for this lady!</li>
            <li> I love all things berry, and this Burt&#x27;s Bees shampoo is no exception.  It not only smells good enough to eat, it leaves hair soft, full, and shiny.  I saw immediate results after only one wash.  At first it feels a little different than what you&#x27;re probably used to, due to the lack of sulfates.  I might even call it waxy.  Give yourself and your hair a couple of days to adjust to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very fluid, not thick, so cup your hand well when pouring it out.  Using very little, it will work into a rich lather that rinses easily and leaves you hair squeaky clean.  (Expect the lather to also be different from what you&#x27;re used to, due to the lack of chemical foaming agents.)  I noticed after a few washes I no longer needed to wash my hair every day.  I wet my hair down in the shower every morning so I can restyle it, but only use the shampoo every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company can proudly boast their products are always free of sulfates, parabens, phthalates, and petrochemicals.  The result is great, healthy hair that isn&#x27;t stripped down by chemicals.  Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 12/17/2012: Burt&#x27;s Bees has totally revamped its formula.  It leaves my hair a bit more managable -- and also a lot less full.  My hair is completely flat by the end of the day.  No more washing my hair every other day, either.  It needs to be washed every day, and even so, it is often totally greasy when I get up the next morning.  Even the formerly yummy fragrance has been altered.  Ultimately, I am disappointed and miss the old formula.  Therefore, I am changing my previous 5 star review to 3.5 stars.  It&#x27;s still a good shampoo, but please, Burt&#x27;s Bees, go back to the original formula!</li>
            <li> I thought my hair would shine more, did not do much but safer than shampoo with sls.</li>
            <li> Yes the title says it all! Burt&#x27;s Bees has no sulfates. For all of you who say that lots of lather is good, your wrong! Sulafates are what make lather, and sulfates destroy hair. This shampoo has enough lather to give a hair a deep clean. I really love this shampoo because it improves your hairs health and bounce.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair which is also color-treated.  I didn&#x27;t have high expectations for this shampoo at all, but decided to give it a try, as many of the \\&quot;volumizing\\&quot; shampoos I had been using were irritating to my skin.  Well, not only does this shampoo not irritate my skin, it is truly wonderful on my hair!  I have been using it for about two weeks, and my hair is soft, shiny, and actually looks thicker.  I live in the Northeast, where winters make for horrible hair days (especially the dry static problem), but my hair hasn&#x27;t been flyaway or staticky since I started using this shampoo, even after wearing a fleece hat!  The cons of this shampoo are that I don&#x27;t love the smell of it, and also it doesn&#x27;t give a rich lather (at least not in hard water - in soft water, the lather is richer).  Also, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using the shampoo without also using the conditioner, because my hair feels terrible (like stripped of moisture) right after I rinse the shampoo out and prior to using the conditioner.  However, once I condition, it feels soft and residue-free. I highly recommend this shampoo to anyone, especially those facing dry, cold winters with thin, fine hair!</li>
            <li> Gentle, fresh and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> I have very fine somewhat thin hair, and I really had high hopes for this product, especially after having read good reviews on this site and elsewhere. I love all Burt&#x27;s Bees products, but unfortunately this shampoo didn&#x27;t do much in the way of volumizing. The smell is great, and the non-chemical formula felt great on my sensitive scalp, but after the first use it just made my hair greasy. (This could be because it is somewhat difficult to tell if you&#x27;ve gotten all of the shampoo out before you dry your hair...since it&#x27;s all natural, it&#x27;s got a different type of lather than other shampoos.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably use the rest of the bottle since it smells great, but there&#x27;s no way I can use it every day (or even every other day) since my fine hair just gets greasy. I won&#x27;t buy it again. (The conditioner, however, was pretty nice. I can&#x27;t condition every day, but it&#x27;s perfect to use on the days I do condition. Not too heavy, nice texture, smells great.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:  When I wrote this review, I gave the product three stars...I decided to try to finish the bottle to free up room in the shower, and needless to say, I was quite surprised when my hair seemed to grow accustomed to the product and started to feel stronger and look nicer.  I&#x27;d like to change my review to five stars, with the caveat that you should give your hair some time to adjust (as in more than 3 or 4 washes...at least, if you have hair like me).  I now love the shampoo!</li>
            <li> definitely not very volumizing.  i think this cleans hair well, but that&#x27;s about all that i liked about it and i&#x27;ve definitely gotten a clean as good or better with different products with a much better total outcome.  this shampoo left my hair feeling a little dry and unmanageable and certainly not soft.  i did give my hair time to get used to the product as some other users/reviewers had suggested in hopes that i&#x27;d get better results but time did not make it any better.  i enjoy using natural products, but this simply is not a very good one.  also, the smell is delightful in small doses but over time it seems to be too rich.  you know what i like better?  yes to carrots products.  highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have problems with dandruff sometimes because of city water and I think shampoo, but since I switched to Burt&#x27;s Bees, I have had awesome hair and no dandruff! It smells good and works really well for volumizing. I personally like the \\&quot;no sulfur\\&quot; portion, because I have switched shampoo, facewash, and toothpaste to rid my daily routine of sodium lauryl sulfate or any derivative of it. It has a more \\&quot;runny\\&quot; composition than other shampoo, but you don&#x27;t use any more than normal!</li>
            <li> I gave this product a rating of three, because it weighs my hair down.  It has a really nice scent and lathers well, but I prefer the Aubrey Camomile Luxurious Volumizing shampoo, as it gives my hair more body and bounce.  I have been using this shampoo as a hand soap, and it does smell nice, but do not like it for a shampoo.</li>
            <li> this is one of the best products i&#x27;ve ever used for adding volume to my hair.  i have thin, baby fine hair...(well, not so much anymore)these products give my hair thickness, depth &amp; a nice shine.  i LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT lather (as compared to other sulfate free brands I&#x27;ve tried)&lt;br /&gt;Delicioius smell,... Does it volumize? The verdict&#x27;s still out.... I&#x27;m not so sure it does :(&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: This shampoo did not volumize my hair, and while it did lather&lt;br /&gt;up and smell nice, it actually ended up drying my hair out and leaving&lt;br /&gt;a &#x27;soapy&#x27; feeling.</li>
            <li> I am older and with mostly grey hair.  It is now moderate to dry in its oil production.  I have thick hair but it is of very fine texture, an unusual combination.  This shampoo does help the volume of someone with fine hair, like mine.  I doubt it does much for thin hair, however.  My mother-in-law has thin hair from Rxs she takes and this shampoo does nothing to alter that.  It also probably should not be used by anyone with oily hair as volume can only be increased if oil is retained. The smell is very nice. Personally, if I am going to pay these big bucks for shampoos though, I prefer either the Aubrey Organics or the Avalon Organic shampoos, also reviewed by me here at Amazon. Bottom line: if you have a big problem with getting volume for your very fine hair which is dry to normal, this may be the shampoo for you.  No others need apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

            <li> I really like the smell of this shampoo, but as far as volume I really didn&#x27;t notice too much of a difference.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful. It is volumizing. Pleasantly  surprised.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair that sometimes wants to curl. I heard this shampoo would not dry out my hair and was good for waves and curls. I had used Burt&#x27;s Bees Grapefruit Shampoo before and liked it a lot, so decided to try this one too. So far, it is better than I expected. It does not smell as good as the grapefruit one, but it is still nice smelling. My hair has been soft and shiny whether I wear it straight or curled. I have super thick hair, and the conditioner is great for removing tangles in the shower. I wash with this everyday and have experienced no buildup or dryness. It also cleans well. The products I use change from day to day depending on how I wear my hair. I sometimes use a holding moose and other times use coconut oil and gel for up-dos. Everything washes out clean. I am very happy with this product and will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> This was crap. It smelled really nice but that&#x27;s about it. Maybe it just didn&#x27;t work for my hair type. If you have thick relaxed African American hair, or you&#x27;re a natural with low porosity I would not recommend it at all. I think my hair just needs sulfates because this really just sat on top of my hair and I dont feel like it got clean enough.</li>
            <li> The old version of this shampoo was awesome.  It was, in fact, the only shampoo I could use without my hair falling out and scalp burning which sulphates in regular washes would do.  Well now they messed up this shampoo literally.  I have hair that reaches my rear and its like washing my hair with Crisco or some kind of lard.  It&#x27;s nasty.  I&#x27;ve complained to Burts Bees and I dont think it makes much difference.  The new bottle, by the way, is to prevent you from seeing the goop inside that wont rinse down the sink.  Ive bought up as many bottles of the old version to just prolong the inevitable.  But that&#x27;s like the only thing I can think to do.  This new stuff sucks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 18 years old and fine, thin hair runs in the family. I have tried so many shampoos in my teenage years I swear I&#x27;ve never bought the same brand twice! The only way I could keep my hair managable (shiny, strong, and most importantly tangle free w/out greasiness) was if I rotated between 3-4 different types of shampoos daily. Once I found Burt&#x27;s Bees new Pomegrante &amp; Soy I decided to give it try since that line has never had a volumizing shampoo before AND I WILL NEVER USE ANYTHING ELSE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took a few weeks for my hair to get used to it. The first shampoo was great but then for a while I wasn&#x27;t too impressed but don&#x27;t lose faith!  I honestly didn&#x27;t notice a change in my hair until my oblivious boyfriend (who would never notice something like this) commented on how shiny my hair was and he was right! I now use it everyday (it&#x27;s been over a month now) and by the end of the day my hair might get a little flat and but not enough to dissapoint me any. And sometimes my scalp is a tad bit itchy which is something the conditioner would probably help with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been so impressed with this product. It truley volumizes thin lifeless hair. My hair has become so shiny in any type of lighting. I can just run my fingers through and notice how strong and smooth it&#x27;s become. I don&#x27;t have any trouble with knotting and I haven&#x27;t even bought the conditioner yet! Even the fragrance is pleasant and best yet the natural ingredients are better for your body. Hands down, this product is a 5 star! I would recommend this to ANYONE especially women with thinning or fine hair. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I think the shampoo is incredible....I noticed the difference after my first shampoo...very voluminizing &amp; just bought my 2nd bottle.  LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Great shampoo! Gives hair. Lots of body.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo in an effort to go sulfate free.  I had been using very expensive salon products (Redken, Miracle 10, Aquage, Joico, etc.) and seeing little to no results. I bumped into this at the drug store and it smelled great so I figured that if it didn&#x27;t work, it would go to my kids like the rest...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I tried it on my little one at bed time.  A nickle sized amount emulsified in your hand washed her long hair! The conditioner sealed the deal and made it easy to comb and very lustrous. Today she woke with her usual snarl but it brushed through very easily with no complaint from her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then used it on my tween and it made her curly hair look like a Panteen commercial!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I just tried it for myself and my long highlighted fine (but tons of it) hair looks amazing. All I applied when wet was my Aquage uplifting foam to the roots, nothing on the ends and the result was unreal. I didn&#x27;t even need to use an iron after blow drying to smooth the ends, which is unheard of as my hair, which i&#x27;ve spent thousands on from root to tip, was looking pretty beat in lieu of all of the proclaimed miracle products in my collection. If this continues, my styling time will be cut and my  hair quality will improve vastly without the use of additional heat tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you from the bottom of my hair, Burt&#x27;s Bees!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very conflicted about Burt&#x27;s Bees line. On the one hand, there are a couple of products that are great go-to options for me (for example the classic lip balm and the garden tomato toner), and then there are ones that seem like nobody even tested out before slapping a logo on them and putting them out on the shelves. I have long, fine hair, and I&#x27;ve been looking for a shampoo that leaves it clean and manageable. This is not that shampoo. After using it daily for a week, my hair was oily and limp, and looked as if it hadn&#x27;t been washed in days. Also, this shampoo smells bad; not in a perfumey, overly cosmetic way, but in a muddy, plasticy way. i don&#x27;t even know how else to describe it. The hunt for a sulfate free shampoo that works continues (sadly).</li>
            <li> I bought it for my wife, she loves what it does to her hair. The shampoo makes her hair nice and full. She doesn&#x27;t really like the smell of pomegranate but what it does for her hair, she can get pass that.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and was looking for a shampoo to give my hair some volume. This shampoo had the opposite effect. It left my hair feeling heavy and after a few hours looked unwashed and greasy. I tried it twice more before giving up on it. The only positive thing I can say is that it does smell nice.</li>
