            <li>My hair look more shinny</li>
            <li>, They&#x27;ve made my hair so healthy that I will continue to take them.</li>
            <li>I lost most of my hair after inhaling mold, then diagnosed with hypothroidism.  </li>

            <li>Nature Supp Advanced Hair Growth Formula vegetarian</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Advanced Hair Growth Formula for about four months and have seen a significant improvement in my hair growth.  </li>
            <li>I am ready to buy more and continue using them.</li>
            <li>Great for hair growth, but seem to have extreme headaches if not taken them.</li>
            <li>One less thing to stress about which is great.</li>
            <li>After using Advanced Hair Growth Formula for an extremely short amount of time she was able to see improvements.</li>
            <li>My hair dresser recommended I try these hair vitamins as her other clients had had good results.</li>
            <li>and I have finally found a suitable product;</li>
            <li>I have and still take a daily multi-vitamin, multi-mineral supplement as many folks do.  </li>
            <li>In fact, it has worked wonders in such a short time that I was impressed enough to write a 5-star review.</li>
            <li>And look forward to more results over the next 30 days.</li>
            <li>And to first time users I would recommend patience.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>Since the price is very reasonable given the results, I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>My hair is in better condition, it seems to be softer and not as dry.</li>
            <li>Ready to purchase another bottle soon.</li>
            <li>I took the whole bottle and maybe some sprigs appeared</li>
            <li>Absolutely works  </li>
            <li>My vacuum cleaner bag is no longer full of hair.  </li>
            <li>I have researched hair vitamins and tried different ones that have worked well, but when I came across Advanced Hair Growth Formula, I noticed a difference that made complete sense to me.  </li>
            <li>Most of the hair vitamin supplements have the same ingredients that the daily vitamins have in them.  </li>
            <li>my hairline is growing back and after two months, has filled out completely.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve already recommended this product to a few of our friends and they love it too.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t tell her that I was talking anything new.</li>
            <li>I have only been using these for a few weeks, so far, but I am going to try them for a few more before I know for sure if they are helping.</li>
            <li>My wife has been looking for a natural way to improve the strength of her hair for years</li>
            <li>I went through a really traumatic relationship experience several years ago and my hair started falling out by the handful.</li>
            <li>My hair was falling out more than normal and was starting to get thin.</li>
            <li>This product really works, the shedding has slowed down and I also notice new hair growth.  </li>
            <li>This not only directly improved her hair, but also improved her confidence in herself.</li>
            <li>After 2-3 months of little improvement I was ready to give up</li>

            <li> I have thick course curly hair that I straighten all the time. I got a bad hair cut hoping this would help grow it out faster. But I took all the pills with no success. Instead my hair started falling out bad when id wash it or even brush it. And is still doing it. Ive never had it falling out this bad. For my type of hair I definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li> I have only been using these for a few weeks, so far, but I am going to try them for a few more before I know for sure if they are helping. My hair stylist did comment that it seems to be thicker. So, we will see how it is the next time I go in. I didn&#x27;t tell her that I was talking anything new.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t vouch for the effectiveness yet because I just started taking this product.  I have researched hair vitamins and tried different ones that have worked well, but when I came across Advanced Hair Growth Formula, I noticed a difference that made complete sense to me.  I have and still take a daily multi-vitamin, multi-mineral supplement as many folks do.  Most of the hair vitamin supplements have the same ingredients that the daily vitamins have in them.  Why pay for the same thing?  This product is a supplement for hair beyond what a daily vitamin contains for me and that&#x27;s why I am trying it out.</li>
            <li> I am very much in love with the Advanced Hair Growth Formula by Nature Supp!  My hair was shedding a lot at the top and I’ve tried lots of hair growth vitamins but none of them worked for me until I found these. What a relief!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This product really works, the shedding has slowed down and I also notice new hair growth.  My hair is in better condition, it seems to be softer and not as dry. I am ready to buy more and continue using them. I can&#x27;t wait to see more growth over time. Highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a great hair supplement without breaking the bank.</li>
            <li> i HAVE BEEN USING THESE FOR LIKE A MONTH AND i ALREADY SEE HAIR GROWING IN MY THINNING SPACES.</li>
            <li> I have been taking these only a couple of weeks but seems like my hair is falling out less than before. I am encouraged, will keep taking!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Advanced Hair Growth Formula for about four months and have seen a significant improvement in my hair growth.  I will continue to use this product until my hair is fully grown again.</li>
            <li> My wife has been looking for a natural way to improve the strength of her hair for years and I have finally found a suitable product; this one. After using Advanced Hair Growth Formula for an extremely short amount of time she was able to see improvements. This not only directly improved her hair, but also improved her confidence in herself. We&#x27;ve already recommended this product to a few of our friends and they love it too.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair supplement with two goals in mind: 1) to make my hair grow faster and 2) to improve the moisture content, so my hair wouldn&#x27;t be so dry. After using this product for almost a month now, I&#x27;m very pleased with the outcome. In fact, it has worked wonders in such a short time that I was impressed enough to write a 5-star review. Since the price is very reasonable given the results, I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I have seen results in less than a month using this product. Buy it! Ready to purchase another bottle soon.</li>
            <li> Given I just started using this product and will need to give a bit of time before i start to see results, one things I can attest to is that the customer service is next to none! Ann and her team are proactive and personable and its incredibly refreshing to have this kind of experience these days.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Not sure yet if these supplements are working. Have only been taking them a couple weeks</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get your card today because I have wanted to let you know how much I love to your product – Nature Supp Advanced Hair Growth Formula vegetarian capsules.&lt;br /&gt;It has made my hair extremely thick and longer than ever. My hair is strong and does not break anymore. I will definitely continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;This is a wonderful product.  I highly recommend it to everyone. It the answer to any hair problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to your card, I will receive an exclusive coupon for $20 off my next bottle.  I’m looking forward to getting my coupon before my second bottle runs out.&lt;br /&gt;Many thanks.&lt;br /&gt;Lula L. Baker&lt;br /&gt;Savannah, GA</li>
            <li> My hair was falling out more than normal and was starting to get thin. My hair dresser recommended I try these hair vitamins as her other clients had had good results. After 2-3 months of little improvement I was ready to give up but she explained that people’s bodies respond at different rates so I should stick with it. I’m so pleased I listened to her as I’m very happy with the results now. One less thing to stress about which is great. Also, amazing customer service from Ann at Nature Supp.</li>
            <li> Great for hair growth, but seem to have extreme headaches if not taken them.</li>
            <li> Bought another bottle...hair thicker and grew a bit too</li>
            <li> My hair look more shinny</li>
            <li> I take 3 a day and the bottle is almost gone.  Can&#x27;t say I have noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I can see a definite increase in the health and vibrancy of my hair. And look forward to more results over the next 30 days.</li>
            <li> I went through a really traumatic relationship experience several years ago and my hair started falling out by the handful. The doctors told me that often happens when a person is under stress. I had tried upping my B vitamins (particularly biotin) and other things people recommended but my hair never seemed to grow back in as thick as it had been before. That is, until I tried these Hair Vitamins. It took several months, but, as I faithfully took this product, my hair grew back in and I no longer have a problem with thin hair. Now I keep taking them because they help my hair grow faster if I get a haircut that&#x27;s too short or that I don&#x27;t like, They&#x27;ve made my hair so healthy that I will continue to take them.</li>
            <li> I lost most of my hair after inhaling mold, then diagnosed with hypothroidism.  I wore wigs for a year.  I ordered these vitamins when I saw them and I am very pleased.  I have thick hair!  No more wigs.  My vacuum cleaner bag is no longer full of hair.  If you have thinning hair or hair loss take these.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see nothing different. I took some pictures before and after and things ate not changing yet.&lt;br /&gt;Bummer...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just going to say OK here. I took the whole bottle and maybe some sprigs appeared but I don&#x27;t know that they were due to come back in anyway. I had surgery and 4 months later i had hair loss. It&#x27;s been a year now and my hair is still thinner that what it was but i do have a lot of shorter hairs. I don&#x27;t know. It&#x27;s really too expensive for me to consider buying on a monthly basis but I had no adverse reactions from taking it.</li>
            <li> I perm my hair and because of my job I wear my hair pull back all the time so my hairline was thinning. I bought this product in June and after one month I did not see any progress, but I remember reading one review where someone was encourage to continue using the product because for some persons it takes time; so I bought another bottle and I am glad I did now my hairline is growing back and after two months, has filled out completely.  I have also seen some growth length wise and my hair does look heather.  Progress is slow but steady, I will continue using. And to first time users I would recommend patience.&lt;br /&gt;One thing I had hope to see some improvement in my skin, usually formulas for hair also affect skin and nails but so far no change in that department.  But the hair is looking good.</li>
            <li> Absolutely works  I&#x27;m so happy</li>
            <li> Did not notice a difference in my hair</li>
    </ol>
