            <li>I have always worn full cover nails - Broadway two step.  </li>
            <li>so I messaged them and they replied quickly letting me know they would send me the sizes.</li>
            <li>These were exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>it is my very first time using this product...and so far i love it.</li>
            <li>they are exactly what I wanted, full coverage of the nail</li>
            <li>(right)</li>
            <li>They all came, pretty good quality, all the sizes but the box they gave me was to small to hold all the nails.</li>
            <li>This is a difference picture from the other one I saw., but I did receive&lt;br /&gt;the right ones, and I do love them as well will order again.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>

            <li>I got sent french tips instead of full nails and not even the correct color, so dont be surprised if this happens to you.  </li>
            <li>The amount of nails received is impressive for a very low price, unfortunately, they don&#x27;t fit my nails and look odd on my hands.  </li>
            <li>but they aren&#x27;t really a natural color, they are a little more on the white-ish side...</li>
            <li>If someone&#x27;s natural nail was shaped that way, they would work for them.  </li>

            <li> Unfortunately I did not read the description on these nails, and was very disappointed when they arrived as I didn’t want full cover</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s will not break and it is not too thin.</li>

            <li> greeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaatttttttttttt  they  are  strong  and  durable  and  last  a  long  time  would  recommend  this  for  every one  who  likes  to  do  their  nails</li>
            <li> This is a difference picture from the other one I saw., but I did receive&lt;br /&gt;the right ones, and I do love them as well will order again.&lt;br /&gt;Thank YOU</li>
            <li> I really like this i was just playing around with nails now i will need to order more becasue i have used them more than i thought i would</li>
            <li> I have always worn full cover nails - Broadway two step.  When they stopped selling the Broadway nails in my area, I tried finding other options.  The amount of nails received is impressive for a very low price, unfortunately, they don&#x27;t fit my nails and look odd on my hands.  If someone&#x27;s natural nail was shaped that way, they would work for them.  They just didn&#x27;t work for me.  Fairly fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I got sent french tips instead of full nails and not even the correct color, so dont be surprised if this happens to you.  After two weeks of waiting I was really ticked they didnt even send the correct nails.</li>
            <li> These were exactly what I was looking for! I can paint them whatever color I want, and can cut them to whatever length I want! Love love love them!</li>
            <li> it is my very first time using this product...and so far i love it. they are exactly what I wanted, full coverage of the nail and you can shape them easily with a nail file. they seem fairly well made but they aren&#x27;t really a natural color, they are a little more on the white-ish side...they still my be useable to get a french tip look, but i haven&#x27;t tried it yet so i don&#x27;t know for sure.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I did not read the description on these nails, and was very disappointed when they arrived as I didn’t want full cover I only wanted half bed tips </li>
            <li> They work very well but they&#x27;re the color white, not beige. These fake nails are great, and I recommend buying them.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really use it yet, but it looks good to me. it come with a box and number on it.</li>
            <li> I love the product, it is easy to use and customer service is excellent. this is not the last time I&#x27;ll use this product!!!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that i came like 3 weeks before it was programmed to arrive :)&lt;br /&gt;the nails they are so many and from many sizes, i cant wait to start using them :)</li>
            <li> they are ok nails but if you use acetone on them they melt... so yeah they need to put that in their ads</li>
            <li> Love these to create nail designs for costumes or outfits a day or two before an event. This ensures that the nails are completely dry before I glue them on. Also it allows me to use the dominate hand (right) to create these designs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for what I&#x27;m doing. Easy to cut and shape. It&#x27;s will not break and it is not too thin. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I would give the product a 5 but I would give the customer service a 2. The first time I received the nails I was so happy that they were good quality full coverage nails but then I noticed that some of the sizes where missing so I messaged them and they replied quickly letting me know they would send me the sizes. When they came in the mail I got all the sizes but they were nail tips not full coverage. I let them know what had happened and asked if i could return the product and get a refund. They said yes but I realized that it&#x27;s not worth it for $10. So I decided to give them another chance and I just order the product again, hoping that my first order was just an honest mistake. They all came, pretty good quality, all the sizes but the box they gave me was to small to hold all the nails. The box was actually different from the one in the picture. I don&#x27;t think I will be ordering from them again.</li>
            <li> Everything that I wanted was what I got. The description was perfect and the picture is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Do not not buy this product from this retailer, as contrary to what they told me when I asked .....they do NOT state anywhere it is shipped from CHINA.&lt;br /&gt;It wont take 7-14 days as they state, it will take weeks. This is not good business practice.</li>
            <li> I started doing my own nails but didnt want to do the acrylic.  These are amazing and work for my needs. Great deal!</li>
            <li> They work for me. They are basic nails. Good quality at a great price. Came with a sorting tray which was a added bonus.</li>
            <li> Soooo many nails came! &amp; the fact they cover the whole nail know my sister will love it! I can&#x27;t wait to give it to her.</li>
            <li> These are good. They are a little long, but can be trimmed to desirable size. I will gladly recommend them.</li>
