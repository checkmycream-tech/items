            <li>Ordered these to fancy up my toenails and they&#x27;re great.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>the glue is the most ideal way to apply these glitters - securing the best</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure these would work wonderfully for nail designs as well.</li>
            <li>I love these!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love these!</li>
            <li>The price is great and there&#x27;s so many colors - love it.  </li>
            <li>love them for my nails that i do they look good on my nails</li>
            <li>The shapes and colors are really nice</li>
            <li>i would def order more very nice priced :)</li>
            <li>amount that comes in each container is awesome, I am very pleased with how full each container was, Worth the money just for the fact of how many comes in each one.</li>
            <li>These were so dirt cheap in comparison to the stuff you see in the store.!  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re really cute.</li>
            <li>However, there could be better packaging instead of the plastic lids.</li>
            <li>so cute</li>
            <li>Okay.</li>
            <li>Works sort of to put on top of applied nail polish.</li>
            <li>I found that when using a top coat some of the color comes off of the glitter shapes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so unless you are going for that look I would avoid the top coat.</li>
            <li>Now I put the top coat on top of my nail art</li>
            <li>I love the shapes and colors, however the purple color bled off when I applied my MAC top coat.</li>
            <li>These glitters are perfect to add a little bit of sparkle to my nail art designs.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy them.  </li>
            <li>The packaging and the glitter is cheap, glitter is too bulky for nail application.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>then use nail glue to secure each glitter gem on my nail.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am still happy with my purchase -</li>
            <li>The packaging was great, none of the glitters were mixed or lost - I&#x27;m excited to try these out.</li>
            <li>you can also create your own sparkle clear coat.  </li>
            <li>i just love them so much</li>
            <li>amazing colors, a nice diversity, If you love designs or just mix them with some nail polish, I mean on top or probably with a clear coat...</li>
            <li>I only wish I had more!</li>
            <li>The packaging is superb as all 12 colors are first packed individually in their own twist on/off containers and then all 12 are in a hard plastic storage container.</li>
            <li>worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I  definitely got my $5 worth, and more, in this set.</li>
            <li>The package comes with many different colors and designs.  </li>
            <li>Received exactly what was shown and described.</li>
            <li>Will buy again very soon!</li>
            <li>They are easy to open and close, and have many different shapes and colors to choose from.</li>
            <li>I used the top coat of clear polish on them to attach to my nail in the video and quickly realized the color will come off slightly</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to show off my new glitter mixes for Acrylic nails!</li>
            <li>and I can still use my hands like a normal person and not worry about them popping off.</li>
            <li>was a little skeptical about purchasing these at first but must say they are the best confetti shaped nail art I&#x27;ve ever received online.</li>
            <li>Only downfall is that when I put the top coat over the color of the sparkles came off a little.</li>
            <li>be giving to my young daughter for art.</li>
            <li>Worth the $5 I spent.</li>
            <li>My 3d shapes kept falling due to the lid not being secure enough and would scatter everywhere.</li>

            <li> The price is great and there&#x27;s so many colors - love it.  Would def. recommend it to others, use it often.</li>
            <li> amazing colors, a nice diversity, If you love designs or just mix them with some nail polish, I mean on top or probably with a clear coat... you can also create your own sparkle clear coat.  I enjoy them.  I also use them individualy, to create for example heads of butterflies, or in the point of their antenna, etc.</li>
            <li> love them for my nails that i do they look good on my nails i just love them so much</li>
            <li> I love these! They&#x27;re really cute. They are all very bright. I can&#x27;t wait until get to try all of them!</li>
            <li> Item was not what I ordered - I got totally different product from picture - Did not need heart designs; but, I will use them.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! worth the wait.</li>

            <li> [[ASIN:B007TGGI5E Premium Nail Art Nailart Manicure Glitter Confetti Shapes for 3D Designs]]&lt;br /&gt;I was a little skeptical about purchasing these at first but must say they are the best confetti shaped nail art I&#x27;ve ever received online. The packaging is superb as all 12 colors are first packed individually in their own twist on/off containers and then all 12 are in a hard plastic storage container.

            <li> I actually use these confetti shapes in the resin jewelry that I make. The shapes and colors are really nice and I&#x27;m sure these would work wonderfully for nail designs as well.</li>
            <li> What girl doesn&#x27;t like to sparkle and shine? This is the perfect accent for your nails so that they are noticed.</li>
            <li> Lots of colors and shapes. Only downfall is that when I put the top coat over the color of the sparkles came off a little. But besides that I will be using these all the time!!</li>
            <li> Im very happy with them they r so cute i cant wait to try them out i would def order more very nice priced :)</li>
            <li> I bought these to use for just myself at home. The colors are great and they are packaged neatly! Great product!</li>
            <li> The packaging and the glitter is cheap, glitter is too bulky for nail application.&lt;br /&gt;Will be giving to my young daughter for art.</li>
            <li> Okay. Much larger than we thought so it won&#x27;t work for what we hoped. Works sort of to put on top of applied nail polish.</li>
            <li> I love these! The packaging was great, none of the glitters were mixed or lost - I&#x27;m excited to try these out. Worth the $5 I spent. I only wish I had more!</li>
