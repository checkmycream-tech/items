            <li>The pricing is good.  </li>
            <li>But i have also been on the look out for a good shampoo.</li>

            <li>.... if anyone finds a good organic shampoo.</li>

            <li>LOVE the scent!</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo!</li>
            <li>The smell is good as well, but if you&#x27;re looking for a super strong peppermint smell, this is not your best pick.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more this shampoo smells pleasantly of botanicals.</li>
            <li>Great shampoo, has a minty smell but not too strong lightweight on the hair and feels nice, I like it</li>
            <li>this product is amazing, after I cut my hair because of a mishap.</li>
            <li>I feel like I have to use a lot more of this shampoo just to get a good lather.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice and works well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a nice shampoo.</li>
            <li>My hair has been nice and shiny since I started using it.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best shampoo I have ever used, and I have tried many!</li>
            <li>I feel that milkcreek -biotin shampoo has great effectiveness on my hair.i am glad that I was able to find something can nourish my scalp&amp; hair ,very evident  the healthier look of hair!</li>
            <li>we&#x27;ll see how it goes - but so far I am quite impressed, with the texture, the ingredients, the price, the feel and smell, and the results.</li>
            <li>and I need much more of the product to get a good clean feel.  </li>
            <li>I like this shampoo, but I must say that had I not bought the conditioner as well (which I LOVE)</li>
            <li>The shampoo is okay</li>
            <li>I would gladly use this again.</li>
            <li>I wish it smelled better.</li>
            <li>This even beats out high-end, top dollar salon shampoos.</li>
            <li>More height</li>
            <li>I love the tingles I get after i rinse it out and start with the conditoner.  </li>
            <li>I love this line and MillCreek</li>
            <li>I was hoping for better results from this product.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have the itching scalp that I have with most shampoos.</li>
            <li>If anything, I noticed that my hair started falling out MORE when I switched to this brand after Nexus biotin shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love Mill Creek products and I&#x27;ve tried many of them</li>
            <li>still wasn&#x27;t sure if it was the biotin shampoo causing the hair loss...</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Most organic/natural shampoo makes my scalp itchy, but this does not.</li>
            <li>I am glad that it does help with the hair loss.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s much better 4U than \\&quot;Yes To Carrots\\&quot;/Pantene/VO5/Mane And Tail.</li>
            <li>This is the 3rd time I have ordered this product and it works wonderful.  </li>
            <li>But I love the way my head and hair feel after I shampoo my hair.  </li>
            <li>If you want something for this reason, you might be better off looking elsewhere.</li>
            <li>go raising it now :-)</li>
            <li>But now I see I am losing more hair than before.</li>
            <li>I got this product on a recommendation from a cosmetologist stating that it would make my hair more healthy.  </li>
            <li>(i tried a bunch of dandruff shampoos that didn&#x27;t help before) and after 3 or 4 washes, my hair has been way fuller, shinier, and my curls are more defined.</li>
            <li>it smells minty and refreshing and doesn&#x27;t contain any drying sulfates!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shampoo has a lovely smell of mint and is soothing to my scalp.  </li>
            <li>and i have to say it made my hair feel silkier for sure.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the conditioner also.  </li>
            <li>The product is ok.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leather as you would think, but just add more.</li>
            <li>Will Buy More.</li>
            <li>I love the way it leaves my hair</li>
            <li>Love these products great clarity and excellent features for tge outstanding ptice this was exactly what i odered and expected</li>
            <li>It gives your hair volume and a very clean feeling to your head.  </li>
            <li>Rinses very clean.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for such an awesome product, keep up the good work.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>It is pretty good at lathering up.&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li>It has a nice mild peppermint smell, but it&#x27;s not so strong that you smell like a candy cane.</li>
            <li>all are natural and organic and work great.</li>
            <li>i loved my shampoo and it came fast</li>
            <li>ok, hair feels clean.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fuller, is more manageable, and feels clean.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t know it wasn&#x27;t very healthy</li>
            <li>so it is fairly runny like a normal shampoo</li>
            <li>It makes my hair more full and manageable throughout any given day</li>
            <li>This shampoo is not bad just ok.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, but a lot of it</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo even while pregnant the smell never bothered me.</li>
            <li>Was looking for a sulfate free shampoo to try, found this at my local TJ Maxx at a great price.</li>
            <li>This Biotin Shampoo is made without lauryl sulfate and is also paraben free.</li>
            <li>available.  </li>
            <li>I searched for a GOOD, organic and natural biotin-containing shampoo, and this is what I bought.</li>
            <li>This is a good product if you just want a clean rinse and a natural product.</li>
            <li>Never heard of Mill Creek but the ingredients list was pretty healthy</li>
            <li>In the first two weeks, I felt my hair is shiny and looking healthy.</li>
            <li>Not a big deal; I wasn&#x27;t expecting to see anything remarkable and it works like shampoo should work.</li>
            <li>So clean but not fruity or flowery.</li>
            <li>I cannot put it in words my hair and head feel clean and I would recommend this item.</li>
            <li>but after you use the conditioner, which has really nice slip to it, your hair becomes really soft.</li>
            <li>Delivery was good and price was similar to what I pay at the store.</li>
            <li>My wife has also commented many times that my hair looks and feels much</li>
            <li>If not and or price is not as good, then will come back to Amazon.</li>
            <li>okay, but is seems to make a real difference.  </li>
            <li>This is different and good.</li>
            <li>Loved it, will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li>I really love this product getting ready to order another one</li>
            <li>However, the package was delivered in a stuffed box but the shampoo bottle had duct tape on the top to keep closed and after removing the tape on each side of the top i removed the top and the bottle did not have a seal.  </li>
            <li>BUT I wanted a shampoo to really up the ante and give me the softest, most luxurious hair ever, because I&#x27;m going to donate all 20 inches of it in</li>
            <li>Right now, Amazon has the cheapest vendor available and Mill Creak doesn&#x27;t change their quality of their products -</li>
            <li>It seems that the other reviewers are particularly happy about its anti-dandruff properties.</li>
            <li>Instead it is a not-sweet, mildly minty scent (part of the scalp invigoration formula, perhaps?)</li>
            <li>I bought this in hopes of healthier growing hair, but it is super drying.</li>
            <li>I was actually looking for a product with more of a tingle factor (this helps bring bloodflow to the scalp and promote healthy hair growth).</li>
            <li>I love both shampoos, I especially love this shampoo because Biotin is listed as the second active ingredient!</li>
            <li>I was very satisfied with receiving my product in such a timely manner.  </li>
            <li>Because it works on the scalp and the hair, it helps the scalp be a healthy place for hair to keep root, and the shampoo helps my long hair keep healthy all along the shaft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the first time i used this, i literally had no hair loss afterwards whatsoever!</li>
            <li>Economical to use.</li>
            <li>but I really love it so far.</li>
            <li>My scalp gets a tingly fresh minty feeling after washing with this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I think that makes this shampoo a much better product then most other choices.</li>
            <li>Works great, doesn&#x27;t lather as much as some other shampoos, but I like it.</li>
            <li>and I noticed right away</li>
            <li>and I have searched and searched and searched to find the right shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It helps clean my itchy scalp really well</li>
            <li>She had a problem with her hair drying up too much and started using this shampoo, and it seems to be making a difference for sure since she has not complained about it ever since.</li>
            <li>I can certainly see a difference!</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have dandruff in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for several years, and it&#x27;s my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was the shampoo, so I stopped using it for a while, and switched back to the Mill Creek Keratin shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>I read the other reviews about helping with hair loss and am excited about that because I do notice my hair in the drain much more as I age.</li>
            <li>Back to the health food store for more.  </li>
            <li>This product cleanse my hair very well!</li>
            <li>I have had better shampoos in the past that seem to have more the \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; factor.</li>
            <li>it will lather up like most shampoos do on only one wash.  </li>
            <li>I have been using their shampoo and conditioner for over ten years and my hair looks great, amazed that they have been able to maintain such a low price for as long as they have...dont</li>
            <li>so a few days later, I decided to try it again - and once again, I experienced an abnormal amount of hair loss</li>
            <li>I would really have given this two stars.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really work either.</li>
            <li>I am now looking to see how much hair growth I have while using this product as well.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for about a month and it is still working very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shampoo really works for me.  </li>
            <li>my hair was smoother and there wasn&#x27;t as much hair</li>
            <li>If you are going to use this product you ABSOLUTELY must use a moisturizing conditioner.</li>
            <li>Smells better than expected.</li>
            <li>Lathers better than expected.</li>
            <li>His hair is much shorter and didn&#x27;t seem to bother him as much.</li>
            <li>but I took her advice and up to now haven&#x27;t seen much difference.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo works very well with my hair.</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li>So i was very dissatisfied with the condition of my bottle of shampoo that i received.  </li>
            <li>I am very hesitant to even use that bottle of shampoo since it was not sealed.</li>
            <li>and it is gentle on my scalp.</li>
            <li>it really helps your hair grow too</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t like product, very drying on my hair</li>
            <li>My daughter has eczema, this shampoo is gentle on her skin n hair</li>
            <li>It made my hair super dry at the ends, and super oily at the roots (I use their conditioner too).</li>
            <li>I first used this product in the 1970&#x27;s when I was very sensitive to smells and chemicals.  </li>
            <li>up&amp;#34; well enough to clean the styling product &amp; any dirt/pollutants out very well, without any harming effects.</li>
            <li>All natural leaves my hair clean and soft</li>
            <li>so I find that I use more then my other shampoos, but they give you a generous amount in the bottle.</li>
            <li>This is a first class product for those of us with sensitive scalps.  </li>
            <li>It got oily the next day, though, so I decided to use more product the next time.</li>
            <li>I tried to use it in many different ways, but the results are the same.</li>
            <li>So as far as her main concern was , this product has certainly delivered...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for for both men and women.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend  them both.</li>
            <li>It cleans well, but you need to use a little bit more each time than with a normal lathering shampoo.</li>
            <li>My doctor said I &amp;#34;broke the hair growth cycle.&amp;#34; I lost about 4 inches of hair on one side of my hair, which is normally mid-back length.  </li>
            <li>My head feels clean when I use this shampoo and it seem to me that my hair is not breaking as much as with my other shampoo.  </li>
            <li>it can dry out your hair as most essential oils are drying.</li>
            <li>Gave it 5 stars despite chemicals cuz it cleans well and far less toxic than more $$$ shampoos.</li>
            <li>My hair felt less soft and shiny than usual, and I was still okay with that, since I can always use more conditioner or put oil on it, etc...</li>
            <li>has a new devoted customer.</li>
            <li>I will use this as my new shampoo from now on.</li>
            <li>It did not appear to be a new bottle of shampoo like the bottle of conditioner i received.  </li>
            <li>Initially once the biotin supplement(oral) was available locally even in a multi or B sup any amt.</li>
            <li>This shampoo has a nice subtle minty scent and cleanses well... almost too well.</li>
            <li>I also use Moroccanoil products right after this shampoo because it can make my hair feel dry and stripped, but the Moroccanoil products puts all the moisture and life back into it right away.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually enjoying wearing my usual 4-week cut into the sixth week and</li>
            <li>Nothing special for my hair and local water, but then again I just wanted to try something different.  </li>
            <li>By now I am pretty certain that it is this shampoo that is causing the excessive hair loss...which is ironic because this is a biotin shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried the biotin shampoo with the matching conditioner and it not only made me hair dry, but I also experienced a huge amount of hair loss - like a scary amount of hair loss!</li>
            <li>Now, forty years after initial usage and am still using with full head of hair with most male relatives having very little hair left.</li>
            <li>I have used this shampoo twice so far and my hair has felt cleaner and shinier after just these two uses.</li>
            <li>The 2nd ingredient is Biotin compared to most other shampoos which contain a lot of other stuff first.</li>
            <li>It was both perky and sensitive to my colored treated hair.</li>
            <li>No harsh chemicals or parabens either, so no worries about buildup issues.</li>
            <li>I personally do not care too much for how my hair feels like afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I used it twice and had to condition my hair a couple times for it to return soft.</li>
            <li>At the time I had natural kinky curly hair</li>
            <li>like this product as a natural option for shampoo, but don&#x27;t expect a miracle.</li>
            <li>I am now 77 years old and have used it ever since.  </li>
            <li>I am growing it out natural now, and keeping the permed hair, and trim it myself.  </li>
            <li>My hair is shiny and soft, and knowing there is biotin in</li>
            <li>The shampoo did a good job without being that expensive.</li>
            <li>It is a little pepperminty, and leaves your scalp feeling tingly and clean.</li>
            <li>(less shedding) but isnt strong enough for oily hair and it costs $28 USD per bottle.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product, my hair is now so soft and shiny only after using this product for one week.  </li>
            <li>Ok first off, this was for my wife so ill try and write whatever she thought about it.</li>
            <li>Was supposed to make my hair thicker and &amp;#34;healthier.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about 6 months and haven&#x27;t noticed any positive results in comparison to regular brand-name shampoos such as Suave or Head &amp; Shoulders.</li>
            <li>Early twenties noticed shower strainer would barely drain because of hair after every shower.  </li>
            <li>Seems to help the skin(and associated hair) as well so use as body wash too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Began using shampoo containing biotin in early twenties, 40 years ago, wow, and MillCreek for about the last 30-35 of those.  </li>
            <li>Mill Creek is shown to have a higher Biotin (B vitamin) content than any other brand.  </li>
            <li>I finally tried this shampoo and conditioner and today (a bottle and a half later)my hair is full of body and the bald spot is filling in.  </li>
            <li>&#x27;you are what you eat&#x27;, so a diet high in protein with biotin supplements has given me glorious hair... thick and curly and long and strong...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Eventually settled on Millcreek biotin shampoo as it was competitively priced with other positive ingredients.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It works ok, I guess but is not a great value at almost $9 a bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So make sure you follow up this shampoo with the conditioner or you will have dry hard to manage hair.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new brand of shampoo since my current brand left my hair brittle and greasy at the same time (if that is even possible!).</li>

            <li> After doing some research on the best things to have for healthy hair growth, I found that Biotin was one of those things and that this shampoo was a very good option.  </li>
            <li> Great price for the quality of shampoo</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for almost a month now, so far,so good.</li>

            <li> The pricing is good.  </li>
            <li> But i have also been on the look out for a good shampoo.</li>
            <li> well, this product is  definitely a good value for your money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> good price</li>
            <li> .... if anyone finds a good organic shampoo.</li>
            <li> Good quality shampoo.</li>
            <li> foams up nice with just a drop works great</li>

            <li> I am very pleased with this product and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!</li>
            <li> And I must say, I love it!</li>
            <li> LOVE the scent!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo!</li>
            <li> The smell is good as well, but if you&#x27;re looking for a super strong peppermint smell, this is not your best pick.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s more this shampoo smells pleasantly of botanicals.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo, has a minty smell but not too strong lightweight on the hair and feels nice, I like it</li>
            <li> this product is amazing, after I cut my hair because of a mishap.</li>
            <li> I feel like I have to use a lot more of this shampoo just to get a good lather.  </li>
            <li> It smells nice and works well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a nice shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair has been nice and shiny since I started using it.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shampoo I have ever used, and I have tried many!</li>
            <li> I feel that milkcreek -biotin shampoo has great effectiveness on my hair.i am glad that I was able to find something can nourish my scalp&amp; hair ,very evident  the healthier look of hair!</li>
            <li> we&#x27;ll see how it goes - but so far I am quite impressed, with the texture, the ingredients, the price, the feel and smell, and the results.</li>
            <li> and I need much more of the product to get a good clean feel.  </li>
            <li> I like this shampoo, but I must say that had I not bought the conditioner as well (which I LOVE)</li>
            <li> The shampoo is okay</li>
            <li> I would gladly use this again.</li>
            <li> I wish it smelled better.</li>
            <li> This even beats out high-end, top dollar salon shampoos.</li>
            <li> More height</li>
            <li> I love the tingles I get after i rinse it out and start with the conditoner.  </li>
            <li> I love this line and MillCreek</li>
            <li> I was hoping for better results from this product.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the itching scalp that I have with most shampoos.</li>
            <li> If anything, I noticed that my hair started falling out MORE when I switched to this brand after Nexus biotin shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love Mill Creek products and I&#x27;ve tried many of them</li>
            <li> still wasn&#x27;t sure if it was the biotin shampoo causing the hair loss...</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Most organic/natural shampoo makes my scalp itchy, but this does not.</li>
            <li> I am glad that it does help with the hair loss.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s much better 4U than \\&quot;Yes To Carrots\\&quot;/Pantene/VO5/Mane And Tail.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd time I have ordered this product and it works wonderful.  </li>
            <li> But I love the way my head and hair feel after I shampoo my hair.  </li>
            <li> If you want something for this reason, you might be better off looking elsewhere.</li>
            <li> go raising it now :-)</li>
            <li> But now I see I am losing more hair than before.</li>
            <li> I got this product on a recommendation from a cosmetologist stating that it would make my hair more healthy.  </li>
            <li> (i tried a bunch of dandruff shampoos that didn&#x27;t help before) and after 3 or 4 washes, my hair has been way fuller, shinier, and my curls are more defined.</li>
            <li> it smells minty and refreshing and doesn&#x27;t contain any drying sulfates!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shampoo has a lovely smell of mint and is soothing to my scalp.  </li>
            <li> and i have to say it made my hair feel silkier for sure.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the conditioner also.  </li>
            <li> The product is ok.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leather as you would think, but just add more.</li>
            <li> Will Buy More.</li>
            <li> I love the way it leaves my hair</li>
            <li> Love these products great clarity and excellent features for tge outstanding ptice this was exactly what i odered and expected</li>
            <li> It gives your hair volume and a very clean feeling to your head.  </li>
            <li> Rinses very clean.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for such an awesome product, keep up the good work.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> It is pretty good at lathering up.&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li> It has a nice mild peppermint smell, but it&#x27;s not so strong that you smell like a candy cane.</li>
            <li> all are natural and organic and work great.</li>
            <li> i loved my shampoo and it came fast</li>
            <li> ok, hair feels clean.  </li>
            <li> My hair is fuller, is more manageable, and feels clean.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t know it wasn&#x27;t very healthy</li>
            <li> so it is fairly runny like a normal shampoo</li>
            <li> It makes my hair more full and manageable throughout any given day</li>
            <li> This shampoo is not bad just ok.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, but a lot of it</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo even while pregnant the smell never bothered me.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a sulfate free shampoo to try, found this at my local TJ Maxx at a great price.</li>
            <li> This Biotin Shampoo is made without lauryl sulfate and is also paraben free.</li>
            <li> available.  </li>
            <li> I searched for a GOOD, organic and natural biotin-containing shampoo, and this is what I bought.</li>
            <li> This is a good product if you just want a clean rinse and a natural product.</li>
            <li> Never heard of Mill Creek but the ingredients list was pretty healthy</li>
            <li> In the first two weeks, I felt my hair is shiny and looking healthy.</li>
            <li> Not a big deal; I wasn&#x27;t expecting to see anything remarkable and it works like shampoo should work.</li>
            <li> So clean but not fruity or flowery.</li>
            <li> I cannot put it in words my hair and head feel clean and I would recommend this item.</li>
            <li> but after you use the conditioner, which has really nice slip to it, your hair becomes really soft.</li>
            <li> Delivery was good and price was similar to what I pay at the store.</li>
            <li> My wife has also commented many times that my hair looks and feels much</li>
            <li> If not and or price is not as good, then will come back to Amazon.</li>
            <li> okay, but is seems to make a real difference.  </li>
            <li> This is different and good.</li>
            <li> Loved it, will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I really love this product getting ready to order another one</li>
            <li> However, the package was delivered in a stuffed box but the shampoo bottle had duct tape on the top to keep closed and after removing the tape on each side of the top i removed the top and the bottle did not have a seal.  </li>
            <li> BUT I wanted a shampoo to really up the ante and give me the softest, most luxurious hair ever, because I&#x27;m going to donate all 20 inches of it in</li>
            <li> Right now, Amazon has the cheapest vendor available and Mill Creak doesn&#x27;t change their quality of their products -</li>
            <li> It seems that the other reviewers are particularly happy about its anti-dandruff properties.</li>
            <li> Instead it is a not-sweet, mildly minty scent (part of the scalp invigoration formula, perhaps?)</li>
            <li> I bought this in hopes of healthier growing hair, but it is super drying.</li>
            <li> I was actually looking for a product with more of a tingle factor (this helps bring bloodflow to the scalp and promote healthy hair growth).</li>
            <li> I love both shampoos, I especially love this shampoo because Biotin is listed as the second active ingredient!</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with receiving my product in such a timely manner.  </li>
            <li> Because it works on the scalp and the hair, it helps the scalp be a healthy place for hair to keep root, and the shampoo helps my long hair keep healthy all along the shaft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the first time i used this, i literally had no hair loss afterwards whatsoever!</li>
            <li> Economical to use.</li>
            <li> but I really love it so far.</li>
            <li> My scalp gets a tingly fresh minty feeling after washing with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I think that makes this shampoo a much better product then most other choices.</li>
            <li> Works great, doesn&#x27;t lather as much as some other shampoos, but I like it.</li>
            <li> and I noticed right away</li>
            <li> and I have searched and searched and searched to find the right shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It helps clean my itchy scalp really well</li>
            <li> She had a problem with her hair drying up too much and started using this shampoo, and it seems to be making a difference for sure since she has not complained about it ever since.</li>
            <li> I can certainly see a difference!</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dandruff in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for several years, and it&#x27;s my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was the shampoo, so I stopped using it for a while, and switched back to the Mill Creek Keratin shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews about helping with hair loss and am excited about that because I do notice my hair in the drain much more as I age.</li>
            <li> Back to the health food store for more.  </li>
            <li> This product cleanse my hair very well!</li>
            <li> I have had better shampoos in the past that seem to have more the \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; factor.</li>
            <li> it will lather up like most shampoos do on only one wash.  </li>
            <li> I have been using their shampoo and conditioner for over ten years and my hair looks great, amazed that they have been able to maintain such a low price for as long as they have...dont</li>
            <li> so a few days later, I decided to try it again - and once again, I experienced an abnormal amount of hair loss</li>
            <li> I would really have given this two stars.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work either.</li>
            <li> I am now looking to see how much hair growth I have while using this product as well.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about a month and it is still working very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This shampoo really works for me.  </li>
            <li> my hair was smoother and there wasn&#x27;t as much hair</li>
            <li> If you are going to use this product you ABSOLUTELY must use a moisturizing conditioner.</li>
            <li> Smells better than expected.</li>
            <li> Lathers better than expected.</li>
            <li> His hair is much shorter and didn&#x27;t seem to bother him as much.</li>
            <li> but I took her advice and up to now haven&#x27;t seen much difference.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo works very well with my hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li> So i was very dissatisfied with the condition of my bottle of shampoo that i received.  </li>
            <li> I am very hesitant to even use that bottle of shampoo since it was not sealed.</li>
            <li> and it is gentle on my scalp.</li>
            <li> it really helps your hair grow too</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like product, very drying on my hair</li>
            <li> My daughter has eczema, this shampoo is gentle on her skin n hair</li>
            <li> It made my hair super dry at the ends, and super oily at the roots (I use their conditioner too).</li>
            <li> I first used this product in the 1970&#x27;s when I was very sensitive to smells and chemicals.  </li>
            <li> up&amp;#34; well enough to clean the styling product &amp; any dirt/pollutants out very well, without any harming effects.</li>
            <li> All natural leaves my hair clean and soft</li>
            <li> so I find that I use more then my other shampoos, but they give you a generous amount in the bottle.</li>
            <li> This is a first class product for those of us with sensitive scalps.  </li>
            <li> It got oily the next day, though, so I decided to use more product the next time.</li>
            <li> I tried to use it in many different ways, but the results are the same.</li>
            <li> So as far as her main concern was , this product has certainly delivered...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for for both men and women.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend  them both.</li>
            <li> It cleans well, but you need to use a little bit more each time than with a normal lathering shampoo.</li>
            <li> My doctor said I &amp;#34;broke the hair growth cycle.&amp;#34; I lost about 4 inches of hair on one side of my hair, which is normally mid-back length.  </li>
            <li> My head feels clean when I use this shampoo and it seem to me that my hair is not breaking as much as with my other shampoo.  </li>
            <li> it can dry out your hair as most essential oils are drying.</li>
            <li> Gave it 5 stars despite chemicals cuz it cleans well and far less toxic than more $$$ shampoos.</li>
            <li> My hair felt less soft and shiny than usual, and I was still okay with that, since I can always use more conditioner or put oil on it, etc...</li>
            <li> has a new devoted customer.</li>
            <li> I will use this as my new shampoo from now on.</li>
            <li> It did not appear to be a new bottle of shampoo like the bottle of conditioner i received.  </li>
            <li> Initially once the biotin supplement(oral) was available locally even in a multi or B sup any amt.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a nice subtle minty scent and cleanses well... almost too well.</li>
            <li> I also use Moroccanoil products right after this shampoo because it can make my hair feel dry and stripped, but the Moroccanoil products puts all the moisture and life back into it right away.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually enjoying wearing my usual 4-week cut into the sixth week and</li>
            <li> Nothing special for my hair and local water, but then again I just wanted to try something different.  </li>
            <li> By now I am pretty certain that it is this shampoo that is causing the excessive hair loss...which is ironic because this is a biotin shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried the biotin shampoo with the matching conditioner and it not only made me hair dry, but I also experienced a huge amount of hair loss - like a scary amount of hair loss!</li>
            <li> Now, forty years after initial usage and am still using with full head of hair with most male relatives having very little hair left.</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo twice so far and my hair has felt cleaner and shinier after just these two uses.</li>
            <li> The 2nd ingredient is Biotin compared to most other shampoos which contain a lot of other stuff first.</li>
            <li> It was both perky and sensitive to my colored treated hair.</li>
            <li> No harsh chemicals or parabens either, so no worries about buildup issues.</li>
            <li> I personally do not care too much for how my hair feels like afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I used it twice and had to condition my hair a couple times for it to return soft.</li>
            <li> At the time I had natural kinky curly hair</li>
            <li> like this product as a natural option for shampoo, but don&#x27;t expect a miracle.</li>
            <li> I am now 77 years old and have used it ever since.  </li>
            <li> I am growing it out natural now, and keeping the permed hair, and trim it myself.  </li>
            <li> My hair is shiny and soft, and knowing there is biotin in</li>
            <li> The shampoo did a good job without being that expensive.</li>
            <li> It is a little pepperminty, and leaves your scalp feeling tingly and clean.</li>
            <li> (less shedding) but isnt strong enough for oily hair and it costs $28 USD per bottle.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product, my hair is now so soft and shiny only after using this product for one week.  </li>
            <li> Ok first off, this was for my wife so ill try and write whatever she thought about it.</li>
            <li> Was supposed to make my hair thicker and &amp;#34;healthier.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about 6 months and haven&#x27;t noticed any positive results in comparison to regular brand-name shampoos such as Suave or Head &amp; Shoulders.</li>
            <li> Early twenties noticed shower strainer would barely drain because of hair after every shower.  </li>
            <li> Seems to help the skin(and associated hair) as well so use as body wash too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Began using shampoo containing biotin in early twenties, 40 years ago, wow, and MillCreek for about the last 30-35 of those.  </li>
            <li> Mill Creek is shown to have a higher Biotin (B vitamin) content than any other brand.  </li>
            <li> I finally tried this shampoo and conditioner and today (a bottle and a half later)my hair is full of body and the bald spot is filling in.  </li>
            <li> &#x27;you are what you eat&#x27;, so a diet high in protein with biotin supplements has given me glorious hair... thick and curly and long and strong...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Eventually settled on Millcreek biotin shampoo as it was competitively priced with other positive ingredients.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It works ok, I guess but is not a great value at almost $9 a bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So make sure you follow up this shampoo with the conditioner or you will have dry hard to manage hair.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new brand of shampoo since my current brand left my hair brittle and greasy at the same time (if that is even possible!).</li>
            <li> This product only requires a small dab to shampoo the whole head.</li>
            <li> Minus the Sodium Laureth Sulfate and the many other ingredients your hair does not need and for that matter not good for it.</li>
            <li> I had an excessive amount of postpartum hair loss and was trying to find something gentle on my hair that would improve</li>
            <li> About 5 years after use was in doctors office for upper respiratory involvement and related my experience as I was curious for his opinion.  </li>
            <li> And lathers fine for me, but maybe I&#x27;m doing it wrong?</li>
            <li> my hair  is growing like crazy.  :-)</li>
            <li> even after using the millcreek biotin conditioner and taking care not to over-rinse, my hair is still not soft.</li>
            <li> It might be noted that the plaque formation prevention in capillaries by biotin has been reported through studies/research to have a similar effect on other tissues.</li>
            <li> If you have dry or damaged hair</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t tangle or dry out after using it.</li>
            <li> After using this shampoo for the second time, I did notice some hairs falling, but it was still less than usual, and it was normal.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo with the recommendation of someone who uses Biotin shampoo all the time with much satisfaction, but I am unhappy with this particular brand because it is too watery</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it smells terrific.</li>
            <li> shampoo itself is rather gel-like; you only need a little bit, it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> my hair is only just now looking a little ragged.</li>
            <li> I had absolutely no reaction to it</li>
            <li> and it worked very well indeed as my hair had started to thin</li>
            <li> I am mid-30&#x27;s with thick, fine, curly hair--can only wash every other day or my scalp gets angry and flaky.</li>
            <li> makes my hair dry and not very clean</li>
            <li> I am 23 yrs old and for the past year and half my hair has been losing volume due to some hormonal imbalance.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve started using it my hair has been less dry and brittle throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Though I am not really at the age where I might be losing hair it doesn&#x27;t hurt!</li>
            <li> I wanted a cheaper alternative that I could use every other day.</li>
            <li> did notice it did not produce a build up like other shampoos</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get that itchy allergic feeling I get with other shampoos...</li>
            <li> I believe this is due to the peppermint oil in the product.</li>
            <li> I researched shampoos and came across this one that has amino acids and other nutrients for hair and decided to try it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because of the reviews after suffering a medical condition, I lost a lot of hair; it broke off from the root and broke off in small pieces.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day.</li>
            <li> Mind you my hair is not long nor is it thick (hence the biotin shampoo).</li>
            <li> Again, I needed NO SULFER or other stupid additives in most hair products.</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago my hair was like wet spaghetti.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for over twenty years and never felt let down.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry brittle hair, and some shampoos only make the situation worse.</li>
            <li> My hair used to move in just a slight breeze however after using this shampoo for a month it feels and looks a lot thicker.</li>
            <li> It works a bit like the Wen system does but with slightly less conditioning, and it&#x27;s also way cheaper.</li>
            <li> Which was plastic wrapped tightly and the bottle sealed.  </li>
            <li> few notes: It is a liquid</li>
            <li> That makes this the only &amp;#34;hair product&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve used that&#x27;s ever made thin hair look stronger and fuller.</li>
            <li> I like the smell, but this shampoo really dried out my hair and didn&#x27;t seem to have any noticeable effects on my hair.</li>
            <li> Continued with the Millcreek all during this time although others have worked when it was not available.  </li>
            <li> and after a few weeks, it started to come in again.  </li>
            <li> AND I had about 50% less hair shedding in the shower also!</li>
            <li> My hope was that I could find a brand that doesn&#x27;t have excessively crappy and poisonous ingredients.</li>
            <li> , this is the first time I&#x27;ve been disappointed with a product from Mill Creek.</li>
            <li> Astonishingly no hair on strainer.  </li>
            <li> About 3 years ago had been taking 300-1000mcgs. and noticed a small amt.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for the past one month.</li>
            <li> I have been taking biotin pills on and off for the past yr and it has helped a lot.</li>
            <li> Whether this is helping I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> It just acted like any other shampoo for thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel hard</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thick texture and it does make my hair &amp;#34;appear&amp;#34; thicker.  </li>
            <li> My hair is now growing in twice as thick.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair, with some gray.</li>
            <li> If you notice excessive hair loss - stop using this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m serious.</li>
            <li> Having used this for about three weeks, I agree with the observation that it lathers poorly.</li>
            <li> One star off for poor lather - shrug.</li>
            <li> began using it for its claim to protect thin hair/hair loss.</li>
            <li> When my hair began to thin</li>
            <li> Sorry to say,.</li>
            <li> My hair feels disgusting, not soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li> Mill Creek Botanicals Biotin Shampoo does not contains any sodium laurel sulfate, parabens, or artificial colors, BUT it does contain sodium myreth sulfate, octyl dimethyl PABA, potassium sorbate, and botanical fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have bad allergies and can not use any products with lavender or fragrance (parfum).</li>
            <li> so you can imagine how bad that can be for my hair.</li>
            <li> Did not work for hair loss or hair growth, made my hair tangle badly.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just gonna use it as soap :(</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like this shampoo, but I must say that had I not bought the conditioner as well (which I LOVE) I would really have given this two stars. It makes my hair feel hard but after you use the conditioner, which has really nice slip to it, your hair becomes really soft. Overall, it&#x27;s ok. The smell is good as well, but if you&#x27;re looking for a super strong peppermint smell, this is not your best pick.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is okay, I can&#x27;t say it did anything different with my hair.</li>
            <li> this product is amazing, after I cut my hair because of a mishap. so I bought it and my hair  is growing like crazy.  :-)</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new brand of shampoo since my current brand left my hair brittle and greasy at the same time (if that is even possible!). My hope was that I could find a brand that doesn&#x27;t have excessively crappy and poisonous ingredients. This Biotin Shampoo is made without lauryl sulfate and is also paraben free. A little goes a long way and it smells terrific. I understand that biotin prevents candida and also hair loss. Though I am not really at the age where I might be losing hair it doesn&#x27;t hurt! What&#x27;s more this shampoo smells pleasantly of botanicals. I would gladly use this again. Great price for the quality of shampoo you are getting.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo! My hair felt thicker after just one use AND I had about 50% less hair shedding in the shower also! Amazing product that smells good and lathers well! I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ve lived without this product!</li>
            <li> I wish it smelled better. Didn&#x27;t really work either.</li>
            <li> This product only requires a small dab to shampoo the whole head. Economical to use.</li>
            <li> It seems that the other reviewers are particularly happy about its anti-dandruff properties. I don&#x27;t have dandruff in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using the shampoo because my brother had it when I visited him. He said it was good for keeping his hair thicker. I bought some to use at home, and I do believe it helps. Because it works on the scalp and the hair, it helps the scalp be a healthy place for hair to keep root, and the shampoo helps my long hair keep healthy all along the shaft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband started using it too. Eventually, the shop we bought it from locally stopped carrying it. Now we buy it several bottles at a time, online. It is a good product at a good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is not syrupy or perfumy. Instead it is a not-sweet, mildly minty scent (part of the scalp invigoration formula, perhaps?) I highly recommend it for for both men and women.</li>
            <li> makes my hair dry and not very clean</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shampoo I have ever used, and I have tried many! This even beats out high-end, top dollar salon shampoos. I&#x27;m serious. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Works. And lathers fine for me, but maybe I&#x27;m doing it wrong? Principally bought because it was reported not to have SLS (or whatever variant of name chance mfg&#x27;s have used to say the same thing). I like it, overall.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine. I&#x27;ve used it before.  Delivery was good and price was similar to what I pay at the store. But I am happy to shop from home instead.</li>
            <li> After doing some research on the best things to have for healthy hair growth, I found that Biotin was one of those things and that this shampoo was a very good option.  I have used this shampoo twice so far and my hair has felt cleaner and shinier after just these two uses. I am now looking to see how much hair growth I have while using this product as well. I will continue to use it and would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> this shampoo makes my hair feel like straw. yuck! even after using the millcreek biotin conditioner and taking care not to over-rinse, my hair is still not soft. i won&#x27;t order this again, and i won&#x27;t even use what i already have.</li>
            <li> If you have dry or damaged hair I would highly recommend this product, my hair is now so soft and shiny only after using this product for one week.  I am definately going to order this shampoo again.  My beautician even mentioned how good my hair looks again.  Thank you so much for such an awesome product, keep up the good work.</li>
            <li> MillCreek - Biotin Shampoo, 16 fl oz gel. I have used this product for years. Again, I needed NO SULFER or other stupid additives in most hair products. I have purchased this item for years and have purchased it from various vendors. Right now, Amazon has the cheapest vendor available and Mill Creak doesn&#x27;t change their quality of their products - all are natural and organic and work great.</li>
            <li> I believe this shampoo and conditioner does work. It is a little pepperminty, and leaves your scalp feeling tingly and clean.</li>
            <li> Update:  I have used this product for about a month and it is still working very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thinning hair and bought this shampoo based on a recommendation. My hair used to move in just a slight breeze however after using this shampoo for a month it feels and looks a lot thicker. My wife has also commented many times that my hair looks and feels much thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few notes: It is a liquid so it is fairly runny like a normal shampoo however it does lather well like a conditioner.  Also, I leave it in during a shower like I would a conditioner and after a couple of minutes it soaks into my hair/head. I don&#x27;t use the conditioner by the same brand since I use this like I would a conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another note: The 2nd ingredient is Biotin compared to most other shampoos which contain a lot of other stuff first. I think that makes this shampoo a much better product then most other choices.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for almost a month now, so far,so good. I have a long/straight hair. It works great with my hair texture. I would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I have been using the shampoo now for about 2 weeks. I see and can feel the difference. It does add body and shine. More height when I style my hair and it stays, does not lose lift like before. Feels good on my scalp, the ingredients are what the hair needs. Minus the Sodium Laureth Sulfate and the many other ingredients your hair does not need and for that matter not good for it. I will buy this again and hopefully find it at my health food store. If not and or price is not as good, then will come back to Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!! I ran across this shampoo after reading about a girl go on and on about it on her blog.  I forgot the name of her blog,  But she stayed faithful to this shampoo. So after stalking her blog until i read every post and noticed how lushious her hair was I took the chance.  And I must say, I love it! I love the tingles I get after i rinse it out and start with the conditoner.  I love this line and MillCreek has a new devoted customer.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for better results from this product.  I don&#x27;t feel like it makes my hair stronger nor does it help with thinning hair. I feel like I have to use a lot more of this shampoo just to get a good lather.  I will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> This shampoo really works for me.  I&#x27;ve used it for several years, and it&#x27;s my favorite.  I don&#x27;t have the itching scalp that I have with most shampoos.</li>
            <li> Having used this for about three weeks, I agree with the observation that it lathers poorly. But my hair is noticeably thicker and possibly stronger. I&#x27;m actually enjoying wearing my usual 4-week cut into the sixth week and my hair is only just now looking a little ragged. That makes this the only &amp;#34;hair product&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve used that&#x27;s ever made thin hair look stronger and fuller. Sounds like an ad ... okay, but is seems to make a real difference.  One star off for poor lather - shrug. I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> Mill Creek Botanicals Biotin Shampoo does not contains any sodium laurel sulfate, parabens, or artificial colors, BUT it does contain sodium myreth sulfate, octyl dimethyl PABA, potassium sorbate, and botanical fragrance. It cleans well, but you need to use a little bit more each time than with a normal lathering shampoo. It has a nice mild peppermint smell, but it&#x27;s not so strong that you smell like a candy cane. I have bad allergies and can not use any products with lavender or fragrance (parfum). Even though this has botanical fragrance, it does not bother my allergies.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo even while pregnant the smell never bothered me. The shampoo did a good job without being that expensive.</li>
            <li> I like the smell, but this shampoo really dried out my hair and didn&#x27;t seem to have any noticeable effects on my hair. If anything, I noticed that my hair started falling out MORE when I switched to this brand after Nexus biotin shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love Mill Creek products and I&#x27;ve tried many of them - I get them at my local TJ Maxx for $5.99.&lt;br /&gt;However, this is the first time I&#x27;ve been disappointed with a product from Mill Creek. I tried the biotin shampoo with the matching conditioner and it not only made me hair dry, but I also experienced a huge amount of hair loss - like a scary amount of hair loss! I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was the shampoo, so I stopped using it for a while, and switched back to the Mill Creek Keratin shampoo and conditioner and I noticed right away my hair was smoother and there wasn&#x27;t as much hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still wasn&#x27;t sure if it was the biotin shampoo causing the hair loss...so a few days later, I decided to try it again - and once again, I experienced an abnormal amount of hair loss + I noticed patches of dandruff (which I used Apple Cider Vinegar to get rid of). By now I am pretty certain that it is this shampoo that is causing the excessive hair loss...which is ironic because this is a biotin shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mill Creek has great products but for people with thinning hair...this biotin shampoo may not be the best option. If you notice excessive hair loss - stop using this!</li>
            <li> Was looking for a sulfate free shampoo to try, found this at my local TJ Maxx at a great price. LOVE the scent! So clean but not fruity or flowery. It&#x27;s been only a week but I really love it so far. I am mid-30&#x27;s with thick, fine, curly hair--can only wash every other day or my scalp gets angry and flaky. That can be a challenge with curly hair because you use a lot of product to hold the curl. This shampoo doesn&#x27;t suds a lot so I find that I use more then my other shampoos, but they give you a generous amount in the bottle. Will definitely purchase again. I read the other reviews about helping with hair loss and am excited about that because I do notice my hair in the drain much more as I age.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  It smells nice and works well.  I feel like I&#x27;ve noticed a definite difference with the amount of hair loss since I started using this.  I will continue to buy this and recommend to friends.  I just wish their conditioner worked as well.</li>
            <li> I feel that milkcreek -biotin shampoo has great effectiveness on my hair.i am glad that I was able to find something can nourish my scalp&amp; hair ,very evident  the healthier look of hair!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shampoo.  It&#x27;s mint.  Seems to foam ok, hair feels clean.  Nothing special for my hair and local water, but then again I just wanted to try something different.  This is different and good.</li>
            <li> This product is a 16 oz size, for around $5 in cost. That&#x27;s pretty good. It was both perky and sensitive to my colored treated hair. No harsh chemicals or parabens either, so no worries about buildup issues. It&#x27;s organic. My hair &amp;#34;soaped up&amp;#34; well enough to clean the styling product &amp; any dirt/pollutants out very well, without any harming effects. The touch of mint was noticeable and did leave the hair with a overall re freshened feeling. Every shampoo should do that, but this one DOES do it. I&#x27;ll buy again &amp; can&#x27;t wait to try try the conditioner!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thick texture and it does make my hair &amp;#34;appear&amp;#34; thicker.  I use this along with their conditioner.  The pricing is good.  Most organic/natural shampoo makes my scalp itchy, but this does not.</li>
            <li> Was recommended by my sister and although it does help with hair loss I personally do not care too much for how my hair feels like afterwards.  I use it twice a week.  I am glad that it does help with the hair loss.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before from a Health Food Store.  It gives your hair volume and a very clean feeling to your head.  I do recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Early twenties noticed shower strainer would barely drain because of hair after every shower.  Began researching.  Tried keratin with no noticeable difference.  Found studies out of Sweden on biotin(B7) preventing a type of plaque formation in the capillaries supplying hair follicles with nutrients(theorized to cause the follicle cells to die causing the hair loss).  Local health food store had this on its shelf for about the price of \\&quot;regular\\&quot; shampoo.  After 3 1/2 days of usage.  Astonishingly no hair on strainer.  Found if the shampoo listed biotin as an ingredient no matter the brand, it had same affect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually settled on Millcreek biotin shampoo as it was competitively priced with other positive ingredients.  Ran out a couple of times so reverted to non biotin.  3-4 days strainer began to be covered.  So made trip back to health food store to purchase.  3-4 days no hair in strainer.  About 5 years after use was in doctors office for upper respiratory involvement and related my experience as I was curious for his opinion.  Was told it was a 7 year cycle and the biotin had no affect on the hair loss.  So when I ran out began using the regular stuff and 3-4 days strainer covered again.  Back to the health food store for more.  After another 4-5 years was in a completely different doctor&#x27;s office so related my experience and word for word he informed me the same 7 year cycle verbatim.  Now, forty years after initial usage and am still using with full head of hair with most male relatives having very little hair left. Seems to help the skin(and associated hair) as well so use as body wash too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Began using shampoo containing biotin in early twenties, 40 years ago, wow, and MillCreek for about the last 30-35 of those.  Also take a supplement which either seems to prevent the hair loss.  Initially once the biotin supplement(oral) was available locally even in a multi or B sup any amt. would suffice.  About 3 years ago had been taking 300-1000mcgs. and noticed a small amt. of hair collected on strainer so upped dose to about 3000 mcgs. and it stopped.  Now there is 5000-10,000 mcgs. available.  Continued with the Millcreek all during this time although others have worked when it was not available.  It might be noted that the plaque formation prevention in capillaries by biotin has been reported through studies/research to have a similar effect on other tissues.</li>
            <li> I have very dry brittle hair, and some shampoos only make the situation worse. But this shampoo is amazing! It cleans my hair, but does not strip everything out of it. It also helps to improve the quality of my hair. Since I&#x27;ve started using it my hair has been less dry and brittle throughout the day. Also it has added thickness and length to my hair since I&#x27;ve started using it. I will continue to use this shampoo forever.</li>
            <li> I use Body Deli&#x27;s \\&quot;living greens\\&quot; shampoo which works well (less shedding) but isnt strong enough for oily hair and it costs $28 USD per bottle. I wanted a cheaper alternative that I could use every other day. Never heard of Mill Creek but the ingredients list was pretty healthy so I ordered a bottle and was impressed with the delicious peppermint smell and rich lather. Since peppermint oil is the third ingredient listed ... it can dry out your hair as most essential oils are drying. Also contains sulfate (not SLS though) and PABA so this isnt perfect but it&#x27;s much better 4U than \\&quot;Yes To Carrots\\&quot;/Pantene/VO5/Mane And Tail. I switched my pop from \\&quot;Yes To Carrots\\&quot; to Mill Creek Biotin shampoo too. Gave it 5 stars despite chemicals cuz it cleans well and far less toxic than more $$$ shampoos.</li>
            <li> I have not tried this product yet. I would have not bought it if I did not think it would help.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd time I have ordered this product and it works wonderful.  My head feels clean when I use this shampoo and it seem to me that my hair is not breaking as much as with my other shampoo.  But I love the way my head and hair feel after I shampoo my hair.  I cannot put it in words my hair and head feel clean and I would recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Loved it, will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> great shampoo, makes hair stronger and fuller,</li>
            <li> I bought this in hopes of healthier growing hair, but it is super drying. My hair feels disgusting, not soft and bouncy. If you are going to use this product you ABSOLUTELY must use a moisturizing conditioner. I used it twice and had to condition my hair a couple times for it to return soft. At the time I had natural kinky curly hair so you can imagine how bad that can be for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have to wash my hair twice...to feel clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works ok, I guess but is not a great value at almost $9 a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice it did not produce a build up like other shampoos have done to my hair/head.</li>
            <li> This is a good product if you just want a clean rinse and a natural product. It works a bit like the Wen system does but with slightly less conditioning, and it&#x27;s also way cheaper. (it smells a bit like Wen, too)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began using it for its claim to protect thin hair/hair loss. If you want something for this reason, you might be better off looking elsewhere. It didn&#x27;t reduce any shedding or hair loss, but it didn&#x27;t increase it either. It just acted like any other shampoo for thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product as a natural option for shampoo, but don&#x27;t expect a miracle. It&#x27;s just a nice shampoo.</li>
            <li> My scalp and hair feel great!  I don&#x27;t get that itchy allergic feeling I get with other shampoos... My scalp gets a tingly fresh minty feeling after washing with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like it, this product didn&#x27;t do anything for my hairloss</li>
            <li> I have been using their shampoo and conditioner for over ten years and my hair looks great, amazed that they have been able to maintain such a low price for as long as they have...dont go raising it now :-)</li>
            <li> I really love this product getting ready to order another one</li>
            <li> This product cleanse my hair very well!</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for the past one month. In the first two weeks, I felt my hair is shiny and looking healthy. But now I see I am losing more hair than before. So, going to continue to use it as body wash.</li>
            <li> Smells better than expected. Lathers better than expected. Was supposed to make my hair thicker and &amp;#34;healthier.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about 6 months and haven&#x27;t noticed any positive results in comparison to regular brand-name shampoos such as Suave or Head &amp; Shoulders.</li>
            <li> Did not work for hair loss or hair growth, made my hair tangle badly.</li>
            <li> I ended up giving this to my husband as I couldn&#x27;t get it to lather in my hair. His hair is much shorter and didn&#x27;t seem to bother him as much. The smell is great however!</li>
            <li> I got this product on a recommendation from a cosmetologist stating that it would make my hair more healthy.  I really didn&#x27;t know it wasn&#x27;t very healthy but I took her advice and up to now haven&#x27;t seen much difference.  Not a big deal; I wasn&#x27;t expecting to see anything remarkable and it works like shampoo should work.</li>
            <li> When my hair began to thin I searched for corrective measures to rejuvenate my scalp.  One of my choices is B vitamins, both internally and in my shampoo and conditioner.  Mill Creek is shown to have a higher Biotin (B vitamin) content than any other brand.  My hair is now growing in twice as thick.</li>
            <li> This stuff is flippin&#x27; awesome!!! I am 23 yrs old and for the past year and half my hair has been losing volume due to some hormonal imbalance. I have been taking biotin pills on and off for the past yr and it has helped a lot. But i have also been on the look out for a good shampoo. This one is perfect!!!! It helps clean my itchy scalp really well (i tried a bunch of dandruff shampoos that didn&#x27;t help before) and after 3 or 4 washes, my hair has been way fuller, shinier, and my curls are more defined. It is pretty good at lathering up.&lt;br /&gt;Plus it smells minty and refreshing and doesn&#x27;t contain any drying sulfates!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;give it a try! i bought mine for like 7 or 8 bucks at my local gnc store.</li>
            <li> MillCreek Biotin Shampoo is a very good product it lathered and smelled great and it cleaned my hair and scalp well, this product is  definitely a good value for your money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> The shampoo has a lovely smell of mint and is soothing to my scalp.  I feel as though my hair has strengthen and grown since using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Ok first off, this was for my wife so ill try and write whatever she thought about it. She had a problem with her hair drying up too much and started using this shampoo, and it seems to be making a difference for sure since she has not complained about it ever since. also i have used it myself and i have to say it made my hair feel silkier for sure. So as far as her main concern was , this product has certainly delivered...</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the conditioner also.  A great product - will order again.  It came quicly and it was just as described.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works very well with my hair. My hair doesn&#x27;t tangle or dry out after using it. I was at one point having a lot of shedding but it has stopped. I like the tingling sensation you get from this product. It makes your scalp feel clean,calm and refreshed.I am very pleased with this product and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> The product is ok. I have had better shampoos in the past that seem to have more the \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; factor. I believe this is due to the peppermint oil in the product. I was actually looking for a product with more of a tingle factor (this helps bring bloodflow to the scalp and promote healthy hair growth).</li>
            <li> I first used this product in the 1970&#x27;s when I was very sensitive to smells and chemicals.  I had absolutely no reaction to it and it worked very well indeed as my hair had started to thin and after a few weeks, it started to come in again.  I am now 77 years old and have used it ever since.  I also use the Biotin Conditioner which works equally well.  I highly recommend  them both.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo. My only issue with it is you need a lot of it in order to lather. Mind you my hair is not long nor is it thick (hence the biotin shampoo). But, I will deal with this unless I find another organic shampoo to use. But for now, I&#x27;m sticking with it. My hair has been nice and shiny since I started using it. I had an excessive amount of postpartum hair loss and was trying to find something gentle on my hair that would improve it&#x27;s health and thickness. Whether this is helping I&#x27;m not sure. I&#x27;m also taking Biotin and prenatal vitamins still, but it&#x27;s definitely not hurting.</li>
            <li> purchased for son ....good price</li>
            <li> I will use this as my new shampoo from now on. It doesn&#x27;t leather as you would think, but just add more.</li>
            <li> the first time i used this, i literally had no hair loss afterwards whatsoever! It got oily the next day, though, so I decided to use more product the next time. After using this shampoo for the second time, I did notice some hairs falling, but it was still less than usual, and it was normal. My hair felt less soft and shiny than usual, and I was still okay with that, since I can always use more conditioner or put oil on it, etc...but then I started feeling that my scalp hurts whenever I play with my hair or part it or do anything with it... that was a turn off for me... I will continue to use it and update my review later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is an update... It made my hair super dry at the ends, and super oily at the roots (I use their conditioner too). I tried to use it in many different ways, but the results are the same. I&#x27;m just gonna use it as soap :( .... if anyone finds a good organic shampoo. please share the info!</li>
            <li> Love these products great clarity and excellent features for tge outstanding ptice this was exactly what i odered and expected</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with receiving my product in such a timely manner.  However, the package was delivered in a stuffed box but the shampoo bottle had duct tape on the top to keep closed and after removing the tape on each side of the top i removed the top and the bottle did not have a seal.  It did not appear to be a new bottle of shampoo like the bottle of conditioner i received.  Which was plastic wrapped tightly and the bottle sealed.  So i was very dissatisfied with the condition of my bottle of shampoo that i received.  I am very hesitant to even use that bottle of shampoo since it was not sealed.</li>
            <li> I was losing a lot of hair each time I shampooed and before I started using this shampoo. I researched shampoos and came across this one that has amino acids and other nutrients for hair and decided to try it. My hair loss stopped when I was using this shampoo. Now I am a dedicated user and do not want to run out.</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago my hair was like wet spaghetti.  Just stringy with no body and what appeared to be a bald spot forming in the front.  I finally tried this shampoo and conditioner and today (a bottle and a half later)my hair is full of body and the bald spot is filling in.  I use the shampoo and the accompanying conditioner.  Once a week, I also condition my hair with argan oil.</li>
            <li> I alternate this shampoo with Regenepure DR. I love both shampoos, I especially love this shampoo because Biotin is listed as the second active ingredient! It makes my hair more full and manageable throughout any given day</li>
            <li> I found it did not do what it purported to do which was give it moisture and volume.  I have fine hair, but a lot of it and I have searched and searched and searched to find the right shampoo.  This is not it.  Sorry to say,.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo, has a minty smell but not too strong lightweight on the hair and feels nice, I like it</li>
            <li> I am african american/american indian/white. I purchased this because of the reviews after suffering a medical condition, I lost a lot of hair; it broke off from the root and broke off in small pieces. My doctor said I &amp;#34;broke the hair growth cycle.&amp;#34; I lost about 4 inches of hair on one side of my hair, which is normally mid-back length.  It took about 3 washes (once/week) for my hair to stop breaking and shedding.  After 5 weeks, my hair is back on track again.  I am growing it out natural now, and keeping the permed hair, and trim it myself.  My goalnow is lower back length...I also use Moroccanoil products right after this shampoo because it can make my hair feel dry and stripped, but the Moroccanoil products puts all the moisture and life back into it right away.  I have made this part of my hair care regimen.</li>
            <li> After a  week or so i could feel a difference. Thicker hair. I use it every other day. Will Buy More.</li>
            <li> This shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather up but smells minty and I have noticed that my hair has been healthier and is has grown quite a bit.</li>
            <li> My hair likes this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for just over two weeks. Works great, doesn&#x27;t lather as much as some other shampoos, but I like it.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair, with some gray. This shampoo cleaned my hair, but left it frizzy.  I did not see any increase in shine.</li>
            <li> I searched for a GOOD, organic and natural biotin-containing shampoo, and this is what I bought. I take biotin (geltabs) internally (5k mcg per day), and &#x27;you are what you eat&#x27;, so a diet high in protein with biotin supplements has given me glorious hair... thick and curly and long and strong... BUT I wanted a shampoo to really up the ante and give me the softest, most luxurious hair ever, because I&#x27;m going to donate all 20 inches of it in March!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo itself is rather gel-like; you only need a little bit, it goes a long way. It smells marvelous and feels great on the hair. Rinses very clean. My hair is shiny and soft, and knowing there is biotin in it makes me very happy! It is a GREAT price and a huge bottle, too! I only shampoo twice a week, so we&#x27;ll see how it goes - but so far I am quite impressed, with the texture, the ingredients, the price, the feel and smell, and the results.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo I have ever used.  I will continue to order it.  I love the way it leaves my hair and it is gentle on my scalp.</li>
            <li> i loved my shampoo and it came fast it really helps your hair grow too</li>
            <li> All natural leaves my hair clean and soft</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like product, very drying on my hair</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo! Lathers beautifully and doesn&#x27;t strip my color!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for over twenty years and never felt let down.  This is a first class product for those of us with sensitive scalps.  You can&#x27;t beat this stuff!</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a nice subtle minty scent and cleanses well... almost too well. So make sure you follow up this shampoo with the conditioner or you will have dry hard to manage hair. I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my hair&#x27;s condition after several weeks of use. This shampoo is not bad just ok.</li>
            <li> Good quality shampoo. .. makes my hair thicker and shinier.</li>
            <li> My daughter has eczema, this shampoo is gentle on her skin n hair</li>
            <li> foams up nice with just a drop works great this is the best one</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo with the recommendation of someone who uses Biotin shampoo all the time with much satisfaction, but I am unhappy with this particular brand because it is too watery and I need much more of the product to get a good clean feel.  It seems that I always have to wash my hair twice and on the second shampoo it will lather up like most shampoos do on only one wash.  Will try another brand next time.&lt;br /&gt;I did write to the manufacturer per above.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a month now. I can certainly see a difference! My hair is fuller, is more manageable, and feels clean. I bought this because of a receding hairline. It has helped! Although, I can pick this up at VitaminShoppe in northwest Indiana for about $7 a bottle.</li>
