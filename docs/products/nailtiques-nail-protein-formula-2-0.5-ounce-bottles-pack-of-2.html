            <li>It is nice to have healthy looking nails.</li>
            <li>My nails have never been as strong as they are now!</li>
            <li>I began using it, and my nails grew out very strong and healthy.</li>
            <li>, I use it every night and now I have nails that look better than the acrylic nails.  </li>
            <li>Great, really works</li>
            <li>It is better to take 0.5 oz bottle.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I have had SO many people ask me where I get my nails done.</li>

            <li>I am pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>Hoping that it provides more strength to my nails as I continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve told so many people about Nailtiques</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I use two coats, and top off when it needs it and sometimes remove and start over altogether.  </li>
            <li>Love this product for my nails - use it all the time.</li>

            <li>So once again it&#x27;s something that I love.</li>

            <li>I am so pleased with this product and will never use anything else.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Very worth the cost for someone wanting to have nice nails.</li>
            <li>They look too good to be real!</li>
            <li>Love it makes nails strong and not chip.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery &amp; good price.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I am happy with both the seller and the product and will most likely continue purchasing items from this seller.</li>
            <li>My nails are strong &amp; chip &amp; peel resistant, &amp; seem to grow faster too.  </li>
            <li>My nails are so strong.  </li>
            <li>works!Its the first time in my life I have ever had my own nails.</li>
            <li>Now, my nails are fine</li>
            <li>Nails worthy of polish!</li>
            <li>Product delivered quickly!  </li>
            <li>Have been using this product on my nails and they have never been in such great shape.</li>
            <li>Worth trying, I recommend and it it as presents for friends!</li>
            <li>It is worth the money!  </li>
            <li>It makes my nails grow quick, it stops the peeling and makes them super strong.</li>
            <li>My nails have improved greatly in just a couple of weeks of using it - they were very dry and layering before.  </li>
            <li>My favorite thing about this polish is that it works fast.</li>
            <li>So far this product seems to be working pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Adding a few drops of Formula Fix thins the nail hardener and you&#x27;re good to go!)</li>
            <li>It does strengthen the nails and looks fresh and clean if used alone.  </li>
            <li>Also dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t damage nails.  </li>
            <li>I originally found this at a beauty supply store, when I noticed the clerks nails and how pretty they were.</li>
            <li>My nails are not only longer, but strong and healthy.</li>
            <li>I will recommend this product to others, just as it was strongly recommended to me, and will order more when I run low.</li>
            <li>I really find it hard to believe but it is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>it is worth the difference in price.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price....</li>
            <li>After your nails get to the point you feel like they are strong enough, I&#x27;d suggest backing off to every other day, because eventually your nails will become very brittle and will break in very unusual ways - sometimes a perfect square shape will chip off the edge of one of my nails.</li>
            <li>Makes my nails healthy and strong, they always grow long</li>
            <li>My nails are growing nice and long and are stronger also.  </li>
            <li>It is nowhere near as good as 3, it&#x27;s peels within the same day</li>
            <li>Price is also very reasonable.</li>
            <li>It could be wear without nail polish , glossy unpainted nails look pretty.  </li>
            <li>It was pretty pricey to learn this.</li>
            <li>I turned to amazon and found what I believed to be the exact product.</li>
            <li>If you are purchasing it for the first time, buy it in the kit with the FORMULA FIX.</li>
            <li>Wish I had just gone with this one first -</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s the first coat, you can literally wash dishes 1 minute after applying the polish.  </li>
            <li>You will see results after the first week of using it.</li>
            <li>one more coat of this and my nails last almost two weeks without chipping.  </li>
            <li>The tips are a beautiful white &amp; it looks like a french manicure, just with a clear coat of protein.  </li>
            <li>Also, a coat of Nailtiques dries much faster than regular polish, so it&#x27;s more convenient.  </li>
            <li>I have used it ever since (for 15 years), and my nails look so good, that most people think they are fake.</li>
            <li>They are healthy and long.</li>
            <li>They are sturdy and I love having long nails!</li>
            <li>Suddenly, I had NAILS - nice, long, pretty nails!</li>
            <li>Great if you have weak nails and need to strengthen them....</li>
            <li>My nails were a mess and would crack and split, I started using Shellac and liked it, but after awhile it was ruining my nails.  </li>
            <li>so I need my nails to look decent!</li>
            <li>A bit pricey but works very well.</li>
            <li>I have my whole family hooked</li>
            <li>This is really works.</li>
            <li>fast delivery.</li>
            <li>When I tell them they are MY REAL nails, they do not believe me.</li>
            <li>It really does work.  </li>
            <li>It really works to strengthen nails that start to split.  </li>
            <li>This product really works.  </li>
            <li>I was ready to give up, but while visiting my daughter we went to a beauty supply store and the sales girl recommended this</li>
            <li>This product has worked very well for me.</li>
            <li>My nails really are stronger.</li>
            <li>This stuff has really helped my nails be stronger and stop peeling.  </li>
            <li>Nails are as strong and long as the Acrylics were.  </li>
            <li>Its important not to over use this product because it can dry out your nails</li>
            <li>I love this product and would give ten stars if possible!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>they 1.) are not pretty and 2.) tend to break easily.  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>It states in the instructions that it is not healthy to push back the cuticle, as it plays an important role in protecting the health of the nail, and that would appear to be true.</li>
            <li>I have tried every polish on the market, and nailtiques has been the only one that really works!  </li>
            <li>I have always had soft and peeling nails.  </li>
            <li>Take off old weekly &amp; re-apply.  </li>
            <li>, so I&#x27;m hoping that the formula hasn&#x27;t, so far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it is basically the same thing if not exactly the same thing, but the picture posted did not match the packaging of what was sent to me.</li>
            <li>I put it on my nails every other day and then start fresh every week.</li>
            <li>I was trying to find the exact product I had run out of and the store in my area that carried it had closed.</li>
            <li>My own nails are peeling worse than ever since I&#x27;ve been using it, and the polish does not last longer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Nailtique for many years and it is the only nail strengthener, when used frequently, that improves my weak splitting nails.</li>
            <li>My nails are much stronger and much healthier looking since I have been using Nailtiques for the past six months.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m nearly 50 and have kept my nails fairly short because when they do grow out they have no curvature, so</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for more than a month now and haven&#x27;t had a broken nail since I started using it.  </li>
            <li>If you use it properly and faithfully, your nails should be strong and hard.  </li>
            <li>Finally I found solution for weak &amp; easy breaking nails.</li>
            <li>I have always had nails that are thin &amp; break or tear easily</li>
            <li>This is the only product that has ever worked for my thin  and easily torn nails.  </li>
            <li>I had acrylic nails for several months and after letting my nails &amp;#34; rest&amp;#34; without them the last time, my nails were staying very soft and not growing due to peeling and breaking.  </li>

            <li> It makes my nails grow quick, it stops the peeling and makes them super strong.</li>
            <li> My nails have improved greatly in just a couple of weeks of using it - they were very dry and layering before.  </li>
            <li> My favorite thing about this polish is that it works fast.</li>
            <li> So far this product seems to be working pretty good.  </li>
            <li> Adding a few drops of Formula Fix thins the nail hardener and you&#x27;re good to go!)</li>
            <li> It does strengthen the nails and looks fresh and clean if used alone.  </li>
            <li> Also dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t damage nails.  </li>
            <li> I originally found this at a beauty supply store, when I noticed the clerks nails and how pretty they were.</li>
            <li> My nails are not only longer, but strong and healthy.</li>
            <li> I will recommend this product to others, just as it was strongly recommended to me, and will order more when I run low.</li>
            <li> I really find it hard to believe but it is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> it is worth the difference in price.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price....</li>
            <li> After your nails get to the point you feel like they are strong enough, I&#x27;d suggest backing off to every other day, because eventually your nails will become very brittle and will break in very unusual ways - sometimes a perfect square shape will chip off the edge of one of my nails.</li>
            <li> Makes my nails healthy and strong, they always grow long</li>
            <li> My nails are growing nice and long and are stronger also.  </li>
            <li> It is nowhere near as good as 3, it&#x27;s peels within the same day</li>
            <li> Price is also very reasonable.</li>
            <li> It could be wear without nail polish , glossy unpainted nails look pretty.  </li>
            <li> It was pretty pricey to learn this.</li>
            <li> I turned to amazon and found what I believed to be the exact product.</li>
            <li> If you are purchasing it for the first time, buy it in the kit with the FORMULA FIX.</li>
            <li> Wish I had just gone with this one first -</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s the first coat, you can literally wash dishes 1 minute after applying the polish.  </li>
            <li> You will see results after the first week of using it.</li>
            <li> one more coat of this and my nails last almost two weeks without chipping.  </li>
            <li> The tips are a beautiful white &amp; it looks like a french manicure, just with a clear coat of protein.  </li>
            <li> Also, a coat of Nailtiques dries much faster than regular polish, so it&#x27;s more convenient.  </li>
            <li> I have used it ever since (for 15 years), and my nails look so good, that most people think they are fake.</li>
            <li> They are healthy and long.</li>
            <li> They are sturdy and I love having long nails!</li>
            <li> Suddenly, I had NAILS - nice, long, pretty nails!</li>
            <li> Great if you have weak nails and need to strengthen them....</li>
            <li> My nails were a mess and would crack and split, I started using Shellac and liked it, but after awhile it was ruining my nails.  </li>
            <li> so I need my nails to look decent!</li>
            <li> A bit pricey but works very well.</li>
            <li> I have my whole family hooked</li>
            <li> This is really works.</li>
            <li> fast delivery.</li>
            <li> When I tell them they are MY REAL nails, they do not believe me.</li>
            <li> It really does work.  </li>
            <li> It really works to strengthen nails that start to split.  </li>
            <li> This product really works.  </li>
            <li> I was ready to give up, but while visiting my daughter we went to a beauty supply store and the sales girl recommended this</li>
            <li> This product has worked very well for me.</li>
            <li> My nails really are stronger.</li>
            <li> This stuff has really helped my nails be stronger and stop peeling.  </li>
            <li> Nails are as strong and long as the Acrylics were.  </li>
            <li> Its important not to over use this product because it can dry out your nails</li>
            <li> I love this product and would give ten stars if possible!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> they 1.) are not pretty and 2.) tend to break easily.  </li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> It states in the instructions that it is not healthy to push back the cuticle, as it plays an important role in protecting the health of the nail, and that would appear to be true.</li>
            <li> I have tried every polish on the market, and nailtiques has been the only one that really works!  </li>
            <li> I have always had soft and peeling nails.  </li>
            <li> Take off old weekly &amp; re-apply.  </li>
            <li> , so I&#x27;m hoping that the formula hasn&#x27;t, so far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it is basically the same thing if not exactly the same thing, but the picture posted did not match the packaging of what was sent to me.</li>
            <li> I put it on my nails every other day and then start fresh every week.</li>
            <li> I was trying to find the exact product I had run out of and the store in my area that carried it had closed.</li>
            <li> My own nails are peeling worse than ever since I&#x27;ve been using it, and the polish does not last longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Nailtique for many years and it is the only nail strengthener, when used frequently, that improves my weak splitting nails.</li>
            <li> My nails are much stronger and much healthier looking since I have been using Nailtiques for the past six months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m nearly 50 and have kept my nails fairly short because when they do grow out they have no curvature, so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for more than a month now and haven&#x27;t had a broken nail since I started using it.  </li>
            <li> If you use it properly and faithfully, your nails should be strong and hard.  </li>
            <li> Finally I found solution for weak &amp; easy breaking nails.</li>
            <li> I have always had nails that are thin &amp; break or tear easily</li>
            <li> This is the only product that has ever worked for my thin  and easily torn nails.  </li>
            <li> I had acrylic nails for several months and after letting my nails &amp;#34; rest&amp;#34; without them the last time, my nails were staying very soft and not growing due to peeling and breaking.  </li>
            <li> DO NOT waste your money on other products</li>
            <li> After having no chip manicures for years, my nails were weak and cut super short.</li>
            <li> Made the mistake of confusing Nailtiques with its competitor with a very similar name and packaging and purchased that one (Nailtek) first.</li>
            <li> But it really does make my nails stronger and no more splitting.</li>
            <li> All the little tears and such are completely gone.</li>
            <li> I have never had long nail.  </li>
            <li> Also lasts long.  </li>
            <li> I am using the Nailtiques at the bottom of the bottle and it is really has gotten too thick.</li>
            <li> You do need to use daily, or every other day, or benefits go away.  </li>
            <li> Transforms weak or splitting nails into strong, hard nails.  </li>
            <li> My first couple of bottles I got from that store but later found they were unable to stay stocked.  </li>
            <li> Like, I&#x27;ve slacked up over the last few years, with keeping my nails up, but no matter how long I neglect my nails, as soon as I get back on track with Nailtiques, I immediately see results, like within a week, maybe a half.</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve tried nail hardeners and polishes promising to strengthen my weak, brittle nails.  </li>
            <li> Far less expensive than CVS with fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I had acrylic nails removed so my own nails were very thin and weak.  </li>
            <li> It dries in one minute and after about three week of everyday using you will definitely see how you nails will improve.</li>
            <li> Have been using the Nailtiques for about 10 days and already see improvement - nails are harder and growing again.</li>
            <li> I have to file my nails down because they get so long.  </li>
            <li> For some reason my nails have become soft and peeling over the past few months...</li>
            <li> and now I use it about every other day.  </li>
            <li> It stays on longer than other products as I go to water aerobics classes and other activity classes.</li>
            <li> This product work extremely well.</li>
            <li> Applying nail polish means at least 10 minutes of not touching anything - not exactly the lifestyle I live.  </li>
            <li> so I use it as a base coat and a top coat.  </li>
            <li> But when I backed off a little to once every other day or once per 3 days, the brittleness disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This happens when you use approximately half of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Helped as a base coat but did not add as much strengthener as I had expected after using for several weeks.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, I ran out and have tried several other, less expensive products since with poor results, so I&#x27;m going to FINALLY purchase some more and try to re-revive my poor, battered nails...</li>
            <li> My entire life, I&#x27;ve had very flat nails which are impossible to grow long.  </li>
            <li> This is the only brand of nail hardener that works for my weak nails.</li>
            <li> It has a few drawbacks.  </li>
            <li> I had acrylic nails removed and my nails were short and broken (below the skil level)  </li>
            <li> and they have always grown unevenly.</li>
            <li> It has been an unusually harsh winter, and my nails don&#x27;t even look or feel like my nails.  </li>
            <li> If your nails are thin and fragile, BEGIN WITH FORMULA 2 PLUS.</li>
            <li> I work with the public and cannot wear colored nail polish or have false nails</li>
            <li> I had the worse nails after 2 months I was  seeing improvements I got long nails again.</li>
            <li> My manicure usually lasts a week without chipping or fading, and then I remove it all and start over.</li>
            <li> I personally have very thin brittle nails.</li>
            <li> (Formula Fix is used when the protein in Nalitiques gets thick.</li>
            <li> Frustrating to say the least.</li>
            <li> Even though my nails are no longer splitting or weak, I continue to use this product because \\&quot;if</li>
            <li> I was having problems with weak and peeling nails.  </li>
            <li> If your nails are weak or splitting, apply one coat a day for a week.  </li>
            <li> and after I stopped, my mom ordered some OPI Nail Envy for Weak, Thin Nails for me(since</li>
            <li> So I was a bit skeptical about purchasing the Nailtiques Nail Protein Formula.  </li>
            <li> My nails were in really bad shape.  </li>
            <li> I had almost resigned myself to living with ugly nails (ever since I began a program of water exercise)</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed if you try this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years, as a base coat or alone reapplying layers if my be nails</li>
            <li> use nailtique as base.  </li>
            <li> my nails were pathetic).</li>

            <li> My nails have improved greatly in just a couple of weeks of using it - they were very dry and layering before.  It has a few drawbacks.  It peels sometimes so you have to keep it up and redo it.  I do my edges almost every day, but it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> Love it makes nails strong and not chip.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Transforms weak or splitting nails into strong, hard nails.  Even manicurists ask what I use.  Dries instantly and shines like nail polish.  No need to polish again.</li>
            <li> This product works like a charm. My nails no longer chip or split. They are sturdy and I love having long nails!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  I have the strongest, longest nails ever.  Even though my nails are no longer splitting or weak, I continue to use this product because \\&quot;if it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I had acrylic nails removed and my nails were short and broken (below the skil level)  I couldn&#x27;t grow any nail, so my daughter found this product on amazon.  It is great, I use it every night and now I have nails that look better than the acrylic nails.  Great, really works, I never thought I would be able to have nice nails ever.  I&#x27;m actually filing length off them.</li>
            <li> Good price for this product which I have used for almost 20 years. Far less expensive than CVS with fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Finally I found solution for weak &amp; easy breaking nails. This is really works. It dries in one minute and after about three week of everyday using you will definitely see how you nails will improve. It could be wear without nail polish , glossy unpainted nails look pretty.  It is better to take 0.5 oz bottle. Price is also very reasonable. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. It works!!! Will order it again. fast delivery.</li>
            <li> This product was supposed to be a great base coat for nails -  and would strengthen nails and have the polish last longer. My own nails are peeling worse than ever since I&#x27;ve been using it, and the polish does not last longer. It was pretty pricey to learn this. I will not reorder.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Nailtique for many years and it is the only nail strengthener, when used frequently, that improves my weak splitting nails.</li>
            <li> I was having problems with weak and peeling nails.  My sister told me about his product and I love it.  I used it daily for about 4-6 weeks and now I use it about every other day.  My nails are in great shape.  I have also had many comments about how great my nails look--professionally manicured, and all I use it this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nailtiques for about 10-12 years and I LOVE it!! I have always had nails that are thin &amp; break or tear easily and they have always grown unevenly. Once I started using this product, my nails have looked GREAT. I have had SO many people ask me where I get my nails done. When I tell them they are MY REAL nails, they do not believe me. The tips are a beautiful white &amp; it looks like a french manicure, just with a clear coat of protein.  You will not be disappointed if you try this product. It is FANTASTIC!!!</li>
            <li> Best stuff for real nails....Nailtiques Nail Protein Formula 2, 0.5-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)....Great if you have weak nails and need to strengthen them....</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I was a nail biter for 27+ years and after I stopped, my mom ordered some OPI Nail Envy for Weak, Thin Nails for me(since my nails were pathetic). But the seller was out of stock and sent this and an apology instead. WOW! Suddenly, I had NAILS - nice, long, pretty nails! Nails worthy of polish! Sadly, I ran out and have tried several other, less expensive products since with poor results, so I&#x27;m going to FINALLY purchase some more and try to re-revive my poor, battered nails...</li>
            <li> So far this product seems to be working pretty good.  I have nails that split, crack, and peel.  I work with the public and cannot wear colored nail polish or have false nails so I need my nails to look decent!</li>
            <li> Best product ever for splitting nails!</li>
            <li> My nails are much stronger and much healthier looking since I have been using Nailtiques for the past six months. Prior to using Nailtiques, my fingernails had been peeling and breaking. Also, this was a great price, as compared to purchasing at a nearby spa.</li>
            <li> I have always had soft and peeling nails.  I was told about Nailtiques nail protein and decided to try it.  It is all I was told and more!  It also is cheaper at Amazon than at the hair salon where I was told about it.  I now have nails that look great!</li>
            <li> This is the only brand of nail hardener that works for my weak nails. I have used it for years. No one believes me that I always had breaking short nails.</li>
            <li> This product is the best I&#x27;ve found.  It stays on longer than other products as I go to water aerobics classes and other activity classes. Great product!</li>
            <li> I love nailtiques it is the only product that enables my nail to grow and protects them. Fast delivery &amp; good price. Thank you!</li>
            <li> It has been an unusually harsh winter, and my nails don&#x27;t even look or feel like my nails.  I am pleased with this product.  It does strengthen the nails and looks fresh and clean if used alone.  I have tried numerous Sally Hansen nail products.  I have never had a good experience with those products.  So I was a bit skeptical about purchasing the Nailtiques Nail Protein Formula.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve tried nail hardeners and polishes promising to strengthen my weak, brittle nails.  Finally a product that lives up to its claims.  You do need to use daily, or every other day, or benefits go away.  But it really does make my nails stronger and no more splitting.</li>
            <li> At the same time that I started using this product, I bought a crystal nail file and also started buffing the edges of my nails.  I had almost resigned myself to living with ugly nails (ever since I began a program of water exercise) but now my nails look good.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything on the market to keep my nails from breaking.  This is the only thing I have found that actually works.  Apply 2 coats.  Take off old weekly &amp; re-apply.  Can even apply over colored polish.  It really does work.  Wish I had found it years ago.</li>
            <li> This product work extremely well. I have used this for about 10 years.. Prevents chips and cracks in the nails. Strengthen the nails totally.</li>
            <li> It really works to strengthen nails that start to split.  Have used it periodically for years, as needed.  Just apply once a day on nails.  Also dries quickly.</li>
            <li> This is without a doubt the best nail strengthener that I have ever used.  You need to follow the directions on the bottle and be faithful in applying it, but IT WORKS!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff right here is AWESOME!!! My nails are not only longer, but strong and healthy. I originally found this at a beauty supply store, when I noticed the clerks nails and how pretty they were. She pointed the Nailtiques out to me, and I&#x27;ve loved it ever since.  My first couple of bottles I got from that store but later found they were unable to stay stocked.  I checked out Amazon, and have had no need to look anywhere else.  My favorite thing about this polish is that it works fast. Like, I&#x27;ve slacked up over the last few years, with keeping my nails up, but no matter how long I neglect my nails, as soon as I get back on track with Nailtiques, I immediately see results, like within a week, maybe a half.</li>
            <li> I am 73 years young, and this is the BEST product I ever used to strengthen my nails.  I&#x27;ve used it for more than a month now and haven&#x27;t had a broken nail since I started using it.  My nails have never been as strong as they are now! Thank you Nailtiques!!!</li>
            <li> It protects my fingernails from breakage and chipping and it makes them look as good as any good nail polish.</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC!!!  My nails would not grow for years and this is an AMAZING PRODUCT.  My nails look beautiful.  They are healthy and long.</li>
            <li> Love this product! After having no chip manicures for years, my nails were weak and cut super short. I have been using the product for almost a month and my nails are growing and stronger.</li>
            <li> I liked this product.  Helped as a base coat but did not add as much strengthener as I had expected after using for several weeks.  Hoping that it provides more strength to my nails as I continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that has ever worked for my thin  and easily torn nails.  Dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t damage nails.  Tried knock-offs - can&#x27;t compare - this the best.</li>
            <li> Your nails will grow like never before with this terrific product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 5 years, &amp; each time I see my friend who recommended it to me, I thank her again.  My nails are strong &amp; chip &amp; peel resistant, &amp; seem to grow faster too.  Also, a coat of Nailtiques dries much faster than regular polish, so it&#x27;s more convenient.  I&#x27;ve told so many people about Nailtiques, I&#x27;m like the town crier.  I plan to use it forever.</li>
            <li> Works the best for me.  My daughter also found it was great for her nails.</li>
            <li> Unable to find locally and this fit the bill!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the product as any Nailtiques nail protein is a fantastic product and the best I have ever used. It makes my nails grow quick, it stops the peeling and makes them super strong. The seller over all was good, pack of two did come and within the time frame stated. My issue however is with the picture the seller used. I was trying to find the exact product I had run out of and the store in my area that carried it had closed. I turned to amazon and found what I believed to be the exact product. I&#x27;m sure it is basically the same thing if not exactly the same thing, but the picture posted did not match the packaging of what was sent to me. Seeing as how some consumers use Amazon to find a product by the packaging, I&#x27;m suggesting that this seller match the correct picture or post multiple pictures. Otherwise, I am happy with both the seller and the product and will most likely continue purchasing items from this seller.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. It is the only treatment that actually helps prevent my nails from splitting &amp; breaking. Its important not to over use this product because it can dry out your nails &amp; then they will break, especially at the corners.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with Nailriques bottles is that the brush becomes detached from the lid. The product is very good.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  It works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years, as a base coat or alone reapplying layers if my be nails are especially think and peely.&lt;br /&gt;It seems the bottle design has changed, so I&#x27;m hoping that the formula hasn&#x27;t, so far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;I have found this works the best for me when my nails get brittle and peel, most often in the winter. Worth trying, I recommend and it it as presents for friends!</li>
            <li> This product really works.  My only criticism is that the bottle is a bit too big.  I am using the Nailtiques at the bottom of the bottle and it is really has gotten too thick.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time and have for years.  I have to file my nails down because they get so long.  If you use it properly and faithfully, your nails should be strong and hard.  You can put it on under your regular nail polish, or use it without polish.  I use two coats, and top off when it needs it and sometimes remove and start over altogether.  I love this product and would give ten stars if possible!</li>
            <li> I started out using the Formula 2, but switched to the 2 plus.  My nails were in really bad shape.  I wore acryllic nails for about 10 years until I couldn&#x27;t stand the pain of getting my nails done.  My nails were a mess and would crack and split, I started using Shellac and liked it, but after awhile it was ruining my nails.  I was ready to give up, but while visiting my daughter we went to a beauty supply store and the sales girl recommended this and I am so happy she did.</li>
            <li> Love this product for my nails - use it all the time.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  If used faithfully it will strengthen and beautify nails.  Will keep buying it.  You need to remove it after a week and reapply as necessary</li>
            <li> This stuff works!Its the first time in my life I have ever had my own nails.So once again it&#x27;s something that I love.Good stuff buy it!</li>
            <li> I have used Nailtique for 6 years.  This product helped regrow and strengthen my nails after 22 years of Acrylics.  Nails are as strong and long as the Acrylics were.  Lots of compliments on nails.  I always wear with polish,  use nailtique as base.  I reapply every 4-5 days and my manicure lasts for 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this and a friend and I purchased the two-fer deal. I bought non-acetone polish remover and have been using that with this polish. In the about two weeks since I started using the product, my cuticles look much, much better and my nails seem to be getting healthier. Over-all, this product has made a big difference in the attractiveness of my hands. It states in the instructions that it is not healthy to push back the cuticle, as it plays an important role in protecting the health of the nail, and that would appear to be true. All the little tears and such are completely gone. I will recommend this product to others, just as it was strongly recommended to me, and will order more when I run low.</li>
            <li> This helps keep the polish from chipping</li>
            <li> I am a Nailtiques POWER USER, and LOVE THIS PRODUCT! I bit my nails as a child and teenager, and when I decided to quit, my friend told me about Nailtiques. I began using it, and my nails grew out very strong and healthy. I have used it ever since (for 15 years), and my nails look so good, that most people think they are fake. That tells you how good Nailtiques is! I use it as a basecoat (two coats), and then add color (two coats), and then use it as a topcoat. My manicure usually lasts a week without chipping or fading, and then I remove it all and start over. I am so pleased with this product and will never use anything else. NOTE: If you are purchasing it for the first time, buy it in the kit with the FORMULA FIX. (Formula Fix is used when the protein in Nalitiques gets thick. This happens when you use approximately half of the bottle. Adding a few drops of Formula Fix thins the nail hardener and you&#x27;re good to go!) If your nails are thin and fragile, BEGIN WITH FORMULA 2 PLUS. Use one or two bottles of Plus and then switch to regular Formula 2. Also, when using this product, follow the directions! Make sure you roll the bottle in your hand to mix the protein and warm it a bit. If the product is not mixed properly, you will have problems.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nailtiques Formula 2 for years.  It&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve ever tried that actually strengthens my nails.  I do apply 2 coats of Nailtiques under my nail polish.  My nails have never been naturally good.</li>
            <li> This product has worked very well for me. I had acrylic nails for several months and after letting my nails &amp;#34; rest&amp;#34; without them the last time, my nails were staying very soft and not growing due to peeling and breaking.  After using this product according to the directions for a couple of weeks they started getting stronger, stopped peeling and have begun to grow. I saw it work for my friend and it has worked for me too.</li>
            <li> product well packaged &amp; arrived promptly.  great nail product.</li>
            <li> terrific product. Does not peel off. My nails really are stronger.</li>
            <li> There are three different formulas in this collection for three different nail types. I personally have very thin brittle nails. When I started using this product seven years ago I never turned back! DO NOT waste your money on other products this is a hundred percent guaranteed effective Salon quality product!</li>
            <li> For some reason my nails have become soft and peeling over the past few months...I had to keep clipping them way back because they just kept peeling and tearing off. I had used this product years ago with great results. Made the mistake of confusing Nailtiques with its competitor with a very similar name and packaging and purchased that one (Nailtek) first. Used that one and saw no improvement at all. Have been using the Nailtiques for about 10 days and already see improvement - nails are harder and growing again. Wish I had just gone with this one first - it is worth the difference in price.</li>
            <li> I have been using nailtiques for over 10 years!  If you use it regularly, your nails will repair and grow!  It is worth the money!  I have tried every polish on the market, and nailtiques has been the only one that really works!  It was recommended to me by a nail technician who swore by it.  If your nails are weak or splitting, apply one coat a day for a week.  Now, my nails are fine so I use it as a base coat and a top coat.  It works!  Love it!!</li>
            <li> My entire life, I&#x27;ve had very flat nails which are impossible to grow long.  I&#x27;m nearly 50 and have kept my nails fairly short because when they do grow out they have no curvature, so they 1.) are not pretty and 2.) tend to break easily.  A friend suggested I try this miracle polish.  She told me to apply 1 coat every day for 4 days - then remove and start again.  My response was - you&#x27;ve got to be kidding - one coat per day?  Applying nail polish means at least 10 minutes of not touching anything - not exactly the lifestyle I live.  But this polish is different.  It dries almost instantly.  If it&#x27;s the first coat, you can literally wash dishes 1 minute after applying the polish.  If it is day 4, I&#x27;d wait about 3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somehow - no idea how, this polish changes the curvature of your nail. Every person i know who has tried this says the same thing.  Use it for about 3 weeks - following the 1 coat per day for 4 days then remove and start over.  My nails are so strong.  After your nails get to the point you feel like they are strong enough, I&#x27;d suggest backing off to every other day, because eventually your nails will become very brittle and will break in very unusual ways - sometimes a perfect square shape will chip off the edge of one of my nails. I&#x27;d never had that happen ever.  But when I backed off a little to once every other day or once per 3 days, the brittleness disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product!  Very worth the cost for someone wanting to have nice nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Formula 3 and it was awesome. But after looking at what each formula was for, I decided I needed to try Formula 2. It is nowhere near as good as 3, it&#x27;s peels within the same day I put it on. Frustrating to say the least. I&#x27;m going back to Formula 3.</li>
            <li> If you want beautiful nails, this is the product for you.  Nails won&#x27;t chip, crack or peel if you routinely use this product.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product on my nails and they have never been in such great shape. It works wonders, will never go back to acrylic ever. You will see results after the first week of using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years now and I love it!  Makes my nails healthy and strong, they always grow long and I&#x27;m always complimented on my nails.</li>
            <li> I have never had long nail.  This works wonders.  My nails are growing nice and long and are stronger also.  I really find it hard to believe but it is wonderful.  Also lasts long.  I put on two coats of this then two coats of color then one more coat of this and my nails last almost two weeks without chipping.  Well worth the price....</li>
            <li> Yes, will buy again! This is great for nails. I have them because I use this product. Great to strengthen nails.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  My nails have gotten stronger and they do not split and break.  It is nice to have healthy looking nails.</li>
            <li> This stuff has really helped my nails be stronger and stop peeling.  My nails were constantly breaking and peeling and this product almost immediately improved that.  My nails look healthier, and are longer and stronger than they&#x27;ve ever been.</li>
            <li> Product delivered quickly!  This polish is great for strengthening peeling nails!</li>
            <li> I had acrylic nails removed so my own nails were very thin and weak.  I could soon notice my nails were stronger after using Nailtique.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff. It works!</li>
