    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>What a wonderful change!</li>
            <li>Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>I was impressed with this cleanser.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Above all, this product satisfies my problem skin the best at this point in time.</li>
            <li>This is a one of the best if not the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>a good combo is this cleanser with Peter Thomas Roth&#x27;s oiless oil plant squalane moisturizing oil!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy, will buy again.</li>
            <li>This is one great product.  </li>
            <li>I trust them and they&#x27;re good products.</li>
            <li>This is a good cleanser with quality ingredients.</li>
            <li>Its ingredients are great for cleansing and removing impurities, but not for effectively fighting a breakout.</li>
            <li>but it does remove my make up and oil without stripping my skin or making my skin flush since I am so fair.</li>
            <li>Does a fairly good job removing my make up.</li>
            <li>I also believe it does have some product in it which is good for women in their 60&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>i liked it.</li>
            <li>It removed all of my make-up.......including mascara, very easily.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE!</li>
            <li>This cleanser is amazing, it is more of a lotion based cleanser than a foaming face wash</li>
            <li>Although this isn&#x27;t the &amp;#34;cleanest&amp;#34; cleanser on the market (in regards to the ingredients list), it is one of the most effective.</li>
            <li>No smell to bother me and it makes my face very smooth feeling.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how this stuff feels so made for my skin, but I&#x27;m glad I found it.  </li>
            <li>I use mostly Derma e and Alba products.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re safe, have safe ingredients, don&#x27;t do animal testing, don&#x27;t have parabens.</li>
            <li>I will repeat use this product:-)</li>
            <li>This cleanser is just ok.</li>
            <li>in fact, the majority of the ingredients are top notch.</li>
            <li>It is not the best cleanser I have ever used, but it gets the job done on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is great, can&#x27;t say enough good things about.  </li>
            <li>Sensitive skin is a challenge, so this is just my experience, but derma-e seems to have great products.  </li>
            <li>5 stars easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just not as good at cleansing as I would like it to be, but it is better than nearly everything else</li>
            <li>It cleans without foaming and rinses easily.  </li>
            <li>An ideal cleanser for me has to be gentle yet effective as in it actually CLEANSES and preferably fragrance free.</li>
            <li>I have some fine lines creeping in, some blackheads around nose &amp; some hormonal break outs sometimes.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy using it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, fragrance free and does the job.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t wear makeup or are fragrant sensitive, this is the best cleanser available as far as I&#x27;m concerned, and sometimes I feel like I&#x27;ve tried every unscented product on the market.</li>
            <li>My skin feels silky smooth.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is gentle, but effective.  </li>
            <li>If I wear more eye makeup than super light daytime level, I do have to use some make up remover, but it&#x27;s still totally worth it for me.  </li>
            <li>This is a very gentle product which I love it.</li>
            <li>As things like Cetaphil cleanser just never could clean my skin &amp; it broke out.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for sensitive, combo dry skin, easily irritated/red skin.</li>
            <li>leaves my face feeling clean and moist.</li>
            <li>Any time you use new product, you should allow your skin time to acclimate before you decide its effectiveness, and this is especially true if you are transitioning to a more natural product.</li>
            <li>I seriously love this stuff so much now &amp;#60;3  </li>
            <li>True True......</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m super picky when it comes to choosing products based on their ingredients list.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that it has any super harmful ingredients...</li>
            <li>I do feel like I have to use my own exfoliator more often, though, because there is no real exfoliation that goes on with this</li>
            <li>This one cleans gently, rinses easily and leaves no scent or residue.</li>
            <li>It feels great on your skin, allows it to retain moisture while you cleanse, and doesn&#x27;t have any harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>My family notices the smooth much much improved skin.  </li>
            <li>Ok, so if you have sensitive skin then you will understand.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff and would recommend it for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I finally found one great product for sensitive skin and aging.  </li>
            <li>As other reviewers have noted, this cleanser probably isn&#x27;t the best for you if you regularly wear a lot of makeup.</li>
            <li>finding the right cleanser is a challenge.</li>
            <li>This is one of the first Derma e products I have used and because it delivered good results I have continued to purchase other products in their skin care line.</li>
            <li>Worked ok at first then turned my skin super red after washing.</li>
            <li>Derma e is a great facial product line that is not only affordable but does not test on animals.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft, fresh and clean with no fragrance.  </li>
            <li>My skin began to feel soothed before the end of the first week.</li>
            <li>I feel my skin is soft and smooth after used .</li>
            <li>This cleanser leaves my skin feeling clean but not dried out like</li>
            <li>It actually rinses clean!  </li>
            <li>Really liked this cleanser, I have extremely intolerant/sensitive skin to the point where most cleansers break me out or dry out my skin too much.</li>
            <li>If you decide to purchase this item make sure you give it a few days before you decide if you like it, especially if you are switching from more mainstream cleansers like Neutrogena or Clean&amp;Clear.</li>
            <li>Now I go out without any make up at all or very</li>
            <li>Gentle, but addresses issues</li>
            <li>It will get rid of the rest of the makeup, and it&#x27;s very soothing.</li>
            <li>It also works very well with my Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>This product truly delivers with a non-toxic ingredient list, it is gentle, and has no fragrance or scent.</li>
            <li>Gently removes makeup, doesn&#x27;t overdry your skin, doesn&#x27;t leave a residue and no scent.  </li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>, nut I&#x27;m kinda cheap especially when it comes to cleansers, bc</li>
            <li>I think,&amp;#34;you just cleanse fast and wash off&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll hopefully keep buying it in the near future :)</li>
            <li>But, WOW!!!  </li>
            <li>many other cleansers do.</li>
            <li>First thing that went was the overly sensitive burning feeling to my face.</li>
            <li>Overall I really like it , the price is the thing that kinda sets me of haha</li>
            <li>I also have combination skin even though it&#x27;s very sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and this cleanser never irritates it.</li>
            <li>Decided to hunt for more natural less chemical and found derma e. YEAH!!  </li>
            <li>Your face will feel fresh, clean without feeling tight or dry.</li>
            <li>I had used the same face cleanser for a couple years, but noticed that it just didn&#x27;t really do anything for my skin.  </li>
            <li>And my old cleanser just never helped any of those issues.  </li>
            <li>It is also not for those who are prone to frequent breakouts of acne.</li>
            <li>It works well on sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>This product is for sensitive &amp; roacea &amp; redness.  </li>
            <li>I had acne in my youth that I cleared up completely by my 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li>No foaming action at all.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong; this is a good cleanser.</li>
            <li>All this time I was changing moisturizers and treatments and makeup but what I really needed was a gentle cleanser that didn&#x27;t agitate my skin before putting other stuff on it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually wear makeup, but when I do, I use makeup removing towelettes and then the cleanser, and that works just fine.  </li>
            <li>And it actually helped clear my skin &amp; make it softer!!  </li>
            <li>I tried many many products only making things worse, absolutely no better.  </li>
            <li>Every time you want to try something new, you have to decide if it&#x27;s worth the potential break outs, rash, itching &amp; wasted time &amp; money.  </li>
            <li>Left my skin feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Cleans well, no strange fragrances.</li>
            <li>Before I was using more and more liquid make up for sensitive skin in an attempt to hide at least some of the bad looking face.</li>
            <li>Went to Whole Foods because I wanted something less than $20 that wasn&#x27;t tested on animals.  </li>
            <li>I have very dry and sensitive skin and this cleanser</li>
            <li>I do wear makeup (powder foundation, blush, waterproof mascara and waterproof eyeliner for starters) and it DID remove my makeup very well although I do use a little dab of eye-makeup remover on my eyes.  </li>
            <li>It is very gentle, but still cleans thoroughly without leaving a dry, tight feeling.  </li>

            <li> Ok, so if you have sensitive skin then you will understand.  Every time you want to try something new, you have to decide if it&#x27;s worth the potential break outs, rash, itching &amp; wasted time &amp; money.  I had used the same face cleanser for a couple years, but noticed that it just didn&#x27;t really do anything for my skin.  It didn&#x27;t agitate it, but I didn&#x27;t feel like it was helping it either.  I have some fine lines creeping in, some blackheads around nose &amp; some hormonal break outs sometimes.  And my old cleanser just never helped any of those issues.  I also have combination skin even though it&#x27;s very sensitive.  I finally decided to find something else.  Went to Whole Foods because I wanted something less than $20 that wasn&#x27;t tested on animals.  I got this but didn&#x27;t realize it was a cream cleanser.  I was so bummed because I thought I was going to have to return it.  As things like Cetaphil cleanser just never could clean my skin &amp; it broke out.  But, WOW!!!  It actually rinses clean!  And it actually helped clear my skin &amp; make it softer!!  I seriously love this stuff so much now &amp;#60;3  If I wear more eye makeup than super light daytime level, I do have to use some make up remover, but it&#x27;s still totally worth it for me.  I use it with my Clairsonic every other day.  I don&#x27;t know how this stuff feels so made for my skin, but I&#x27;m glad I found it.  Sensitive skin is a challenge, so this is just my experience, but derma-e seems to have great products.  Will order this forever (or until my skin changes again), and maybe try some of their other stuff.  LOVE LOVE!</li>
            <li> 5 stars easily. Reduces my butterfly rash, redness, irritation. Wonder product!</li>
            <li> I use mostly Derma e and Alba products. They&#x27;re safe, have safe ingredients, don&#x27;t do animal testing, don&#x27;t have parabens. I trust them and they&#x27;re good products. And between the two of the companies, they make about every skin product you&#x27;ll need.</li>
            <li> This is one of the first Derma e products I have used and because it delivered good results I have continued to purchase other products in their skin care line. This is a good cleanser with quality ingredients. It cleans the skin well without being overly harsh or drying.    As other reviewers have noted, this cleanser probably isn&#x27;t the best for you if you regularly wear a lot of makeup. The cleanser alone  won&#x27;t remove all of it.  I don&#x27;t usually wear makeup, but when I do, I use makeup removing towelettes and then the cleanser, and that works just fine.  It is also not for those who are prone to frequent breakouts of acne. Its ingredients are great for cleansing and removing impurities, but not for effectively fighting a breakout. When I break-out I incorporate a cleanser with salicylic acid or use a deep-cleaning clay mask, along with this product, and it clears up.     It feels great on your skin, allows it to retain moisture while you cleanse, and doesn&#x27;t have any harsh chemicals. It works well on sensitive skin.  I enjoy using it.  If you decide to purchase this item make sure you give it a few days before you decide if you like it, especially if you are switching from more mainstream cleansers like Neutrogena or Clean&amp;Clear. Any time you use new product, you should allow your skin time to acclimate before you decide its effectiveness, and this is especially true if you are transitioning to a more natural product. It is a different experience for your skin.     Bottom line is that I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Cleans well, no strange fragrances. I&#x27;m happy, will buy again.</li>
            <li> This product is for sensitive &amp; roacea &amp; redness.  True True...... I had fought for several years break outs [I am 66 so not achne] red veiny lines,soreness and reaction to almost every emotion and type of weather. I tried many many products only making things worse, absolutely no better.  Decided to hunt for more natural less chemical and found derma e. YEAH!!  I do the regiment of derma e facial cleanser, serum and moisturizing cream two times a day.  My skin began to feel soothed before the end of the first week. First thing that went was the overly sensitive burning feeling to my face. I am now in my 6th month of using derma e. My family notices the smooth much much improved skin.  Before I was using more and more liquid make up for sensitive skin in an attempt to hide at least some of the bad looking face. Hated to even be seen.  Now I go out without any make up at all or very little. What a wonderful change! The serum is used for redness/problem spots.  You dab it on the breakouts or redness.  It so soothes the skin and gives an added healing to the problem areas.  With the problems I had, I almost wanted to go&amp;#34;auw now that feels soothing!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is a very gentle product which I love it. I feel my skin is soft and smooth after used . No tightening or dry feeling. I will repeat use this product:-)</li>
            <li> This cleanser is just ok. I washed my face with it and afterwards I cleaned my face with witch hazel and I saw traces of my makeup on the cotton ball.  I sent it back to Amazon.</li>
            <li> I had acne in my youth that I cleared up completely by my 20&#x27;s but as I approached 30 it came back again. Not quite the same but I started seeing my pores, blackheads in my nose, and acne with white heads continually on my lower jaw. I tried everything and would think it was clearing up only to realize that the cycle on my jaw was still ongoing. I realized that I had to stop treating the acne and the aging and focus on the sensitivity of my skin. Within 2 weeks of using this cleanser my skin stopped producing white heads and zits. All this time I was changing moisturizers and treatments and makeup but what I really needed was a gentle cleanser that didn&#x27;t agitate my skin before putting other stuff on it. This cleanser is amazing, it is more of a lotion based cleanser than a foaming face wash but it does remove my make up and oil without stripping my skin or making my skin flush since I am so fair. This was the missing link to my facial puzzle now I have added back in the Hyluronic Day cream and use the derma e aha overnight peel once per week and my skin stays the way it should.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cleanser for a couple of years now and it&#x27;s become a must-have staple in my skincare routine! I have very sensitive skin and this cleanser never irritates it. I have what you would call extreme combination skin...dry and cracking, or oily, or both at the same time. I&#x27;m prone to breakouts. This cleanser leaves my skin feeling clean but not dried out like many other cleansers do. I don&#x27;t wear much makeup (just usually a bit of foundation and mascara) and it takes it off effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m super picky when it comes to choosing products based on their ingredients list. I&#x27;ve never liked the idea of putting a bunch of chemicals on my skin to be absorbed into my bloodstream so I choose all my personal hygiene products with care. Although this isn&#x27;t the &amp;#34;cleanest&amp;#34; cleanser on the market (in regards to the ingredients list), it is one of the most effective. It&#x27;s not that it has any super harmful ingredients...in fact, the majority of the ingredients are top notch. I&#x27;ve tried at least 20 high quality cleansers over the past decade and this one is my favourite!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and in tact. The consistency is like cleansing milk. Your face will feel fresh, clean without feeling tight or dry.</li>
            <li> Suffering from extreme dryness n sensitivity (menopause, hypothyroidism, n Sjogrens Syndrome all contribute), this creamy cleanser soothed and actually permitted healing of scaling red patches at my mouth corners. a good combo is this cleanser with Peter Thomas Roth&#x27;s oiless oil plant squalane moisturizing oil!</li>
            <li> This product feels like washing your face with mayonaise, leaves your skin feeling greasy  and unclean.&lt;br /&gt; No foaming action at all.  Also, I received a used bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A.</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for a couple of months now and I like it. It&#x27;s lightweight, fragrance free and does the job. It is not the best cleanser I have ever used, but it gets the job done on a regular basis. I do feel like I have to use my own exfoliator more often, though, because there is no real exfoliation that goes on with this cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use a moisturizer by the same company (different line in the dermaE collection) and it also works well.</li>
            <li> Does not irritate my skin. Does a fairly good job removing my make up. I have been using their products for at least 5 years now.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle, but still cleans thoroughly without leaving a dry, tight feeling.  I also believe it does have some product in it which is good for women in their 60&#x27;s.  Which is hard to find.  Gentle, but addresses issues</li>
            <li> So soothing and cleansing without any perfume or lasting fragrance. think it has helped to prevent some dryness and aging.</li>
            <li> finished the bottle and ordering another - cleaned well, no greasy residue, didnt break out, didnt dry skin - i liked it.</li>
            <li> I use this cleanser in the morning, because it just doesn&#x27;t have enough oomph to get all my makeup off at night. (For a product that does and that smells yummy, see the Vanilla Mousse Cleanser from Derma-e.) Besides, in the morning, I prefer to put as little scent on my skin as possible to avoid reactions. Don&#x27;t get me wrong; this is a good cleanser. It&#x27;s just not as good at cleansing as I would like it to be, but it is better than nearly everything else I&#x27;ve tried - including soap and water. If you don&#x27;t wear makeup or are fragrant sensitive, this is the best cleanser available as far as I&#x27;m concerned, and sometimes I feel like I&#x27;ve tried every unscented product on the market. Definitely purchase the toner to go with this. It will get rid of the rest of the makeup, and it&#x27;s very soothing.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that&#x27;s oily and dry at the same time, so finding the right cleanser is a challenge. This one cleans gently, rinses easily and leaves no scent or residue. My skin feels silky smooth. It also works very well with my Clarisonic. Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Worked ok at first then turned my skin super red after washing. Had to give it up.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with this cleanser. It removed all of my make-up.......including mascara, very easily. Left my skin feeling soft and moisturized. I have been using Cetaphil cleanser and moisturizer for years which my dermatologist recommended for sensitve skin. I love this stuff and would recommend it for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Like the gentleness, but still leaves traces of makeup after use.</li>
            <li> This product truly delivers with a non-toxic ingredient list, it is gentle, and has no fragrance or scent. Everything a cleanser should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I have two complaints:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of the other Derma E products come close to this one - it is their one and only that is not a sensitizer (unfortunately).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I am still left with dry patches on my forehead and must use a wash cloth to slough, following a wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Above all, this product satisfies my problem skin the best at this point in time. Until I find its replacement, I give it praise.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is great, can&#x27;t say enough good things about.  Gently removes makeup, doesn&#x27;t overdry your skin, doesn&#x27;t leave a residue and no scent.  A little goes a long way, so one bottle can last a while. Perfect for sensitive, combo dry skin, easily irritated/red skin.</li>
            <li> It cleans without drying out my skin!  I have very dry and sensitive skin and this cleanser leaves my face feeling clean and moist.</li>
            <li> Derma e is a great facial product line that is not only affordable but does not test on animals.  I read that some people thought it didn&#x27;t remove their makeup well enough.  I do wear makeup (powder foundation, blush, waterproof mascara and waterproof eyeliner for starters) and it DID remove my makeup very well although I do use a little dab of eye-makeup remover on my eyes.  It leaves my skin feeling soft, fresh and clean with no fragrance.  I will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> This is one great product.  I finally found one great product for sensitive skin and aging.  It cleans without foaming and rinses easily.  Also, plumps your skin since I have severe bagging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m highly sensitive to all smells and have had trouble finding facial cleanser without fragrances.  Well I found this and it fits the bill. No smell to bother me and it makes my face very smooth feeling.  It works very well.</li>
            <li> Really liked this cleanser, I have extremely intolerant/sensitive skin to the point where most cleansers break me out or dry out my skin too much. An ideal cleanser for me has to be gentle yet effective as in it actually CLEANSES and preferably fragrance free. This is a one of the best if not the best I&#x27;ve used. Don&#x27;t expect it to remove your heavy makeup. I remove my makeup prior to cleansing , always, even if I&#x27;m not wearing a lot and I recommend that you do so with this cleanser. Overall I really like it , the price is the thing that kinda sets me of haha, nut I&#x27;m kinda cheap especially when it comes to cleansers, bc I think,&amp;#34;you just cleanse fast and wash off&amp;#34; but I&#x27;ll hopefully keep buying it in the near future :)</li>
            <li> This cleanser is gentle, but effective.  I would purchase this again.  I would recommend it to family and friends also.</li>
            <li> New formula is INFERIOR to previous one. Before, it was quite scentless, and had a pink color. The &amp;#34;new formula&amp;#34; is now white, and feels harsher, dries out my skin, and has a scent that I can even taste. Very disappointed, as I have used this for years and now have to look for a different product. Very disappointed.</li>
