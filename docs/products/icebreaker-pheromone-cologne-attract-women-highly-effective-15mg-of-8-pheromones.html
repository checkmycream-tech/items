            <li>I also followed the instructional booklet, which was a nice bonus.</li>
            <li>Highly Effective 15mg of 8 Pheromones]]</li>
            <li>I can smell pheromones very easily in products that have a lot of them and this one claims to have 15mg of pheromones</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fragrance its delightful and sutil not offensive,not a strong stinky one it certainly will not attract just anyone you have to do your own work if you want to pursue anything.</li>
            <li>This one smells like cheap cologne so you can forget about using it with any good cologne -</li>
            <li>Very fast shipper great to do business with.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been ordering Icebreaker for over 2 years now, they have been consistent and giving me great results with their product which is why I have been continuing to order.</li>
            <li>It smells great, wakes me up every morning, gives me a more positive outlook for the day</li>
            <li>He says he has noticed a lot more smiles and looks from girls.</li>
            <li>And the ladies seem to like it over most Cologne&#x27;s I&#x27;ve had on.</li>
            <li>I want more of this.  </li>
            <li>OK it did not work on my women.</li>
            <li>It is better than Nexus.</li>
            <li>I am in doubt if this cologne realle have pheromones, It does not matter because the smell is super nice.</li>
            <li>and I can enjoy the increased sexual appeal every moment.</li>
            <li>so the smell should be strong</li>
            <li>so I could get numbers and stuff just fine, but this spray boosted that and women were all over me</li>
            <li>I am batter of with Spanish Fly.</li>
            <li>BUT IT IS MORE EFFECTIVE AND HIGH POWERFUL WITH CIVET OIL .</li>
            <li>but this time i wish i had ordered 2 or 3 bottles more because of all the positive statements i received.  </li>
            <li>so you&#x27;d have a more positive outlook and appearance to the women.</li>
            <li>HE says so far this has to be one of his favorite products!</li>
            <li>And I remember distinctly this one girl that  gave him this look that was that type of look like</li>
            <li>I think this is worth the money</li>
            <li>And that really came in handy since I was working in an adult store.</li>
            <li>Omg I want to jump your bones right now.</li>
            <li>this product really works and i say that because i tried using 2 different products at the same time...that were the best sellers and Icebreaker got more responses and compliments then the other.  </li>
            <li>I think the stuff smells great and long lasting.</li>
            <li>The only okay thing is its smell.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and I am definitely going to purchase it again.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Icebreaker!</li>
            <li>I mean I am attractive</li>
            <li>The Seduction guide has some useful tips for younger less experienced guys.</li>
            <li>I personally enjoyed the smell and amazed at how long it lasts.</li>
            <li>Ehhhh who knows if this really works?</li>
            <li>As far as getting any action, undoubtedly that would happen anyway, but the fact that the opposite sex response to you so well with this cologne is really amazing</li>
            <li>He was VERY and when I say VERY</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s not the point I paid much money for...</li>
            <li>so 3 sprays is now too much.</li>
            <li>They diluted it with too much alcohol, so there isn&#x27;t as much pheros in there.    </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>I usually never re-order for awhile</li>
            <li>I did notice a change in my behavior when I wore it the first time and noticed several girls checking me out, talking to me a lot more, flirting with me, or simply just giving a smile when we walk past each other.</li>
            <li>I mean it pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>But the main problem is that it doesn&#x27;t do anything - I didn&#x27;t get attraction, I only got \\&quot;Ugh</li>
            <li>I have never given any one a hug without a compliment after starting to mix this with my normal stuff.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast - took 3 days, the only problem was that UPS left the box outside of my apartment.</li>
            <li>, I really hope Icebreaker isn&#x27;t going in the gutter like some other pheromone companies.</li>
            <li>I think the major catch in this item is that it boosts your inner self confidence and your ego</li>

            <li> Also their &#x27;crash course on dating&#x27; is just a little sheet of paper.     </li>
            <li> Do waste your money</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but these pheromones actually work.</li>
            <li> I mean with this bottle now I still get smiles, looks, and girls talking to me.</li>
            <li> this product sucks it smells bad its a waste of your money</li>
            <li> Looks, numbers, smiles, flirting, you really can&#x27;t go wrong.    </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve started random conversation with girls in my church who&#x27;d rather not pursued talking to me if I were not wearing this cologne.</li>
            <li> Its expensive</li>
            <li> I am disappointed with the result.</li>
            <li> But I am disappointed</li>
            <li> I hate the smell</li>
            <li> the scent is awful and it doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Have not noticed any more help getting some , but it smells good.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product several times, but now the product seems to have been like watered down and the cologne odor is gone very quickly---like in a half hour or so. I would give it a try again but i&#x27;m not willing too waste my money.</li>
            <li> Ehhhh who knows if this really works?</li>
            <li> this product really works and i say that because i tried using 2 different products at the same time...that were the best sellers and Icebreaker got more responses and compliments then the other.  I usually never re-order for awhile but this time i wish i had ordered 2 or 3 bottles more because of all the positive statements i received.  As far as getting any action, undoubtedly that would happen anyway, but the fact that the opposite sex response to you so well with this cologne is really amazing and yes it works.</li>
            <li> This product is a scam. the scent is awful and it doesn&#x27;t work at all. I will never never recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> this product sucks it smells bad its a waste of your money i do beleive&lt;br /&gt;in pheromones colognes because i use different brand before and they do work&lt;br /&gt;stay away from this one</li>
            <li> My friend has been a phero user for about 3 years now and I got this as a gift for him. He was VERY and when I say VERY I mean it pleased with this product. Not only did it come before the time I expected. He noticed immediate results when he used it. He says he has noticed a lot more smiles and looks from girls. I went to the mall with him and he got 2 girls numbers and another girl was chatting him up. And I remember distinctly this one girl that  gave him this look that was that type of look like Omg I want to jump your bones right now. HE says so far this has to be one of his favorite products!</li>
            <li> YES A VERY GOOD PHEROMONE COLOGNE , BUT IT IS MORE EFFECTIVE AND HIGH POWERFUL WITH CIVET OIL . ESPECIALLY EFFECTIVE IN BETWEEN 25 DEGREE TO 34 DEGREE CELCIOUS TEMPERATURE . FROM DHAKA BANGLADESH DR. HASAN KABIR</li>
            <li> Whether or not the stuff works. I think the stuff smells great and long lasting. I did notice a change in my behavior when I wore it the first time and noticed several girls checking me out, talking to me a lot more, flirting with me, or simply just giving a smile when we walk past each other. I think the major catch in this item is that it boosts your inner self confidence and your ego so you&#x27;d have a more positive outlook and appearance to the women. I personally enjoyed the smell and amazed at how long it lasts. It smells great, wakes me up every morning, gives me a more positive outlook for the day and I can enjoy the increased sexual appeal every moment. I think this is worth the money but it won&#x27;t work for everyone.</li>
            <li> I have used this one for one month and tried several times in different occasions. I am disappointed with the result. There is no difference between I wear this one or others. The only okay thing is its smell. But that&#x27;s not the point I paid much money for...</li>
            <li> I am in doubt if this cologne realle have pheromones, It does not matter because the smell is super nice. If it does not have is a good cologne to mix with pheromones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering Icebreaker for over 2 years now, they have been consistent and giving me great results with their product which is why I have been continuing to order. Looks, numbers, smiles, flirting, you really can&#x27;t go wrong.    I mean I am attractive so I could get numbers and stuff just fine, but this spray boosted that and women were all over me it seems where ever I went either some were staring me down or hitting on me.    This bottle I received a couple weeks ago seems to be a dud.  It&#x27;s either:  1.) They up-ed the phero amount in this, so 3 sprays is now too much. I haven&#x27;t tried spraying a less amount yet. Since I doubt this is the problem.  2.) They diluted it with too much alcohol, so there isn&#x27;t as much pheros in there.    But I am disappointed, I really hope Icebreaker isn&#x27;t going in the gutter like some other pheromone companies. I mean with this bottle now I still get smiles, looks, and girls talking to me. But I think thats just my ownself and the spray not really affecting anything.    I&#x27;m going to order another bottle. If it seems to not be working like this recent bottle. Goodbye Icebreaker for me.</li>
            <li> This one smells like cheap cologne so you can forget about using it with any good cologne - I hate the smell so I can bearly stand to wear it at all.    But the main problem is that it doesn&#x27;t do anything - I didn&#x27;t get attraction, I only got \\&quot;Ugh what are you wearing - it smells terrible.\\&quot;    If it has pheromones in it I can&#x27;t smell them. I can smell pheromones very easily in products that have a lot of them and this one claims to have 15mg of pheromones so the smell should be strong but it&#x27;s not there.    Also their &#x27;crash course on dating&#x27; is just a little sheet of paper.     My advice is to pass on this one.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me and I don&#x27;t like the smell. Any girl wanted me since I use this cologne</li>
            <li> Has a very good scent not to strong. And the ladies seem to like it over most Cologne&#x27;s I&#x27;ve had on.</li>
            <li> I have a girlfriend, but I wanted to try if this can help me to solve the \\&quot;I am not in the mood\\&quot; problem that my girlfriend gives me sometimes. I&#x27;ve been using icebreaker for about a moth without her knowledge. I definitly saw an increased interest in making out and sex. Also she seems more relaxed and calm around me, and that&#x27;s priceless! I was skeptical, but these pheromones actually work. The Seduction guide has some useful tips for younger less experienced guys. Shipping was fast - took 3 days, the only problem was that UPS left the box outside of my apartment. The product works for me, smells good too, I&#x27;m reordering more.</li>
            <li> No noticable reaction from women, relationships remain the same.  I would not reccomend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> It smells alright and it seems to work. No complaints.</li>
            <li> great product smells really nice works excellent and lasts a while. Very fast shipper great to do business with.</li>
            <li> First off I was skeptical because I&#x27;ve sprayed in the past Chikara Pheremones on a few months ago. Icebreaker is amazing and I&#x27;ve started random conversation with girls in my church who&#x27;d rather not pursued talking to me if I were not wearing this cologne. Even my own mother compliments me on the smell. Two to three sprays are acceptable.... women want you to start the conversation and compliment them...</li>
            <li> Does not really work Do waste your money it doesn&#x27;t attract women i don&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone start a conversation with an attractive women</li>
            <li> I want more of this.  I have never given any one a hug without a compliment after starting to mix this with my normal stuff.  Highly recommended.  P.S.  Cant seem to find it anywhere now.  HELP?</li>
            <li> OK it did not work on my women. I am batter of with Spanish Fly.</li>
            <li> It worked for me. I use it every day. I also followed the instructional booklet, which was a nice bonus. [[ASIN:B0011TWSJK Icebreaker Pheromone Cologne - Attract Women - Highly Effective 15mg of 8 Pheromones]]</li>
            <li> Good smell i like it a lot . Its expensive but really it is amazing so why not purchasing it</li>
            <li> I ordered this about a year ago and I really loved the way it smelled and I don&#x27;t know if it was a placebo affect or what, but when I was around attractive women the attention was mutually shared. They almost seemed drawn to me. And that really came in handy since I was working in an adult store. I totally noticed changes with women on the days I put it on. I love this stuff and I am definitely going to purchase it again. This may actually become my permanent cologne! I absolutely recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Icebreaker!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fragrance its delightful and sutil not offensive,not a strong stinky one it certainly will not attract just anyone you have to do your own work if you want to pursue anything.</li>
            <li> It is better than Nexus.</li>
