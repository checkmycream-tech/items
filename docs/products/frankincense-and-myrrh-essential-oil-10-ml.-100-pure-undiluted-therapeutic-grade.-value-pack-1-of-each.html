            <li> These oils smell strange and do not seem to be as high quality as other brands I have smelled.</li>
            <li> Is this typical for this essential oil?</li>
            <li> big waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to their learning center and blog.  </li>
            <li> Not what I expected them to smell like, but I&#x27;m still learning about EOils</li>
            <li> This was the most disappointing purchase I have ever made!  </li>

            <li> I also had dark itching spots on my arms and legs as well.</li>
            <li> I think myrrh is a odd scent</li>

            <li> I could not get a drop from Frankincense bottle, because the thick oil in glass bottle.</li>
            <li> The myrh is so thick it will not come out of the bottle and has a plastic like smell.</li>
            <li> The frankincense and myrrh smell like they should but the aroma is weak.</li>
            <li> The Myrrh  oil is thin and watery.</li>
            <li> Not pure essential oils: these items have a very nasty smell, have clear watery look feel, and they cause severe itching, terrible rashes  on my wife&#x27;s arms, legs, and her stomach area.</li>
            <li> The frankincense is very weak.</li>
            <li> So sorry I purchased them.  </li>
            <li> I tried these 2 together for my  diabetic feet pain it help but the smell is awful, but as long as it helps I&#x27;ll just deal with the smell.</li>

            <li> I bought this set becuase I figured they would smell good. Turns out the oil was so thick in each bottle I couldn&#x27;t get any out. Waste of money. I had to really shake them up like a paint can if I wanted a few drops. The frankincense smelled bad and i couldnt get any from the myrr. Very disappointed. I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> My family likes the benefits of essential oils. We use Oil Diffusers as well as other applications. This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased from Plant Guru. I&#x27;m enjoying the Frankincense and Myrrh Essential Oil. They seems to have some great products at reasonable prices. I&#x27;m looking forward to their learning center and blog.  Its always good to keep learning about ways to maintain &amp; improve your health!</li>
            <li> I think myrrh is a odd scent but I am still learning about oils .</li>
            <li> great oils great prices</li>
            <li> Disappointing. The frankincense and myrrh smell like they should but the aroma is weak. The myrrh is ok but I have had better. The frankincense is very weak. They will work in a pinch but in the future I will look for something with better quality.</li>
            <li> This was used during our Christmas time and pagent at the church. I had always wondered, as have many, how these smelled. Now we know!&lt;br /&gt;During the children&#x27;s time they didn&#x27;t think it was any oil or perfume Mom or Dad would wear!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it. I could not get a drop from Frankincense bottle, because the thick oil in glass bottle. The Myrrh  oil is thin and watery. I am disappointed with this order.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected them to smell like, but I&#x27;m still learning about EOils</li>
            <li> My first encounter with either of these oils. Not the best smelling stuff but it did the trick.</li>
            <li> Happy with this combo pack.</li>
            <li> Great used in my childrens SS class at Christmas...</li>
            <li> Smells good. I wish the scent would last  bit longer tho.</li>
            <li> Wonderful! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great product for use in my home. I love them.</li>
            <li> The myrrh bottle was defected and would not work i was very disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Not what I was looking for.. Scents were overbearing and strong</li>
            <li> Very good quality will buy from again!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product.  I was not sure what they would smell like.  I do not like the scents but I bought them with out knowing.</li>
            <li> Best price ever thanks.</li>
            <li> These oils smell strange and do not seem to be as high quality as other brands I have smelled. The myrh is so thick it will not come out of the bottle and has a plastic like smell. I would not purchase these again.</li>
            <li> Not pure essential oils: these items have a very nasty smell, have clear watery look feel, and they cause severe itching, terrible rashes  on my wife&#x27;s arms, legs, and her stomach area. I also had dark itching spots on my arms and legs as well. we contact the seller and the seller was very unhelpful and blame these health problems on us.  the seller told us we was using the oils wrong and his product are great and pure oils. over the past 3 to 4 years using both of these oils from another seller, we never experience these health problems at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;we also lost about $40 worth of olive oils we mix these nasty oils  with and the seller didn&#x27;t offered anything at all to help pay for our loss. do not buy this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;when we get the  pictures of the rashes off my phone, i will up date this review and put the pictures on here for every one to see.</li>
            <li> I received the oils, and started to use them, however only time will tell if they work the way they are described.  I gave them only 3 stars, because it is to soon to tell if they work for the purpose I purchased them, which was for toe nail fungus.  The oils do help the on dry feet, and hands, you do not need to use much.</li>
            <li> I love adding the frankincense to my moisturize .  Still learning all the things I can do with essential oils</li>
