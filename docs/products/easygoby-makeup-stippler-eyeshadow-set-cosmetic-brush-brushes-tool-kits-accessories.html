            <li>I love the quality and the quantity.</li>
            <li>Satisfied w merchandise</li>
            <li>They adjust easily depending on the size of brushes.</li>
            <li>Easily ripped.</li>
            <li>Not a bad product just better options out there.</li>
            <li>These little do-kickeys are awesome!  </li>
            <li>These brush guards provide a great protection for make-up brushes at a terrific price.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The work best for bigger brushes like foundation or blush but not so much shadow brushes.</li>
            <li>It is best for big brushes not small brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although it took several weeks to arrive from oversea, I was pleasantly surprise at how well the guards worked.</li>
            <li>These are good if you are just starting out in make up and learning to wash your brushes.</li>
            <li>There was an issue with my order which was handled quickly by both Amazon and E-Tribe.</li>
            <li>Hi everyone, This is a great product, works excellent for all my face brushes even the really big ones if you are wondering, the only reason I&#x27;m not giving it five stars is because they are not small enough for my eye</li>
            <li>These guards are much better quality and protect my brushes as good as more expensive guards.  </li>
            <li>So far okay</li>
            <li>These brush guards are very versatile; I keep them on my brushes all the time, even while they are in the drawer, so they keep their original shape.  </li>
            <li>Thanks you very much!</li>
            <li>IT WILL HAVE EXPANDED THE MATERIAL AND WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO HOLD THE BRUSHES OR KEEP THEM IN IT&#x27;S PROPER FORM.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use make-up very often, but I love how these keep the same shape of my brushes after each and every wash and use.</li>
            <li>I really like using these for travel</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve 3 months with it and help to protect my brush set really well.</li>
            <li>I also keep them on my brushes when not in use or during travel to keep the bristles in place and ready for use.  </li>
            <li>I really like these.  </li>
            <li>These qork great for letting my brushes dry upside down (to protect the ferrel from water damage) while keeping their shape and form in the process.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I do like was the rich purple color.</li>
            <li>I would like it if it were slightly tighter to hold my mini brushes better tho.</li>
            <li>They work better on big brushes then with smaller brushes.</li>
            <li>They fit all different brush sizes and can be trimmed to fit even the shortest yet plum little brushes.</li>
            <li>I also use them to help dry my brushes after I clean them.</li>
            <li>it took a little longer than what I expected, but it sure was worth the wait!</li>
            <li>(stiff guards, not my favorite, but come in samll sizes)</li>
            <li>They help keep my brushes looking new.</li>
            <li>The pieces are fantastic for big brushes (foundation, power, blush), but the &amp;#34;one size fits all&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t shape the smaller eye brushes.</li>
            <li>Great little product which arrived much earlier than expected.  </li>
            <li>I received my order fairly quick and the items were just as expected.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much money for a similar item that was 2x the price.</li>
            <li>I have thought that these brush guards have professional quality.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like investing so much on brushes, so these help with keeping that possible.</li>
            <li>They are soft and flexible.  </li>
            <li>They are worth every penny spent on them!</li>
            <li>I bought other brush guards but this one is better because it is almost one size fits all, and it is light enough to shape the brush but still allows air in so it dries faster than other ones thicker and less flexible.</li>
            <li>I also like the purple because the little things make me smile.</li>
            <li>YOU ARE REALLY THAT IMPATIENT IN WAITING FOR THEM TO DRY, DRY THE BRUSHES WITH THE BLOW DRYER FIRST</li>
            <li>TIP: FOR PEOPLE WHO CLEAN THEIR BRUSHES AND THEN PUT ON THE BRUSH GUARD AND WAIT FOR THEM TO DRY, BUT ARE IMPATIENT WITH WAITING FOR THEM TO DRY, KNOW THAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE DECIDED TO TAKE A BLOW DRYER TO THEIR BRUSHES</li>
            <li>For the same price as my old brush guards I received double the the amount and can now dry all my makeup brushes all at once after cleaning with several unused extra guards to spare.</li>

            <li> For the same price as my old brush guards I received double the the amount and can now dry all my makeup brushes all at once after cleaning with several unused extra guards to spare.</li>
            <li> I needed several brush guards that were affordable after my 2yr old son decided to rip all the other ones I had.</li>
            <li> I had an old set of makeup shapers that I tried to trim down.</li>
            <li> This package of 15 will last me a very long time, even with 5 brushes!  </li>
            <li> For a size refrence, these fit small blush brushes, the small tapered brushes (sigma) and dual-fiber brushes all the way up to my largest powder brush (sigma), wide handled kabuki, and body brushes.  </li>
            <li> These work just as well as the more expensive ones, and they&#x27;re purple!</li>
            <li> DRY</li>
            <li> I also find that when you put these on the brushes, the brushes don&#x27;t dry.</li>
            <li> It keeps the brushes from fraying out when they dry.</li>
            <li> I washed by makeup brushes and ang them upside down to dry.</li>
            <li> These work well for medium/highlightling/contour/blush brushes, too small for powder brushes and too big for eye brushes.</li>
            <li> I bought these small ones and use them on all of my brushes, even the big ones.  </li>
            <li> I bought these because they were cheaper than any other brush guards I could find.</li>
            <li> They are too small for my bigger brushes, like powder and blush.</li>
            <li> They help keep by brushes from getting dust or other bacteria on them when they are not in use.  </li>
            <li> However they look straight on website picture but in person they are curly and warped in slightly different length as were hand cutting from a mesh roll which I can buy on Ebay for just about $3/ one meter.</li>
            <li> I was afraid that my brushes would not dry in the middle because the fibers are pushed together but</li>
            <li> I got this in few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> even my thickest brush dried with these on.  </li>
            <li> They compress the bristles together to straighten your kabuki-style brushes and taper your round and tapered style brushes.  </li>
            <li> THESE WILL NOT FIT EYE BRUSHES.  </li>
            <li> The shapers fell apart after a few uses.</li>
            <li> But the main problem is that they are an awkward in between size.</li>
            <li> Too stiff that destroy the brush heads!!</li>
            <li> I mean it still holds, but I would prefer it tighter.</li>
            <li> I had to take off the guards because I was afraid of mold.</li>
            <li> AND IT&#x27;S A VERY BAD IDEA!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> These brush guards provide a great protection for make-up brushes at a terrific price. I&#x27;ve tried others at a more expensive price, but these match their quality.</li>
            <li> Fits most brushes. Great for thicker brushes. Not for thinner brushes like liners, lip, etc</li>
            <li> There good. They work perfectly for me.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Fits all my brushes, some can be doubled (smaller Brushes). Just what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> These were a good buy for the price. I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much money for a similar item that was 2x the price. Did what they were supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I have thought that these brush guards have professional quality. However they look straight on website picture but in person they are curly and warped in slightly different length as were hand cutting from a mesh roll which I can buy on Ebay for just about $3/ one meter.

            <li> Love these! They help keep my brushes looking new.</li>
            <li> Too stiff that destroy the brush heads!!</li>
            <li> These are great! They adjust easily depending on the size of brushes. Good price! I&#x27;m  happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome and gets the job done. It is best for big brushes not small brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 TIP: FOR PEOPLE WHO CLEAN THEIR BRUSHES AND THEN PUT ON THE BRUSH GUARD AND WAIT FOR THEM TO DRY, BUT ARE IMPATIENT WITH WAITING FOR THEM TO DRY, KNOW THAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE DECIDED TO TAKE A BLOW DRYER TO THEIR BRUSHES WHILE THE BRUSH GUARD WAS ON....THAT IS A BIG NO NO AND IT&#x27;S A VERY BAD IDEA! THE HEAT WILL DAMAGE THE BRUSH GUARD AND IT WILL NOT HAVE IT&#x27;S SKINNY FORM ANYMORE. IT WILL HAVE EXPANDED THE MATERIAL AND WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO HOLD THE BRUSHES OR KEEP THEM IN IT&#x27;S PROPER FORM. SO DON&#x27;T DO THAT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF YOU ARE REALLY THAT IMPATIENT IN WAITING FOR THEM TO DRY, DRY THE BRUSHES WITH THE BLOW DRYER FIRST AND THEN ONCE THEY&#x27;RE DRY PUT THE BRUSH GUARDS ON THEM AND LEAVE THEM ALONE.</li>
            <li> I got this in few weeks ago. I love it. That is very nice.  Have nice a day.  Good job</li>
            <li> These little do-kickeys are awesome!  I was afraid that my brushes would not dry in the middle because the fibers are pushed together but even my thickest brush dried with these on.  This package of 15 will last me a very long time, even with 5 brushes!  They seem to hold up very well and are a great value because they can be reused over and over.  I am ordering some for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Great for after you have washed your brushes.  I bought these small ones and use them on all of my brushes, even the big ones.  Wonderful for traveling too.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t fancy about these brush guards but they work great. You get a lot in one bag so it is great if you was many brushes at one time.</li>
            <li> I like these better than the name brand ones!  They are soft and flexible.  They compress the bristles together to straighten your kabuki-style brushes and taper your round and tapered style brushes.  For a size refrence, these fit small blush brushes, the small tapered brushes (sigma) and dual-fiber brushes all the way up to my largest powder brush (sigma), wide handled kabuki, and body brushes.  THESE WILL NOT FIT EYE BRUSHES.  The only brand I have found that fits eye brushes is the Brush Guard brand smallest size. (stiff guards, not my favorite, but come in samll sizes)</li>
            <li> it took a little longer than what I expected, but it sure was worth the wait! Amazing quality for a very good price :)</li>
            <li> These are good if you are just starting out in make up and learning to wash your brushes. I would recommend buying a brush tree instead which is what I will be doing soon. The work best for bigger brushes like foundation or blush but not so much shadow brushes. I had to group the smaller ones together. Not a bad product just better options out there.</li>
            <li> Brush gaurd are sturdier</li>
            <li> I received my order fairly quick and the items were just as expected. Thanks you very much! These guards are wonderful for all my makeup brushes. It allows my to take my brushes birth me in any bag without damaging the bristles.</li>
            <li> I needed several brush guards that were affordable after my 2yr old son decided to rip all the other ones I had. I came across the Makeup Cosmetic Beauty Brush Pen Guards on Amazon and thought &amp;#34;Wow this is a very good deal&amp;#34; and purchased it. Although it took several weeks to arrive from oversea, I was pleasantly surprise at how well the guards worked. For the same price as my old brush guards I received double the the amount and can now dry all my makeup brushes all at once after cleaning with several unused extra guards to spare.</li>
            <li> These qork great for letting my brushes dry upside down (to protect the ferrel from water damage) while keeping their shape and form in the process.  Love them!</li>
            <li> These do a great job shaping my brushes after I wash them and while storing them.  They fit all different brush sizes and can be trimmed to fit even the shortest yet plum little brushes.</li>
            <li> These guards are much better quality and protect my brushes as good as more expensive guards.  I really like using these for travel and after I wash my brushes while drying, to reshape the bristles.  These brush guards are very versatile; I keep them on my brushes all the time, even while they are in the drawer, so they keep their original shape.  I would recommend these for drying, reshaping, and travel to protect your bristles because they are so great!</li>
            <li> I like this product. I&#x27;ve 3 months with it and help to protect my brush set really well. Easy to clean. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> these were okayyy they hold big brushes and medium brushes well not lil brushes though i recommend these brush guard</li>
            <li> They work great- my brushes have never looked or felt better than when drying in these. Need to order more!</li>
            <li> I bought these because they were cheaper than any other brush guards I could find. And I think they hold up well. But the main problem is that they are an awkward in between size. They are too small for my bigger brushes, like powder and blush. And too big for my eye brushes. I also find that when you put these on the brushes, the brushes don&#x27;t dry. I waited two days and they were still damp. I had to take off the guards because I was afraid of mold.</li>
            <li> I washed by makeup brushes and ang them upside down to dry. Then I put these brush guards on and the bristles stayed in shape.</li>
            <li> Purchased these because of the reviews and they really work great. Slide the guards over the makeup brushes after washing them and they  keep the bristles from flairing out while drying.  I also keep them on my brushes when not in use or during travel to keep the bristles in place and ready for use.  The guards go back to their skinny shape when you remove them from the makeup brushes.  Great little product which arrived much earlier than expected.  There was an issue with my order which was handled quickly by both Amazon and E-Tribe. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product and this seller.  These guards are a must have if you use makeup brushes. I think you&#x27;ll be happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Happy I found these. They hold the bristles together nicely after washing them.</li>
            <li> These work great to protect the makeup brushes and help keep them in shape.</li>
            <li> These were not what I was looking for. They work better on big brushes then with smaller brushes. Easily ripped.</li>
            <li> Great stocking stuffer!  My daughter uses these to protect her makeup brushes and they were a great purchase for the price:0)</li>
            <li> I bought other brush guards but this one is better because it is almost one size fits all, and it is light enough to shape the brush but still allows air in so it dries faster than other ones thicker and less flexible.</li>
            <li> Hi everyone, This is a great product, works excellent for all my face brushes even the really big ones if you are wondering, the only reason I&#x27;m not giving it five stars is because they are not small enough for my eye brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy these again, no doubt about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy....</li>
            <li> This is really good. I love the quality and the quantity. I have tiny brushes to giant face brushes. The thing I like about it is that it doesn&#x27;t stretch out. I can use it for my giant brush and reuse it for my mini brush. I would like it if it were slightly tighter to hold my mini brushes better tho. I mean it still holds, but I would prefer it tighter.</li>
            <li> Satisfied w merchandise</li>
            <li> excellent way to protect brushes</li>
            <li> My wife used them on all her brushes.  I use one on my shaving cream brush.  It keeps the brushes from fraying out when they dry.</li>
            <li> Genius! They work great.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly and shapes my brushes exactly. I also like the purple because the little things make me smile.</li>
            <li> These are a perfect addition to your brushes - they keep the bristles in shape when drying and also stop them from getting mangled in your make up bag.</li>
            <li> got these today, they are what they look like in the picture! I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> I really like these.  They help keep by brushes from getting dust or other bacteria on them when they are not in use.  I also use them to help dry my brushes after I clean them.</li>
            <li> These work just as well as the more expensive ones, and they&#x27;re purple!</li>
            <li> I had an old set of makeup shapers that I tried to trim down. Big mistake. The shapers fell apart after a few uses. I ordered these for a replacement  and they work great. Just don&#x27;t trim them! The only thing I wish was different was that there were smaller sizes mixed in with the bigger sizes. The pieces are fantastic for big brushes (foundation, power, blush), but the &amp;#34;one size fits all&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t shape the smaller eye brushes.</li>
            <li> So far okay and they do the job but material is very flimsy and they are already falling apart after just a few weeks in my makeup bag.</li>
