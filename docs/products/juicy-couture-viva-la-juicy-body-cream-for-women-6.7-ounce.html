            <li>Love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is so sexy</li>
            <li>, I purchase the lotion a while ago, luv the body cream better.</li>
            <li>I love the texture of the cream, but there is an additive that makes the scent a bit off.  </li>
            <li>If the scent was better, this would rate a 5.</li>

            <li>u get cheap.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using it.  </li>
            <li>and this one is super moisturizing and rich.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is very feminine, floral but not cloying and subtly sexy.  </li>
            <li>Layering on the perfume on top of the body creme would be too much, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>so it got finished quick</li>
            <li>This body creme is enough on its own.  </li>
            <li>;D  </li>

            <li>It came sealed and boxed just like from the manufacture directly.</li>
            <li>Bought two so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; enough for her to use in keeping her skin hydrated without feeling like she&#x27;s using an old woman product.  </li>

            <li> The jar is quite large for a body creme, and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It hold the small much longer</li>
            <li> or i&#x27;ve been deployed too long..</li>
            <li> I was so excited when i found out i could purchase it at amazon,only for them to send me a fake version,with no smell.</li>
            <li> Makes the perfume last longer and requires less perfume.</li>
            <li> This cream had absolutely NO SMELL that resembled the perfume....</li>
            <li> A little dab goes a long way.</li>
            <li> i ordered this body cream because i recently purchase the set at Macys and fell in love,the lotion was small</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy or greasy and it hasn&#x27;t broken me out like some other products did.</li>
            <li> and since i used it everyday.</li>
            <li> These people are bad shi crazy</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I am very disappointed in this product.</li>

            <li> Smells great, I really love this product. Will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> I was initially so excited to get this because I LOVE the perfume.  This cream had absolutely NO SMELL that resembled the perfume....it just smelled like regular lotion with no scent.  Needless to say, I am very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Love this body cream. It makes my skin feel so silky. It&#x27;s not heavy or greasy and it hasn&#x27;t broken me out like some other products did. And it smells soooo good.</li>
            <li> This body cream is amazing....love it. I have bought it from amazon about 4 times now. The smell is great. I always get many many compliments on the smell. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Viva La Juicy perfume for years and wanted this to add to the fragrance.  This cream didn&#x27;t smell at all like the perfume itself so I returned it without any hassle at all.  Refund was prompt and great customer service!</li>
            <li> Great texture, feels great, smells wonderful!  Juicy and fruity and very feminine, makes me feel young and saucy.  Borrowed my niece&#x27;s and loved it, so I bought my own!</li>
            <li> It came sealed and boxed just like from the manufacture directly. I got lots of compliments and  turn many heads (from both males &amp; females)...sweet! ;D  P.S. Layer it with both the powder and perfume....Scent lasted for a good 6 hour. I know where to buy for my next set of all three !!!</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful. Lasts a lifetime (if you use it occasionally).</li>
            <li> Bought this for my teen daughter at Christmas time and she uses daily.  It&#x27;s &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; enough for her to use in keeping her skin hydrated without feeling like she&#x27;s using an old woman product.  Smell is nice, not overwhelming at all.</li>

            <li> This body cream is luscious! Goes on smooth and helps perfume last-will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance. The creme smells just like the perfume. A little dab goes a long way. Makes the perfume last longer and requires less perfume.</li>
            <li> Good product for the money.  This is a great fragrance and not over powering.  I would buy it again. Thanks</li>
            <li> Gave this to my bestie as a gift and she loves it! Must have for any Juicy couture lover!!  Great price too!</li>
            <li> This was a gift and she loved it.It wasn&#x27;t a fragrance I would have chosen but then perfume is very personal.</li>
            <li> Love this! Smells great and goes on so smooth! I bought the perfume too! All of it smells great! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This body cream smells wonderful, layers well, and gives skin a soft sheen.  I&#x27;m on my third jar, and if you like a moisturizing body cream, you will love this.</li>
            <li> awesome, a very good price and I love the smell!</li>
            <li> This fragrance is so sexy and I receive numerous compliments from women, men and even kids lol. When I am close running out I quickly order more</li>
            <li> I luv this body cream, I purchase the lotion a while ago, luv the body cream better. It hold the small much longer and I also like the thickness of it. It smells really well along withthe perfume.</li>
            <li> I love the texture of the cream, but there is an additive that makes the scent a bit off.  If the scent was better, this would rate a 5. As is, it is just &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> These people are bad shi crazy the lotion smells just like the perfume or i&#x27;ve been deployed too long.. Anyways I love the lotion its perfect and shipped very fast :)</li>
            <li> I hove Viva La Juicy, and was happy to get this at a great value, compared to Macy&#x27;s at $55.  Bought two so far.</li>
            <li> I bought this jar for $11 at TJ Maxx and I&#x27;m thrilled with my purchase.  I love perfumed body lotion and creme and this one is super moisturizing and rich.  The fragrance is very feminine, floral but not cloying and subtly sexy.  I love the original Juicy Couture fragrance and so when I saw this, I had to have it.  The jar is quite large for a body creme, and a little bit goes a long way. I have received numerous compliments on it too.  I&#x27;m thinking of going back and buying another one!  I have many difference perfumes and the lotion and creme forms are a great way to try new ones, especially when I can get them for such a reasonable price.  The fragrance lasts quite a while.  Layering on the perfume on top of the body creme would be too much, in my opinion.  This body creme is enough on its own.  I really enjoy using it.  I heartily recommend this product, but you may want to check out the discount stores before you spend money on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling lotion !! I get lots of compliments every time I wear it! You won&#x27;t regret this purchase!</li>
