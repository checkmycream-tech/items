    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It first appeared to be okay, within a day or two-- it made my hair hard and dry in the roots. So my hair started shedding.  I have fine shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> The best hair treatment money can buy. I have been using this product for so many years and will recommend it for all hair types. I have very thick hair and it still works great. If you have thinning hair it is great to massage into scalp, you will be surprised how much your hair will grow. Don&#x27;t be without it when you perm or color your hair.. Love, Love, Love it.</li>
            <li> The Fantasia Leave In Treatment Hair &amp; Scalp was recommended to me by my hairdresser. I was going &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; after many years of using chemicals and heat to style my hair. I purchased a bottle and was satisfied with it. I couldn&#x27;t find it in my area so decided to go online to purchase in quantity so I would not run out of it too soon. I&#x27;m not a specialist on scalp conditions, but it seems to help my scalp feel less sensitive and the formerly thin areas of my hair appears thicker.&lt;br /&gt;--CM</li>
            <li> I brought this product a couple weeks ago and I noticed when I got my hair done with it, it actually made my hair very course, and grainy in other words nappy. Its contains alot of vitamins and minerals in it which attracted me to the product, but the fact that it makes my hair so grainy, stopped me from using the product.  I have thin short hair personally I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Been using this forever. Great for itchy scalp, and also is a super leave-in conditioner that does not leave the hair limp and lifeless.</li>
            <li> I use this product when I style my hair in individual braids. I pour it into a spray bottle and use it in conjunction with my Aphogee Green Tea Reconstructor spray. I utilize this product every other day (when wearing braids). It aids with balancing my hair&#x27;s pH level and prevents split ends.</li>
            <li> I have used this since 1970 excellent for cradle cap dry itchy scalp &amp; it is great for ur hair!  I had a hard time finding it I am a hairdresser I can not even in a beauty supply store!!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. Makes your hair healthy very quickly.. I received it in just a couple of days. Thank you.</li>
            <li> this product is the best money can buy..and look at its price!!!i have dyed and dry hair.this product makes the hair so silky and full...you will not be disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> Love the product..glad I found this product on Amazon</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 21 years and I still swear by it.  If your hair is damaged IN ANY WAY, it&#x27;s to your advantage &amp; your hair, to try this.  I use a lot of the Fantasia products &amp; would never switch.  The only problem is the&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;IC&amp;#34; is hard to find but I know I can count on Amazon to have it available.</li>
            <li> This Leave In Treatment is the best I have found for dry, damaged hair or dry scalp.  I especially like this product after a perm which dries out my scalp and causes itching -- that is when I alternate using this product with the Fantasia IC with Aloe</li>
            <li> It worked really well</li>
            <li> Excellent leave in treatment.  I strayed and purchased others out of convenience and/or availability.This although hard to find otg performs better and more consistently then others like infusium 23.  I also got tired of sticky hair.  No need to wash daily or every few days with this. It won&#x27;t build up and leaves hair strong and moisturized. I need and would buy this and leave in moisturizing formula by the gallon. Good buy.</li>
            <li> Bleached my hair and it was like straw.. But daily use ofthis product restored hydration and nutrients to make it soft and healthy again. Easy to use, smells great too</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about four years. I am an African American woman and it works great on relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this along with my IC heat protectant, which I love, but didn&#x27;t notice anything exceptional. I haven&#x27;t used it since the first couple of tries...will give it another shot soon and see what happens.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 15+ years.  This is my only conditioner.  Recommend anyone try it for 1 month.  It you are at the beach and can&#x27;t get the soap out of your hair this will solve that problem.</li>
            <li> Great seller.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to take time to review this product that has been soooo misunderstood. There are many reviews negatives and positive as well that it is quite confusing. Fantasia leave-in its a \\&quot;cocktail\\&quot; of vitamins and proteins. Therefore it DOES works but also after some time your hair could or will feel \\&quot;hard\\&quot;. This happens when you have excess of proteins build-up. Too many proteins makes your hair feels like hard. Same with body builders, right? That doesn&#x27;t means your hair is damage, wasted or became coarse. The purpose is to protect and repair (if possible) the damage that has been done to your hair. It is NOT a moisturizer for hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; We need to learn how to read instructions!! Clearly in the bottle says: For damage, permed, bleach..so on ..hair. You can use it in healthy hair though not necessary. If you do, use it less often. After some time, let your hair rest from this product and then start again. So easy like that. I highly recommend it after bleaching your hair or perm. You can use more if you will pick up your hair in a bun (so you don&#x27;t care if feels a bit hard or not). Use less if will blow dry your hair (because you don&#x27;t want to pull your hair that feels hard). The hardness will go away after rinsing your hair or next time shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product:&lt;br /&gt;Comes in a plastic bottle, this  in particular was an extra size (taller bottle). Its a clear liquid with a light aroma that vanish after some time. It contains proteins and vitamins for the hair, but in the list of ingredients you can see all that appears in the bottle description. UNLESS, maybe they do have it but with \\&quot;weird\\&quot; names that we don&#x27;t know what they are or means. Well, some of them we can recognize. Does not leave your hair sticky after dry (though feel slightly sticky in your hands), dries same as water dries in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Experience with the product:&lt;br /&gt;3 persons with different purposes used this product. One had bleached hair, the other coarse dry hair and the third one normal straight hair. In all cases it worked like a charm, but the BEST results was in the bleach hair. Constant use improves the elasticity and strength of the hair, hair look and FEELS less damage. Nonetheless, moisture levels did not improve significantly. (Using it weekly and sometimes 2 times per week) In all cases hardness went away after rinsing the hair, actually the hair felt very soft after that. So I guess it is a temporary hardness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller:&lt;br /&gt;The package was received as promise, on time. It came in a box with a simple wrap. No problems whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;If you use the product directly from the bottle you will waste too much of it. It is better to use a spray bottle. Soak your hair and let dry IF you will NOT blow dry your hair, or will stay at home or use a cap. Whatever. If you blow dry your hair use less quantity to avoid the feeling of \\&quot;hard\\&quot;. Also, after the product has dry out you can apply some drops of moisturizing oil to your hair. That DEFINITELY will counterattack the hardness feeling. TESTED!!! if your hair is too damage use it for a whole month or more. If not, use for two weeks and rest 2 weeks before starting again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a nutshell:&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product at cheap price. To use it WHEN NEED IT, but not to abuse of it.
