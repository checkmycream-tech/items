            <li>It is the best blowdryer I have ever had.</li>
            <li>is the best!!</li>
            <li>I got this for Christmas, and immediately people started telling my hair looked great!</li>
            <li>This blow dryer is not an authentic CHI!!!  </li>
            <li>Great while it lasts.....</li>
            <li>I agree that it was great while it lasted.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get a receipt and they refuse to do ANYTHING to fix it, and when I googled how to fix it (because I love the dryer!)</li>
            <li>LOVE this dryer!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended from hair stylist, and as a girl who loves to look beautiful as a newlywed at the time (and now pregnant and want to be a beautiful preggo lady), of course I got one of these!  </li>
            <li>light but so strong!!  </li>
            <li>I have had many hairdryers and this was my favorite</li>
            <li>love my chi...</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d shop around and find better quality for the price.</li>
            <li>it is much more quieter than hers.</li>
            <li>The dryer itself is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>My cheap ConAir on the other hand, I&#x27;ve had for over 10 years, and it still works perfectly.</li>
            <li>Overall the hair dryer is really good.  </li>
            <li>I LOVED it and used it 2-3 times a week, personal use, never dropped it</li>
            <li>Drys hair quickly without damage.</li>
            <li>It dries my hair fairly quickly and efficiently.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Dries my hair so quickly and thoroughly.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with my hair dryer until it recently quit working.</li>
            <li>But I miss my Chi, I just can&#x27;t bring myself to pay that kind of money again knowing it won&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>but this one is worth</li>
            <li>Worth every penny...</li>
            <li>Other than those things it works great and does seem to smooth my hair as opposed to making it look fried like my old hair dryers have done.</li>
            <li>There is barely any sound, but dries really quickly and leaves my hair super silky with no frizz</li>
            <li>blowdries my hair super fast.  </li>
            <li>The more recent purchase was 9/11.  </li>
            <li>Must&#x27;ve been looking pretty sad before LOL!</li>
            <li>My first one caught on fire where the cord enters the device.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy to see a more heavy duty cord on this model than was on my previous model.</li>
            <li>In addition, on the back of the dryer where you can remove the plastic part to clean the filter, the word CHI is on the plastic part!  </li>
            <li>My Revlon dryer has the large plug(transformer?)just as this one does</li>
            <li>the reading was very high.</li>
            <li>The quality of the hair dryer really does make a difference in how your hair looks.</li>
            <li>So much for quality.</li>
            <li>the cheap ConAir blow dryers last longer than that.</li>
            <li>I have owned several CHI dryers and the real CHI dryers are nothing like this one!!!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe a product of this quality is available for sale, not to mention at such a high price point.</li>
            <li>, it was super hot and super quiet and dried my hair faster then my old $30 dryer.</li>
            <li>Both times, after about 4 months, the hair dryer began making a very loud noise and started to smell of smoke.  </li>
            <li>Then the new one does the same thing that is why you see them at marshalls and TJ maxx!</li>
            <li>The plug  fits loose within the power receptacle and has fallen out with some fairly gentle movement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The main point is that I want the EMF&#x27;s at the blower end to be low, which it is very low on the Revlon unit (basically zero) but not with this unit (about 30-50).  </li>
            <li>Farouk systems offers a 2 year warranty and I wish I had purchased through them and not through an Amazon seller because they only offered a 1 year warranty.</li>
            <li>I bought my 12 year old dtr last year and</li>
            <li>The handle is a different shape (more sqaure), where as a real CHI has a rounded handle, the cool shot does not work and the dryer makes a weird noise when shut off (like two small beeps).  </li>
            <li>It is much heavier than a real Chi, the cord looks like an industrial cord because of how thick it is.  </li>

            <li> But it&#x27;s 5+ starts on performance as long as it&#x27;s working, but quality just isn&#x27;t there...</li>

            <li> i&#x27;ll never go back to any other blow dryer - chi</li>

            <li> So now it only blows cold air.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Right at a year, the heating element went out, no warning only cold air coming out.  </li>
            <li> , less expensive CHI blow dryer</li>
            <li> I found this is a VERY common thing to happen between 1 - 1/2 years - conveniently just out of warranty.  </li>
            <li> Manufacturor&#x27;s warranty is lousy: they want a 20% restocking fee even for a broken unit.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry but for a $100</li>
            <li> They make it difficult to return.</li>

            <li> This is a horrible company and they need to protect consumers against Chi!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I have purchased this blowdryer before and it lasted me for five years. When it finally quit I found it again on Amazon. It is the best blowdryer I have ever had. Drys hair quickly without damage.</li>
            <li> Overall the hair dryer is really good.  My two complaints are that it is very hot and there is no way to adjust that (besides the cold button) and it also doesn&#x27;t blow as hard as I would like.  Other than those things it works great and does seem to smooth my hair as opposed to making it look fried like my old hair dryers have done.</li>
            <li> I have had many hairdryers and this was my favorite, it was super hot and super quiet and dried my hair faster then my old $30 dryer. However after about 2 years the heating element went out and apparently that is a common problem for this hair dryer. So now it only blows cold air. I&#x27;m sorry but for a $100+ hair dryer it should last a LOT longer than 2 years. My cheap ConAir on the other hand, I&#x27;ve had for over 10 years, and it still works perfectly. But I miss my Chi, I just can&#x27;t bring myself to pay that kind of money again knowing it won&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> I have owned two of these hairdryers, and could not be more disappointed with their quality. My most recent purchase of the Chi Pro, made about a year ago, was especially frustrating not to mention dangerous. While using it, the ceramic interior actually exploded. I can&#x27;t believe a product of this quality is available for sale, not to mention at such a high price point. Do not buy this product.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with my hair dryer until it recently quit working. Farouk systems offers a 2 year warranty and I wish I had purchased through them and not through an Amazon seller because they only offered a 1 year warranty. I will no longer purchase these types of products through Amazon sellers.</li>
            <li> We have purchased 2 of these hair dryers starting in 2009.  The more recent purchase was 9/11.  Both times, after about 4 months, the hair dryer began making a very loud noise and started to smell of smoke.  I&#x27;m waiting to hear back from the seller regarding a refund.  I would avoid this product.</li>
            <li> Great while it lasts.....key word lasts.  Once it breaks if you arent in warrenty, they company doesnt care.  They DONT have a repair center.</li>
            <li> The dryer itself is pretty good.  It dries my hair fairly quickly and efficiently.  However, the cord is forever long and extremely bulky.  The plug  fits loose within the power receptacle and has fallen out with some fairly gentle movement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer specifically because it is supposed to be \\&quot;low EMF\\&quot;.  I have an EMF meter and it emits three times the EMF&#x27;s than my ordinary Revlon hair dryer.  My Revlon dryer has the large plug(transformer?)just as this one does which I think keeps the EMF&#x27;s farther away from the unit. The main point is that I want the EMF&#x27;s at the blower end to be low, which it is very low on the Revlon unit (basically zero) but not with this unit (about 30-50).  At the blower end that would be next to your head the reading was very high. I can only conclude this is either a defective unit or a scam.</li>
            <li> This is a horrible company. They are producing dryers they know spark and catch on FIRE! Their dryers are a fire hazard &amp; they know it! They make it difficult to return. Charge for shipping and replacements and you pay to ship FIRE HAZARD back! Then the new one does the same thing that is why you see them at marshalls and TJ maxx! Be vary careful! This is a horrible company and they need to protect consumers against Chi!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; *** Warranty VOID**** if NOT purchased through salon!!!! SO if you buy on here NADA! Really Horrible company!</li>
            <li> love my chi...light but so strong!!  i&#x27;ll never go back to any other blow dryer - chi is the best!!</li>
            <li> This I the third Chi dryer I&#x27;ve bought. I love it. The quality of the hair dryer really does make a difference in how your hair looks.</li>
            <li> blowdries my hair super fast.  There is barely any sound, but dries really quickly and leaves my hair super silky with no frizz</li>
            <li> Highly recommended from hair stylist, and as a girl who loves to look beautiful as a newlywed at the time (and now pregnant and want to be a beautiful preggo lady), of course I got one of these!  I LOVED it and used it 2-3 times a week, personal use, never dropped it (because I wanted it to last for years... it&#x27;s an \\&quot;investment\\&quot; right?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right at a year, the heating element went out, no warning only cold air coming out.  I called, told them because I purchased it from my hair stylist I didn&#x27;t get a receipt and they refuse to do ANYTHING to fix it, and when I googled how to fix it (because I love the dryer!) I found this is a VERY common thing to happen between 1 - 1/2 years - conveniently just out of warranty.  I don&#x27;t have the money to spend $100+ every year on a dryer....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guess I either have to figure out how to fix it or find another brand.  But it&#x27;s 5+ starts on performance as long as it&#x27;s working, but quality just isn&#x27;t there... I&#x27;d shop around and find better quality for the price.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s my 20% restocking fee...don&#x27;t buy this dryer if it matters to you that it costs $100 and lasts less than a year.  So much for quality.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is not an authentic CHI!!!  It is much heavier than a real Chi, the cord looks like an industrial cord because of how thick it is.  The handle is a different shape (more sqaure), where as a real CHI has a rounded handle, the cool shot does not work and the dryer makes a weird noise when shut off (like two small beeps).  In addition, on the back of the dryer where you can remove the plastic part to clean the filter, the word CHI is on the plastic part!  I have owned several CHI dryers and the real CHI dryers are nothing like this one!!!</li>
            <li> Manufacturor&#x27;s warranty is lousy: they want a 20% restocking fee even for a broken unit.  For less than that, I replaced it with a different hair dryer.</li>
            <li> LOVE this dryer!  I have never paid this amount of money for a dryer but this one is worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;Dries my hair so quickly and thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this blow dryer. I had it only for 1 year and then stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even the cheap ConAir blow dryers last longer than that.</li>
            <li> I had this blow dryer for almost 10 years and it died last fall (plug short circuited). My hair hasn&#x27;t been the same since! I got this for Christmas, and immediately people started telling my hair looked great! Must&#x27;ve been looking pretty sad before LOL! My hair dries in a quarter of the time with this than the different lower en, less expensive CHI blow dryer I bought my 12 year old dtr last year and it is much more quieter than hers. I am so happy to see a more heavy duty cord on this model than was on my previous model. I hope it lasts just as long. I will buy another one when it does!! Worth every penny...</li>
            <li> I agree that it was great while it lasted.  My first one caught on fire where the cord enters the device.  Thought that it was a freak event and I purchased a second one...that one began sparking and smoking at the outlet itself.  Will NOT fall victim a third time!  BEWARE!!!</li>
