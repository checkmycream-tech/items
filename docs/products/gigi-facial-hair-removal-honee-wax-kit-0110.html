    <ol>
            <li>Excellent product.</li>
            <li>Since it seems my skin or talent is not conducive to using this product, I ended up giving the kit to a beautician and she was happy with it!</li>
            <li>works great!</li>
            <li>the strips aren&#x27;t the best sizes for waxing your eyebrows or lip area</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>This machine is wonderful.</li>
            <li>The wax is great and all the lotions are wonderful too.</li>
            <li>Great set, great deal, used often  </li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>so happy to have this product</li>
            <li>NIECE EXPERIENCED THIS</li>
            <li>an experienced waxer been doing it for years.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t have purchased a better Gigi!!</li>
            <li>Fantastic product!!!</li>
            <li>Good return policy.</li>
            <li>Over all it was a good purchase.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased.  </li>
            <li>She has used it many many times and has had no issues it works great and made her happy.</li>
            <li>Great product and is very visually appealing on the bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li>I love the GiGi Kit!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just as good as going to the salon but better..</li>
            <li>and my husband is happy that i am once again hair free! :-)</li>
            <li>Very easy to use</li>
            <li>Easy to use!  </li>
            <li>the warmer works excellently and keeps the wax warm for a long time</li>
            <li>Great company because they carry the whole line of quality products for reordering.</li>
            <li>the kit comes with 5 different samples of gigi, after-wax products; i like the cooling gel the best.  </li>
            <li>the one thing that could make this kit better would be an instruction dvd.</li>
            <li>After about 6 months of use the brown top cracked...</li>
            <li>The rest of the kit seemed ok.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this item..</li>
            <li>much better than those microwave wax kits.</li>
            <li>It calls for a powder that does not come with the kit yet for what I needed, there were more sample products than I  will ever use.  </li>
            <li>Is really good wax, hair came right off</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good kit for beinners; it&#x27;s my first one, and i&#x27;ll probably stick with the gigi brand.  </li>
            <li>Bcuz u can do it yourself for free..:)</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast and the kit is great.</li>
            <li>It was my first time using a wax kit on my own</li>
            <li>The warmer took about 20 mins to warm the wax with the first use but ever since its warmed in 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>wax gets hot quickly applies nicely and everything stays organized and clean!</li>
            <li>the warmer is compact and the wax is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Was excited to get it.  </li>
            <li>I like the idea of the cardboard rim to keep the can clean.  </li>
            <li>you literally have to let the wax completely cool for like two minutes before you pull off the strip, or it wont rip out all the hair.</li>
            <li>I love the kit comes witn a Manual of how to wax, very helpful.</li>
            <li>The wax is super super sticky&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great little kit.</li>
            <li>This was well worth the money and has paid for itself in two uses.</li>
            <li>She also got a laugh at my novice bumblings.</li>
            <li>the various cooling  and post waxing gels and creams are nice and do soothe the skin</li>
            <li>The warmer has different heat settings which is nice depending on if you are in a hurry to heat up the wax or not.  </li>
            <li>Super easy to use and professional results.</li>
            <li>I love the different lotions that come with the kit as well.  </li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly.</li>
            <li>I started reading the instructions and the first thing you need</li>
            <li>and I was able to get it to her as soon as possible.</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>the low medium high setting on the warm are a nice addition not seen on other models</li>
            <li>All that aside, the kit seems worth the price for someone familiar with waxing and proper skin type.</li>
            <li>I am familiar with the system as a professional hairstylist and would highly recommend this kit.  </li>
            <li>the wax is very sticky and this kit comes with everything</li>
            <li>FAST SHIPPER QUALITY PRODUCT</li>
            <li>Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- fast shipping</li>
            <li>I will try one more time but not sure this is right for me.</li>
            <li>I really like that this unit heats up so quickly, 1/2 hour or so, the one I currently have takes hours.  </li>
            <li>the price overall is pretty decent</li>
            <li>The instructions are very clear.</li>
            <li>So Amazon just rejected my first review with the guidelines,  not sure what was the problem but allow me to be more specific in my review&amp;#62;&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li>DVD and instruction manual gives clear directions.  </li>
            <li>so I managed to irritate the small area I tried to wax, OUCH, but the directions were easy to understand.  </li>
            <li>A little messy (I guess I need a little more practice) but is worth it!</li>
            <li>Waxed my entire face with no trouble.  </li>
            <li>The first try, I didn&#x27;t pull my skin as tight before pulling the wax off, so I got a minor skin tear.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> the wax is messy-sticky but not sticky enough to actually rip out hair So after all that pain,  only about every other hair actually comes off.  </li>
            <li> It stuck to my skin, dripped onto my sink (which I still can&#x27;t remove and is still sticky), and just made a complete mess.</li>
            <li> /&gt;WAX LEAVES SKIN DRY</li>
            <li> Will be saving $50 a month that I used to spent at the Salon.</li>
            <li> I just did my eyebrows and lip, it actually hurts less than getting it done at a salon!</li>
            <li> the wax trails a little (the stringy bit that hangs off the stick) but not as badly as other brands.  </li>
            <li> My face broke out into tons of little pimples for 2 weeks afterward.</li>
            <li> This little box of supplies has all you could need in it.  </li>
            <li> the little rest that comes with it has no instructions,</li>
            <li> I had to email the company to find out what to do with the little bent metal - HINT it goes inside the wax jar to avoid dripping wax</li>
            <li> the little disc they give you to catch wax is flimsy and can&#x27;t be cleaned so you&#x27;ll be ordering those forever&lt;</li>
            <li> If you attempt to move it around it gets extremely messy.</li>
            <li> May have just wasted my money.</li>
            <li> The warmer works and there are quite a few accessories.</li>
            <li> The wax is a little thick, but still manageable.</li>
            <li> and I have a small rash</li>
            <li> but that is just a personal preference there isn&#x27;t anything wrong they get the job done.</li>
            <li> No more trips to the salon for waxing.</li>
            <li> On the downside;  there are 5 small bottles that came with the pkg that I found useless and threw away.  </li>
            <li> BUT the wax remover,  which also is useless as it doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I have used this twice now and it seems to be very difficult.</li>
            <li> SO BAD AFTER WAXING&lt;br</li>
            <li> Terrible do not waist your money</li>
            <li> The honee wax is absolutely AWFUL.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> If you think about each visit you make to the salon to get your eyebrows done....anywhere from 8-10-12-14 dollars....this pays for itself within 5 uses.  I have used this numerous times and have not ran out of any of the products.  Very pleased with it.  You do need a designated place to keep it tho.  If you attempt to move it around it gets extremely messy.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. This was well worth the money and has paid for itself in two uses. Great company because they carry the whole line of quality products for reordering. Would recommend this waxer over all others.</li>
            <li> Used just about everything in the box. It was my first time using a wax kit on my own and I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> Great set, great deal, used often  and I&#x27;m very pleased.  Did end up with 3 mystery metal pieces though. Still don&#x27;t know what those are to this day</li>
            <li> I love the GiGi Kit!  Very easy to use and it pays for itself in a short period of time (instead of going to the salon).  I love the different lotions that come with the kit as well.  Definitely recommed it.</li>
            <li> I just did my eyebrows and lip, it actually hurts less than getting it done at a salon!, I wish it came with the cream removal for wax stuck on your fingers or hair but I used alcohol it worked. FYI do not over wax areas, I did on one side of my eyebrow and I have a small rash but that was my fault, as they do in salons just finish off with the tweezers instead of going over the area.</li>
            <li> the warmer is compact and the wax is fantastic.  the wax trails a little (the stringy bit that hangs off the stick) but not as badly as other brands.  the kit comes with 5 different samples of gigi, after-wax products; i like the cooling gel the best.  the kit also comes with an instruction booklet and different sized sticks.  it&#x27;s a good kit for beinners; it&#x27;s my first one, and i&#x27;ll probably stick with the gigi brand.  the one thing that could make this kit better would be an instruction dvd.</li>
            <li> I have used this twice now and it seems to be very difficult. I will try one more time but not sure this is right for me. The reason I purchased was to save time and money by having to make appointments at the salon. May have just wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Terrible do not waist your money I through mine out after one use.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It came with everything you would need to wax including a lot of different types of lotions for after waxing and a pre-conditioner. I would recommend this product to everyone who waxes regularly!</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife who wanted to try and wax from home. She has used it many many times and has had no issues it works great and made her happy. After about 6 months of use the brown top cracked... not sure why im guessing the prolonged heat and cool down is what did it so be carefull if you buy this and want the cover to last.</li>
            <li> The honee wax is absolutely AWFUL. I followed the directions exactly. It stuck to my skin, dripped onto my sink (which I still can&#x27;t remove and is still sticky), and just made a complete mess. I couldn&#x27;t get it off of my face, nor did it remove any hair whatsoever. My face broke out into tons of little pimples for 2 weeks afterward. I was embarrassed to be seen. I threw it in the garbage. The rest of the kit seemed ok. The warmer works and there are quite a few accessories.</li>
            <li> Great little kit. This little box of supplies has all you could need in it.  I have never used wax before so I managed to irritate the small area I tried to wax, OUCH, but the directions were easy to understand.  Since it seems my skin or talent is not conducive to using this product, I ended up giving the kit to a beautician and she was happy with it! She also got a laugh at my novice bumblings. All that aside, the kit seems worth the price for someone familiar with waxing and proper skin type.</li>
            <li> Was excited to get it.  It came with numerous bottles of lotions and potions.  I started reading the instructions and the first thing you need to do use their powder to treat the skin before anything can be done and there was none included.  Called the company and they said it was not included.  Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I really like that this unit heats up so quickly, 1/2 hour or so, the one I currently have takes hours.  I like the idea of the cardboard rim to keep the can clean.  On the downside;  there are 5 small bottles that came with the pkg that I found useless and threw away.  The one item they should add is an oil to remove the wax on your hands and wherever it may drip</li>
            <li> So Amazon just rejected my first review with the guidelines,  not sure what was the problem but allow me to be more specific in my review&amp;#62;&lt;br /&gt;1) the wax is very sticky and this kit comes with everything BUT the wax remover,  which also is useless as it doesn&#x27;t work&lt;br /&gt;2) the wax is messy-sticky but not sticky enough to actually rip out hair So after all that pain,  only about every other hair actually comes off.  I tried it both on the face and on the legs,  I ordered 2 kinds of wax -- neither worked.&lt;br /&gt;3) the stuff drips all over the place&lt;br /&gt;4) the little rest that comes with it has no instructions, no photos and I had to email the company to find out what to do with the little bent metal - HINT it goes inside the wax jar to avoid dripping wax&lt;br /&gt;5) the little disc they give you to catch wax is flimsy and can&#x27;t be cleaned so you&#x27;ll be ordering those forever&lt;br /&gt;6) did I mention the wax doesn&#x27;t get the hair off --- that was a deal breaker for me,  I sent it back.  Good return policy.</li>
            <li> I have used this twice, on eyebrows and upper lip. The first try, I didn&#x27;t pull my skin as tight before pulling the wax off, so I got a minor skin tear. The second time, I did it correctly and no problem. The wax is a little thick, but still manageable. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this item.. It&#x27;s just as good as going to the salon but better.. Bcuz u can do it yourself for free..:) comes with all the products u need!!! Couldn&#x27;t have purchased a better Gigi!!</li>
            <li> FAST SHIPPER QUALITY PRODUCT</li>
            <li> works great! wax gets hot quickly applies nicely and everything stays organized and clean! much better than those microwave wax kits. so happy to have this product and my husband is happy that i am once again hair free! :-) hehe</li>
            <li> I bought this because i couldn&#x27;t stand the thought of paying $21 every wax when this was so inexpensive. This is salon quality. The wax is great and all the lotions are wonderful too. The warmer took about 20 mins to warm the wax with the first use but ever since its warmed in 10 minutes. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this kit is the wax strips but that is just a personal preference there isn&#x27;t anything wrong they get the job done. Overall i would this again !</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;- the warmer works excellently and keeps the wax warm for a long time&lt;br /&gt;- the low medium high setting on the warm are a nice addition not seen on other models&lt;br /&gt;- the various cooling  and post waxing gels and creams are nice and do soothe the skin&lt;br /&gt;- the price overall is pretty decent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The wax is super super sticky&lt;br /&gt;- No excess wax remover is included ( I went out and bought baby oil instead)&lt;br /&gt;- Wish there was a how to video for beginners&lt;br /&gt;- the strips aren&#x27;t the best sizes for waxing your eyebrows or lip area (I had to cut them smaller)&lt;br /&gt;- you literally have to let the wax completely cool for like two minutes before you pull off the strip, or it wont rip out all the hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my niece for Christmas.  I am familiar with the system as a professional hairstylist and would highly recommend this kit.  It came promptly and I was able to get it to her as soon as possible.</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast and the kit is great. Is really good wax, hair came right off and I&#x27;m not an expert! I love the kit comes witn a Manual of how to wax, very helpful. Will be saving $50 a month that I used to spent at the Salon. A little messy (I guess I need a little more practice) but is worth it!</li>
            <li> Easy to use!  DVD and instruction manual gives clear directions.  Waxed my entire face with no trouble.  Fantastic product!!!</li>
            <li> NEVER AGAIN !&lt;br /&gt;CHEESE CLOTH THIN&lt;br /&gt;WAX LEAVES SKIN DRY&lt;br /&gt;AND ALL THE GELS ETC&lt;br /&gt;ESPECIALLY SOOTHING GEL&lt;br /&gt;BURNS SO BAD AFTER WAXING&lt;br /&gt;DOESNT SOOTH AT ALL&lt;br /&gt;( MY PERSONAL AND MY GROWN NIECE EXPERIENCED THIS AND 6 DAYS LATER EYELIDS ARE CRUSTY AND I KEEP NEO SPIRIN ON THEM)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m an experienced waxer been doing it for years.</li>
            <li> Great product and is very visually appealing on the bathroom counter.  The warmer has different heat settings which is nice depending on if you are in a hurry to heat up the wax or not.  I really like it!</li>
            <li> I have no skill in hair removal and didn&#x27;t want to go sit around in a salon when I could do it myself.  The instructions are very clear. It calls for a powder that does not come with the kit yet for what I needed, there were more sample products than I  will ever use.  Over all it was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Great product! My wife is a cosmetologist and she LOVES it!</li>
            <li> This machine is wonderful. Paid for itself after two applications. Use it for eyebrows and upper lip. No more trips to the salon for waxing. Super easy to use and professional results.</li>
