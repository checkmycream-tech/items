            <li>so I won&#x27;t be able to evaluate based on doing my own nails</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just what I hoped it would be and better.  </li>
            <li>I love this tool.  </li>
            <li>im still learning to use the drill, and i think it should have better instructions.</li>

            <li>I love this machine.  </li>
            <li>I love the variable speed control.</li>
            <li>I am pleased to write that the seller responded to all of my inquiries in a timely fashion.  </li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>Ok, so I&#x27;m not mechanically inclined</li>
            <li>I love this unit and use it in the privacy of my home.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get the hang of it</li>
            <li>It was easy to learn to use and contains everything you need to maintain your acrylic nails (for the exception of the Acrylic Fill crystal/gel--which is an inexpensive additional cost).  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I would have liked having information on where to purchase additional buffer attachments when I first bought the MAXIM Pro Nail kit.  </li>
            <li>Other than that this is a good drill at a good price.</li>
            <li>and it worked just fine.  </li>
            <li>I had a cheap manicure set that is now in the trash, there is no comparison.</li>
            <li>Since quality is so important, don&#x27;t hesitate.  </li>
            <li>If it only came with the sanding bands I would have been happy.  </li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t say enough great things about this product.  </li>
            <li>And yes, all of the Dremmel attachments do fit his item.</li>
            <li>The company selling the item is shady at best.</li>
            <li>Now that I have this nail care kit pedicures are much easier and the results seem to be more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I found it easy to learn/use for my own personal use, and it&#x27;s also nice to use for natural manicures/pedicures for people who do not wear acrylic nails.</li>
            <li>Works great on natural and acrylic nails!!Comes with several attachments so you can start using it right away!</li>
            <li>If I wore acrylics I&#x27;d definitely use this to do touch ups and probably my own fill-ins.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>I received this drill in two days, much quicker than originally promised on the Amazon email.  </li>
            <li>- it is pretty powerful &amp; can be intimidating if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing (which without the manual, I didn&#x27;t); it is salon strength though</li>
            <li>AND IT STILL WORK LIKE THE FIRST DAY I GOT IT</li>
            <li>The only thing that it lacks is being able to use it in the reverse mode.</li>
            <li>THE REAL PROS USE!</li>
            <li>And dangerously hot during use.</li>
            <li>A Dremel tool would work much better and costs the same</li>
            <li>Not only do I do my own (natural &amp; acrylic) nails, but</li>
            <li>i really like this.</li>
            <li>have yet to find a product that really does the job to my liking but this one is o.k.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>When my wife asked for this I told we already had one in the garage with more power and half of the attachments she needed.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>this my 2nd one and i just love it lost the 1st in shipping back home</li>
            <li>Highly reccomend</li>
            <li>I love the concept of this product but the instructions that came with it were so bare bones minimal</li>
            <li>I just used it for the first time and it made the entire filing process so much easier versus manual nail files.  </li>
            <li>I will be getting a new set put on.  </li>
            <li>i dont think its very clear on how to change the bits either, but i figured it out.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Overall, this is a very decent drill.</li>
            <li>So far I have had this item about 1 hour</li>
            <li>It feels durable and will probably complete the task I had in mind effortlessly.  </li>
            <li>Oh, by the way, the lady at the nail salon uses a different (much scarier looking) drill than this one.  </li>
            <li>I think hers has a foot pedal and is much more complex.  </li>
            <li>I use it to do my natural nails-</li>
            <li>I bought this drill so that I could quickly file down the sides and not have to go in and get a manicure or fill to remedy the situation.   </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this drill especially for professionals, whom want to make their job easier and faster!!</li>
            <li>she is not a professional and this product is really the tops.</li>
            <li>I used it one single time and after my third nail this drill was too hot to hold onto.  </li>
            <li>great or bad</li>
            <li>I only use this for natural nails, not acrylic.  </li>
            <li>I am not a professional nail tech, and actually am fairly new to having acrylic nails/nail art.  </li>
            <li>it was cheaper than the other drills, althoug i bought it for 59.99, two days later it was 39.99, and the customer service wasnt very helpful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recieved my nail drill a couple days ago, on time, and exactly what I wanted...comes with few instructions on the basics of using it though.</li>
            <li>it was difficult to figure out what went where and now that I have misplaced that treasured little piece of paper , which I had to enlarge on the copy machine at work in order to read, I am left with a product that I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll love a soon as I figure it out.  </li>
            <li>, I AM A BUSY SINGLE MOM</li>

            <li> , I AM A BUSY SINGLE MOM</li>
            <li> Loose connection it starts and stops constantly.</li>
            <li> They will soon be purchasing ones of their own, seeing as how the cheap models they picked up other places (battery operated) are just plain crap!    </li>
            <li> Otherwise, you will spent a lot of time doing this with the bits that come with the drill.</li>
            <li> I never really got the hang of using this and preferred to use nail files instead.</li>
            <li> not real easy to use.</li>
            <li> I would not hestitate - one day down the road - to get another one.</li>
            <li> I do recommend that if you&#x27;re going to use it to grind down existing acrylics that you purchase carbide bits, which aren&#x27;t included with the drll.</li>
            <li> but it feels like a heavy duty durable product as described in other product reviews.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t go cheap, you&#x27;ll be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It took a little bit of figuring - on how to work it..........</li>
            <li> Contacted the seller to return it &amp; they were a little demeaning in their response &amp;#34;instructions</li>
            <li> The instructions that come with it appear to be  poorly translated from Chinese.</li>
            <li> Waste of my money!  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this poorly made manicure/pedicure machine.</li>
            <li> Usually, after about a week the acrylic grows out and the edges are awkward and sometimes rough making it difficult to knit.  </li>
            <li> Purchased this item and was skeptical about how it would work.  </li>
            <li> I was upset that my opnion was not correct and that I was treated wrong...</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Complicated to use as it came with vague diagrams; had to go on line to get the instruction manual</li>
            <li> It seems dangerous.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> IT&#x27;S SALON QUALITY ..I HAVE IT FOR A WHILE AND IT STILL WORK LIKE THE FIRST DAY I GOT IT</li>
            <li> Now that I have this nail care kit pedicures are much easier and the results seem to be more comfortable.  I would have liked having information on where to purchase additional buffer attachments when I first bought the MAXIM Pro Nail kit.  Otherwise I am happier now when caring for my nails.</li>

            <li> I love this kit!  It was easy to learn to use and contains everything you need to maintain your acrylic nails (for the exception of the Acrylic Fill crystal/gel--which is an inexpensive additional cost).  I am not a professional nail tech, and actually am fairly new to having acrylic nails/nail art.  This unit has already paid for itself by saving me four visits to the nail salon to fill, fix and file my existing acrylic nails.  I would recommend it to others.  I found it easy to learn/use for my own personal use, and it&#x27;s also nice to use for natural manicures/pedicures for people who do not wear acrylic nails.</li>
            <li> this my 2nd one and i just love it lost the 1st in shipping back home it work real good</li>
            <li> Wow!  I love this tool.  I just used it for the first time and it made the entire filing process so much easier versus manual nail files.  I recommend this to anyone dedicated to doing their own acrylics.  It will pay for itself in no time.</li>

            <li> Awesome! Just what I wanted!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have this a month and it stopped working. Loose connection it starts and stops constantly.</li>
            <li> i really like this. im still learning to use the drill, and i think it should have better instructions. i have not had a problem with it, yet. i think it needs better instructions on what bit is for what. i dont think its very clear on how to change the bits either, but i figured it out. it was cheaper than the other drills, althoug i bought it for 59.99, two days later it was 39.99, and the customer service wasnt very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update: I wasn&#x27;t very happy with the company that I ordered from. I never really got the hang of using this and preferred to use nail files instead. I tried to return this and when I called the lady I spoke to stated that she knew for a fact that the drill worked better for using with acrylic nails and wouldn&#x27;t return it. I was upset that my opnion was not correct and that I was treated wrong...I wouldn&#x27;t order from them again..</li>
            <li> This Nail Drill and attachments has been really great. My daughter does my nails she is not a professional and this product is really the tops. Very satisfied. Great shipping and packaging.</li>
            <li> This is o.k.&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to find a product that really does the job to my liking but this one is o.k.&lt;br /&gt;Not great or bad just o.k.</li>

            <li> I love this machine.  It is amazing.  I had a cheap manicure set that is now in the trash, there is no comparison. Since quality is so important, don&#x27;t hesitate.  You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Perfect, just what I was looking for. Works great on natural and acrylic nails!!Comes with several attachments so you can start using it right away! I highly recommend this drill especially for professionals, whom want to make their job easier and faster!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned my Maxim for about two years now.  Not only do I do my own (natural &amp; acrylic) nails, but I now give manicures and pedicures to my sisters!  They will soon be purchasing ones of their own, seeing as how the cheap models they picked up other places (battery operated) are just plain crap!    If it only came with the sanding bands I would have been happy.  With all the extra attachments...I&#x27;m elated.  I just can&#x27;t say enough great things about this product.  Don&#x27;t go cheap, you&#x27;ll be disappointed.  Get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> WHEN I READ THE WORD \\&quot;PRO\\&quot; IN THE TITLE, I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST TO SELL THE PRODUCT, BUT LET ME TELL YA! THIS IS JUST LIKE THE REAL PROS USE! WORKS GREAT, I AM A BUSY SINGLE MOM SO I WANTED THIS FOR MY PERSONAL USE ON MY TIPS, NOW I AM DOING MY FAMILY&#x27;S NAILS AS WELL! HIGHLEY RECOMENDED!</li>
            <li> This item is like the one the nail professionals use.  Great for at-home use.</li>
            <li> I only use this for natural nails, not acrylic.  It works great. I love the variable speed control.</li>
            <li> I am pleased to write that the seller responded to all of my inquiries in a timely fashion.  I received this drill in two days, much quicker than originally promised on the Amazon email.  So far I have had this item about 1 hour and I turned it on and played with it a bit.  I just cut my nails so I won&#x27;t be able to evaluate based on doing my own nails but it feels like a heavy duty durable product as described in other product reviews. I put one of the attachments on and filed the tip of one of my nails and it worked just fine.  I have been getting \\&quot;fills\\&quot; on acrylic nails for a year now and I recently let them grow out/fall off.  I will be getting a new set put on.  Usually, after about a week the acrylic grows out and the edges are awkward and sometimes rough making it difficult to knit.  I like to get fills about every two weeks.  I bought this drill so that I could quickly file down the sides and not have to go in and get a manicure or fill to remedy the situation.   It feels durable and will probably complete the task I had in mind effortlessly.  Oh, by the way, the lady at the nail salon uses a different (much scarier looking) drill than this one.  I think hers has a foot pedal and is much more complex.  This one looks good for home use.</li>
            <li> I love this. I use it to do my natural nails- I have the toughest nails around and this is great for trimming and shaping my Teflon toenails. For the price it&#x27;s a great piece of equipment, comes with lots of goodies you may or may not ever need. I&#x27;m going to try this on my dog&#x27;s nails since the Dremel made for pets is horrid. If I wore acrylics I&#x27;d definitely use this to do touch ups and probably my own fill-ins.</li>
            <li> This item overheats.  I used it one single time and after my third nail this drill was too hot to hold onto.  It seems dangerous.  Also it only drills going one direction.  Waste of my money!  And dangerously hot during use.</li>
            <li> I love the concept of this product but the instructions that came with it were so bare bones minimal it was difficult to figure out what went where and now that I have misplaced that treasured little piece of paper , which I had to enlarge on the copy machine at work in order to read, I am left with a product that I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll love a soon as I figure it out.  Ok, so I&#x27;m not mechanically inclined but then I shouldn&#x27;t have to be.</li>
            <li> I love this unit and use it in the privacy of my home.  Great for nail and foot care.  Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Happy with this purchase it works great!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this poorly made manicure/pedicure machine. The instructions that come with it appear to be  poorly translated from Chinese. The company selling the item is shady at best. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> not real easy to use. A Dremel tool would work much better and costs the same</li>
            <li> Complicated to use as it came with vague diagrams; had to go on line to get the instruction manual so I knew what was used to do what.  Contacted the seller to return it &amp; they were a little demeaning in their response &amp;#34;instructions are not difficult&amp;#34; undertone plus returning it would have cost me the return shipping AND a re-stocking fee.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get the hang of it - it is pretty powerful &amp; can be intimidating if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing (which without the manual, I didn&#x27;t); it is salon strength though &amp; that&#x27;s what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. LOVE IT! Great for quickly buffing finger &amp; toenails . Eliminates the need for using clippers. Highly reccomend</li>
            <li> When my wife asked for this I told we already had one in the garage with more power and half of the attachments she needed.&lt;br /&gt;Now she has her own. And yes, all of the Dremmel attachments do fit his item.</li>
