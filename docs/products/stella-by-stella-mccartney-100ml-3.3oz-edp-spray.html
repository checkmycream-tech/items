    <ol>
            <li>The delivery was perfect.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>My daughter was thrilled.</li>
            <li>The product, which I have used for several years, is excellent.  </li>
            <li>AND WHEN I RAN OUT I HAD TO GET MORE.</li>
            <li>IT SIMPLY IS MY FAVORITE FRAGRANCE.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite perfums of all time.</li>
            <li>As a perfume lover this was the perfect present.  </li>
            <li>If your looking for a nice light floral perfume this is the one for you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to sample Stella side-by-side with Lancome&#x27;s &#x27;Mille et Une Roses,&#x27; as @soirdelune</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this on my wife.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I swear I&#x27;ve gotten more compliments from men than from women since I started wearing this</li>
            <li>My daughter love this perfume.</li>
            <li>Love this sent; been wearing it for 7 years now off and on .  </li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance and will always love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rosy in a really soft way that isn&#x27;t aggressively floral or too old-lady powdery; it&#x27;s basically the kind of scent that appeals to and smells good on almost anyone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and does not overpower.</li>
            <li>Regardless, it&#x27;s a light, flirty, feminine scent</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light floral scent that is not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>this is such a great perfume.</li>
            <li>Stella is a pretty, throwback rose that has crystalline &amp; modern qualities.</li>
            <li>I really thought I&#x27;d love this one before testing.</li>
            <li>Stella is on the edge of cloying, yet doesn&#x27;t hold well, which is rare a combination imo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Do not feel all notes pointed, but just a very simple note rose, expressionless.</li>
            <li>I was happy with the product and how quickly it arrived as it was for my daughter&#x27;s birthday and not sure it would arrive in time, but it did....</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>You pick out your favorite and can get a small bottle of your favorite from the store.  </li>
            <li>Sure enough they had it.</li>
            <li>first for what I need...</li>
            <li>But as much as I love this scent, you should definitely visit a Sephora or a department store first</li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s no compelling reason for me to add Stella to my collection, and I love both peonies and roses!</li>
            <li>It has a slight hint of rose, very feminine scent</li>
            <li>Thanks for your prompt delivery.  </li>
            <li>She is 15 and says that many of her friends (male and female) ask her about the aroma.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I think  Stella is similar to Cabaret (longer lasting, more complex) and Ellen Tracy Peony &amp; Rose (prettier peony), both of which I prefer to Stella.</li>
            <li>Everyday I wear it receive many complements, although I let a friend wear some</li>
            <li>It is not an young girl&#x27;s perfume and that is strictly IMHO.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a heavy scent like a lot of floral perfumes and not one that you can smell coming.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s subtle, it lasts a long time, and guys love it for some reason.</li>
            <li>I take breaks breaks form it for other modern ones one and</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s reasonably priced, but a big bottle of perfume is still a long-term investment to carefully consider.</li>

            <li> Fixation, longevity and sillage bad, which is not consistent with the characteristics attributed to all for this perfume.</li>
            <li> Very poor operation and will not use this seller again.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the second bottle of this perfume I have purchased through Amazon marketplace, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Thanks!</li>
            <li> The product, which I have used for several years, is excellent.  The delivery was perfect.</li>
            <li> Never received the item. Shipping and billing address are different and the system cannot handle processing.    Very poor operation and will not use this seller again.</li>
            <li> THIS WAS GIVEN TO ME AS A GIFT SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND WHEN I RAN OUT I HAD TO GET MORE. IT SIMPLY IS MY FAVORITE FRAGRANCE.</li>
            <li> I like this perfume. It&#x27;s light and does not overpower. I didnt get nearly as many compliments on it as I do with my usual perfume, which i was disappointed about. Regardless, it&#x27;s a light, flirty, feminine scent and I like it.</li>
            <li> It is not an young girl&#x27;s perfume and that is strictly IMHO. I would rate it for ladies 35+ years.  So do check it out in a store before you decide to order one online for your partner.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite perfums of all time. The scent last all day and I always get a ton of compliments. It has a slight hint of rose, very feminine scent</li>
            <li> I got a perfume sampler as a Christmas gift this past year from Sephora.  It included 10 different sample size perfumes from different designers.  You pick out your favorite and can get a small bottle of your favorite from the store.  As a perfume lover this was the perfect present.  There were some that I had never heard of and some that I probably wouldn&#x27;t have tried.  It was a hard choice but I picked out Stella as my perfume.  It&#x27;s a light floral scent that is not overpowering.  It&#x27;s not a heavy scent like a lot of floral perfumes and not one that you can smell coming.   If your looking for a nice light floral perfume this is the one for you.</li>
            <li> I was happy with the product and how quickly it arrived as it was for my daughter&#x27;s birthday and not sure it would arrive in time, but it did....</li>
            <li> this is such a great perfume. I always get compliments when I wear this. Bought it before at a high end department store and got it for half the price here on amazon. cant beat that!</li>
            <li> Stella is a pretty, throwback rose that has crystalline &amp; modern qualities. It&#x27;s a bit too sweet, too thin, and too fruity for me. Stella is on the edge of cloying, yet doesn&#x27;t hold well, which is rare a combination imo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think  Stella is similar to Cabaret (longer lasting, more complex) and Ellen Tracy Peony &amp; Rose (prettier peony), both of which I prefer to Stella. I&#x27;d love to sample Stella side-by-side with Lancome&#x27;s &#x27;Mille et Une Roses,&#x27; as @soirdelune suggests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no compelling reason for me to add Stella to my collection, and I love both peonies and roses! I&#x27;m surprised. I really thought I&#x27;d love this one before testing. After testing, I know that I don&#x27;t even like it.</li>
            <li> My daughter asked for this perfume for Christmas. I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores  so I tried Amazon.com. Sure enough they had it. My daughter was thrilled. Now I always chec Amazon .com first for what I need...</li>
            <li> Thanks for your prompt delivery.  I love the smell of this on my wife.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Stella for at least a year now and I love it. It&#x27;s rosy in a really soft way that isn&#x27;t aggressively floral or too old-lady powdery; it&#x27;s basically the kind of scent that appeals to and smells good on almost anyone. It&#x27;s subtle, it lasts a long time, and guys love it for some reason. I swear I&#x27;ve gotten more compliments from men than from women since I started wearing this perfume-- it seems to turn them on a little. I imagine this would be a selling point for ladies on the prowl, so there you have it. But as much as I love this scent, you should definitely visit a Sephora or a department store first so you can try it out before you buy it. I think it&#x27;s reasonably priced, but a big bottle of perfume is still a long-term investment to carefully consider.</li>
            <li> Smells delish.  Get compliments all the time.</li>
            <li> My daughter love this perfume. She is 15 and says that many of her friends (male and female) ask her about the aroma.  Will keep buying it</li>
            <li> Love this sent; been wearing it for 7 years now off and on .  Everyday I wear it receive many complements, although I let a friend wear some and it smelled different on her.  BTW- she received complements too.  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Fixation, longevity and sillage bad, which is not consistent with the characteristics attributed to all for this perfume. Do not feel all notes pointed, but just a very simple note rose, expressionless. Also, the plastic packaging shaft violated.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance and will always love it. I take breaks breaks form it for other modern ones one and then but I always return. My sister loves this on me and only calls this the XXX-perfume (XXX&#x3D;my name)... Nomnomnnommm</li>
            <li> present for my daughter</li>
            <li> Trustful seller. Great product. I recommend.</li>
