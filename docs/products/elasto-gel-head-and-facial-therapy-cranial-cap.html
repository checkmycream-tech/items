            <li>It has been a great help!</li>
            <li>Excellent.</li>
            <li>This has been wonderful to have.  </li>
            <li>and this is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>This is great - just shouldn&#x27;t have gotten the largest size.  </li>
            <li>It is great for Migraines and neck pain.</li>
            <li>great seller.</li>
            <li>It does feel great when your feeling overheated.</li>
            <li>Very nice quality.</li>
            <li>The fit isn&#x27;t perfect (regardless of size)</li>
            <li>Very excited about this!</li>
            <li>Great for numbing superficial pain &amp; quite comfortable.</li>
            <li>love Elasto gel have had the product for years and they work great and had to get more</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still better than anything else for migraines re.</li>
            <li>Be sure of the size before you order it.</li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>I have tried wrapping a towel around it to insulate, and that works better than having it exposed to the air.  </li>
            <li>Great for the initial onslaught of a headache, but would need to stay cool longer to be more effective.</li>
            <li>I would have preferred a snugger fit</li>
            <li>so this is a dream come true.  </li>
            <li>I also wish it held the cool temperature longer.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had an intense headache since I purchased this, but I have had mild headaches coming on that disappeared soon after wearing this cap.</li>
            <li>I used this cap every night for the first three weeks to help with the headaches and the pain.  </li>
            <li>Really works!</li>
            <li>It seems like it warms up pretty fast.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend for those with migraines!  </li>
            <li>product really works.</li>
            <li>Better then I expected</li>
            <li>Very soothing for my headaches.</li>
            <li>I use it mostly laying down and avoid using the chin strap, but then it doesn&#x27;t feel like a tight fit.  </li>
            <li>This thing feels great, but because it&#x27;s not terribly thick (and if it was, it&#x27;d be super heavy), the cold doesn&#x27;t last terribly long.</li>
            <li>Cools down hot flashes too</li>
            <li>Fits good, flexible, too expensive,  I liked it, though cold only lasts 10-15 minutes.  </li>
            <li>The way it fits you would probably be better going a little small than too big.</li>

            <li> My husband has trouble with heat, so I got this to coax him into my far infrared sauna!</li>
            <li> I wish there was a different way to keep it on my head, other than the neck Velcro strap.  </li>
            <li> I seem to do just a well with other ice packs I keep in the freezer.</li>

            <li> The cold doesn&#x27;t last too long, but it lasts long enough to do the job.</li>
            <li> but that is about my only complaint.</li>
            <li> I do have to cover my ears due to how cold it is, but that is why I love this product, it stays cold for hours.</li>
            <li> cold ice packs and such!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s itchy and uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> Ha, he loves this and he looks totally silly wearing it</li>
            <li> I just wish it would stay cold longer.  </li>

            <li> love Elasto gel have had the product for years and they work great and had to get more</li>
            <li> Fits good, flexible, too expensive,  I liked it, though cold only lasts 10-15 minutes.  It did covet my head &amp; neck.</li>
            <li> This is great - just shouldn&#x27;t have gotten the largest size.  Highly recommend for those with migraines!  The fit isn&#x27;t perfect (regardless of size) but it&#x27;s still better than anything else for migraines re. cold ice packs and such!</li>
            <li> Be sure of the size before you order it. The way it fits you would probably be better going a little small than too big. The cold doesn&#x27;t last too long, but it lasts long enough to do the job. This is wonderful for migrane sufferers.</li>
            <li> i bought this cap for my wife and myself.It is great for Migraines and neck pain.The price was the best I found</li>
            <li> This is a distinctive shapely product.  Heat all head parts, except for face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chin strap is too short.  I created an extender, but an extra 2 or 3 inches would have made this a 5 star product.</li>
            <li> I wish I had discovered this one sooner.  I love this.  I&#x27;m a chronic migraine sufferer so this is a dream come true.  I wish it stayed colder longer but that is about my only complaint.</li>
            <li> This thing feels great, but because it&#x27;s not terribly thick (and if it was, it&#x27;d be super heavy), the cold doesn&#x27;t last terribly long. Great for the initial onslaught of a headache, but would need to stay cool longer to be more effective.</li>

            <li> great seller. product really works.</li>
            <li> Better then I expected</li>
            <li> I was in a car accident and have a concussion.  I used this cap every night for the first three weeks to help with the headaches and the pain.  It has been a great help!</li>
            <li> Excellent. Really works!</li>
            <li> I got this to help with my migraines.  It works okay.  I wish there was a different way to keep it on my head, other than the neck Velcro strap.  It&#x27;s itchy and uncomfortable.  I use it mostly laying down and avoid using the chin strap, but then it doesn&#x27;t feel like a tight fit.  I also wish it held the cool temperature longer.  I have tried wrapping a towel around it to insulate, and that works better than having it exposed to the air.  I don&#x27;t think I would buy this again.  I seem to do just a well with other ice packs I keep in the freezer.</li>
            <li> My husband has trouble with heat, so I got this to coax him into my far infrared sauna!</li>
            <li> I would have preferred a snugger fit so I know that every section of my head was being cooled. I haven&#x27;t had an intense headache since I purchased this, but I have had mild headaches coming on that disappeared soon after wearing this cap. I&#x27;ve never experienced the sensation of having my entire head chilled at the same time. It does feel great when your feeling overheated.</li>
            <li> This has been wonderful to have.  I get migraines and this is wonderful.  I do have to cover my ears due to how cold it is, but that is why I love this product, it stays cold for hours.</li>
            <li> Very soothing for my headaches. I wish I had this three days ago when I had a doozy of a headache. I will be prepared for my next headache though.</li>
            <li> This item chills all the parts of my head where I need it when I get a migraine or a tension headache.  I just wish it would stay cold longer.  It seems like it warms up pretty fast.  But it definitely helps.</li>
            <li> Ha, he loves this and he looks totally silly wearing it but it keeps him cooled off.  Very nice quality.</li>
