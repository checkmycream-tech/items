            <li>Good shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I imagine it&#x27;s probably good for any color treated hair type.</li>
            <li>My daughter loved mine, she is 27 and is now using it.</li>
            <li>Silky, creamy and well-lathering shampoo laced with the most beautiful fragrance on earth</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Packaged nicely.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, and the price was great!</li>
            <li>I have to use a good bit &amp; wash my hair twice, to feel like its clean.</li>
            <li>Good value quick shipment</li>
            <li>My hair has never been so healthy.</li>
            <li>I love Biolage shampoos.</li>
            <li>Seems to preserve my color better than cheaper shampoos.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Glad to see I can reorder here at Amazon.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser used to laugh at me for bringing my bottles with me to appointments but I loved how it made my hair feel and since I have a lot of hair</li>
            <li>if we used color care for many years and loved it, I am pretty sure we know how to rinse shampoo from our hair.  </li>
            <li>Best shampoo I&#x27;ve tried in a long time that&#x27;s sulfate free.</li>
            <li>Strong smell.</li>
            <li>Fabulous shampoo for color treated hair...</li>
            <li>my color stays true, doesn&#x27;t fade.</li>
            <li>Old color safe</li>
            <li>I Love the smell of this shampoo, it is has a soft fresh smell.</li>
            <li>I used to think that the old ColorCare could not get any better as a shampoo.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like they went with a more traditional (cheaper) detergent style shampoo and added some conditioner to it to make up for the harshness.</li>
            <li>Suupeeerr amazing, - and it comes from extremely picky person in hair products!</li>
            <li>Hands down love it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>I bought a gallon of the new ColorLast</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very soft &amp; moisturized.</li>
            <li>Suupper caring towards colored hair with perfect consistency and....a little goes a long way, unlike other expensive shampoos that takes a whole lot to make it to clean and lather.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, thin hair that tends to get greasy a lot</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing distinctive about the new formulation that you couldn&#x27;t get buying the cheapest generic brand of shampoo at the 99c store.</li>
            <li>, Biolage go back to the old stuff.</li>
            <li>My hair type is normal to dry, color treated.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> My hair type is normal to dry, color treated.</li>
            <li> I returned it immediately, as my spouse and I both agree that the new formulation of ColorLast dries out the scalp and makes it feel tight.</li>
            <li> it was one of the only brands to help me get a brush through it when it was wet.</li>
            <li> I have been using Biolage for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> BUT DOES DRY THE HAIR</li>
            <li> This shampoo does not strip my hair like the other shampoo I was using, did.  </li>
            <li> And I find it extremely offensive that they suggest thoroughly rinsing hair........</li>
            <li> Even after I put on the Color Care Conditioner, my scalp felt dried out.</li>
            <li> It lathers so well with just a small amount.</li>
            <li> Was already a fan of this shampoo, but was looking for a less expensive supplier.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t believe they would change to such a bad formulation.</li>
            <li> &amp; I feel that this shampoo is to thin,  </li>
            <li> I can wear it down again and not have to keep it up tied up to hide how bad it was.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed cause I used to rave about this brand to everyone.</li>
            <li> It was horrible.  </li>
            <li> Biolage has changed their formula and it&#x27;s awful!</li>
            <li> I want to return this horrible product and</li>
            <li> Awful service and awful product</li>

            <li> Was already a fan of this shampoo, but was looking for a less expensive supplier. Purchased here for 1/3 the price I was paying locally!!!</li>
            <li> Old color safe Biolage did not suds up.  This kind suds up great and protects hair color.</li>
            <li> Seems to preserve my color better than cheaper shampoos. Smells great!</li>
            <li> Great experience!  Product delivered on time. Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Best hair care I&#x27;ve ever tried in my life... I have very fine, thin hair that tends to get greasy a lot and this totally revives it. Hands down love it.</li>
            <li> 1/3 the retail of Target ... Fantastic!!!</li>
            <li> Great price for this shampoo.  I have been using Biolage for a very long time.  Glad to see I can reorder here at Amazon.</li>

            <li> Terrific product. Helps hold color and smells great!</li>
            <li> Suupeeerr amazing, - and it comes from extremely picky person in hair products! Silky, creamy and well-lathering shampoo laced with the most beautiful fragrance on earth (subjective) -an orchid! Suupper caring towards colored hair with perfect consistency and....a little goes a long way, unlike other expensive shampoos that takes a whole lot to make it to clean and lather. Along with Redken Diamond Oil, Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Tea Tree and Colored hair versions, Wella, Goldwell this is my to-go shampoo! Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Packaged nicely. Strong smell.</li>
            <li> Good value quick shipment</li>
            <li> REALLY GREAT SHAMPOO BUT DOES DRY THE HAIR SO AM ALTERNATING</li>
            <li> This shampoo does not strip my hair like the other shampoo I was using, did.  It was horrible.  This shampoo, coupled with the conditioner, makes my hair feel great.  I can wear it down again and not have to keep it up tied up to hide how bad it was.  Highly recommend this product and I will definitely be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, and the price was great! Very happy with my purchase :)</li>
            <li> great shampoo even better price!!!</li>
            <li> Item was delivered as promised and was as described</li>
            <li> Excellent color stay shampoo.</li>
            <li> Good shampoo.  Great price.</li>
            <li> I Love the smell of this shampoo, it is has a soft fresh smell. It lathers so well with just a small amount. I also use it daily and it doesn&#x27;t build up on my hair. It leaves my hair very soft &amp; moisturized. My hair type is normal to dry, color treated. I imagine it&#x27;s probably good for any color treated hair type. I am 47, and borrowed this while visiting my mom who uses it daily as well. She is 74 and she has great hair. My daughter loved mine, she is 27 and is now using it. So it&#x27;s for everyone!</li>
            <li> I used to think that the old ColorCare could not get any better as a shampoo. I bought a gallon of the new ColorLast and I can&#x27;t believe they would change to such a bad formulation. There&#x27;s nothing distinctive about the new formulation that you couldn&#x27;t get buying the cheapest generic brand of shampoo at the 99c store.

Even after I put on the Color Care Conditioner, my scalp felt dried out.</li>
            <li> Biolage has changed their formula and it&#x27;s awful! I&#x27;m so disappointed cause I used to rave about this brand to everyone. My hairdresser used to laugh at me for bringing my bottles with me to appointments but I loved how it made my hair feel and since I have a lot of hair it was one of the only brands to help me get a brush through it when it was wet. I want to return this horrible product and even though it&#x27;s prime eligible and fulfilled by Amazon I would have to pay $15 to send it back! Awful service and awful product, Biolage go back to the old stuff.</li>
            <li> It smells good &amp; it&#x27;s a great price.  I have med. hair length &amp; I feel that this shampoo is to thin,  I have to use a good bit &amp; wash my hair twice, to feel like its clean. It doesn&#x27;t lather up well at all.</li>
            <li> Why oh why did they change from color care to color last???? And I find it extremely offensive that they suggest thoroughly rinsing hair........ if we used color care for many years and loved it, I am pretty sure we know how to rinse shampoo from our hair.  Goodbye Matrix !!!!!!!!! I only gave one star so the review would post.</li>
