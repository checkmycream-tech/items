            <li> I purchased this for me. Such a lovely fragrance . I wear it for special occasions&lt;br /&gt;And will have to buy more soon.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful, unique perfume for me. Got tons of complements wearing it. Fresh, seductive and lusting aroma. Love it.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells just like Philosogy&#x27;s Inner Grace. Plus, it is a perfume I can smell on myself all day long (shudder). Bottomline is that this does NOT smell like the sample in the magazine. It is completely different.</li>
            <li> This product is beautifully packaged. Narcisco Rodriguez produced samples on paper that were devine and so I purchased it based on the product on paper.  I cant tell if what I received was old, or it just doesnt smell quite like the sample version.  I went and got more samples and just as I expected.....yummmy..but this product is just not the same.  I am wearing it on occasion. But all in all...not just it.  I think perfume should put a date of mfg on them as we all know they dont smell the same after they sit awhile.</li>
            <li> I just received this item a day early. Neatly packaged and the fragrance is&lt;br /&gt;Exactly what I wanted. Great choice!</li>
            <li> It came in the expected time, it seems original, smells like it. Love it. Highly Recommended, Highly Recommended, Highly Recommended</li>
            <li> Came upon this in a magazine and have loved it from then on, a little expensive but well worth it in the long run.</li>
            <li> Smelled real good for 2 minutes. Did not last at all.  Will not buy again. Very dissatisfied. One two three</li>
            <li> Bought two little bottles to start with and loved it so much I bought a big bottle. I love how soft it smells. It just smells so feminine to me.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for my girlfriend, she knew how it smelled and all because one of her friends had it. I am not a perfume fan , they usually give me headaches and all that bad stuff , but this one is different , it has like very soft scent, she and obviously i enjoy it very much, now i force my girlfriend to wear this fragrance every :D I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing fragrance for confident women of all ages. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the pretty pink bottle it&#x27;s a very sensual fragrance!</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance, its soft and just right for me.  I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Received in excellent new conditon.  This fragrance is WONDERFUL!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not generally a fragrance wearer, but I have fallen in love with Narciso. This is a feminine fragrance with some depth - not sweet and girly, but not overbearing or heady. A good every day, day and night fragrance.</li>
            <li> Beautiful scent, most perfumes give me a headache or end up smelling too strong on me after a while, this one is great from beginning to end. I&#x27;ll be buying again for sure.</li>
            <li> I tried the fragrance at a store, so I knew I liked it. Not too strong, just right in frangrance.</li>
            <li> I Love the very feminine, fresh, enduring scent of this fragrance. Simply beautiful without overpowering. I routinely get asked by passing strangers &amp;#34;what is that fragrance you are wearing&amp;#34;? They appreciate the same things that I do about this scent.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and it is exactly as described by the seller!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this fragrance! I had been smelling the magazine inserts for quite some time. I was hoping that when I actually received it that it smelled the same...and it does! Received it very quick too! Love, love, love it!!</li>
            <li> One of best perfumes, I have tried in my whole life. No wonder they are still charging premium price.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this parfum and I must admit I find it quite arousing every time she wears it. The beautiful part it is so easy to get online for various holidays.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a great fragrance, and even and better my wife loves it.  Found it at a deptartment store and wasn&#x27;t going to pay the overpriced amount they wanted, good buy we are happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is a signature scent for me and whenever I wear it, honestly, I wanna make out with myself. It&#x27;s that yummy. Kind of like early summer, jasmine, the beach &amp; gardenias except not fruity, sickeningly sweet or overpowering. It&#x27;s just sexy. I alternate between this and Gucci II but this one is my favorite because it lasts longer. You can still pick up the scent on sheets/sweaters days later. :)</li>
            <li> I tried this perfume at saks. I fell in love. Long story short, the perfume I ordered smelled nothing like it. I sprayed it on and it literally lasted 2 minutes. I had to constantly spray myself. Amazon will not allow returns on perfume...wish I had known😡</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the best perfumes that I ever bought for my wife.</li>
            <li> the perfume smelled really good on the magazine and ive heard great reviews about it, but the vial i bought has a scent which doesn&#x27;t last long and smells a little different from what was in the magazine.</li>
            <li> I really like this fragrance and happy I got from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;However, it doesn&#x27;t seem to last, at least not on my body..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve become addicted to Narcisco&#x27;s fragrances, and everything I&#x27;ve purchased from Amazon is the real deal.  This is so overwhelmingly feminine without being cloying, nice semi-powdery drydown.</li>
            <li> Perfect!  One of my favorites !</li>
