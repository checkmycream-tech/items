            <li>This has got to be one of the best nail products out there period!    </li>
            <li>I especially love having it on get-aways and vacations.    </li>
            <li>Excellent Transaction--Great Product--Fast Shipping--</li>
            <li>The idea of the product is great</li>
            <li>It is great for carrying one in your bag, leave one at work, another in your suitcase, etc.  </li>
            <li>I bought it because I though the pen would be great to carry in my purse for touch-ups on the go.</li>
            <li>The bottle where the brush stays in liquid polish is still the best way to go for a nice finish.  </li>
            <li>Good price also</li>
            <li>Good travel idea.  </li>
            <li>but I should have known it was too good to be true.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, not messy and looks great!</li>
            <li>The polish dries fast, which is great</li>
            <li>Love the convenience of this nail pen.</li>
            <li>A good idea and works (to a certain extent) but not the product for me.</li>
            <li>It seems like a great idea and might be fun the first time, but I wouldn&#x27;t bother buying another one because of the problems with the brush.</li>
            <li>First and foremost, the ease of use and convenience is simply amazing.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful, neat, lasting and convenient.</li>
            <li>This product is light weight and easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>It drys quick too!  </li>
            <li>This product is truly fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought several colors and they work great.</li>
            <li>The polish paints on the nail clean with no clumps.  </li>
            <li>My wife loved this product it is easy to use and it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>It would be good for guys with toe discoloration, that wanted to get rid of the color without having obviously painted nails.</li>
            <li>Great pen, but this color looks so natural that it is kind of a waste of time to paint your nails.</li>
            <li>If you have to use it at work or wherever, make sure you clean the brush when you get back home because these pens are really only good for one use and one coat at a time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really impressed to say the least, and highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Either buy 2 of them and put one in the purse, or make sure you clean the brush thoroughly and let it dry before throwing it in your purse.  </li>
            <li>What seems quick and easy is actually so high-maintenance</li>
            <li>The color wasn&#x27;t even a pretty.</li>
            <li>The more you try to squeeze more polish out and go over it to smooth it out, the worse it gets!</li>
            <li>All these nail pens... use it fast and stick to one coat.</li>
            <li>So do it as fast as you can and don&#x27;t attempt another coat.  </li>
            <li>I am very dissapointed</li>
            <li>pink is a color I haven&#x27;t tried yet, but it should be just as great as the other colors I have used.</li>
            <li>The more polish that is dried on the brush, the more the new polish doesn&#x27;t move through it and makes a clumpy mess by the time you can get any of it on the nail.</li>
            <li>Sad considering the concept is great.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a light pink tone..</li>
            <li>The color really does last over a week easily, and pen is small and leak-proof, so I can carry it around for rare touch-ups when I need it.    </li>
            <li>it is completely clear.</li>
            <li>All it does is put a shiny, clear coat on my nails.</li>
            <li>This particular shade is divine (I like sheer beige too).  </li>
            <li>they dry fast and that is what ui need.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to trying this sheer pink color out.</li>
            <li>but it also dries fast on the brush so as soon as it starts to dry, it starts streaking from the dry polish hardening on the bristles.  </li>
            <li>If you want a pink color I highly recommend a different \\&quot;pen\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I suggest thoroughly cleaning the brush with polish remover and letting dry before putting the cap back on or it will be a hot mess the next time you try to use it.</li>

            <li> I was never a fan of nail salons, and always look out for subtle sheer shades (Lippmann Sarah Smile was my preferred polish up until this one).  </li>
            <li> So much easier to use than the brush in the small neck of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Finally, I can apply it to my nail, I ordered the sheer pink color and the color come out pale yellow, like a very old nail polish.</li>
            <li> Anyhow, it&#x27;s not a sheer pink color at all.</li>
            <li> When i received this sheer pink enamel it was not a sheer pink.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll notice it&#x27;s not the color of the sheer pink which is promised by the strip of pink before the casing.</li>
            <li> First the package was broken, the paint was out and sticky to the point that it took me half an hour trying to open it.</li>
            <li> Unlike regular polish and does take a little while to dry.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t pink.</li>
            <li> One there is paint on the brush and it starts to dry (less than a minute) streaks and lumps</li>
            <li> I guess because this was sold by an extreme discount warehouse I should have known it wasn&#x27;t what it said it was.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> The polish was either very very old or it was just the wrong color.</li>
            <li> If I was a little happier with the situation I&#x27;d say tan.</li>
            <li> I was highly excited for this order and was extremely disappointed when I got it.</li>
            <li> The brush made these weird lines in the polish and didnt distribute properly.</li>
            <li> This product was not good for me at all.  </li>
            <li> it is difficult to make a mistake.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it&#x27;s a murky tan instead.</li>
            <li> Which is extremely disappointing.</li>
            <li> I hate this product.  </li>

            <li> it wasn&#x27;t pink. It was a gross orange color</li>
            <li> This has got to be one of the best nail products out there period!    I was never a fan of nail salons, and always look out for subtle sheer shades (Lippmann Sarah Smile was my preferred polish up until this one).  This product is truly fantastic.  I used high-end designer brands for nail polish exclusively, so discovered this one on an \\&quot;emergency\\&quot;.  I&#x27;m really impressed to say the least, and highly recommend it.  First and foremost, the ease of use and convenience is simply amazing.  I especially love having it on get-aways and vacations.    The color really does last over a week easily, and pen is small and leak-proof, so I can carry it around for rare touch-ups when I need it.    This particular shade is divine (I like sheer beige too).  It&#x27;s like having french manicure in one step when it goes on a naked nail.  Beautiful, neat, lasting and convenient.</li>
            <li> Great pen, but this color looks so natural that it is kind of a waste of time to paint your nails. It would be good for guys with toe discoloration, that wanted to get rid of the color without having obviously painted nails. There is a low amount of visible gloss.</li>
            <li> This product is light weight and easy to handle.  The polish paints on the nail clean with no clumps.  It drys quick too!  I&#x27;ve bought several colors and they work great.</li>
            <li> The idea of the product is great but I should have known it was too good to be true. When the pen arrived it was a yellow/ orange color. The color wasn&#x27;t even a pretty. I guess because this was sold by an extreme discount warehouse I should have known it wasn&#x27;t what it said it was.</li>
            <li> It is great for carrying one in your bag, leave one at work, another in your suitcase, etc.  it is difficult to make a mistake.</li>
            <li> This product was not good for me at all.  The brush made these weird lines in the polish and didnt distribute properly. Would not recommend this product at all.</li>
            <li> pink is a color I haven&#x27;t tried yet, but it should be just as great as the other colors I have used. they dry fast and that is what ui need.</li>
            <li> Excellent Transaction--Great Product--Fast Shipping--A+A+A+</li>
            <li> All these nail pens... use it fast and stick to one coat. The polish dries fast, which is great but it also dries fast on the brush so as soon as it starts to dry, it starts streaking from the dry polish hardening on the bristles.  A second coat is a disaster. The more you try to squeeze more polish out and go over it to smooth it out, the worse it gets! The more polish that is dried on the brush, the more the new polish doesn&#x27;t move through it and makes a clumpy mess by the time you can get any of it on the nail. So do it as fast as you can and don&#x27;t attempt another coat.  Don&#x27;t dilly-dally either or the second hand will be steal city! I suggest thoroughly cleaning the brush with polish remover and letting dry before putting the cap back on or it will be a hot mess the next time you try to use it. I bought it because I though the pen would be great to carry in my purse for touch-ups on the go. Either buy 2 of them and put one in the purse, or make sure you clean the brush thoroughly and let it dry before throwing it in your purse.  If you have to use it at work or wherever, make sure you clean the brush when you get back home because these pens are really only good for one use and one coat at a time.  One there is paint on the brush and it starts to dry (less than a minute) streaks and lumps galore!  It seems like a great idea and might be fun the first time, but I wouldn&#x27;t bother buying another one because of the problems with the brush. The bottle where the brush stays in liquid polish is still the best way to go for a nice finish.  What seems quick and easy is actually so high-maintenance it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> My wife loved this product it is easy to use and it lasts for a long time. Good price also</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to trying this sheer pink color out. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s a murky tan instead. If I was a little happier with the situation I&#x27;d say tan. Anyhow, it&#x27;s not a sheer pink color at all. Which is extremely disappointing. D:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you look at the casing liquid (the end of the nail polish \\&quot;pen\\&quot;) you&#x27;ll notice it&#x27;s not the color of the sheer pink which is promised by the strip of pink before the casing. If you want a pink color I highly recommend a different \\&quot;pen\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I put this in my mother-in-law&#x27;s stocking and she says she like this. It&#x27;s easy to use, not messy and looks great!</li>
            <li> A good idea and works (to a certain extent) but not the product for me. Unlike regular polish and does take a little while to dry. Gave to a friend who wanted to try it.</li>
            <li> the color that comes out of this is not the same color on the outside wrapper.  I hate this product.  Sad considering the concept is great.</li>
            <li> My second one. So much easier to use than the brush in the small neck of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Love the convenience of this nail pen. Good travel idea.  Color was a bit on the yellow side though.</li>
            <li> I got one today. First the package was broken, the paint was out and sticky to the point that it took me half an hour trying to open it. Finally, I can apply it to my nail, I ordered the sheer pink color and the color come out pale yellow, like a very old nail polish. I am very dissapointed</li>
            <li> I was highly excited for this order and was extremely disappointed when I got it. When painted on my nail, it looks nothingggg like the color presented on the tube. I was expecting a light pink tone.. it is completely clear. All it does is put a shiny, clear coat on my nails. I totally regret my purchase.</li>
            <li> When i received this sheer pink enamel it was not a sheer pink. The polish was either very very old or it was just the wrong color. I did print out all the info to return this item, but i may have missed my return time frame.</li>
