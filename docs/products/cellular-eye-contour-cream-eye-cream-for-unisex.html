    <ol>
            <li>Great price!</li>
            <li>So for those of you out west, it would probably be perfect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best eye cream on the market</li>
            <li>Ive been using this cream for over a year, and really happy with results.</li>
            <li>It is a great product.  </li>
            <li>This product is as good as it gets....</li>
            <li>I am sure that this would be a great product for someone living in a dryer climate.</li>
            <li>The absolute best eye cream there is</li>
            <li>The product feels very smooth and nice.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years and love it..</li>
            <li>I have no wrinkles around my eyes and give this product most of the credit.  </li>
            <li>I love this eye cream.  </li>
            <li>but I have been doing it for many years</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Now with aging skin, I find this product even better.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and have been using it since 1978.</li>
            <li>Eye contour cream is excellent when it comes to hydrating and reducing dark circles.</li>
            <li>Light formula, moisturizes, and gets rid of dryness.</li>
            <li>And the delivery is quick and accurate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used this product a long time ago and it was good then.  </li>
            <li>noticed ever since using this product, i haven&#x27;t seen more sagging upper eyelid or fine lines under the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Easily absorbed into skin.</li>
            <li>it is worth it.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I live in a very humid climate and this is much more than I need.</li>
            <li>It also happens to be very reasonably priced, expecially at amazon.com.</li>
            <li>apply this cream first and then add obagie vitamin c eye serum on top for additional moisture for nights only.</li>
            <li>La Prairie is the only brand I have been using since 18 and love every one of their products.</li>
            <li>Product is as expected though having an idea of the expiration date would be nice.  </li>
            <li>But overall, my favorite eye cream at the moment</li>
            <li>I have used this product for 15 years and most people think I look younger that I really am.  </li>
            <li>When I opened this jar, I found a large void in the cream.  </li>
            <li>This La Prairie cream is reasonably priced and Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>She brought me my La Prairie creams, which arrived just in time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank yoy very much&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I would pay twice as much for the results.</li>
            <li>It just feels greasy to me, although very hydrating.</li>
            <li>This product works well for my particular needs..</li>
            <li>and people often assume I am many years younger than my actual age - even at my periodontist&#x27;s office where the lighting is not at all</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend,</li>
            <li>A very small amount is needed to be effective.</li>
            <li>As I told you I am from CHILE and a friend of mine was visiting New York.</li>
            <li>La Prairie also have a smart cream that comes with spf 15, but I personally prefer contour.</li>
            <li>On the advice of a skin care person, I started using this in my early 30s every night and am now 73.  </li>
            <li>move enough for a month or so into a smaller jar for daily use and leave the protective seal semi-attached in the original jar to preserve freshness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The results are temporary, but because it takes only a small amount the jar lasts about a year using it every night and most mornings.  </li>
            <li>If your concern are dark circles, than Id say no, as it doesnt do much about it.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s better than other expensive eye creams.</li>
            <li> The product had a big air pocket in the center ,when I tapped it</li>
            <li> Ihave used this for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Sounds a bit stingy but it really does take a very small amount to see results.  </li>
            <li> I go off of it and then come running back after using other products.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products and always return to this baby!</li>
            <li> By buying through Amazon, I now pay half of what I was paying.  </li>
            <li> Yes it is very expensive, but it is well worth it.  </li>
            <li> La Prairie may be a little expense but if&lt;br /&gt;you can spoil yourself</li>
            <li> Little cream is needed to get results.</li>
            <li> It truly helps with minimizing wrinkles and keeping the delicate skin under the eyes firm.  </li>
            <li> You use a very small amount, but it softens the lines/crows feet around the eye.  </li>
            <li> although very expensive, it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still less expansive than buying it through a department store, but this is a disappointing development.</li>
            <li> Gave me a horrible allergy!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is as good as it gets....Thank You!</li>
            <li> Easily absorbed into skin. Topical products could never repair...only surgery could diminish damaged/aging skim,&lt;br /&gt;But noticed ever since using this product, i haven&#x27;t seen more sagging upper eyelid or fine lines under the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I apply this cream first and then add obagie vitamin c eye serum on top for additional moisture for nights only. Daytime, using la prarie alone followed by SPF.</li>
            <li> Great price! There is no perfume to sting. I use a Lancôme liquid foundation, so I bought the Lancome eye cream at the same time. Big mistake. The Lancome eyecream has perfume and therefore stings a bit.  This La Prairie cream is reasonably priced and Very moisturizing. I use it both daytime and as a night eye cream. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Yes it is very expensive, but it is well worth it.  You use a very small amount, but it softens the lines/crows feet around the eye.  I have used this product for 15 years and most people think I look younger that I really am.  Highly recommend,</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and love it..La Prairie may be a little expense but if&lt;br /&gt;you can spoil yourself it is worth it.</li>
            <li> La Prairie is the only brand I have been using since 18 and love every one of their products. Eye contour cream is excellent when it comes to hydrating and reducing dark circles. It also happens to be very reasonably priced, expecially at amazon.com. This cream does not have sun protection, so you have to wear sun glasses. La Prairie also have a smart cream that comes with spf 15, but I personally prefer contour.</li>
            <li> I would order this again</li>
            <li> As I told you I am from CHILE and a friend of mine was visiting New York. She brought me my La Prairie creams, which arrived just in time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank yoy very much&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manuela Hidalgo Rose-Price</li>
            <li> The product feels very smooth and nice. But, I don&#x27;t see any obvious improvement in reducing my wrinkles, I am over 50.</li>
            <li> On the advice of a skin care person, I started using this in my early 30s every night and am now 73.  I have no wrinkles around my eyes and give this product most of the credit.  I remember wincing when I looked at the price, but went ahead with it and I would pay twice as much for the results.</li>
            <li> Product is as expected though having an idea of the expiration date would be nice.  This product works well for my particular needs..</li>
            <li> Wife loves this stuff - go figure!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 5 years.  Used something else before....it is a staple my daily skin care regime.</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream.  The results are temporary, but because it takes only a small amount the jar lasts about a year using it every night and most mornings.  Sounds a bit stingy but it really does take a very small amount to see results.  At night, after putting it below my eyes, I dab whatever is left on my ring finger above my eyes.  I know! That&#x27;s not what the beauty experts recommend but I have been doing it for many years and people often assume I am many years younger than my actual age - even at my periodontist&#x27;s office where the lighting is not at all flattering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I move enough for a month or so into a smaller jar for daily use and leave the protective seal semi-attached in the original jar to preserve freshness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t go to the department store!  By buying through Amazon, I now pay half of what I was paying.  And the delivery is quick and accurate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;April 27, 2013:  When I opened this jar, I found a large void in the cream.  It&#x27;s still less expansive than buying it through a department store, but this is a disappointing development.</li>
            <li> The product had a big air pocket in the center ,when I tapped it I actually had 3/4 of the jar full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was upset but figured maybe that&#x27;s the way it is because I&#x27;m buying it from amazon.....is it????&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ileana</li>
            <li> I have been using this eye cream for years.  I go off of it and then come running back after using other products.  It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this cream for over a year, and really happy with results. Light formula, moisturizes, and gets rid of dryness. If your concern are dark circles, than Id say no, as it doesnt do much about it. But overall, my favorite eye cream at the moment</li>
            <li> The absolute best eye cream there is</li>
            <li> It is a great product.  A very small amount is needed to be effective. I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Ihave used this for a long time.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I used this product a long time ago and it was good then.  Now with aging skin, I find this product even better.  It truly helps with minimizing wrinkles and keeping the delicate skin under the eyes firm.  It&#x27;s better than other expensive eye creams.</li>
            <li> Item was delivered as promised and was as described</li>
            <li> I am sure that this would be a great product for someone living in a dryer climate. I live in a very humid climate and this is much more than I need. It just feels greasy to me, although very hydrating. So for those of you out west, it would probably be perfect.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have been using it since 1978. It&#x27;s the best eye cream on the market although very expensive, it lasts a long time. Little cream is needed to get results. I&#x27;ve tried other products and always return to this baby!</li>
