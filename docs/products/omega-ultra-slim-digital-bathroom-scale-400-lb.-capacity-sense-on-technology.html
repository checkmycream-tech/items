            <li>It pleased her alot</li>
            <li>But since it doesn&#x27;t know how to register a correct weight, I can&#x27;t give it any more stars.    </li>

            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>The slim lines are very attractive, and it slips under smaller areas to slide out of sight.  </li>
            <li>I love this scale.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t found any scale to do better except for my WII which weighed within 1/10th of a pound.</li>
            <li>If one can fall in love with a scale, then this has happened to me.  </li>
            <li>I love using this thing.</li>
            <li>This is ok for the money.  </li>
            <li>most of the time it times out before getting a lock on your weight.  </li>
            <li>But now that I know how it works it works better.</li>
            <li>But I love it ...</li>

            <li>I love that you don&#x27;t have to \\&quot;activate\\&quot; it or anything.  </li>
            <li>but then the batteries died so I inserted more.  </li>
            <li>The Epica Ultra Slim Digital Bathroom Scale is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>WE have purchased Omega Ultra Slim Digital Scale, till now this is working excellent.</li>
            <li>What more can you want?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve held a 10# weight, step on the scale and weigh 20# more.  </li>

            <li>Definitely the best scale I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t matter to me , because I use them more to&lt;br</li>
            <li>pleased with scales</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want anything elaborate.  </li>
            <li>Since the unit is not \\&quot;fussy\\&quot;, there isn&#x27;t much more to say about it.  </li>

            <li>I suspect most of the 5 star reviews are faked or where created with some incentive.</li>
            <li>Most scales use watch/cell batteries that end up in landfills since they can&#x27;t be recharged.</li>

            <li>The best thing about this scale is it&#x27;s really low profile</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad that I found this one.</li>
            <li>But for the most part no complaints.</li>

            <li>What more does one need to say?</li>
            <li>The Product is OK but seems to have some problem with the weighing.</li>
            <li>Just make sure and set it on level ground (like tile or something), carpet doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Glad I did, though.</li>

            <li>An important thing to remember is that it needs to be calibrated each time it is put on the floor</li>
            <li>I have compared its results with my Wii Fit and another scale I have access to, and it is consistantly accurate.</li>
            <li>The light-up reading means I don&#x27;t have to turn the light on (although I do need my glasses).</li>
            <li>Overall a great product.</li>
            <li>I love the big numbers and bright light display.</li>
            <li>and it has a light on the screen.</li>
            <li>The price was cheap....</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s important for them to have a scale.  </li>
            <li>It arrived well packed and damage free.</li>
            <li>Comparing this scale to a traditional weight scale at my gym has shown great accuracy and consistency.</li>
            <li>Comfortable to stand on and extremely accurate.  </li>
            <li>let the light go out) then get on to get weighed</li>
            <li>A great value for the low price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a slim frame and is fairly light.</li>
            <li>My eyes aren&#x27;t great and the numbers are obvious,</li>
            <li>, it arrived on time in pristine condition and I am extremely happy with the product even though it tells me the truth about my lax attempts to lose the extra poundage.</li>
            <li>It has background light</li>
            <li>This is a nice, modern looking scale.</li>
            <li>it has a light that comes on..and NO tapping..</li>
            <li>It arrived earlier than they said and it looks and works great.  </li>
            <li>the sensors are on the bottom so important for it to be leveled or will be off readings.</li>
            <li>This is a great scale, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>This scale works really well and looks sleek and nice on my bathroom floor.</li>
            <li>Scale came well packaged for shipping and is light weight.</li>
            <li>simple as described looks great and works.</li>
            <li>so ambient light level or angle is not an issue.&lt;br /&gt;Simple to use, just step on and get your reading.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super slim, easily fits in a drawer, the numbers in the display are huge, so everyone can easily read them.  </li>
            <li>So far so good ...</li>
            <li>(Weight Watchers) which I always thought was quite good, but I actually like the Omega better because you don&#x27;t have to tap it for it to come on -</li>
            <li>Time will tell if it remains calibrated but so far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Seems that my old scales have been off a couple pounds ..to the good for me.</li>
            <li>Our old one fluctuated a good bit.</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m sure that for most people, that&#x27;s not going to be much of an issue at all, there will be one or two for whom it causes a problem.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>&amp; I did toss out my old one, good riddance.</li>
            <li>and...so far so good.</li>

            <li>It seems to be pretty accurate, with good repeatability, but I don&#x27;t really have another scale to compare it to, so who knows.</li>

            <li>and if I was satisfied, I think this might be a first and a reason to use this company.</li>
            <li>My original review is below.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been 2 months of using this every day and so far, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>I really love the blue screen much more than I ever thought I would!  </li>
            <li>Though I haven&#x27;t had this scale for long it is great.</li>
            <li>It arrived timely and so far we are very pleased.</li>
            <li>Tonight I checked the scale three times within two minutes and received three quite significant figures..</li>
            <li>I love it and highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews I was so excited to get this scale.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product so far.  </li>
            <li>I noticed the inconsistency one day when, excited about a signifigant weight loss, i weighed myself twice, minutes apart.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t think I could love a scale so much!  </li>
            <li>First off, the beautiful blue light will not stay lit which means that I can not get a reading of my weight because that&#x27;s where the numbers display.</li>
            <li>pretty sure I didn&#x27;t drop 20 pounds over night, and even with the reset step that you had to do to calibrate, it&#x27;s still not working!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Such</li>
            <li>After spending a great deal of time getting that mess straightened out...i began to look for a newer and better bathroom scale.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>Was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>Once I got it there, I was getting more consistent readings.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just a good scale in general.</li>
            <li>or it will shut off, this item is totally worth it!</li>
            <li>This scale fits perfectly in the small space under my bathroom vanity.</li>
            <li>I like that the weight stays on the screen for a few seconds to give you time to convince yourself and make your peace with it! :D</li>
            <li>Love the modern design!</li>
            <li>The price was agreeable, it shipped quickly and arrived in fine condition.  </li>
            <li>and I love just stepping on without having to touch it first.</li>
            <li>I am pretty satisfied with this scale.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty, sure, but don&#x27;t let looks fool you.</li>
            <li>Fun to use!  </li>
            <li>So far so good much better and accurate than our older scale.....</li>
            <li>Not this Omega -- I&#x27;ve been nothing but pleasantly surprised by its consistent accuracy, easy of use, and good looks.  </li>
            <li>Great product, works perfectly, looks slick, love the fact that it keeps your weight for a few seconds after you step off.&lt;br /&gt;Quick delivery as well.</li>
            <li>I have owned this for two months now, so hoping the product works great long term!</li>
            <li>Thin, easy to look at, and thoughtfully sized to fit in the smallest space, the scale was an excellent choice.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Omega Ultra Slim Digital Bathroom Scale after giving up on the clunky old gym scale which has a 5-10 lb lb margin of error on the best days.</li>
            <li>It must be stored parallel to the floor and under no circumstances should we put any objects on top of it, so it&#x27;s kind of a space hog.</li>
            <li>This is a serviceable bathroom scale that quickly delivers accurate weight measurements to 1/10 of a pound.  </li>
            <li>I got my scale quickly and the packaging was secure....</li>
            <li>Scale remains stable and reports measurements quickly and accurately.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had it for a month or so, and don&#x27;t know what the battery usage/durability will be, but so far I would rate this one a perfect 5 without reservation.</li>
            <li>The Omega delivers a quick, accurate weight in moments with it&#x27;s sense-on technology.</li>
            <li>however, it does motivate me for continued work outs and the bright blue screen is a cheerful reflection of the \\&quot;weigh\\</li>
            <li>This Ultra Slim Digital Scale is nice and easy to read, it&#x27;s light weight and always accurate.</li>
            <li>Those long intervals inbetween weighs will be more significant and make you feel much more confident about losing.</li>
            <li>It is sturdy, quick on soon as you step on it, easy to read, accurate, and remains on just the right amount of time after you get off.  </li>
            <li>It seems to take a few sample numbers and average them to get the best weight, which is great.</li>
            <li>Very consistent and accurate compared against my doctor&#x27;s scale.  </li>
            <li>Seems very consistent and accurate.</li>
            <li>Very stylish as far as scales go, haha :)</li>
            <li>I also liked that batteries were included in the box, so it was ready to use right out of the box.  </li>
            <li>The display is nice and large, and easy to read even when I&#x27;m standing straight.</li>
            <li>Great to just step on and get results with large easy to read digital readouts</li>
            <li>Seems pretty accurate and is easy to use, just tap it then stand on it and wait a couple seconds for it to weigh ya.</li>
            <li>easy to store and to use, the display is large and easy to read.</li>
            <li>Looks sleek and modern and very accurate.</li>
            <li>It is sleek, a nice fit in my bathroom, the bright purple digital numbers are very readable (large) and it is accurate.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d need the light on it, but I keep it in the closest and the light is super useful.  </li>
            <li>It is thin and light weight, but the best feature is it is easy to read.</li>
            <li>Ok how excited can you really be about a scale?  </li>
            <li>The large LED display is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I wanted a scale that did not require special batteries which is another reason I like this scale.</li>
            <li>Love the lighted display with LARGE numbers.  </li>
            <li>they were right!  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t even have to tap on the scale to start it, you just step right on and your weight appears in seconds!</li>
            <li>I feel motivated to eat right and exercise every time I weigh myself!</li>
            <li>and you have a reading right away!</li>
            <li>It is very accurate and most of all very consistent every time, even after moving its place.&lt;br /&gt;Beside being accurate it is also pretty stylish, featuring a blue back-lit LCD display,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done a good amount of testing this with other scales and found that it matches up pretty nicely.</li>
            <li>This scale is much more precise and steady than the one I bought and returned before it.</li>
            <li>Step on it, it lights up, shows your weight in nice large numbers, no need for glasses and no need to tap first....</li>
            <li>have found it to be accurate within 2 tenths of a pound compared to a professional scale and very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Ordering</li>
            <li>I had this scale on a tile floor because I heard that a hard floor gives you the best results.</li>
            <li>She says it is light, contemporary and nice looking, the numbers show up nice and big, and you do not need to tap it, all you need to do is step on it and it displays the weight.  </li>
            <li>Inserted included batteries and it has worked fine right from start.</li>
            <li>Would have given a perfect score of 5 stars but took off for the inconsistenties of the first weigh in as well as batteries missing.</li>
            <li>I like that it has a big bright screen.</li>
            <li>This is a great scale, so much better than my old digital scale.  </li>
            <li>working well, numbers are bright and big,</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s relatively cheap, and seems to give accurate and consistent readings.  </li>
            <li>These scales replaced a set of standard spring type scales and appear to be more accurate with a more visible read-out.  </li>
            <li>bright digital display.  </li>
            <li>Big, bright numbers.</li>
            <li>Big bright numbers.</li>
            <li>to assemble, sleek looking, big bright display.</li>
            <li>The cool thing about this one is that it also show</li>
            <li>Cool.</li>
            <li>So sweet.  </li>
            <li>Indeed, the people who gave this product good reviews should pay me back!!</li>
            <li>I was surprised as to how slim the scale was, really nice.</li>
            <li>Although I wish that transformation was true, it&#x27;s not the reality.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is you have to be perfectly still for it to get a good reading.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this because it had such good reviews, so I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this bathroom scale and really loved the way it looked when it arrived.  </li>
            <li>Full Recommendation.</li>
            <li>This seems to be true.</li>
            <li>The display is very visable and the design is slim &amp; stylish</li>
            <li>I purchased this scale after reading fairly good reviews, but upon receiving it, and using for almost a week my weight varied daily by up to 7 pounds!</li>
            <li>Low cost and good quality.</li>
            <li>If you want a good scale that is built to last, buy the [ASIN:</li>
            <li>I ordered this based on mostly good reviews, but once I received it, I couldn&#x27;t get the same weight twice.  </li>
            <li>Works very well, stylish looks.</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, its a good price, its sleek and works well enough for me.</li>
            <li>Overall a good product for recording a persons weight.</li>
            <li>It stays lit after you step off, and I hope to use this feature when traveling to make sure my suitcase is below the weight limit - and it will make it much easier.</li>
            <li>good necessary piece of gadget for bathroom.</li>
            <li>That is the only good thing about this scale.</li>
            <li>For what its worth, I dont have this problem with a cheap analog bathroom scale</li>
            <li>a good basic scale-</li>
            <li>It sure is slim, which to me is a real plus.  </li>
            <li>Love this scale it does not take up much space in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a good, simple scale to monitor my weight throughout my training process.</li>
            <li>Good value for a basic scale.</li>
            <li>The price was good and would definitely recommend buying this product from this company.</li>
            <li>If you put it on tiles make sure the edges that touch the ground are not in cracks, as this may throw off weight by as much as 10 pounds.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to anyone that needs a good scale.</li>
            <li>Well some days I don&#x27;t love it AS much....</li>
            <li>Nice clear reading panel for me even without my glasses</li>
            <li>I keep track of it anyway :) its really high quality tho!</li>
            <li>Enjoying it&#x27;s sleek, modern style.  </li>
            <li>Cheaper scales seem to have more variance in weight accuracy so the reasonable Omega&#x27;s cost is acceptable.</li>
            <li>We serarch online at Amazon for a bathroom scale and are delighted with the Omega Unlra Slim Digital.</li>
            <li>Overall, a good buy..</li>

            <li>The readings are consistent and accurate every time.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to know whether I weigh exactly 148.2, but I do need a scale which will accurately capture my weight changes.</li>
            <li>but it seems to be pretty accurate.  </li>

            <li>Works great so far, no complains, I should have gotten this earlier instead of freaking out about my weight so often.</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t believe I gained and lost 3 pounds daily for a week.</li>
            <li>I think it was worth spending money.</li>
            <li>This scale is decent for the price, however, I&#x27;ve noticed that the rubber feet on the bottom move quite easily</li>
            <li>Love the slimness of the scale-not scared of it tipping over like my old one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I told her not to pay any attention to the doctor scales, as now that she has her own, it is the only one that she need pay attention too anymore.</li>

            <li>The scale is a nice slim size and the display is easy to read in a dark or lighted room.  </li>

            <li>While many digital scales are touchy after being moved and re set (this one included), it is still pretty accurate</li>
            <li>It turns on when you step on it, so it&#x27;s really user friendly</li>
            <li>Fast &amp; friendly service and well packaged.</li>

            <li>it went on right away once batteries were put in and is working the way it is suppose too.</li>
            <li>I think the right price point is $15.</li>
            <li>I compared it to the results at the doctors office, and it is right on.  </li>
            <li>I still can&#x27;t get get it to work right.</li>
            <li>I chose a rating of one because I used it for two months and within that time, it stopped telling me the right weight anymore.</li>
            <li>And the price is right.</li>
            <li>This scale is almost right on from my doctor&#x27;s scale.</li>
            <li>I just step right on and it gives me my weight.  </li>

            <li>Price was right too!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I hear you&#x27;re supposed to weigh yourself in the morning, right?</li>
            <li>You step right on and it gives you your weight.</li>
            <li>This scale worked right for about three weigh ins.</li>
            <li>I weigh 250 pounds right now, and the scale felt sturdy.</li>
            <li>The digital scale is very accurate, classy looking for any bathroom and very light weight,</li>
            <li>This scale was also priced reasonably, and overall, I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to just step on the scale and get an instant residing rather than have to tap it first.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is such a shame because it is such a beautifully designed scale and it is lightweight.  </li>

            <li>Also the blue backlight makes it very easy to read</li>

            <li>And, I&#x27;m ecstatic, because I obtained the same weight as my old Taylor scale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the clean lines of the scale, it appears it will be very easy to keep clean, which is a bonus, too.  </li>
            <li>We specially liked the fact that our old scale was giving a reading 3 pounds heavier than the new one.</li>
            <li>numbers on display are very large, so even I can see.</li>
            <li>It has a very large, easy-to-read display.  </li>
            <li>Read out is very large.  </li>
            <li>That apart, I like the large blue LED display, the fact that I don&#x27;t have to tap on it before I stand on it and that it&#x27;s extremely light (Makes it much more convenient to stash or</li>

            <li>entire thing fits easily under my shelf and would also fit under my bed so it can be out of the way.</li>
            <li>I was looking for an easy to read digital scale that fit my budget.</li>
            <li>It takes 4 batteries but that&#x27;s cheaper than the special kind of battery I had to use with my other scale.</li>
            <li>So if it has been working fine and seems to go haywire just put in new batteries.</li>
            <li>(Perhaps the single most important quality in a scale.)      </li>
            <li>Thin / light-weight  Comfortable to stand on  Bright LCD makes digital reading easy  Easy to clean    CONS:  </li>
            <li>Big, bright easy-to-read digital dial works well in any light.  </li>

            <li>Slim, very modern looking, and the price was right.  </li>
            <li>I was a bit worried about if the maximum weight was true or not, as I&#x27;m a large man that comes pretty close to the limit.</li>
            <li>The display is nice &amp; large with a blue backlight.</li>
            <li>My recommendation is spending a little more to get one of the nicer scales on the market that read BMI and have better calibrating options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has an easy to read, lighted display and the numbers are large enough to see easily.</li>

            <li>But I wish it would give the right indication on the first try vs. having to do so three times.  </li>
            <li>When you step on you can see it searching for exactly the right weight for you at the moment.</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend Omega!</li>

            <li>I have only good things so far to say about this scale.  </li>

            <li>Been using for only about a month, but so far so good</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this scale to anyone looking for a good functional and professional looking scale.</li>
            <li>You may not think that extra step matters, but think about what you could do with an extra 2 or 3 seconds each day, plus the joy of not having to remember a two-sequence behavior chain in the morning behavior you&#x27;ve had your coffee.</li>

            <li>the large digital reading lights up which makes makes seeing your weight very easy.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even say this scale is good for a general idea of how much you weigh, because every week I weigh myself it goes down 10 pounds or more.</li>
            <li>If a scale is good, your four measurements will not be different by more than half pound.</li>
            <li>This scale is thin and light - nice display that is easy to read.  </li>
            <li>Certainly it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Bought  this scale to replace older analog scale, while weight does flucuate it is much more acurate than old scale.  </li>
            <li>so scooting it under a cabinet or such wouldn&#x27;t be a problem, and best of all, you step up and in seconds you have your weight lit up and easily read in big numbers and it stays lit for a couple of seconds after stepping down, for those of us who are challenged to see below our waist while standing on scales.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thin and nice looking and the numbers are very easy to read.</li>
            <li>Will not work on carpet but works great on hard wood floors or tile.</li>

            <li>Don&#x27;t have to tap before we step on, nice large display, feels much sturdier than our last scale.</li>
            <li>High quality look and feel, extremely accurate and consistent measurement, very affordable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s light, lighted, and likely to stay right where it is - in my kitchen!  </li>
            <li>I love these scales and had bought them before, but my toilet leaked water onto the floor and they didn&#x27;t quite work right since.  </li>
            <li>and so far it is showing accurate information.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s extrememly accurate, but it&#x27;s not too far off.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also accurate - the readings are consistent with the professional scales at my doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>could also be that I&#x27;m on the higher limit of this scale</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Also  they register decimal for those of us who want to know exactly what we weigh.</li>
            <li>Love the blue light-up display  </li>
            <li>I bought this scale as a first step in finally losing weight and getting healthy.</li>
            <li>I hope that i purchase more product from this seller in future.</li>
            <li>After 6 years, it still works - no cracks or chips; and, the display is still crisp.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, no matter what we did, the scale kept adding about 16-20 pounds per person - it was adding the weight of the scale to the people&#x27;s weight.  </li>
            <li>However, it has not weighed me consistently since I&#x27;ve had it.  </li>
            <li>Not to mention while testing it out the first day for some reason it would not set to 0 pounds to start it kept doing 26 pounds so every time I got on the scale</li>
            <li>I love the lighted blue display and it&#x27;s sleek design.  </li>
            <li>This scale is exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>At first it was reading about 14 pounds off.</li>
            <li>This scale is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what I need it to do.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it does exactly what I bought for it to do.</li>
            <li>Is no digital scale able to be used on carpet?</li>
            <li>To test accuracy, I placed weights on the scale, and sure enough, it was off....</li>
            <li>We settled on this scale, which was affordable and looked stylish enough.  </li>
            <li>It seems to not be consistent.</li>
            <li>The company has followed up several times to ensure we are completely satisfied...</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to finally have a scale that actually works and gives an accurate weight measurement.</li>
            <li>We like this scale so much more than our last one.</li>
            <li>Since then the weight has been consistent.  </li>
            <li>am going to be purchasing an analog scale as it seems that many digital scale suffer from this problem.</li>
            <li>I can read it and it gives me the exact weight.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Much better than prior scale.</li>
            <li>It shows a tiny bit more than I would like to see</li>
            <li>of my better recent Amazon.com experiences!</li>
            <li>;-) If you read and follow the instructions as soon as you receive it, you should have no problem with the product.</li>
            <li>Although it appears to be well-made, I could never get a consistent reading on it.  </li>
            <li>I like it so much better than the one I had that would never give me the same result each time!!</li>
            <li>Although this is the first scale I have bought and have nothing to compare, it has served me well.  </li>
            <li>I sometimes would gain as much as 5 pounds in one day!  </li>
            <li>Numbers appeared on the LED display, but I was NOT given an exact number.</li>
            <li>I went to replace batteries for first time and now the scale does not even power on.  </li>
            <li>No longer consistent.</li>
            <li>After reading a million reviews on scales with many people complaining of accuracy I finally decided on this one.</li>
            <li>Perhaps I got a lemon, but the scale did not give me consistent readings.</li>
            <li>It came on time and works as advertised, and it is pretty slim.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had any problem getting a consistent reading.  </li>
            <li>the scale is consistent</li>
            <li>It is consistent if you weigh yourself more than once in a short time.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>THE FIRST SCALE I GOT</li>
            <li>We have been using a digital scale for many years.  </li>
            <li>Work first time and every time.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t have to tap it first.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work because I liked the design and when looking for a scale of similar price, the Eatsmart scale reviews seem really fishy.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s exactly what I got.</li>
            <li>there is no tapping required, and the weight is consistent</li>
            <li>First calibration, spot on weight.</li>
            <li>This bathroom scale worked at first, for about two or three months.  </li>
            <li>the fact that you don&#x27;t have to first tap the scale before getting on is a plus.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The bathroom scale is exactly what I ordered</li>
            <li>I love the digital preciseness and the lit panel.  </li>
            <li>Purchased this scale to replace a glass top one that only lasted a year.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly as pictured, and shows weight to the tenth of a pound.  </li>
            <li>I followed the instructions by turning it on and then letting it turn off after you install the first time, but no go.  </li>
            <li>I use it on a wood floor and it seems to be pretty stable and repeatable.</li>
            <li>This scale performs exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>What more could you possibly want in a scale?</li>
            <li>#34;spot on&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li>Kind of closed my eyes and pointed when I was searching for a scale.</li>
            <li>This worked well for just about one year exactly, then it suddenly stopped being able to provide a consistent reading.  </li>
            <li>you step onto the scale, you never get a consistent number.</li>
            <li>At first it was 3-4 pounds off from the reading I would get from the manual gym scale.</li>
            <li>Extremely consistent.  </li>
            <li>The scale isn&#x27;t always consistent however.</li>
            <li>It works as advertised with consistent accuracy with in acceptable error margin.</li>
            <li>You do not have to step on the scale first to get it calibrated...just stand on it and your number lights up.</li>
            <li>Great for early morning or in the dark.</li>
            <li>The only thing that makes you pause is the sticker on top of the scale that reads as google translation with instructions on how to calibrate the thing.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Product exactly as described.</li>
            <li>It must&#x27;ve been the hot weather that makes the item change.</li>
            <li>I will be willing to pay more next time</li>
            <li>the scale is exactly what I hoped for.</li>
            <li>When I first got this, I was using it in my kitchen.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely not acceptable, I&#x27;m going to have to find a scale elsewhere that is more reliable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get the same as replacement...</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been consistent for all 3 of us.</li>
            <li>Consecutive weighing shows consistent weight.</li>
            <li>I believe this is not a generic problem with the design of this weighing machine but more of a quality control issue.</li>
            <li>The item shipped fast and was here before i even knew it!</li>
            <li>I can just step on the scale and get a reading without tapping first.</li>
            <li>Stays consistent sometimes.</li>
            <li>Having two scales (the first I know to be accurate)side by side, and getting a variance of up to 12 pounds is inexcusable.  </li>
            <li>&quot; the scale first.</li>
            <li>We got exactly what was advertised.</li>
            <li>I really like the scale a lot!</li>
            <li>The first reading is always 4lbs heavier</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>Consistent.</li>
            <li>No need to tap it first to turn it on.</li>
            <li>The weight change is often a surprisingly higher number (~5lbs) even though it does not look it.</li>
            <li>item was descibed exactly as it was in the description.</li>
            <li>The scale was exactly as described and works really well!</li>
            <li>It has been 100% consistent -</li>
            <li>The scale is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>The display is bright to read and the weight will remain on the scale for a few seconds once you get off the scale.</li>
            <li>Thanks for speedy delivery too!</li>
            <li>Readings are consistent for me, but inaccurate.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I will convince myself I am losing weight and eat hot fudge sundaes.  </li>
            <li>than that, the scale is exactly what I wanted and ordered.</li>
            <li>No complaints, exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I recommend buying this scale, its not expensive and you can change the weight options from pounds to kilos.  </li>
            <li>Tried it for more than a week, wildly different readings all the time.</li>
            <li>I can even leave the room light off and see them clearly.  </li>
            <li>Stays consistently on target.  </li>
            <li>and the weight is exact.</li>
            <li>I love my Omega Ultra Slim Digital Bathroom Scale.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>No matter how many times i repeat this process, the weight is always the same for that day.  </li>
            <li>This scale was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I put it in my closet and don&#x27;t need to turn on the light to weigh myself like I had to do with my old scale.</li>
            <li>the number changes pretty drastically.</li>
            <li>Ease of use and exact weight match with my doctor&#x27;s scale.</li>
            <li>everytime and it has been consistent.</li>
            <li>once it did the weight was the same regardless of how many times I got on it.</li>
            <li>Only gripe is that I wish the screen would lock my weight more consistently and not turn off causing me to get on it</li>
            <li>We as a family are pleased overall.</li>
            <li>Thanks a ton!</li>
            <li>I believe it&#x27;s better than I would have found at one of the big box stores at a lower cost</li>
            <li>When I first got the scale</li>
            <li>The scale has sense on technology, so you don&#x27;t have to turn it on first, it starts working as soon as you step on it.  </li>
            <li>It exactly matched up to the scale at my doctor&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Hoping it continues to provide correct weight and ill be happy!</li>
            <li>THE FIRST WEEKS</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I love the digital display.</li>
            <li>When I had my annual checkup, my home weight was exactly my weight at the doctor&#x27;s office!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Exactly as promised.</li>
            <li>Measurements consistent after moving scales about room, and repeatedly off and on the scales five times.</li>
            <li>This scale works exactly as it should, no problems.</li>
            <li>The first is that the description is ever-so-mildly inaccurate.  </li>
            <li>This scale does exactly what I need it to do without any confusion.</li>
            <li>No tapping the scale first.  </li>
            <li>This is my 3rd digital scale and this one is simple to use and I am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>What we love about this one is that it fits under the bathroom door so when you open the door all the way, it clears the scale no problem.</li>
            <li>Also like the fact that you can just stand on it and not have to touch it first and wait.  </li>
            <li>I read through many of the reviews and I was lead to believe the Omega Ultra Slim Digital Bathroom Scale would meet my needs.  </li>
            <li>I did not want any of this hassle, so I took way more time than I should have reading reviews for different scales on Amazon, and landed on this one.</li>
            <li>Since I first weighed myself I was 198 lbs</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Step on it the first time it says one thing, step on it again</li>
            <li>It is very slim and sleek-looking, and I&#x27;m happy with the purchase, since I didn&#x27;t need any of the additional features one finds on more expensive scales.</li>
            <li>We checked it for accuracy using 5 and 10 pound weights and it added exactly 5 or 10 pounds to our body weights.</li>
            <li>Consistent readings.</li>
            <li>Love digital feature</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s nice and wide, and pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li>Im off to shop for another one, hopefully it will last better than this one did.</li>
            <li>I love being able to see my weight gain and loss, even if it&#x27;s a small amount.</li>
            <li>For the first month</li>
            <li>Matches exactly the weight I get from my Dr&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>This is our first digital and we love the sleek look and accuracy.</li>
            <li>However, this scale isn&#x27;t consistent.  </li>
            <li>Then one day I moved it to mop in my bathroom and when I put it back on the floor it said that I weighed 356 lbs (which is over 200 more than what I weigh) and continued to error out when I tried to reset it until it just stopped working all together.</li>
            <li>This scale is great, to say the least.</li>
            <li>Hesistant at first but nothin to it works as described.</li>
            <li>I found the scale to be exactly as described on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Never knew what it was going to give me, sometimes it was lower and some times it was higher.  </li>
            <li>I love the blue from it too and how it automatically shuts off.</li>
            <li>This is my first scale, and I don&#x27;t know how I managed without one.  </li>
            <li>Every time I used it I could get three or more different</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase and because of the competitive price, as well as the specific reading (tenths of pounds)</li>
            <li>(I am within the higher end of what this scale supports).</li>
            <li>Very slim design which works great in my small bathroom, as the bottom edge of the door clears the scale with room to spare</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it is supposed to do and</li>
            <li>The size makes it easy to stand on even with size 14 feet, and it is extremely lightweight and easy to move.</li>
            <li>The number display is large and vibrant, and its nice not to having to tap it initially (you just step on to get a reading).</li>
            <li>This scale is so much more accurate than our previous scale.</li>
            <li>Quick reaction time with an accurate measure that will help anyone get a constant grasp on their weight.  </li>
            <li>The numbers are easy for me to read (I wear tri-focal glasses) and looking down at my feet area requires good lighting and larger letters and numbers...</li>
            <li>buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I eliminated the brand with the gazillion reviews on all their scales after reading that their reviewers were promised free goods among other things if they left a good review.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve waited a full month and have had no problems with my new scale.  </li>
            <li>Ordered a scale from them which arrived right away and was very well packaged.</li>
            <li>It has a very sleek look and design and according to what we knew about ourselves, was right on target with our weight.  </li>
            <li>The price and the many positive reviews made it the obvious choice.</li>
            <li>The light is a beautiful blue and stays on long enough for viewing</li>
            <li>And it doesn&#x27;t seem to mind being stored upright - it comes right back on easily and without needing to be re-set.</li>
            <li>The numbers are large and clear and it seems to be accurate.</li>
            <li>The display is bright and the numbers are large, but if you can&#x27;t see the display while standing on the scale, your weight will stay up for a few seconds after you step</li>
            <li>the number are large and bright and stay showing a few seconds after I step off the scale for me to look and see it</li>
            <li>love the features including: auto on, the extra large LCD display, the weight units in kg, or lbs, the 0.2 lb graduation and the fact that it does come with batteries to get you started.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love the low profile, the fact that it doesn&#x27;t need a tap to reset the display, and the ease of reading the large digits.</li>
            <li>The numbers are large and the blue background helps make them stand out more.</li>
            <li>The platform is more than large enough for size 12 feet.</li>
            <li>I generally weigh myself twice just to make sure I&#x27;ve gotten an accurate reading, and it always gives me the same reading, even after i re-zero it.</li>
            <li>This little scale is performing great so far.  </li>
            <li>Bought this scale after reading some favorable professional product reviews and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I decided to follow their steps - and so far, I am not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought it to replace my old manual, dial non-battery, non-digitable scale which lasted over 10 years, but was beat up looking...</li>
            <li>Just make sure to place it on a flat surface.</li>
            <li>Even better that it continues to track a weight loss which I give credit to hard work and an accurate scale!</li>
            <li>Also it came with it down batteries-which I love!.</li>
            <li>if you move it around you can tap it first, wait for the light to go back off then step right on.</li>
            <li>A great bathroom scale that seems to be as accurate as the expensive scales you&#x27;ll find at the gym or doctor&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li>Seriously, this guy&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>Weight is to the tenths of a pound, so if you are a serious weight-watcher, this is great.  </li>
            <li>Bright digital readout, low to the floor, no flipping over.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve had it for a few months, it works accurately, stores well, and you can set things on top of it without it activating.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that the numbers are big and illuminated against a blue background making then so easy to read.</li>
            <li>Good investment, I definitely recommend this scale to anyone looking for a simple bathroom scale.</li>
            <li>The look of this scale alone is worth the price; very sleek and modern.</li>
            <li>This scale is pretty, lightweight, and has large numbers.</li>
            <li>It is a good scale but it is very sensitive if I wiggle a toe or even move a little it will not measure right.  </li>
            <li>This is not a perfect scale, but it works fine for the price - better than some that I&#x27;ve paid more money for.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a simple scale that give accurate weight (I compared it right after a doctor&#x27;s appointment</li>
            <li>The one big reason was all the good reviews and also the LARGE back lit LED display.  </li>
            <li>THE LIGHT AROUND IT IS A PLUS- EASY TO READ EVEN IN THE DARK.</li>
            <li>We are both big people and this scale is easy to use, no tapping it first.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because of positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>I chose this scale because it had positive reviews and had the profile &amp; features</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s right on with what my doctor&#x27;s office says I weigh, so I think it&#x27;s a decent product.</li>
            <li>Works great after calibration, step on to turn on and weight displays brightly, no buttons or switches.</li>
            <li>I can step on it without tapping it first to activate it, and the lit display works really well.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend and I were very worried that this was not reporting the correct weight the first week we owned it.  </li>
            <li>This product is very lightweight and almost 99% gives consistent readings.</li>
            <li>I chose this scale because I wanted to see exactly how much I was losing each day.</li>
            <li>The footpads are rubberized in feel and the whole thing looks pretty sleek for the price.</li>
            <li>I freaked out that I had gained weight so fast, but then realized you just have to tap it first and then get on.</li>
            <li>It does its job and really helps me know and understand how much I weigh!  </li>
            <li>This scale is very slim which is exactly what we wanted.</li>
            <li>I recieved this item pretty fast.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast from Amazon, thanks!</li>
            <li>First weight ever purchased &amp; really like  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend storing anything on top of it long</li>
            <li>For the past two weeks, I&#x27;ve been dieting and exercising, and thought it would be good to track progress as I go with a scale.</li>
            <li>Beautiful and so thin.</li>
            <li>Not sure why others give good reviews.</li>
            <li>Small size that is not ugly or obvious (we were able to slide it under some furniture) and it was very accurate.</li>
            <li>It has a blue light that is easy to view in the dark and easy to read screen.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much more lightweight than our last, and it has a classic design.</li>
            <li>Even though the analog scales may not get your true weight exactly right, they will deliver exactly the same reading every time if you weight doesn&#x27;t change.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Initially, I was going to purchase another scale on Amazon that had a large number of positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>Thankfully this scale is pretty tough and should be a great helping hand in my quest to become healthy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Unlike other digital scales which provide extra features and don&#x27;t eventually work, this is the best bet for weight watchers.</li>
            <li>Works fine, looks sharp, nice price, batts have lasted several months and thanks the Maker</li>
            <li>Easy to use, just step on, highly visible display, and also quite accurate when I compared to it to other scales.  </li>
            <li>However, since the second day of use, the Omega has given consistent and highly accurate weight readings.  </li>
            <li>It stays consistent on multiple uses and was accurate when compared to the doctors weighted scales.</li>
            <li>It seems to be accurate as I first weigh myself on this and then on a doctors weight scale, both the same!!  </li>
            <li>It seems to be accurate--I weighed myself on a scale with weights that I know is accurate, and this scale gave almost exactly the same weight.</li>
            <li>It has big numbers I can read easily so that I know to either stop eating cookies or go ahead and have another.</li>
            <li>This slim, digital scale is easy to&lt;br /&gt;use</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice change from my previous scale which did not have replaceable batteries and had to be tossed when it quit working.</li>
            <li>Lights up with powder blue background for easy sight.    </li>
            <li>* EASY TO READ DIGITAL DISPLAY.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a simple scale that I think will not break easily.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to read and the weight actually flashes and then stops when it is at your weight.  </li>
            <li>Blue backlit numbers are easy to read without my glasses.</li>
            <li>simple to set up, sleek design, easy to use.</li>
            <li>The scale was simple to set up and is easy to read and use.  </li>
            <li>It wil be easy to move from one bedroom to the next.</li>
            <li>Super reliable so far.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a scale that wasn&#x27;t going to take up a lot of room, was easy to set up, and simple to use.</li>
            <li>It works, it is slim enough the the bathroom door goes easily over it.  </li>
            <li>clear display that turns on quickly.</li>
            <li>It is easy to read and remembers that last reading.</li>
            <li>Simple, easy to use, streamlined and durable.  </li>
            <li>So far the scale works well; I had no trouble getting it calibrated at first use and the batteries seem fine.</li>
            <li>I especially like how easy it is to see what my weight is.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to read and the only set up involved is take the packaging off and go!</li>
            <li>It was easy to set up and has been functioning well since I got it last month.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to read and stays on a second after getting off of it.</li>
            <li>The read out screen has a blue background, which makes the numbers easy to read from a standing position.  </li>
            <li>(let&#x27;s face it, we occasionally stomp if the first light tap doesn&#x27;t do the trick).  </li>
            <li>It worked well for the first two weeks, then it was off and on with weight fluctuations and now...I can stand on it and have my weight change from 1 to 8 different weights all before the light shuts itself off.</li>
            <li>Easy to read digital display.  </li>
            <li>My Omega is still going strong, on the same batteries that came with it, one year ago.  </li>
            <li>My Omega is still going strong, on the same batteries that came with it, one year ago.  </li>
            <li>6 months later still running strong.</li>
            <li>Digital numbers are large and easy to see.</li>
            <li>The Omega has a large digital numeric display which is easy to read.  </li>
            <li>Large and easy to read digital display.</li>
            <li>The numbers are large enough to see easily.</li>
            <li>The display is large enough and it has a backlight for easy reading.</li>
            <li>So I decided to get this scale, large numbers, digital, 400lbs maximum weight, backlight for easy read.  </li>
            <li>The digital numerals are large and easy to read.</li>
            <li>Large numbers easy to read and also weight stays on for ten seconds.  </li>
            <li>The digital reading is large and easy to read.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s low to the ground with a large footprint - making it easy to stand on.  </li>
            <li>It is accurate down to the ounces, so you keep track of your weight in an accurate manner.</li>
            <li>The numbers are large and backlit.</li>
            <li>The numbers are large and readable...</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t tried to use it for large packages yet, to get a mailing weight for postage,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m expecting this large display to help with that.</li>
            <li>Large easy-to-read display.</li>
            <li>Large LCD readout</li>
            <li>The accuracy of weighing and the large display and illumination is a plus for someone like me who has a vision problem.</li>
            <li>It has everything that I wanted in a scale: LARGE display of the numbers, lighted display, slim profile, step on to turn on, etc.</li>
            <li>Numbers are large and easy-to-read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>large display of the weight makes it a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li>Large well lit numbers.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s a large Man and it is quite sturdy.</li>
            <li>this one give me a number for my large self.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my mom because of the large display.</li>
            <li>Although it is slim, it is has a large surface area.</li>
            <li>The numbers are so large I can read them without my glasses.  </li>
            <li>Mom&#x27;s elderly and the large display works well for her</li>
            <li>Now that is something you certainly don&#x27;t expect from a weighing scale.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a large fellow</li>
            <li>I wish the manufacturers would realize that not all bathrooms are large.</li>
            <li>You have large numbers that are displayed.</li>
            <li>Large numbers - can&#x27;t miss them.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need glasses to read the large lighted screen.</li>
            <li>I also like the large, lit</li>
            <li>The read-out is large and stays lighted quite a while.  </li>
            <li>It certainly scores in the looks department.</li>
            <li>While I cant say for certain that the build quality is an issue, I would have to imagine that the sounds I heard were not in fact part of the feature set of the scale.&lt;br /&gt;- Reliability.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Conclusion: If you&#x27;re in the higher range that thisscale supports, you might be better off buying a slightly more expensive model with higher build quality and more reliable measuring for larger weights.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really bummed and have to believe that the majority of positive reviews are faked.  </li>
            <li>I have yet to see a digital scale that is consistent and accurate for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Its pretty nice tho, thin and light.</li>
            <li>It seems that most of the new scales are larger than those of 20-30 years ago.  </li>
            <li>This is a very sleek and modern looking digital scale and is pretty accurate.  </li>
            <li>Wide so is very comfortable when you see your weight.</li>
            <li>The display lights up in the dark, digits are large and very easy to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved the design and the ease of our new bathroom scale--just step on it, wait, and the good or bad news is there.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Original 3 star review 3/2011:&lt;br /&gt;Scale is nicely priced, very good looking &amp; arrived fast, but the black numbers on a blue background make it hard to read before you put your contacts in/glasses</li>
            <li>I wish it were made sturdier, but I can just slide the magnet back in and it works fine.</li>
            <li>Omega Ultra Slim Digital scale turned out to be a fine choice.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a pretty decent scale.</li>
            <li>Looks pretty decent for the price.</li>
            <li>If you want a very simple, easy to use, modern looking scale for a reasonable price, this one should not disappoint.</li>
            <li>The readout is large and legible.</li>
            <li>I like the large LCD screen which lets me see without my glasses on how much I weigh.</li>
            <li>Has a large legible display.</li>
            <li>A nice little surprise..</li>
            <li>I was interested in purchasing one of the older model that did not use batteries, but I am very please with this product.  </li>
            <li>It give accurate readings and is large enough that I don&#x27;t feel like I am trying to balance on it.</li>
            <li>yeah, it would be great to weigh that little, but when this scale says 115 and you go to the doctor later that day</li>
            <li>The Omega Ultra Slim Digital bathroom scale is simple, clean, as the name says, slim, the display numbers are large and easy to read.</li>
            <li>This scale is very flat so although my bedroom door opens across it, the door easily clears the scale.</li>
            <li>Very flat and easy to stand on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m unsure how accurate it is since this is the only scale I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s thin, the display is huge, it stays lit for 10 seconds... and it looks nice, too.  </li>
            <li>UNTIL PURCHASING THIS SCALE, I thought that the only accurate weight management tool was the high-priced scales physicians use in their offices...</li>
            <li>The platform is of thick clear glass over the scales weight mechanisms, all covered attractively with a neutral tone color band about two inches</li>
            <li>Our 35-year-old scale just isn&#x27;t accurate enough.</li>
            <li>Accurate to 0.2 lbs and reliable (almost always the same measure,</li>
            <li>Finally one that&#x27;s accurate.  </li>
            <li>I place my feet in the same spots every time to get a really accurate read</li>
            <li>Not as accurate (for the price) as a cheaper one purchased at a later date.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it does give me the same weight 2 times out of 3, but who knows how accurate that is.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Appears to be accurate and was very simple to start.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely accurate, as my weight was the same at home and at my doctors office.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be accurate based on my prior scale and the doctor&#x27;s office scale.</li>
            <li>I was looking for an accurate simple scale and this proved to be just that.</li>
            <li>Only then can you get on it and get an accurate weight reading for yourself.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s accurate and still works months later.</li>
            <li>This scale weighs several pound light, so I never have any idea what my real weight is.</li>
            <li>This digital scale provides the accurate measure, and works with AA batteries.</li>
            <li>Seems accurate enough...</li>
            <li>all the manufacturer says it is - I need to use it daily for health conditions and it is accurate to my doctors scale.</li>
            <li>My only wish would be that it wasn&#x27;t so darn accurate.</li>
            <li>Works very well, gives reliable numbers.</li>
            <li>Sleek, modern, noninvasive disegn</li>
            <li>FAST delivery.  </li>
            <li>Very durable.</li>
            <li>It is very lightweigh, and , doesn&#x27;t skid on the floor.</li>
            <li>I was in a real pickle without a scale!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really like this scale as I do not have to tap it before standing on it to get weighed.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping .</li>
            <li>Very sleek looking.</li>
            <li>My goodness never knew there was so much scale competition</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to this scale.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still amazed at how much bathroom scales can cost</li>
            <li>* THIN, SLEEK, AND ATTRACTIVE.  </li>
            <li>Thanks bunches.</li>
            <li>Thanks   </li>
            <li>Very acurate.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, and well-done.</li>
            <li>People, read and follow the simple instructions and your scale will always work precisely the way it was meant to work.</li>
            <li>For the men, myself being one, they are very sturdy made, which I like a lot.  </li>
            <li>then you&#x27;re ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>like the blue light-</li>
            <li>Although I really like the product, I may not have made the purchase had I noticed this.  </li>
            <li>Scale works really well.  </li>
            <li>This scale is very inaccurate.</li>
            <li>I have no idea how much I weigh.  </li>
            <li>Very slim, compact, and</li>
            <li>Very inconsistent weights&lt;</li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this scale!</li>
            <li>Then on two visits to our doctor we found that the Omega&#x27;s numbers were very close when clothing was taken into account.  </li>
            <li>This works very well.</li>
            <li>but if you shift your weight it can swing as much as 10 pounds.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I really like this scale.</li>
            <li>It is not however, very consistant.</li>
            <li>I suspect if i had spent a bit more it might not have the issues I have noticed.  </li>
            <li>Much more than I expected for the price.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>the scale itself is slim and really compact.</li>
            <li>You have to stand real still for it to register.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Then it is ready to use.  </li>
            <li>One of the things I really like about it is that you don&#x27;t have the tap the scale and wait for it to &#x27;tare&#x27;.</li>
            <li>The batteries (2 AAA type) are primarily used for the Digital LED numerical display.    </li>
            <li>When we got it, all we had to do was put the batteries in and set it on the ground and it was ready to use.  </li>
            <li>I would really like to know how to contact the manufacturer</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely reccomend this scale.</li>
            <li>Response time is also very quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very slim and compact.</li>
            <li>The picture and title is very deceiving.&lt;br</li>

            <li>(let&#x27;s announce to the whole house we are getting on the scale)</li>
            <li>We really like this scale.</li>
            <li>Very sleek and modern design.</li>
            <li>This is so much easier than the tap, wait.</li>
            <li>In fact, the light will actually turn off while you&#x27;re standing on the scale.</li>
            <li>I really like this scale.</li>
            <li>It is lightweight and efficient and does not require an intense set up procedure by the user.</li>
            <li>Works very well for me.  </li>
            <li>I really like that I don&#x27;t have to tap and then step on -</li>
            <li>I really like that this scale feels so sturdy.</li>
            <li>I really like that the read out lights up when you step on it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this one fore 2-3 months and works very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a simple, cheap scale that works well.</li>

            <li>It looks modern and feels well made.  </li>
            <li>The scale arrived incredibly fast, well packed and shipped.</li>
            <li>and she really likes it.</li>
            <li>The final number persists for a bit with the light.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon Prime</li>
            <li>I received the package very promptly</li>
            <li>The Sense-on Technology works really well, as soon as I stand on the scale it calibrates the weight.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>So much so that the slim form factor is an inspiration to become slimmer :</li>
            <li>and it has held up through much use and a couple of moves.</li>
            <li>I really like this scale.</li>
            <li>I really like my Omega Ultra Slim bathroom scale.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It works when it wants to work and not all of the time.</li>
            <li>so there is t much wobble when standing in</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s ready to go.</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable also.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t wobble around too much.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t been very meticulous in looking at the scale or it&#x27;s functions.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not supposed to do much else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like these scales.</li>
            <li>It is very helpful to see results in increments of .2 pounds.</li>
            <li>it seems like it&#x27;s very accurate.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I could put it in a very convenient place</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>Doesnot even occupy much place .</li>
            <li>the sizes, but somehow it didn&#x27;t really register in my mind.  </li>
            <li>I knew it was very  close if not</li>
            <li>Plus the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very please with my purchase.</li>
            <li>The weight amounts jiggle around too much and don&#x27;t stay still.</li>
            <li>What I really got the scale for was to weigh my cat, who is overweight, according to the veterinarian and is supposed to lose weight.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable as well.</li>
            <li>Plus delivery is fast.</li>
            <li>, it couldn&#x27;t be much easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>when it shuts off it&#x27;s calibrated and ready to go.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li>Vendor send it fast and well packaged.</li>
            <li>too much waiting</li>
            <li>If you even move the scale an inch on the floor, the weight really changes.  </li>
            <li>The weight may change as much as 2 or 3 pounds.</li>
            <li>It has been working very well.</li>
            <li>it is very slim.</li>
            <li>Also shipped to receive fast.</li>
            <li>This produt will not take up much room.</li>
            <li>But the scale is very INACCURATE.  </li>
            <li>Very acccurate.  </li>
            <li>I really do like this scale.  </li>
            <li>Very inaccurate.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this scale!</li>
            <li>It also weighs in decimals, so I can see my weight loss progress...which is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does its job and tells me how much I weigh.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a cheap product and definitely not with the money</li>
            <li>I really like that the scale is sleek</li>
            <li>: Tells me how much I weigh</li>
            <li>: Now I know how much I weigh</li>
            <li>but I think that&#x27;s pretty normal</li>
            <li>and it was ready to use.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too.</li>
            <li>AND THEY WERE VERY CLOSE,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fond of this scale.</li>
            <li>It is slim and does not take much space and results</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also had mine for not even a year, and I guess too much water got on it from the shower...</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this scale to everyone!</li>
            <li>Absolutely.</li>
            <li>(very helpful trying to weigh your luggage).</li>
            <li>It is also very slim.  </li>
            <li>The scale helps him stay on target as often as he wants now.</li>
            <li>Makes it much easier to view.</li>
            <li>Slim and does not take up much space.</li>
            <li>Arrived ready to use and as advertised.</li>
            <li>I am getting ready for bariatric surgery, and will need to closely monitor my weight after the operation.  </li>
            <li>THanks</li>
            <li>When it computes the final reading, an indicator light blinks.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the product, although not happy when I read my WEIGHT.</li>
            <li>I appreciate that the numbers light up and stay lit for several seconds after you step off the scale.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>My husband and I really like this scale.  </li>
            <li>This one is stable and doesn&#x27;t make me guess how much I really weigh.</li>
            <li>The directions do request that you store it on the ground as if you were to step on it at any time, but it doesnt take up much space anyways.&lt;br /&gt;Takes 4 AAA batteries which are provided in the box.</li>
            <li>Weight fluxuates too much.  </li>
            <li>This is a great scale with a thin profile, that I like.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for the speedy service.</li>
            <li>Not to insult her, but because she found herself getting very discouraged and upset</li>
            <li>how much she weighed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shipped out fast.</li>
            <li>(not standing straight and still can alter your reading...</li>
            <li>Out of the box, pop in the batteries and you are ready to go.</li>
            <li>So much nicer not having to tab or stomp just to get it to work.</li>
            <li>Also, the price is extremely reasonable.  </li>
            <li>Really needed one since we are on the road for months at a time.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>LIke really?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very dissapointed.</li>
            <li>Very dissatisfied ,I will be returning it.  </li>
            <li>The weight is very close to my doctor&#x27;s scale.</li>
            <li>Very sleek design</li>
            <li>I really like these scales.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping ...</li>
            <li>really like the company I bought this from.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thin and attractive for a scale.  </li>
            <li>The results vary by as much as 5 to 8 pounds.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;Omega Ultra Thin Digital Bathroom Scale\\&quot; is an excellent quality and value...    </li>
            <li>But I liked them enough to buy a second one.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for ease of use then the Omega Ultra Thin Digital Bathroom Scale is perfect!</li>
            <li>And I love that I can see the screen so big and clear.</li>
            <li>I was impressed with how thin the scale is and how the weight is illuminated on the digital display.</li>
            <li>Once I established a good firm foundation for it, I had absolutely no trouble.  </li>
            <li>It gives the same reading when you get on and off it several times and agrees with another scale I own.</li>
            <li>I love the bold numbers and bluelight, as now I can see my weight even in the dark!!</li>
            <li>I like my new scale very much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very accurate and extremely convenient to use.</li>
            <li>It is very accurate after comparing to two other scales.</li>
            <li>No complaints; light small easy to use and sleek design</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small and sleek and fit easily in a corner of my bathroom.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve only had it for a few weeks, but so far, so good!  </li>
            <li>I completely understand the non-slip rubber for the feet, but the metal that can apparently wear through the rubber in no time seems like a pretty significant design flaw.</li>
            <li>We have ONE truly level spot in our old home and that is right inside the bathroom.</li>
            <li>Honestly it&#x27;s just plain inaccurate.</li>
            <li>The blacklight is useful and the screen is easy to see when looking down.</li>
            <li>More seriously, it would also be great for someone having trouble seeing around their expansive tummy---or perhaps to weigh yourself and then yourself with an object you would like to weigh---like your toddler, or the dog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;and easy to step up on for us who are not young anymore, and&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far the scale is usually the bringer of good news as far as my weight is concerned!I was able to lose 30 pounds with the help of this scale by dieting and exercising,with a keen eye on my weight almost daily..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very nice looking and small enough to put in a corner of our bedroom but large enough to feel comfortable standing on it.  </li>
            <li>I like the aesthetic appearance, the blue led light is bright enough to read even in the dark.</li>
            <li>This scale is very slim, easy to read, easy to calibrate, and displays your information seconds longer than my other digital units.</li>
            <li>It seems quite accurate and gives repeatable results, though as others have noted it needs a perfectly flat floor.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also sharp looking in comparison to most bathroom scales.</li>
            <li>We love that this scale lights up, like our other one did that bit the dust.  </li>
            <li>I have used other beriatric bathroom scales and this one is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to find a website, phone number, or any other contact information for EPI or Epica.</li>
            <li>When other scales just tell me &amp;#34;E&amp;#34;  (which I suppose must mean Excellent)</li>
            <li>Just be sure to check the box carefully for batteries, I almost threw them away!</li>
            <li>He says he is very happy with the product and has just broken through 340!!</li>
            <li>All you need to do is step on it and in a few seconds your actual weight is displayed in a pleasant blue light.  </li>
            <li>Another great feature about these scales is that they run on regular batteries rather than a disc battery, so it costs so much less to operate then my old Frontgate scales.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a second scale for a friend, who apparently is having slightly better luck with his.</li>
            <li>Work great, small enough for our bathroom.</li>
            <li>There is nothing fun about buying a scale when you need to lose weight, so other than this little flat square being my sworn enemy, it&#x27;s a good product, easy to read and to store.</li>
            <li>The scale is small, fairly lightweight, but has a large easy-to-read display that could be easily read in the dark!</li>
            <li>Just make sure you don&#x27;t look down until it is done and stay very still.</li>
            <li>Switching back between kg and lb is good and the metric stays for 3-5 seconds after you get down</li>
            <li>I needed a scale that was accurate to record my weight daily for medical reasons.&lt;br /&gt;After looking at many different ones and reading reviews, I chose this Omega.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s very modern and classy  Recommended</li>
            <li>It is ultra slim as described, and has a modern, high tech look to it.  </li>
            <li>This scale appears to be highly inaccurate and very unreliable.</li>
            <li>It was very easy to calibrate, only needed to be placed on a flat surface (floor).  </li>
            <li>the blue lighted read out area is more then large enough to see your weight.  </li>
            <li>Love the low-profile of these scales;  Small bathroom, and the door opens right over them.</li>
            <li>Definitely the right choice!</li>
            <li>This scale replaced a very old clunker and has been amazingly accurate next to my doctor&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li>I like it pretty accurate with my other two scales,</li>
            <li>it was accurate, on point, and didn&#x27;t take long to calculate my weight</li>
            <li>This scale is really accurate, and it doesn&#x27;t take long to load.</li>
            <li>Very low profile, big bright digital display.</li>
            <li>This scale is accurate, looks good, and thin enough to store away when you don&#x27;t like the number it shows you.</li>
            <li>Why did I wait so LONG to order this fantastic scale??</li>
            <li>All that was true until recently.  </li>
            <li>I also had checked the various scale market and finally after much  reading of many reviews opted for these.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep this review short and sweet...</li>
            <li>thought the error in this scale would be relative to my true weight, but there the error seems to be redrawn each time you step on the scale.</li>
            <li>We are both pretty health conscious and run.  </li>
            <li>far it reads consistently and the illumination is great.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>nice and small, compact.  </li>
            <li>It is worth a few extra dollars to get a scale that has the nice features this one has.  </li>
            <li>It is small and unobtrusive, but also nice looking.</li>
            <li>I so far think this scale is pretty descent.  </li>
            <li>I love that the display is backlit also, so you can see it in the dark.</li>
            <li>and I love how it doesn&#x27;t immediately go dark when I step off of it.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be much sturdier and fancy then the last scale I had, but I did weigh more back then.</li>
            <li>Short and sweet</li>
            <li>Since my main use is to weigh my overweight cat that is on a special diet, the speed is a definite asset.  </li>
            <li>It is also very accurate, weighing me exactly what my physician&#x27;s office weighed me a few hours before!</li>
            <li>the more my weight is going down.</li>
            <li>so if you are too big to see it when you&#x27;re on the scale, you can still see what you weigh; it doesn&#x27;t wobble even if the floor is not absolutely flat; it doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of excess functions most of us don&#x27;t want</li>
            <li>Very comfortable to stand on and love the blue black lit digital display.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s brand new!</li>
            <li>New diet , lost 12 pounds in three weeks!</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s my third (even though the name on the top changes frequently, it&#x27;s still the same exact design).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other over the counter scales, and not been particularly happy with the accuracy of digital overall.  </li>
            <li>My husband has decided he wants to live longer.</li>
            <li>If I move its location, a whole new set of weights show up.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this because it had more good than bad reviews.</li>
            <li>The scale&#x27;s style, value (much less than those shown in most stores), easy-to-read LCD, quality and simplicity make it a pleasure to weigh in every morning.  </li>
            <li>Now he is eating less so he won&#x27;t weigh more.  </li>
            <li>Easy to set up, minimal learning curve.</li>
            <li>changes it by half a pound or more, even after I reset it as instructed.</li>
            <li>This is a much more reliable scale than our previous 20-year-old Healthometer scale.   </li>
            <li>I particularly like that you don&#x27;t have to tap it to make it work.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so sad; we&#x27;ve shared so many diets together; so many successes and failures.</li>
            <li>This scale replaced an older dial model that had about a five pound swing, depending on how my feet were positioned and weight was shifted.  </li>
            <li>You can switch from Kilos to Pounds and vice versa by pressing the button located on the bottom side of the device (upper area, in the middle of the top row).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We bought this scale to replace an older Taylor model.  </li>
            <li>Crystals\\&quot; (that&#x27;s the actual \\&quot;techno\\&quot; for how most all these type scales work) which converts Mechanical Forces (weight) into an Electrical force (voltage &amp; current), that feeds the Electronic Measuring Circuitry.  </li>
            <li>At this price you&#x27;ll be hard pressed to find a better scale!</li>
            <li>I purchased the Omega Ultra Slim Digital scale to replace an old, cheap scale that - for whatever reason - I&#x27;ve been hanging onto for years.</li>
            <li>My 20 month old son especially loves stepping on and off of it to see it light up.</li>
            <li>My one year old sits on it and likes to tap the light, and my cat occasionally perches on the thing, and no harm done.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty simple - exactly what I need.  </li>
            <li>Love the big numbers, and you weigh the same, no changes by getting on and off.  </li>
            <li>No need to touch it beforehand - you just step on it, stand still, and it lights up and flashes your weight then shows it steady.  </li>
            <li>Also, the slim and contemporary design fits well in my batchlor pad.</li>
            <li>Nice big wide area to stand on so your not teetering while trying to weigh.  </li>
            <li>I recently purchased this scale at Amazon and it arrived quickly in the mail.</li>
            <li>I finally bought myself a digital scale and love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve re-weighed myself several times in a row and never gotten a result that was different than more than a tenth or two.</li>
            <li>It works decently.  </li>
            <li>It is much lighter than my old scale and much prettier.  </li>
            <li>We bought this scale to replace a different brand model which wasn&#x27;t old or cheap but</li>
            <li>The scale is flat enough for him to comfortably stand on and the numbers are just in the right place.</li>
            <li>Delivered in two days and is exactly as shown -- very thin, accurate and easy to read all at a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Secondly, there are 4 wheels/suctioned that enable the scale to stay solid and be accurate, but ever since the first time I took the scale out of the box, one or another of these suctions have always popped out of alignment and this causes a 100 lb variation in my weight.</li>
            <li>We needed a digital scale that was accurate to the tenths as our son is a wrestler and knowing exact weights is necessary.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been very consistent reading the same thing if I weigh myself within minutes to get two readings.  </li>
            <li>Pretty simple scale, digital, light, sleek, instructions included.</li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s just not true of a cheap weighing machine!</li>
            <li>Packaging was not excessive, so not too much trash, delivery was prompt and issue-free.</li>
            <li>The digital display is large and backlit, making it easy to read and avoiding the hunching over effect caused by smaller scale read-outs.  </li>
            <li>I like the no-nonsense ability to just get on and obtain a digital reading and step off - that weight reading stays lit/visible for several seconds before it shuts off making it easy to see/read the large numbers visible.</li>
            <li>Easy to see in the dark thanks to the backlit display.</li>
            <li>You just step on and be still for a few seconds and the readings are very accurate.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend buying this scale.</li>

            <li>If you&#x27;re in the market for a bathroom scale, I would highly recommend purchasing this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>

            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>

            <li>I highly suggest this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone looking to gain control of their weight.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>have used this scale for a couple of weeks now, and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>reccomend this scale highly.</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend it.</li>
            <li>and the weight differs from the other scale, (the accurate one) by as much as 3-4 lbs.</li>
            <li>because I don&#x27;t really care if its a pound or less off from time to time, im really just looking for a fairly accurate \\&quot;ballpark\\&quot; weight...which is what this gives me.</li>
            <li>We got this product a few weeks ago and so far it&#x27;s been a quick and accurate scale.  </li>
            <li>It was very simple to setup and is pretty consistent on the weight it shows if calibrated properly following the instructions (which are pretty simple).It is also very sleek and the display is large and clear.</li>
            <li>The display is large and clear.</li>
            <li>Readout is large and clear to read.</li>
            <li>The display on this weighing scale is large and clear.</li>
            <li>weighed myself at home with it and then went to the doctor and used their large, professional electronic scale</li>
            <li>The numbers are large and can clearly be seen.  </li>
            <li>This scale is very accurate, although I wish it would lie to me every once in a while, or at least console me when it reads a higher result than it is used to.</li>
            <li>my friend&#x27;s scale worked ok for a little while</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for an estimation of your weight, this scale will work for you, but if every little bit matters, you better look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that it weighs so little, enabling me to take it with me when I go on trips.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great and with other similarly priced scales that don&#x27;t look nearly as sleek or reliable as this one I would definitely recommend this one over others.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s accurate (agrees with my doctor&#x27;s scale), repeatable to the tenth of a pound, and has a large back-lit display that I can read in the dark without my glasses.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, no waiting for flashing settings etc., like some other scales.</li>
            <li>In other words easy to do.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slightly larger than I expected, which is bonus for anyone with large feet :).</li>
            <li>device looks decent with its nice big illuminated display but I don&#x27;t want to have to bend down and test the scale for any wobbling whenever I want to take it out to weigh myself.</li>
            <li>Just one day it worked great and the next time I used it a few days later, I couldn&#x27;t get a reading.  </li>
            <li>so far we have weighed ourselves and every animal in the house haha.</li>
            <li>Modern low-profile looks fantastic...not your grandma&#x27;s old clunky scale.  </li>
            <li>the scale is very slim and classy looking</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d be surprised how much those gym shoes weigh.</li>
            <li>So, I put it out on the concrete slab in my garage.  </li>
            <li>It is very slim, clear to read</li>
            <li>So far this scale performs very well.</li>
            <li>I bought this one in the hopes it would work properly because I have since exceeded the weight limit of my old scale and needed one with a greater capacity to track my current weight loss program.</li>
            <li>Most were heavy and just an eye sore in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>Not just by a few ounces, but by 1, 2, or more pounds.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this scale a few months ago &amp; it gave me precise, consistent readings.</li>
            <li>I used it to check my weight and find it is between 2 and 3 lbs difference from a normal scale.</li>
            <li>It does take quite a few batteries, but battery life is OK.</li>
            <li>This digital scale is definately worth it.</li>
            <li>weight fluctuates around 2-5lbs a day, this is COMPLETELY NORMAL because of water weight which can be gained and lost rapidly.</li>
            <li>Love that the weight lasts for a few seconds after I get off the scale.</li>
            <li>I love this scale and weigh myself everyday.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been using this product for the past one month and so far no issues of any kind.</li>
            <li>Our former scale required the bathroom light on to barely see the display.</li>
            <li>My parent&#x27;s scales (not this one - they&#x27;ve had more than a few over the years)</li>
            <li>I love this scale, I use it everyday.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not a complaint, but at my size I guess I sort of expect things to be HUUUGE, and this wasn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>I have tried numerous brands of fresh batteries since and it does not turn on.</li>
            <li>Bought way more pricey scales and they were nothing but trouble.  </li>
            <li>This scale is thin, good looking and works well.</li>
            <li>Material feels good despite the thin build and is sturdy.</li>
            <li>I purchased this scale based on the many positive reviews but even after following the manual instructions very carefully &amp; replacing the batteries I have never gotten the scale to stop with one reading nor did the weight stay on for 10sec seconds after stepping off the scale.  </li>
            <li>The large LED display holds your reading for a few seconds after dismount making it easy to record your weight without craning your neck.</li>
            <li>This scale is very light-weight, has a back-light screen that allows for easy reading of the numbers, and has four little non-skid feet on the bottom so that it will stay in place on a tile or linoleum floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not real big and bulky, either, but slim and easy to fit into a small space.</li>
            <li>in twenty minutes there was more than half a pound of variation in my measured weight!</li>
            <li>Not hard to fix just push the button to switch.</li>
            <li>This scale could never settle on a weight sometimes weighing as much as 200 pounds less than should be accurate.</li>
            <li>Big numbers are easy to see, and it gives you final weight in seconds.  </li>
            <li>They are thin and light so can be stored easily</li>
            <li>This is accurate, thin and easily stored.</li>
            <li>This scale is lightweight, thin, easy to read, and seems to measure weight accurately.</li>
            <li>But this one is unbelievably thin &amp; light, it&#x27;s so easy to carry from one room to another.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased the Omega Ultra Slim Digital Bathroom scale and although the scale is simple, it works amazingly and actually looks very modern.</li>
            <li>O.K., it&#x27;s just a Digital Scale for home usage right...  </li>
            <li>After viewing several scales, and reading comments, the Omega scale appeared to be the right choice for me.</li>
            <li>I get the same reading after weighing myself again right after.  </li>
            <li>I reserve the right 2 revise this later if anything should change.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get it to work properly even right after calibration and using it on my wood floors.</li>
            <li>Quick readout, no buttons to reset (as long as you don&#x27;t move it).  </li>
            <li>My husband has a balance issue and cannot easily get on the average scale.</li>
            <li>Backlit screen makes it easy to read in the dark.</li>
            <li>Also easy to read in the dark since it is LED.  </li>
            <li>The readings are quick and the final measurement stays on the screen for a few seconds so you can easily view it.</li>
            <li>Do not buy the cheapest item in any category when a five-star alternate is available for only a few dollars more.</li>
            <li>It is thin, the display is nice and big and the price was right!  </li>
            <li>Overall, pretty decent scale.</li>
            <li>Overall I think it&#x27;s a pretty decent product for the price.</li>
            <li>The large heavy contrasted LED is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>the digital scale is catchy, smart and doesn&#x27;t occupy much space.</li>
            <li>Very rarely, it operates as promised, flashes a few weights then holds constant on your weight even when you step off, but as above, that has been about 1/50th of the time, and yes, I&#x27;ve tried it that many times.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, a fantastic purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this for a month and have noticed that I&#x27;m having pretty high and low fluctuations of weight.</li>
            <li>My old scale was about 20 years old and not very accurate any more.</li>
            <li>I ordered this scale and it has become his new toy.  </li>
            <li>I returned it, got a refund, and now have a new one.</li>
            <li>Went on a diet for New Years.  </li>
            <li>I used brand new batteries and recalibrated it using all methods mentioned in these reviews, but it still won&#x27;t work correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After that, regardless of me buying new batteries it did not give me a reading at all.</li>
            <li>A NEW ONE</li>
            <li>Now I have to get a new scale.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone needing a new scale - or just wanting one.</li>
            <li>Time to get a new scale</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: I emailed the seller and asked about the warranty and they sent me a new scale.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a new scale to buy</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve already replaced it with a new scale.</li>
            <li>compared the Omega to the new one and found that this one weighs you 4-5 pounds heavier than you are.</li>
            <li>I bought this scale for my new weight-loss regime.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anybody looking a new scale.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to anyone who needs a new bathroom scale.</li>
            <li>it must be the faulty scale&amp;#34;, so I decided to get a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was on groupon and saw one on sale for $25 but decided to check out Amazon for reviews and comparison.</li>
            <li>I ordered a new one to replace it and it is now located in my bed room where it will not see water again.</li>
            <li>AND OF COURSE I COMPARED MY WEIGHT  BETWEEN THIS NEW SCALE AND</li>
            <li>I decided that I could live with that and just add on to whatever the scale told me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>our new scale...</li>
            <li>We both like ouir new scale.</li>
            <li>It came with packaged new batteries</li>
            <li>I bought this scale after I moved out of my family home and into a new apartment.</li>
            <li>I needed a new scale.</li>
            <li>Ah, the New Year.</li>
            <li>The thin design makes it easy to move if necessary and the large numbers are easy to read.</li>
            <li>Appears to be very accurate, and will measure small fluctuations in weight throughout the day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small, lightweight, and seems to be very accurate.</li>
            <li>It seems accurate enough, although sometimes I can weigh myself, wait 5 minutes and weigh myself again and get a slightly different reading.</li>
            <li>scale is a lot lighter than my previous glass-topped one, so it&#x27;s easy to move.</li>
            <li>It is lightweight, accurate, and low profile, making storage or hiding a very simple task.  </li>
            <li>We wanted something that could be seen reasonably well in different lighting conditions and didn&#x27;t take up too much space.</li>
            <li>The Omega Ultra Slim Digital scale is aptly named because the scale in super thin.  </li>
            <li>It is Easy to clean and it doesn&#x27;t get confused by the cats walking across it</li>
            <li>Overall, it is much better quality than I&#x27;d expected for the price.</li>
            <li>It is thin and light weight and will fit in my bag to take into a nursing visit.</li>
            <li>I especially like that it locks in your weight so that you can stand straight, then get off and see how much you weigh.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s consistent every morning, the scale was extremely well packed, and shipped so darned fast, and it&#x27;s got a very high quality feel to it.</li>
            <li>After putting a board down and the scale on that it worked fine.</li>
            <li>The weight is pretty much accurate, I get the same reading even after 3-4 attempts, the one which I had earlier would show me a different reading everytime.</li>
            <li>This scale is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>This scale is very thin, yet sturdy, looks very nice on my bedroom floor.  </li>
            <li>It has a very classy look in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>This scale is very, VERY sensitive.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re nearing the high end of the range this scale offers, you may encounter troubles with maintaining the scale.  </li>
            <li>Now that I have gotten used to my *new* weight, I love the slim design and the small footprint it takes up.</li>
            <li>display stays lit for just long enough after you&#x27;ve stepped off, and is easy to read.</li>
            <li>well-designed, stylish, so thin it barely rises above the floor, with a large well-lit display and accurate as well</li>
            <li>: it comes w/ its own batteries; it&#x27;s fashionably thin; it&#x27;s large enough for the display to be visible even if you&#x27;ve got a bit of a belly; the display is well-lit and large; the display stays on for about 20 seconds after you get off</li>
            <li>This scale can handle our weight and has huge glow in the dark letters.  </li>
            <li>I love the small design, but it does need to be on a level surface, otherwise the weight will vary.</li>
            <li>Not sorry for my choice and would definitely recommend them.</li>
            <li>not sure why I settled on the Omega, with SO many choices,</li>
            <li>/&gt;Popping in the batteries and, weighing in for the first time, only took a couple of minutes.  </li>
            <li>Just follow the exact instructions in the short manual enclosed</li>
            <li>This scale works well and is consistent when stepped on several times in a row.</li>
            <li>The scale number is big and clear, with blue light in background.</li>
            <li>Such an improvement over those scales you have to tap first to get them to weigh you.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately it never worked properly for us.</li>
            <li>Not sure how many words I can write about a scale.</li>
            <li>And while this scale does have a memory - in that it will repeat exactly the same weight</li>
            <li>Of the four pages, two of them are the meat, the other two pages are the front cover and back cover :)</li>
            <li>exactly* the same each time</li>
            <li>ordered my scale the first of the week and received it two days later.  </li>
            <li>My dad ruined the first one I bought - he didn&#x27;t realize it was only the battery that needed changing.</li>
            <li>Just bought this the other day and was excited to try it out.</li>
            <li>It is a small scale and definitely stylish.</li>
            <li>I selected it based on other customer reviews and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>normally 175 to 180 nearly fell over, had no scale and wanted a unit that would show any increase</li>
            <li>Same exact weight as doctor scale.  </li>
            <li>Makes the bath complete!</li>
            <li>This is my second purchase as I gave the first one to my mom.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s a pretty big fluctuation.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li>This is my first digital scale.</li>
            <li>I got wild results between 500 and 600 pounds!  </li>
            <li>I take the second reading about 2 min after the first.</li>
            <li>Its always first thing in the morning and always in the same spot om the tile floor.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;lie&amp;#34; like I need it to do!  :&amp;#62;)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s consistent, always reads the same number twice if I get off and try again.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a pretty big deal.</li>
            <li>I have gotten back on them a number of times and at first the numbers seem to be zeroing in</li>
            <li>This scale is extremely thin and very handsome.</li>
            <li>This is my first digital scale.  </li>
            <li>so far!</li>
            <li>Also it was never like a 1 or 2 pound difference more like 5 to 10 its a waste of money!</li>
            <li>This is our first digital scale.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s a pretty big difference.</li>
            <li>Now... if only it could help me LOSE weight, I&#x27;d give it SIX stars...;-)</li>
            <li>When I ordered this scale I specifically requested in the search box &amp;#34;Made in USA only&amp;#34; from an original list of 30-40 scales I was left with only 3</li>
            <li>gives the exact same reading.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t need to know your bone density or other bull then get this very simple and yet stylish bathroom</li>
            <li>When you stand on the scales you MUST be completely still!  </li>
            <li>Only problem I had at first</li>
            <li>that is has tenths in pounds (since every little bit counts) and its easy to read.  </li>
            <li>Seriously this product is good and if you are looking or researching to buy a scale definitely consider buying this one.</li>
            <li>WHEN I FOUND OUT THE VERY LITTLE DIFFERENCE OF MY WEIGHT, I WAS VERY EXCITED</li>
            <li>Very reliable; even in the dark with easy to read digital scale.</li>
            <li>I reviewed many, many digital scales before this one and while there were only 2 reviews on the OMEGA ULTRA THIN scale, I chose it because of the reviews...</li>
            <li>Anyhow, I very much like the LCD&#x27;s soft blue backlighting.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to track their weight on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>The lit blue background is very easily read and the black and chrome looking appearance of these scales is out of this world!</li>
            <li>I bought this scale to replace a 20+ year old scale when i started a new diet  </li>
            <li>I needed to get a new scale as mine was old</li>
            <li>But, I need typically need to get on it three times to get an accurate reading.  </li>
            <li>I took it with me 2 the Dr office &amp; it was accurate within a half pound of their scale.</li>
            <li>One problem is that the light on the scale does not stay on long enough so that you have to hurry and read your weight or get off and try again.   </li>
            <li>We have this tucked into a small, out-of-the-way corner in our dining room and it is very slim and light.</li>
            <li>It was kind of scary stepping on this for the first time.</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful and functional bathroom scale, which uses regular AA batteries instead of those expensive, disk-shaped ones.  </li>
            <li>soon as i stepped on it the number started jumping around wildly and then turned off before it settled, i looked to the instructions for help and it seemed to be written by a first year english student from japan</li>
            <li>Embarrassingly, the scale made loud cracking noises and felt physically stressed during my first attempts at using it</li>
            <li>A little wipe-down, and it looks exactly like it did right out of the box.  </li>
            <li>A little wipe-down, and it looks exactly like it did right out of the box.  </li>
            <li>Clear numbers and easy to see in a lighted room or in the dark!</li>
            <li>Works really well (at least in the last month that we&#x27;ve had it), looks exactly as advertised, and the display is clear and easy to read.</li>
            <li>Aside from the obvious &#x27;scale&#x27; parts of the scale&lt;br /&gt; (which I&#x27;ve used a few times against weight balance scales and it seems pretty accurate, or holding plates of weight and seeing what it reads)&lt;br</li>
            <li>But the real problem is that I step on the scale, get a jumpy reading, then step off and on again...and get a different reading, sometimes several pounds off from the first one.</li>
            <li>I find it is consistently about .5 to .75 pounds higher than the doctor&#x27;s scale, but I am not too worried, because at least it is consistent (perhaps the doctor&#x27;s scale is off).  </li>
            <li>super light and thin - fits anywhere.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much better than my previous digital scale.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know anything about bathrooms scales, and I assume that they are basically very similar, but the style design and the black on silver color of the Epica are outstanding.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipping, thin and light scale.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I got a broken one or what since reviews seem good on this scale, but I&#x27;m trashing this one and finally getting a new one.</li>
            <li>Sleek, thin, easy to use, like the blue light.  </li>
            <li>I received this scale earlier this week, and it&#x27;s very simple to use, easy to read, and does it&#x27;s job in just a second or two.</li>
            <li>I would say that it is as acurate as any scale and it was less expensive than the more popular brands.</li>
            <li>Readings are very consistent, I tested it by stepping on and off several times and always got the same reading!</li>
            <li>The large number display is terrific.  </li>
            <li>I especially like the Sense-On technology and the large display.</li>
            <li>The numbers are blue, and large</li>
            <li>The display is large enough to see well</li>
            <li>And there certainly are things about this Omega Ultra Slim Digital Bathroom Scale that I like.  </li>
            <li>The numbers are large enough to read without glasses.</li>
            <li>I gave it 5 stars for ease of use and sleek low profile with large backit numbers.</li>
            <li>Get on the scale, read the large digital display and do that every morning.  </li>
            <li>The scale goes into a little bit of a fit.</li>
            <li>However, I am still rating this an average as it managed to do all the features it promised, and appears to be a good value deal for those in the lower range who needn&#x27;t worry about the build quality or other issues above.</li>
            <li>I am rating at 4 as the LCD could be a bit bigger but its decent size for normal use.</li>
            <li>the digital reading is large and clear.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it would have been better if they used a hard plastic for the feet, or no feet at all.  </li>
            <li>We love this scale, my elderly Mom was having a hard time reading her scale.</li>
            <li>The display is large and clear in a soft blue backlight.</li>
            <li>The scale arrived quickly, is solid and stylish, reads instantly, and has a large display which freezes for a few seconds after it stabilizes (which helps if you are just out of the shower and do not have your glasses on).  </li>
            <li>However, the number of reviews made me a little suspicious (the number of reviews was higher than almost all other items on Amazon), and I found out that the other company rewards people for posting good reviews, so I didn&#x27;t trust those reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems extremely accurate when I did a few repeated test measures.</li>
            <li>These are the pivoting feet that give the scale balance and allow for accurate readings on uneven surfaces like bathroom tile.</li>
            <li>Accurate, heavy duty well made scale..</li>
            <li>There is a difference if i take my shoes off or am wearing heavy jeans or not so I&#x27;d say the scale is accurate.  </li>
            <li>I had this scale for a few months and then realized it wasn&#x27;t accurate at all.</li>
            <li>see the doctor in a few months to see how accurate it is, &amp; keep you posted.</li>
            <li>Step on, stand still, get a clear read out.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t keep near the bathtub when you have children,  to much water splashed on it will make it not work properly.  </li>
            <li>No misreadings of any sort, and takes about 3 seconds to give you a clear weight.</li>
            <li>I was too busy to contact the vendor, and I really didn&#x27;t have time to package it up and send it back.  </li>
            <li>It is accurate enough for someone to place it, calibrate it, and use it to monitor fluctuations, which is what I expected.</li>
            <li>No waiting for numbers to clear or reset.</li>
            <li>It is slim and lightweight and shows the numbers clearly.  </li>
            <li>Only have it for about 1 month, so far I really like it.  </li>
            <li>No &amp;#34;jiggling&amp;#34; to get a reading -- the reading is quite clear, even without my glasses.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s done the same thing the whole time.</li>
            <li>When it comes to weighing myself, that part of my life is simple and dependable thanks to this scale.</li>
            <li>b/c if we&#x27;re obsessive enough to be weighing ourselves at home we don&#x27;t need a scale to track our weight (do you really want to have to tell it each time that it&#x27;s you &amp; not your SO</li>
            <li>but since we are a weight conscious society guess I should not have been too surprised.</li>
            <li>I have only had it for a short time but so far it works better than I expected.</li>
            <li>It was time to say goodbye to my old faithful friend.</li>
            <li>The majority of the time it will vary by as much as 2 lbs regardless of method used even when stepping in the same area of the foot deck.  </li>
            <li>This item offers me this option.</li>
            <li>It is at least one pound heavier and sometimes more.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that it gives your weight in tenths of a pound (or at least fifths).</li>
            <li>I was looking for a simple and functional scale that doesn&#x27;t take up too much space.</li>
            <li>If you move too much just step off the scale and back on to get your results.  </li>
            <li>After using this Omega digital scale for two months, I can&#x27;t really find anything to complain about for a scale in the twenty five dollar price range.</li>
            <li>so when our old scale died, we contacted them about their scale.</li>
            <li>They sent us the direct link for ordering one and we did so.</li>
            <li>It is consistant enough for me but with in 20 minutes the readings will vary by as much as a pound.</li>
            <li>6/2014:&lt;br /&gt;After 3 years this scale stopped working correctly and now fluctuates wildly from 3-7 lbs.</li>
            <li>I got this for my 85 year old mother.</li>
            <li>Her old scale had died.</li>
            <li>My old scale had to be tapped</li>
            <li>started reading wild numbers and wouldn&#x27;t \\&quot;lock\\&quot; on to a value and would just shut off.  </li>
            <li>So far, I have not purchased another scale but continue to research them to find one that works well.</li>
            <li>We really like this scale and the only reason it is not five stars</li>
            <li>its streamlined, modern look to the back lit numerals</li>
            <li>The Omega Ultra Slim Digital Bathroom Scale is off as much as 10 pounds at any given time.  </li>
            <li>No problem at all so far.</li>
            <li>I have not owned a scale in about 6 years because my daughter broke my old one by playing with it.  </li>
            <li>Also, so far we haven&#x27;t had any issues with accuracy.</li>
            <li>I bought this weight scale to replace my old one and now i always end up checking my weight on my old one.</li>
            <li>So far, it has been just what we needed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a really tall slightly bigger girl</li>
            <li>My weight does not fluctuate as it did on my old scale where I could gain or lose 8-10pounds by stepping on and off the scale.  </li>
            <li>They are far to in-accurate for this</li>
            <li>I have it near.  </li>
            <li>Completely unreliable, and just sits in our cabinet.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my 92 year old Grandmother.  </li>
            <li>Used my old scale worked.</li>
            <li>my master bathroom got accidentally flooded by me and water got in all corners of my master bathroom including my old bathroom scale.</li>
            <li>DO NOT waste your money on this piece of junk.</li>
            <li>Each time I got in the scale it would fluctuate as much as 8 lbs from the prior days readings.</li>
            <li>and I completely regret it.</li>
            <li>We ordered this to track our daughter&#x27;s weight gain since she is now too old for an infant scale.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product directly from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I purchased this Epica scale on Amazon in early March, and as of August, it is no longer functional.</li>
            <li>It is not a poblem for us as we have the room to leave it be, but it&#x27;s something to consider if you need to move the scale around frequently.  </li>
            <li>If I were naturally given to bends and gyrations, I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased a 400 pound capacity scale.</li>
            <li>I only weigh that much?</li>
            <li>I miss my old scale with the dial.</li>
            <li>It has a low price, it&#x27;s very compact</li>
            <li>but once it hit the year mile mark  it became WAY TOO sensitive (even when i recalibrate it) and takes forever to calculate my weight</li>
            <li>I tried weighing myself before leaving for office (in complete attire) and the weight was within the margin of error.</li>
            <li>(The real professionals even have extensive setups to test the quality of the lens and may buy/</li>
            <li>Our old scale needed replacing.</li>
            <li>Bought this product to replace an old dial type.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This bathroom scale is light on price, but heavy on reliability and design.</li>
            <li>so much I bought a second one for my home.</li>
            <li>The fact that the display lights up when I step on, holds the number for my weight for a few seconds and then dims, automatically is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>so most likely I will just keep this one and weigh myself with the scale in the same position all the time, hoping the margin of error will be minimal.</li>
            <li>It also fluctuated wildly.  </li>
            <li>after my old scale died, i began my search for a scale that didn&#x27;t make you tap dance to see if you lost an ounce or a pound.  </li>
            <li>This scale is completely off.</li>
            <li>I already have been keeping track of my weight and thus far the scale is helping me achieve my goals.</li>
            <li>People say that their weight on it varies, but I wonder how much of that is water weight that they think is actually the fault of the scale.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My old one was an analog spring loaded scale that always said 150 if i was wearing nothing or fully clothed with boots and holding my 20 lb cat.    </li>
            <li>This was a Christmas present for my mom, and everyone immediately started taking turns to see how much they weighed.</li>
            <li>The scale is very inaccurate, it can give you different answer</li>
            <li>i kept tripping over the old scale.</li>
            <li>you have it on a completely level surface.</li>
            <li>I even had my husband step on them directly after me to see if the reading would change, and they gave his correct weight.  </li>
            <li>, so I don&#x27;t know if 150 pounds really is 150 pounds, but I&#x27;ll report back if I find any issues.</li>
            <li>I was COMPLETELY</li>
            <li>Does not waste batteries and can be stored anywhere</li>
            <li>(really, I can&#x27;t possibly weigh this much)</li>
            <li>My 4 year old son loves it as well.</li>
            <li>I bought this scale after our old one died.</li>
            <li>It looks very sleek and low profile in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>No issues so far.</li>
            <li>Completely inaccurate (and by that</li>
            <li>The Omega unltra slim digital scale is big enough to comfortably accomodate everyone in my family&#x27;s feet</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought scales that were three times as much for the same quality.</li>
            <li>The digits are very big,too, so you can read them standing further away</li>
            <li>has a modern sleek design, yet is well made and solid.</li>
            <li>Its simple to turn on plus the batteries do not have to be replaced very often.</li>
            <li>WAS NOT DEAD.</li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s working just as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I could not read my old scale (I am 82) but can read this without my glasses.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My old one had a 3 to 5 lb swing, constanatly.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the bathroom scales as I needed an upgrade to my old one.  </li>
            <li>If you move it&#x27;s all over the place, so you cannot really see the actual weight.  </li>
            <li>I like it so far.</li>
            <li>I found out my old scale was off by 6 lbs.</li>
            <li>Just received my scale and so far it has been all that I hoped for.  </li>
            <li>It is important for her to weigh everyday.</li>
            <li>I wish I had paid more attention to the negative reviews before purchasing this.  </li>
            <li>I bought this scale because my old one died and my trainer had an Epica</li>
            <li>this product is complete</li>
            <li>scale has exceeded our expectations by far.</li>
            <li>Using it daily is really helping me stay on track of my weight-maintenance goals.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re nearing the end of the range this scale offers you may encounter issues with unreliable weight measuring.</li>
            <li>We are both pretty heavy, my husband over 300 lbs, and it seems to handle the weight well, and is consistent in readings.</li>
            <li>Love this scale,very thin and also very accurate.i would recomend this scale to any one looking to upgrade.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s likely many will have trouble viewing the numbers from atop the scale).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thin and nice looking.</li>
            <li>Nice and thin.</li>
            <li>digital display is large and stays a few seconds after I step off, and the square design makes it easy to fit in a corner of my small bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>that it holds the number for three-four seconds before going dark (alllowing  just the right amount of time for \\&quot;contemplation\\&quot;); and lastly, that it is very sleek and high tech looking.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It needs to be placed on a flat surface, and if you move it, you have to recalibrate it, which, based on reading the tea leaves in the four page user manual, means to tap on the main surface briefly to turn on, not step on it, let it measure 0, then let it turn off on its own, and then measure yourself as usual.</li>
            <li>Ultra Thin Digital Scale, Super Sleek Design VERY TRUE...</li>
            <li>It is very thin with a nice blue back light.  </li>
            <li>I have an Electronics Engineering background, and believe they are all made in China (big surprise, right), and they probably all have the same -or</li>
            <li>Only downside about this scale is that I literally have to check my weight 2 times and the second one is always right.</li>
            <li>In case you haven&#x27;t noticed there are multiple scales being sold on Amazon right now by numerous companies.  </li>
            <li>I put the batteries in and and put them in place and was a little concerned because I had received different weights when I first got on them and took the batteries out for a second time , put them in place and waited until the light went out.</li>
            <li>easily in her small bathroom</li>
            <li>no sound when stepping on it, and the weight shows in Big blue numbers and is very easy to read.</li>
            <li>Wipes clean, larger display than expected.</li>
            <li>It is not accurate at all and not user friendly to turn on.</li>
            <li>I like most everything about this scale ... large base &amp; easy to read.</li>
            <li>Got this scale for my husband &amp; I about 10 days ago because we wanted one that was more specific than the usual dial scales.</li>
            <li>It worked for about 2 days (I think) on the first day I weighed 136lbs and same on the second.</li>
            <li>I consistently get the same weight reading if I do not move the scale, but moving it to a different location</li>
            <li>The scale is consistent in its readout; it does not vacillate at all even when you get on multiple times in a row whereas my last scale was in increments of .5 pounds and changed readouts often.</li>
            <li>This is a particular plus for the middle age+ group who shouldn&#x27;t have to run for their glasses to see the readout.</li>
            <li>First reading was 72.8lbs, Second reading was 73, Third reading was 73.4.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately the weight it says is higher than what I would like it to be, but that seems more like a user problem than an issue with the scale itself.</li>
            <li>Weighed myself just before going to the doctors for an annual physical and it was exactly the same.</li>
            <li>You can see the numbers without bending down even in low light situations.  </li>
            <li>It is right on when compared to other scales I use as well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend looking for a different scale.</li>
            <li>bought this scale because Consumer Reports had highly recommended several Escali scales (though they didn&#x27;t review this one).</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s only about an inch high</li>
            <li>We had no problems with customer service so overall I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Ranged from low to high SIX lbs.  </li>
            <li>Having owned several inaccurate scales, I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li>i recentley started a new weight loss program with a nutritionist and i took the scale with me to compare it to her professional scale and it was only one pound over!</li>
            <li>My new Omega Ultra Slim Digital Bathroom Scale replaces a 6 year old scale that I never trusted.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I would have expected (and appreciated) that maybe it would lock-in the weight so that it can be viewed from off the scale (after-all, with such a large population of obese individuals in the US</li>
            <li>The numbers are very large, well-lit and much easier to read than my previous digital scale.</li>
            <li>This scale is very sleek looking and can easily be hidden discretely in a corner when not in use where it doesn&#x27;t take up much space.</li>
            <li>Extremely easy to set up, and it arrived in only a few days.</li>
            <li>was easy and scale arrived within a few days using standard</li>
            <li>have no complaints and would STRONGLY recommend this product to someone looking for an affordable bathroom scale with all of the extra features of a more expensive unit!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Furthermore I&#x27;m not very heavy, and I babied this scale the 2 years I owned it.</li>
            <li>Not sure if this scale is accurate because two weeks ago I was 7 pounds heavier, so maybe so.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this scale is accurate or just flattering.</li>
            <li>We also enjoy the sense-on technology with no more tapping to turn on the scale.  </li>
            <li>I also really like the clear and big digital screen.</li>
            <li>Works well as long as  you have a very even floor</li>
            <li>I have had many digital scales that have failed and not been worth the investment.</li>
            <li>well designed, sturdy (I&#x27;m a relatively big, well, I&#x27;ll say it, stout, man), and the scale has zero problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last, but not least, the price.</li>
            <li>It is very simple though so not hard to figure out.</li>
            <li>one is small enough to be put out of the way easy, is extremely consistent, never varying a single ounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Large numbers with blue back lighting.  </li>
            <li>The platform is large enough to accommodate almost everyone, unless you&#x27;re Charles Barkley, but it&#x27;s so low to the ground, that it might prevent</li>
            <li>The platform is large enough to accommodate almost everyone, unless you&#x27;re Charles Barkley, but it&#x27;s so low to the ground, that it might prevent</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scale takes four AAA batteries, inserted in pairs of two on the bottom side of the device (upper left and upper right corners).</li>
            <li>Gurin Precision Digital Bathroom Scale w/ Extra Large Backlit Display and Auto-On Technology]]</li>
            <li>This scale is low profile and has large digital numbers that records to the 1/10th of a pound or kg.</li>
            <li>You can get off the scale and stand back and your weight is still available to read for a little while.</li>
            <li>Def recommend this over the super expensive scales, its worth it!</li>
            <li>, looks like new, AND, still with the same battery.</li>
            <li>Tried brand new batteries and got the same result.</li>
            <li>Finally decided to spring for a new one.</li>
            <li>We have tried multiple new batteries and just keep getting a &#x27;LO&#x27; message</li>
            <li>Mailed new one back</li>
            <li>pretty to look at, not very useful.</li>
            <li>The red LED readout on my 15 year old digital scale was beginning to dim and new batteries were not helping.  </li>
            <li>Really like this scale because it is so light and thin.</li>
            <li>I only had this scale for a few weeks but for some reason it&#x27;s not reading my accurate weight and know its not reading at all.</li>
            <li>The scale responds immediately when you step on it and only takes a few seconds to accurately read your weight, which it then blinks so</li>
            <li>I like the fact that the batteries are common and easy to replace.</li>
            <li>If it is than I would be grateful to have finally purchased something to last and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Scale is light and thin so it doesn&#x27;t take up much space in our bathroom.</li>
            <li>I appreciated the step on instant weight showing and the 10 second hold while viewing..</li>
            <li>I have tried resetting it and each time the readings are different, not but much, but they are different.</li>
            <li>I weight myself several times in a week, wearing similar clothes, and the weight did not change much.</li>
            <li>This scale is so thin and has such a nice display.   </li>
            <li>THE COLOR OF THE SCALE IS ALSO ELEGANT, IT IS ALSO NOT HEAVY AND THIN.</li>
            <li>Right out of the box you need to put in the provided batteries, set the scale on a hard floor to let it calibrate and its ready to go.</li>
            <li>Major problem is that the scale does not work on a carpet</li>
            <li>Unlike our last digital scale; you can re-weigh yourself repeatedly with exactly the same results.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a scale to tell you your weight, with no other frills, this is what you want.</li>
            <li>Darn I have some major eating to do till I reach my goal</li>
            <li>I upgraded for a higher quality scale which also reads BMI and other weight-factors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I guess most digital scales these days use those little rubber things on their bottoms, which is the same problem I had with my last scale.</li>
            <li>My major issue, though, is that the wait fluctuates.  </li>
            <li>The last two, different brands,  either quit working or got stuck on exactly the same weight for 4 weeks!</li>
            <li>It has a broad platform to stand on, so you don&#x27;t feel like your going to fall off.</li>
            <li>We tried the scale out five times in a row and each time the scale provided a different weight output, sometimes varying by nearly 10lbs!</li>
            <li>I measured multiple times before and after meals, with and without a coat, before and after an output operation, and the numbers were consistently higher when you expected them to be higher, and lower when you expected them to be lower.</li>
            <li>Very well made, classy with metal accent in the middle, it is thin in stature, but not flimsy or cheap.    </li>
            <li>My old mechanical had long since needed to be put out to pasture, and a digital one seemed the next logical step.</li>
            <li>The quality seems high and it is dead on accurate compared to my other scales.</li>
            <li>I finally decided to get a digital scale for my home, and I picked this one based on the price and the overall positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>, is accurate to within half a pound compared to the doctor&#x27;s expensive scale, has a super sleek profile, is extremely easy to read, and costs less than just about anything else on Amazon or eBay.    </li>
            <li>I use it and the older style to check my weight daily as I have been put on a strict diet by medical staff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to slide it on a smooth linoleum floor.</li>
            <li>Nice wide area to stand on, display is large, and unfortunately it&#x27;s accurate.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>Needless to say this scale is useless for tracking weight loss and honestly I can see any kind of application for it other than a toy for the kids that will get old fast.</li>
            <li>I will get two to three different weights, one right after each other.</li>
            <li>is our first digital scale, and it seems pretty accurate, (matches a very expensive balance</li>
            <li>You get a general idea but not something for someone on a diet.  </li>
            <li>Yes the profile is slim and it is easy to step on, but it does not work well if you have a serious balance problem.</li>
            <li>This scale meets all my criteria for simple and sleek design, space saving size, and clear display.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>let it clear its brain and step back on to get a reading.  </li>
            <li>, I get the same reading every time as long as I stand up straight</li>
            <li>Just wish there was a smaller size version available for small bathrooms</li>
            <li>I have a beaten-up, Taylor scale, that&#x27;s about ten, plus, years old.</li>
            <li>, I did not compare its measurements with professional gym and medical scales, so I can&#x27;t tell you how it performs in that</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to constantly adjust it like the old one.  </li>
            <li>not much else to say, it tells you how much force you exert on the surface of the Earth.</li>
            <li>It was solidly packed and complete with instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Replacing old digital scales.  </li>
            <li>We replaced an old scale with this current technology.  </li>
            <li>nearly the same-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had the scale for two months and thus far no problems.</li>
            <li>She had an old scale that wasn&#x27;t digital, so I bought her this as one of her birthday gifts.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for several months now and have had no trouble with it at all.  </li>
            <li>I was really surprised to have it a day earlier than stated,  </li>
            <li>Scale does not work properly, The weight number swings wildly then shuts itself off.</li>
            <li>When this arrived (on time) I was surprised at the actual thinness of the unit.  </li>
            <li>Scale is very sleek and what I expected.</li>
            <li>No regrets of my purchase.</li>
            <li>His old scales only went to 250.</li>
            <li>The scale so far works properly.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast and product is just what I expected.</li>
            <li>Just keep it on a level bare floor (No Carpet)</li>
            <li>No fluff, no stuff.</li>
            <li>My weight is the same on this scale as it is on the one at the gym that I frequent</li>
            <li>Remember to put it on a oard of some type or on the bare floor.</li>
            <li>All scales are different, but I was surprised how close this number was to the office&#x27;s number.</li>
            <li>Have only had the product for one month and no problems thus far.  </li>
            <li>We ordered this scale to be used everyday by an 85 year old, and it has worked well for the first month (and longer we hope).  </li>
            <li>I love these scales, they are thin</li>
            <li>It is ultra thin and stepping on it is more like just a forward move instead of a step.  </li>
            <li>The scale was touching the baseboard in my bathroom causing false readings.  </li>
            <li>First weight is basically 2-3 pounds higher than the second weight every time and it never really settles down on anything.  </li>
            <li>The only disappointing issue was that, while it is \\&quot;Ultra Slim\\&quot; as advertised, it does occupy more floor space than my previous scale and requires a bit more attention on my part to keep from stubbing a toe.  </li>
            <li>My wife wanted a new scale but did not need all the extra features such as programing.</li>
            <li>It also refuses to stay on a single number when I double check my current weight, or even within 5 of the first number it gives me.</li>
            <li>It is reasonable in price, easy to set up, and has performed without fail for me each morning.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical when I read how other reviewers liked the scale so much.  </li>
            <li>Right before sitting down I just tested again around my house and still the same as day I opened.  </li>
            <li>So to further check the scale I went to my local doctor and gym and found the weighing scales matched the older non digital weight.</li>
            <li>This instantly shows the weight, and not like other weigh machines which first process your weight and then display....</li>
            <li>/&gt;The low profile of the scale means that you do have to look down a decent amount to see the display, so if you&#x27;re bigger you may have to step a little, but the number stays so it should be fine.</li>
            <li>Very thin and fits nicely under a chest of drawers</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small and seems to be very consistent regarding weight read outs.  </li>
            <li>I needed a scale with a very small height and this fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really lock into a weight like other scales, which I like.  </li>
            <li>I had it on a flat rug, never a problem with my old scale.  </li>
            <li>I use it everyday and thus far I have lost 4 pounds--just by keeping track of daily of how much I weigh!</li>
            <li>Thin, not very heavy, easy to put away.</li>
            <li>I weigh a little over 300 pounds and fluctuate somewhere around that number and most scales only go up to 300 or less, but this scale can handle 400,</li>
            <li>i got mine to replace a regular scale that is accurate, but is kinda hard to read.  </li>
            <li>The only down side is that, due to the back color of the reading, black on bright blue, I cannot read the number without my glasses on.</li>
            <li>Many other electronic scales I&#x27;ve used will vary a few pounds almost instantly: step on and you&#x27;re X, step off, step back on</li>
            <li>Like some other reviewers, I also sometimes weigh myself twice in a few minutes, and each time I get the same result, so I feel the scale is pretty consistent.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take up much space, the lighting is very sharp and clear to read (even without my glasses on), and I like the way it holds the total weight for a minute after you get off.  </li>
            <li>We came back from a doctor appointment where I was weighed, I got on the Omega and my weight was the same as it was on the doctor&#x27;s professional scale.  </li>
            <li>Considering it was only about 20 minutes old, it was a simple decision to return.</li>
            <li>After several attempts at getting it to display the correct weight, it eventually died completely and wouldn&#x27;t turn back on.</li>
            <li>most of the times i find myself getting annoyed and not even bothering to try to get it to work, because i can find myself spending up to 5 minutes trying to get it to work properly.</li>
            <li>I ordered the Omega Ultra slim digital bathroom scale because I was tired of touching the scale and waiting before you could get on to weigh.  </li>
            <li>My Omega Scale is thin enough that the bathroom door swings  over it without touching it.  </li>
            <li>But the most irritating thing is that it doesn&#x27;t actually ever decide on a weight.  </li>
            <li>Out of the three times I stepped on the scale, it gave me the exact same reading (down to the .1 of a pound).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>interested in the back story, after checking my weight with the Omega I am down 15lbs.</li>
            <li>The only thing that you need to pay attention to is when you first add batteries, set it down where it&#x27;s going to be so that it can callibrate.  </li>
            <li>(I guess people are completely unaware of this fact... especially since this seems to be the #1 complaint about pretty much every scale on Amazon)&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also uses standard batteries, so you won&#x27;t be searching around the grocery store for some strange size when it needs new ones.</li>
            <li>I like that it&#x27;s thin, light, and wide, with a large backlit display.</li>
            <li>screen is Blue,the body of the scale is Black overall with a Silver line in b/w,so it looks exactly as shown in the product image..</li>
            <li>It does exactly what a scale is supposed to do, no more, and no less.</li>
            <li>but unfortunately the batteries died pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Works much better than old scale, and very thin.</li>
            <li>even in a dark room thanks to the backlit display.</li>
            <li>The Sense-on feature makes activating the scale much simpler than some other digital scales.</li>
            <li>I had such an old scale and this was a big change for me going Digital...</li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s complete, which doesn&#x27;t take long at all, the numbers start to flash.</li>
            <li>big, white, square and an eye sore (drawing the wrong kind of attention).</li>
            <li>I had just had surgery and spent 2 weeks in a nursing home eating what was supposed to be the normal diabetic diet.  </li>
            <li>The previous scale I had would give different readings if I stepped off and right back on, but this one gives the same reading.  </li>
            <li>Then 5 minutes later i stepped on again and it went down 5 lbs from the first time which means 8 lbs of difference from the second time.</li>
            <li>Turns out, what these two things mean is that after the first time you put it down for use, and every time you lift it to clean or to move it somewhere else, you have to step on briefly, just long enough for the display to read \\&quot;00\\&quot; &amp; not long enough to show a weight, and get right off, leaving it alone until the display goes dark.  </li>
            <li>It is so sleek and thin, there isn&#x27;t much to clean on it and for an 80 year old</li>
            <li>These reviews really helped in narrowing down the scale I chose.</li>
            <li>So after 3 weeks of juicing I noticed that my weight went down fast but thought &amp;#34;hey</li>
            <li>I am confident that it will meet our needs, specifically to monitor Mom&#x27;s water weight gains due to Chronic Heart Failure.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast, very carefully wrapped!</li>
            <li>but it only works on a bare floor and my entire house is carpeted except for the kitchen and bathroom.</li>
            <li>Thin, easy to handle.</li>
            <li>We needed a scale that was lightweight, thin, and setup easily each time we used it since it can&#x27;t lay on our floor all the time (it&#x27;s in a closet).  </li>
            <li>It takes a while to calibrate as it was giving radically different weights in the first few uses.  </li>
            <li>This is a thin scale that doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space and its easily calibrated.</li>
            <li>I like this scale because it&#x27;s thin &amp; can be stored easily just about anywhere.  </li>
            <li>It is thin and easy for elderly people to step on and off.</li>
            <li>Functional easy to read thin scale</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thin and easy to move and store.</li>
            <li>I also like that it only takes a few seconds to register my exact weight.  </li>
            <li>In my own feeble effort to shed a few pounds this year, I decided to invest in a decent scale.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i have Congestive Heart Failure and need a true weight weight</li>
            <li>It is thin, weighs in .2 pound increments, and is easy to read  with large black on blue numbering.</li>
            <li>this scale due to all of the great ratings, my experience unfortunately was not positive.</li>
            <li>If you need to be extrememly accurate due to medical reasons, you may want to make a larger investment if you can aford it, but for everyday monitoring, I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li>First day of use you need to allow the scale to \\&quot;break in\\&quot; - the first few times I weighed myself or other objects, the weight reading was widely varied.  </li>
            <li>I do see that the weight that shows is in the same area because I also check the scale at work for verification and it normally gives the same weight plus or minus a couple pounds.  </li>
            <li>First thing I was surprised at is how small this product is!</li>
            <li>Black on white is much easier to see.</li>
            <li>The scale is very accurate, showing just what the one in the doctor&#x27;s office does (unfortunately).  </li>
            <li>It comes on with a touch and provides a clear digital read out of how unsuccessful I&#x27;ve been in my attempt to loose weight.  </li>
            <li>We tried recalibrating, putting new batteries in, tapping, stepping on it, pushing the lb kg selection button, but it had simply BROKEN right after we took it out of the packaging.</li>
            <li>This bathroom scale has a large read out display, stays on for a few seconds after stepping off of it.</li>
            <li>The feature that shows the weight for a few seconds after the object is removed, allows for the weighing of large boxes and suitcases.</li>
            <li>now I can see how much I weigh in the dark too!</li>
            <li>Does not need calibration, large digital numbers display stays lit a few seconds after you step off.</li>
            <li>, sometimes her driving is a little dangerous, lol).</li>
            <li>My only quibble is that the black surface shows dust easily, but that is a small thing.</li>
            <li>And in the rare cases when it did work, it drained the battery in about two months with hardly any usage.</li>
            <li>so finding a tough digital scale is a must for accurate weight readings.</li>
            <li>This scale is very thin and seems to be very accurate.  </li>
            <li>(Which is good or bad, depending on the day for me).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not experienced what one reviewer describes about huge inaccuracy swings.  </li>
            <li>My wife and I placed the batteries in the Omega Ultra Thin Digital Bathroom Scale and it worked only ONCE accurately and then IMMEDIATELY STOPPED WORKING.  </li>

            <li> I love this scale.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t found any scale to do better except for my WII which weighed within 1/10th of a pound.</li>
            <li> If one can fall in love with a scale, then this has happened to me.  </li>

            <li> WE have purchased Omega Ultra Slim Digital Scale, till now this is working excellent.</li>

            <li> Definitely the best scale I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t matter to me , because I use them more to&lt;br</li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t want anything elaborate.  </li>
            <li> Since the unit is not \\&quot;fussy\\&quot;, there isn&#x27;t much more to say about it.  </li>

            <li> Sure glad I didn&#x27;t get the one that talks, or I&#x27;d have taken a hammer to it already.</li>
            <li> I suspect most of the 5 star reviews are faked or where created with some incentive.</li>
            <li> Most scales use watch/cell batteries that end up in landfills since they can&#x27;t be recharged.</li>
            <li> love the scale</li>

            <li> Now to just get that number lower :) We&#x27;ve had it for quite a while now.</li>
            <li> The best thing about this scale is it&#x27;s really low profile</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad that I found this one.</li>
            <li> But for the most part no complaints.</li>
            <li> We all love it.</li>
            <li> and I totally love the slim form factor.</li>
            <li> -)&lt;br /&gt;Jokes apart, the machine is accurate and quite effective.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t have to turn on the light to read it!  </li>

            <li> Fantastic scale!</li>
            <li> What more does one need to say?</li>
            <li> The Product is OK but seems to have some problem with the weighing.</li>
            <li> Just make sure and set it on level ground (like tile or something), carpet doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Glad I did, though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great addition to my dorm room - allowed me to keep track of my weight and check that my luggage was ok for air travel.</li>

            <li> Glad I decided on this one</li>
            <li> So if I picked up a book it would show more weight.  </li>
            <li> now i can safely walk about the bathroom.</li>
            <li> What more could you ask for.</li>
            <li> I love this set of scales.  </li>

            <li> I do house calls, and I was looking for a lightweight, accurate scale measures to 400 lbs.  </li>
            <li> 2 LB accurate reading.</li>
            <li> your going to use to settle in and it will give you accurate readings  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I cant get an accurate reading because its all over the place.  </li>
            <li> , seems accurate &amp; is</li>
            <li> The scale is extremely accurate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that the scale isn&#x27;t always accurate.  </li>
            <li> I got this scale in March and it was great until just recently where the scale won&#x27;t give me an accurate reading anymore.</li>
            <li> I remember I was scared of buying a scale on Amazon because people kept saying theirs wasn&#x27;t accurate.</li>
            <li> It is used every day and provides us with accurate readings, we have used weights to check.</li>
            <li> This scale was accurate, unobtrusive and actually sort of attractive.</li>
            <li> , so I can&#x27;t tell how accurate it is to the tenth of a pound.</li>
            <li> I believe that it weighs accurately because it doesn&#x27;t fluctuate if you get off and on.</li>
            <li> It is accurate because I checked my weight against my weight  on my doctor&#x27;s scale.  </li>
            <li> It seems fairly accurate and hasn&#x27;t caused any problems.</li>
            <li> The scale doesn&#x27;t give accurate weights.  </li>
            <li> Even compared with the doctor&#x27;s scale, this one is accurate.</li>
            <li> The scale seems really accurate.</li>

            <li> Accurate</li>
            <li> To take an accurate reading, the scale must be reset every time you move the scale.  </li>
            <li> Accurate?</li>
            <li> No tapping on it to turn on, just step on and it accurately weighs you to the ounce.  </li>
            <li> (step on as if to weigh yourself to calibrate, then weigh again for an accurate weight).</li>
            <li> WASN&#x27;T ACCURATE,</li>
            <li> Therefore I believe it to be an accurate devise.&lt;br</li>
            <li> She also said it is accurate.  </li>
            <li> #34;instant-on,&amp;#34; which she likes, and it seems to be accurate with reproducible readings.  </li>

            <li> Accurate numerical count.  </li>
            <li> I needed an accurate weight scale to keep track of my efforts to trim 30#(doctors orders, wife&#x27;s delight).  </li>

            <li> it&#x27;s compact and seems quite accurate.</li>
            <li> I believe the scale is accurate.</li>

            <li> Easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> they were definitely honest and real.  </li>
            <li> Cheap junk.  </li>
            <li> but I may keep it around as a reminder about what being so cheap gets me.</li>

            <li> My boyfriend and I decided we wanted a scale for our apartment, and we started looking around on Amazon, reading reviews about how various scales are great, but they don&#x27;t do X...</li>
            <li> This scale is attractive, slim and simple to use.  </li>
            <li> Close monitoring of my weight is important to me while I have been on a weight loss program and while adjusting my eating and activity to maintain that loss.</li>
            <li> Great purchase overall</li>
            <li> Once you install the batteries, you place it on the floor where it will reside and lightly step on it to turn it on until it reads zero to calibrate the scale.  </li>
            <li> My entire family uses this scales and thinks it is great.  </li>

            <li> Cheap price.</li>
            <li> The scale is light weight and not an eyesore in our bathroom.  </li>
            <li> This product definitely works great</li>
            <li> Maybe I should continue using rubbing alcohol to smooth out the damage.</li>
            <li> We travel full-time in an RV and space and weight are primary concerns.  </li>
            <li> It is light weight/slim.  </li>
            <li> Seems pretty accurate too and seems like it&#x27;s consistent, which is good.</li>
            <li> It flashes when the weight is set so you can monitor precisely loss/gain.</li>
            <li> The delivery of the scale was on time and packaged securely.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;an accurate amount, it is light to carry, looks&lt;br</li>
            <li> This scale was great for a short while</li>
            <li> results are amazingly precise and reliable, but you can&#x27;t weight luggage, or anything that doesn&#x27;t have two legs.</li>
            <li> Sleek, easy to clean and affordable</li>
            <li> it is light.</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these scales for my guest bathroom and liked it so much</li>
            <li> Easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> About the time it settles on my weight and it locks, the light goes out.</li>

            <li> Thanks for honest representation.</li>
            <li> Then I saw that the modern generation has the nice feature of turning on without the need to \\&quot;tap\\</li>
            <li> I like the slim body and that it&#x27;s light weight.</li>
            <li> and I have to say I really do enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a great product to add to your home if you are looking for a bathroom scale.    </li>
            <li> This scale is so light and slim.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight, records weight and light and number remains on for a couple of seconds after one has stepped off, so one can see it well.</li>
            <li> (recommended you don&#x27;t on box I think), but alot of people must because we have to fit it somewhere in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic scale</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s primary function...</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to turn on the bathroom light to get a reading.</li>
            <li> It will fit into my carry on luggage.  </li>

            <li> Also easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I’ve had a cheap Wal-Mart scale I got almost two years ago</li>
            <li> As importantly, it serves as a conscience prodder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it almost everyday to weigh myself and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> The product is a fabulous value.</li>
            <li> Its slim profile and accuracy is fantastic.</li>

            <li> and it looks fantastic again.</li>
            <li> even though it looks nice, it is very inaccurate.</li>
            <li> Worked great during its fairly short lifetime.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just got unlucky with the light thing.</li>
            <li> This thing was so extremely cheap</li>
            <li> An important thing to remember is that it needs to be calibrated each time it is put on the floor</li>
            <li> I have compared its results with my Wii Fit and another scale I have access to, and it is consistantly accurate.</li>
            <li> The light-up reading means I don&#x27;t have to turn the light on (although I do need my glasses).</li>
            <li> Overall a great product.</li>
            <li> I love the big numbers and bright light display.</li>
            <li> and it has a light on the screen.</li>
            <li> The price was cheap....</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s important for them to have a scale.  </li>
            <li> It arrived well packed and damage free.</li>
            <li> Comparing this scale to a traditional weight scale at my gym has shown great accuracy and consistency.</li>
            <li> Comfortable to stand on and extremely accurate.  </li>
            <li> let the light go out) then get on to get weighed</li>

            <li> /&gt;It has a slim frame and is fairly light.</li>
            <li> My eyes aren&#x27;t great and the numbers are obvious,</li>
            <li> , it arrived on time in pristine condition and I am extremely happy with the product even though it tells me the truth about my lax attempts to lose the extra poundage.</li>
            <li> It has background light</li>
            <li> This is a nice, modern looking scale.</li>
            <li> it has a light that comes on..and NO tapping..</li>
            <li> It arrived earlier than they said and it looks and works great.  </li>
            <li> the sensors are on the bottom so important for it to be leveled or will be off readings.</li>
            <li> This is a great scale, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> This scale works really well and looks sleek and nice on my bathroom floor.</li>

            <li> simple as described looks great and works.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s super slim, easily fits in a drawer, the numbers in the display are huge, so everyone can easily read them.  </li>
            <li> So far so good ...</li>
            <li> (Weight Watchers) which I always thought was quite good, but I actually like the Omega better because you don&#x27;t have to tap it for it to come on -</li>
            <li> Time will tell if it remains calibrated but so far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Seems that my old scales have been off a couple pounds ..to the good for me.</li>
            <li> Our old one fluctuated a good bit.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m sure that for most people, that&#x27;s not going to be much of an issue at all, there will be one or two for whom it causes a problem.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> &amp; I did toss out my old one, good riddance.</li>

            <li> My original review is below.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 2 months of using this every day and so far, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> I really love the blue screen much more than I ever thought I would!  </li>
            <li> Though I haven&#x27;t had this scale for long it is great.</li>
            <li> It arrived timely and so far we are very pleased.</li>
            <li> Tonight I checked the scale three times within two minutes and received three quite significant figures..</li>
            <li> I love it and highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I was so excited to get this scale.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product so far.  </li>
            <li> I noticed the inconsistency one day when, excited about a signifigant weight loss, i weighed myself twice, minutes apart.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think I could love a scale so much!  </li>
            <li> First off, the beautiful blue light will not stay lit which means that I can not get a reading of my weight because that&#x27;s where the numbers display.</li>
            <li> pretty sure I didn&#x27;t drop 20 pounds over night, and even with the reset step that you had to do to calibrate, it&#x27;s still not working!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Such</li>
            <li> After spending a great deal of time getting that mess straightened out...i began to look for a newer and better bathroom scale.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> Was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Once I got it there, I was getting more consistent readings.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just a good scale in general.</li>
            <li> or it will shut off, this item is totally worth it!</li>
            <li> This scale fits perfectly in the small space under my bathroom vanity.</li>
            <li> I like that the weight stays on the screen for a few seconds to give you time to convince yourself and make your peace with it! :D</li>
            <li> Love the modern design!</li>
            <li> The price was agreeable, it shipped quickly and arrived in fine condition.  </li>
            <li> and I love just stepping on without having to touch it first.</li>
            <li> I am pretty satisfied with this scale.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased so far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty, sure, but don&#x27;t let looks fool you.</li>
            <li> Fun to use!  </li>
            <li> So far so good much better and accurate than our older scale.....</li>
            <li> Not this Omega -- I&#x27;ve been nothing but pleasantly surprised by its consistent accuracy, easy of use, and good looks.  </li>
            <li> Great product, works perfectly, looks slick, love the fact that it keeps your weight for a few seconds after you step off.&lt;br /&gt;Quick delivery as well.</li>
            <li> I have owned this for two months now, so hoping the product works great long term!</li>
            <li> Thin, easy to look at, and thoughtfully sized to fit in the smallest space, the scale was an excellent choice.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Omega Ultra Slim Digital Bathroom Scale after giving up on the clunky old gym scale which has a 5-10 lb lb margin of error on the best days.</li>
            <li> It must be stored parallel to the floor and under no circumstances should we put any objects on top of it, so it&#x27;s kind of a space hog.</li>
            <li> This is a serviceable bathroom scale that quickly delivers accurate weight measurements to 1/10 of a pound.  </li>
            <li> I got my scale quickly and the packaging was secure....</li>
            <li> Scale remains stable and reports measurements quickly and accurately.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a month or so, and don&#x27;t know what the battery usage/durability will be, but so far I would rate this one a perfect 5 without reservation.</li>
            <li> The Omega delivers a quick, accurate weight in moments with it&#x27;s sense-on technology.</li>
            <li> however, it does motivate me for continued work outs and the bright blue screen is a cheerful reflection of the \\&quot;weigh\\</li>
            <li> This Ultra Slim Digital Scale is nice and easy to read, it&#x27;s light weight and always accurate.</li>
            <li> Those long intervals inbetween weighs will be more significant and make you feel much more confident about losing.</li>
            <li> It is sturdy, quick on soon as you step on it, easy to read, accurate, and remains on just the right amount of time after you get off.  </li>
            <li> It seems to take a few sample numbers and average them to get the best weight, which is great.</li>
            <li> Very consistent and accurate compared against my doctor&#x27;s scale.  </li>
            <li> Seems very consistent and accurate.</li>
            <li> Very stylish as far as scales go, haha :)</li>
            <li> I also liked that batteries were included in the box, so it was ready to use right out of the box.  </li>
            <li> The display is nice and large, and easy to read even when I&#x27;m standing straight.</li>
            <li> Great to just step on and get results with large easy to read digital readouts</li>
            <li> Seems pretty accurate and is easy to use, just tap it then stand on it and wait a couple seconds for it to weigh ya.</li>
            <li> easy to store and to use, the display is large and easy to read.</li>
            <li> Looks sleek and modern and very accurate.</li>
            <li> It is sleek, a nice fit in my bathroom, the bright purple digital numbers are very readable (large) and it is accurate.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d need the light on it, but I keep it in the closest and the light is super useful.  </li>
            <li> It is thin and light weight, but the best feature is it is easy to read.</li>
            <li> Ok how excited can you really be about a scale?  </li>
            <li> The large LED display is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I wanted a scale that did not require special batteries which is another reason I like this scale.</li>
            <li> Love the lighted display with LARGE numbers.  </li>
            <li> they were right!  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t even have to tap on the scale to start it, you just step right on and your weight appears in seconds!</li>
            <li> I feel motivated to eat right and exercise every time I weigh myself!</li>
            <li> and you have a reading right away!</li>
            <li> It is very accurate and most of all very consistent every time, even after moving its place.&lt;br /&gt;Beside being accurate it is also pretty stylish, featuring a blue back-lit LCD display,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done a good amount of testing this with other scales and found that it matches up pretty nicely.</li>
            <li> This scale is much more precise and steady than the one I bought and returned before it.</li>
            <li> Step on it, it lights up, shows your weight in nice large numbers, no need for glasses and no need to tap first....</li>
            <li> have found it to be accurate within 2 tenths of a pound compared to a professional scale and very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Ordering</li>
            <li> I had this scale on a tile floor because I heard that a hard floor gives you the best results.</li>
            <li> She says it is light, contemporary and nice looking, the numbers show up nice and big, and you do not need to tap it, all you need to do is step on it and it displays the weight.  </li>
            <li> Inserted included batteries and it has worked fine right from start.</li>
            <li> Would have given a perfect score of 5 stars but took off for the inconsistenties of the first weigh in as well as batteries missing.</li>
            <li> I like that it has a big bright screen.</li>
            <li> This is a great scale, so much better than my old digital scale.  </li>
            <li> working well, numbers are bright and big,</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s relatively cheap, and seems to give accurate and consistent readings.  </li>
            <li> These scales replaced a set of standard spring type scales and appear to be more accurate with a more visible read-out.  </li>
            <li> bright digital display.  </li>
            <li> Big, bright numbers.</li>
            <li> Big bright numbers.</li>
            <li> to assemble, sleek looking, big bright display.</li>
            <li> The cool thing about this one is that it also show</li>
            <li> Cool.</li>
            <li> So sweet.  </li>
            <li> Indeed, the people who gave this product good reviews should pay me back!!</li>
            <li> I was surprised as to how slim the scale was, really nice.</li>
            <li> Although I wish that transformation was true, it&#x27;s not the reality.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is you have to be perfectly still for it to get a good reading.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this because it had such good reviews, so I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this bathroom scale and really loved the way it looked when it arrived.  </li>
            <li> Full Recommendation.</li>
            <li> This seems to be true.</li>
            <li> The display is very visable and the design is slim &amp; stylish</li>
            <li> I purchased this scale after reading fairly good reviews, but upon receiving it, and using for almost a week my weight varied daily by up to 7 pounds!</li>
            <li> Low cost and good quality.</li>
            <li> If you want a good scale that is built to last, buy the [ASIN:</li>
            <li> I ordered this based on mostly good reviews, but once I received it, I couldn&#x27;t get the same weight twice.  </li>
            <li> Works very well, stylish looks.</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, its a good price, its sleek and works well enough for me.</li>
            <li> Overall a good product for recording a persons weight.</li>
            <li> It stays lit after you step off, and I hope to use this feature when traveling to make sure my suitcase is below the weight limit - and it will make it much easier.</li>
            <li> good necessary piece of gadget for bathroom.</li>
            <li> That is the only good thing about this scale.</li>
            <li> For what its worth, I dont have this problem with a cheap analog bathroom scale</li>
            <li> a good basic scale-</li>
            <li> It sure is slim, which to me is a real plus.  </li>
            <li> Love this scale it does not take up much space in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good, simple scale to monitor my weight throughout my training process.</li>
            <li> Good value for a basic scale.</li>
            <li> The price was good and would definitely recommend buying this product from this company.</li>
            <li> If you put it on tiles make sure the edges that touch the ground are not in cracks, as this may throw off weight by as much as 10 pounds.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to anyone that needs a good scale.</li>
            <li> Well some days I don&#x27;t love it AS much....</li>
            <li> Nice clear reading panel for me even without my glasses</li>
            <li> I keep track of it anyway :) its really high quality tho!</li>
            <li> Enjoying it&#x27;s sleek, modern style.  </li>
            <li> Cheaper scales seem to have more variance in weight accuracy so the reasonable Omega&#x27;s cost is acceptable.</li>
            <li> We serarch online at Amazon for a bathroom scale and are delighted with the Omega Unlra Slim Digital.</li>

            <li> The size and look are great as well as the large blue screen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering about battery life, because this thing lights up like a landing strip, but it sure does make it easy to see, particularly if stumbling into the bathroom first thing in the morning, sans glasses or contacts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered this scale based on the other great reviews and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>

            <li> Checked the accuracy of this scale against the ones in my doctors&#x27; office and it&#x27;s pretty accurate.</li>
            <li> The readings are consistent and accurate every time.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to know whether I weigh exactly 148.2, but I do need a scale which will accurately capture my weight changes.</li>
            <li> but it seems to be pretty accurate.  </li>
            <li> First, this scale isn&#x27;t accurate for me.</li>
            <li> For the first time, a scale that provides an accurate weight.</li>

            <li> It is a very pretty scale.   </li>
            <li> Very pleased with my Ultra Slim Digital Scale.  </li>

            <li> My recommendation is spending a little more to get one of the nicer scales on the market that read BMI and have better calibrating options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has an easy to read, lighted display and the numbers are large enough to see easily.</li>
            <li> This Omega ultra slim is straightforward, provides an easy to view backlit digital screen and seems to correspond well to the calibrated scales used in my doctors offices.  </li>
            <li> This new scale is great--very precise, matches just what the doctor&#x27;s office reports.  </li>
            <li> These are right on and consistent.</li>
            <li> and she loves the large led readout!</li>
            <li> But I wish it would give the right indication on the first try vs. having to do so three times.  </li>
            <li> When you step on you can see it searching for exactly the right weight for you at the moment.</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend Omega!</li>
            <li> Instant on is great Finalizes weight quickly and holds a few seconds which is convenient Accurate</li>
            <li> I have only good things so far to say about this scale.  </li>
            <li> What I like best about it is that it&#x27;s so thin that my bathroom door can pass over it while it sits in a place that I couldn&#x27;t really use before.</li>
            <li> Been using for only about a month, but so far so good</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this scale to anyone looking for a good functional and professional looking scale.</li>
            <li> You may not think that extra step matters, but think about what you could do with an extra 2 or 3 seconds each day, plus the joy of not having to remember a two-sequence behavior chain in the morning behavior you&#x27;ve had your coffee.</li>
            <li> It is very slim and fits nicely in our smaller bathroom.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the quick and efficient service.</li>
            <li> This scale weighs accurately and it has a really good-looking and modern display.</li>
            <li> Huge LCD display with back light</li>
            <li> Thin, attractive, as accurate as can be.</li>
            <li> It shipped out fast and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Gives bright clear digital read out.  </li>
            <li> It works reliably, is easy to read and doesn&#x27;t require the \\&quot;tap\\&quot; to wake it up like my old scale did.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean, and has a low profile, so I can tuck it under stuff.</li>
            <li> The numbers are clear and easy to see.</li>
            <li> Although we have had this scale only for a couple of months, so far it is very accurate and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t even have to put the bathroom light on if you decide to weigh yourself early in the am!  </li>
            <li> Light, slim, easy to use and a large digital display.  </li>
            <li> You just step on it, it pretty quickly tells you how much you weigh, and you step off it.</li>
            <li> It is very accurate, and gives not only pounds, but ounces as well.  </li>
            <li> Follow the instructions and you will have a very accurate digital scale for life.</li>
            <li> Company delivered this item very fast and prompt.</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> This scale does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and  at a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> Shipped VERY fast from USA Vitamins.</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast, and you can&#x27;t beat the value.  </li>
            <li> We do like it very much and would recommend it to others.  </li>
            <li> I like this scale very much.</li>
            <li> It truly is slim and trim and is very modern looking.</li>
            <li> The price also is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I like this scale very much.  </li>
            <li> I like this scale very much.  </li>
            <li> Very fast and well lit scale.</li>
            <li> I like this scale very much.</li>
            <li> works well and shipped very fast.  </li>
            <li> It looks very modern and minimalistic, which I like.</li>
            <li> And the price is also very reasonable.</li>
            <li> the large digital reading lights up which makes makes seeing your weight very easy.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even say this scale is good for a general idea of how much you weigh, because every week I weigh myself it goes down 10 pounds or more.</li>
            <li> If a scale is good, your four measurements will not be different by more than half pound.</li>
            <li> This scale is thin and light - nice display that is easy to read.  </li>
            <li> Certainly it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Bought  this scale to replace older analog scale, while weight does flucuate it is much more acurate than old scale.  </li>
            <li> so scooting it under a cabinet or such wouldn&#x27;t be a problem, and best of all, you step up and in seconds you have your weight lit up and easily read in big numbers and it stays lit for a couple of seconds after stepping down, for those of us who are challenged to see below our waist while standing on scales.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin and nice looking and the numbers are very easy to read.</li>
            <li> Will not work on carpet but works great on hard wood floors or tile.</li>
            <li> Most important, always place the scale in a hard surface and if your weight still shows too high then lay off the sweets and start walking more often.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have to tap before we step on, nice large display, feels much sturdier than our last scale.</li>
            <li> High quality look and feel, extremely accurate and consistent measurement, very affordable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s light, lighted, and likely to stay right where it is - in my kitchen!  </li>
            <li> I love these scales and had bought them before, but my toilet leaked water onto the floor and they didn&#x27;t quite work right since.  </li>
            <li> and so far it is showing accurate information.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s extrememly accurate, but it&#x27;s not too far off.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also accurate - the readings are consistent with the professional scales at my doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> could also be that I&#x27;m on the higher limit of this scale</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Also  they register decimal for those of us who want to know exactly what we weigh.</li>
            <li> Love the blue light-up display  </li>
            <li> I bought this scale as a first step in finally losing weight and getting healthy.</li>
            <li> I hope that i purchase more product from this seller in future.</li>
            <li> After 6 years, it still works - no cracks or chips; and, the display is still crisp.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, no matter what we did, the scale kept adding about 16-20 pounds per person - it was adding the weight of the scale to the people&#x27;s weight.  </li>
            <li> However, it has not weighed me consistently since I&#x27;ve had it.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention while testing it out the first day for some reason it would not set to 0 pounds to start it kept doing 26 pounds so every time I got on the scale</li>
            <li> I love the lighted blue display and it&#x27;s sleek design.  </li>
            <li> This scale is exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> At first it was reading about 14 pounds off.</li>
            <li> This scale is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what I need it to do.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it does exactly what I bought for it to do.</li>
            <li> Is no digital scale able to be used on carpet?</li>
            <li> To test accuracy, I placed weights on the scale, and sure enough, it was off....</li>
            <li> We settled on this scale, which was affordable and looked stylish enough.  </li>
            <li> It seems to not be consistent.</li>
            <li> The company has followed up several times to ensure we are completely satisfied...</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to finally have a scale that actually works and gives an accurate weight measurement.</li>
            <li> We like this scale so much more than our last one.</li>
            <li> Since then the weight has been consistent.  </li>
            <li> am going to be purchasing an analog scale as it seems that many digital scale suffer from this problem.</li>
            <li> I can read it and it gives me the exact weight.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Much better than prior scale.</li>
            <li> It shows a tiny bit more than I would like to see</li>
            <li> of my better recent Amazon.com experiences!</li>
            <li> ;-) If you read and follow the instructions as soon as you receive it, you should have no problem with the product.</li>
            <li> Although it appears to be well-made, I could never get a consistent reading on it.  </li>
            <li> I like it so much better than the one I had that would never give me the same result each time!!</li>
            <li> Although this is the first scale I have bought and have nothing to compare, it has served me well.  </li>
            <li> I sometimes would gain as much as 5 pounds in one day!  </li>
            <li> Numbers appeared on the LED display, but I was NOT given an exact number.</li>
            <li> I went to replace batteries for first time and now the scale does not even power on.  </li>
            <li> No longer consistent.</li>
            <li> After reading a million reviews on scales with many people complaining of accuracy I finally decided on this one.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I got a lemon, but the scale did not give me consistent readings.</li>
            <li> It came on time and works as advertised, and it is pretty slim.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had any problem getting a consistent reading.  </li>
            <li> the scale is consistent</li>
            <li> It is consistent if you weigh yourself more than once in a short time.  </li>
            <li> It is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> THE FIRST SCALE I GOT</li>
            <li> We have been using a digital scale for many years.  </li>
            <li> Work first time and every time.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t have to tap it first.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work because I liked the design and when looking for a scale of similar price, the Eatsmart scale reviews seem really fishy.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s exactly what I got.</li>
            <li> there is no tapping required, and the weight is consistent</li>
            <li> First calibration, spot on weight.</li>
            <li> This bathroom scale worked at first, for about two or three months.  </li>
            <li> the fact that you don&#x27;t have to first tap the scale before getting on is a plus.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> The bathroom scale is exactly what I ordered</li>
            <li> I love the digital preciseness and the lit panel.  </li>
            <li> Purchased this scale to replace a glass top one that only lasted a year.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly as pictured, and shows weight to the tenth of a pound.  </li>
            <li> I followed the instructions by turning it on and then letting it turn off after you install the first time, but no go.  </li>
            <li> I use it on a wood floor and it seems to be pretty stable and repeatable.</li>
            <li> This scale performs exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> What more could you possibly want in a scale?</li>
            <li> #34;spot on&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li> Kind of closed my eyes and pointed when I was searching for a scale.</li>
            <li> This worked well for just about one year exactly, then it suddenly stopped being able to provide a consistent reading.  </li>
            <li> you step onto the scale, you never get a consistent number.</li>
            <li> At first it was 3-4 pounds off from the reading I would get from the manual gym scale.</li>
            <li> Extremely consistent.  </li>
            <li> The scale isn&#x27;t always consistent however.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised with consistent accuracy with in acceptable error margin.</li>
            <li> You do not have to step on the scale first to get it calibrated...just stand on it and your number lights up.</li>
            <li> Great for early morning or in the dark.</li>
            <li> The only thing that makes you pause is the sticker on top of the scale that reads as google translation with instructions on how to calibrate the thing.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Product exactly as described.</li>
            <li> It must&#x27;ve been the hot weather that makes the item change.</li>
            <li> I will be willing to pay more next time</li>
            <li> the scale is exactly what I hoped for.</li>
            <li> When I first got this, I was using it in my kitchen.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely not acceptable, I&#x27;m going to have to find a scale elsewhere that is more reliable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get the same as replacement...</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been consistent for all 3 of us.</li>
            <li> Consecutive weighing shows consistent weight.</li>
            <li> I believe this is not a generic problem with the design of this weighing machine but more of a quality control issue.</li>
            <li> The item shipped fast and was here before i even knew it!</li>
            <li> I can just step on the scale and get a reading without tapping first.</li>
            <li> Stays consistent sometimes.</li>
            <li> Having two scales (the first I know to be accurate)side by side, and getting a variance of up to 12 pounds is inexcusable.  </li>
            <li> &quot; the scale first.</li>
            <li> We got exactly what was advertised.</li>
            <li> I really like the scale a lot!</li>
            <li> The first reading is always 4lbs heavier</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> Consistent.</li>
            <li> No need to tap it first to turn it on.</li>
            <li> The weight change is often a surprisingly higher number (~5lbs) even though it does not look it.</li>
            <li> item was descibed exactly as it was in the description.</li>
            <li> The scale was exactly as described and works really well!</li>
            <li> It has been 100% consistent -</li>
            <li> The scale is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> The display is bright to read and the weight will remain on the scale for a few seconds once you get off the scale.</li>
            <li> Thanks for speedy delivery too!</li>
            <li> Readings are consistent for me, but inaccurate.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I will convince myself I am losing weight and eat hot fudge sundaes.  </li>
            <li> than that, the scale is exactly what I wanted and ordered.</li>
            <li> No complaints, exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I recommend buying this scale, its not expensive and you can change the weight options from pounds to kilos.  </li>
            <li> Tried it for more than a week, wildly different readings all the time.</li>
            <li> I can even leave the room light off and see them clearly.  </li>
            <li> Stays consistently on target.  </li>
            <li> and the weight is exact.</li>
            <li> I love my Omega Ultra Slim Digital Bathroom Scale.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> No matter how many times i repeat this process, the weight is always the same for that day.  </li>
            <li> This scale was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I put it in my closet and don&#x27;t need to turn on the light to weigh myself like I had to do with my old scale.</li>
            <li> the number changes pretty drastically.</li>
            <li> Ease of use and exact weight match with my doctor&#x27;s scale.</li>
            <li> everytime and it has been consistent.</li>
            <li> once it did the weight was the same regardless of how many times I got on it.</li>
            <li> Only gripe is that I wish the screen would lock my weight more consistently and not turn off causing me to get on it</li>
            <li> We as a family are pleased overall.</li>
            <li> Thanks a ton!</li>
            <li> I believe it&#x27;s better than I would have found at one of the big box stores at a lower cost</li>
            <li> When I first got the scale</li>
            <li> The scale has sense on technology, so you don&#x27;t have to turn it on first, it starts working as soon as you step on it.  </li>
            <li> It exactly matched up to the scale at my doctor&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Hoping it continues to provide correct weight and ill be happy!</li>
            <li> THE FIRST WEEKS</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I love the digital display.</li>
            <li> When I had my annual checkup, my home weight was exactly my weight at the doctor&#x27;s office!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Exactly as promised.</li>
            <li> Measurements consistent after moving scales about room, and repeatedly off and on the scales five times.</li>
            <li> This scale works exactly as it should, no problems.</li>
            <li> The first is that the description is ever-so-mildly inaccurate.  </li>
            <li> This scale does exactly what I need it to do without any confusion.</li>
            <li> No tapping the scale first.  </li>
            <li> This is my 3rd digital scale and this one is simple to use and I am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> What we love about this one is that it fits under the bathroom door so when you open the door all the way, it clears the scale no problem.</li>
            <li> Also like the fact that you can just stand on it and not have to touch it first and wait.  </li>
            <li> I read through many of the reviews and I was lead to believe the Omega Ultra Slim Digital Bathroom Scale would meet my needs.  </li>
            <li> I did not want any of this hassle, so I took way more time than I should have reading reviews for different scales on Amazon, and landed on this one.</li>
            <li> Since I first weighed myself I was 198 lbs</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Step on it the first time it says one thing, step on it again</li>
            <li> It is very slim and sleek-looking, and I&#x27;m happy with the purchase, since I didn&#x27;t need any of the additional features one finds on more expensive scales.</li>
            <li> We checked it for accuracy using 5 and 10 pound weights and it added exactly 5 or 10 pounds to our body weights.</li>
            <li> Consistent readings.</li>
            <li> Love digital feature</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s nice and wide, and pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li> Im off to shop for another one, hopefully it will last better than this one did.</li>
            <li> I love being able to see my weight gain and loss, even if it&#x27;s a small amount.</li>
            <li> For the first month</li>
            <li> Matches exactly the weight I get from my Dr&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> This is our first digital and we love the sleek look and accuracy.</li>
            <li> However, this scale isn&#x27;t consistent.  </li>
            <li> Then one day I moved it to mop in my bathroom and when I put it back on the floor it said that I weighed 356 lbs (which is over 200 more than what I weigh) and continued to error out when I tried to reset it until it just stopped working all together.</li>
            <li> This scale is great, to say the least.</li>
            <li> Hesistant at first but nothin to it works as described.</li>
            <li> I found the scale to be exactly as described on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Never knew what it was going to give me, sometimes it was lower and some times it was higher.  </li>
            <li> I love the blue from it too and how it automatically shuts off.</li>
            <li> This is my first scale, and I don&#x27;t know how I managed without one.  </li>
            <li> Every time I used it I could get three or more different</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase and because of the competitive price, as well as the specific reading (tenths of pounds)</li>
            <li> (I am within the higher end of what this scale supports).</li>
            <li> Very slim design which works great in my small bathroom, as the bottom edge of the door clears the scale with room to spare</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is supposed to do and</li>
            <li> The size makes it easy to stand on even with size 14 feet, and it is extremely lightweight and easy to move.</li>
            <li> The number display is large and vibrant, and its nice not to having to tap it initially (you just step on to get a reading).</li>
            <li> This scale is so much more accurate than our previous scale.</li>
            <li> Quick reaction time with an accurate measure that will help anyone get a constant grasp on their weight.  </li>
            <li> The numbers are easy for me to read (I wear tri-focal glasses) and looking down at my feet area requires good lighting and larger letters and numbers...</li>
            <li> buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I eliminated the brand with the gazillion reviews on all their scales after reading that their reviewers were promised free goods among other things if they left a good review.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve waited a full month and have had no problems with my new scale.  </li>
            <li> Ordered a scale from them which arrived right away and was very well packaged.</li>
            <li> It has a very sleek look and design and according to what we knew about ourselves, was right on target with our weight.  </li>
            <li> The price and the many positive reviews made it the obvious choice.</li>
            <li> The light is a beautiful blue and stays on long enough for viewing</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t seem to mind being stored upright - it comes right back on easily and without needing to be re-set.</li>
            <li> The numbers are large and clear and it seems to be accurate.</li>
            <li> The display is bright and the numbers are large, but if you can&#x27;t see the display while standing on the scale, your weight will stay up for a few seconds after you step</li>
            <li> the number are large and bright and stay showing a few seconds after I step off the scale for me to look and see it</li>
            <li> love the features including: auto on, the extra large LCD display, the weight units in kg, or lbs, the 0.2 lb graduation and the fact that it does come with batteries to get you started.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love the low profile, the fact that it doesn&#x27;t need a tap to reset the display, and the ease of reading the large digits.</li>
            <li> The numbers are large and the blue background helps make them stand out more.</li>
            <li> The platform is more than large enough for size 12 feet.</li>
            <li> I generally weigh myself twice just to make sure I&#x27;ve gotten an accurate reading, and it always gives me the same reading, even after i re-zero it.</li>
            <li> This little scale is performing great so far.  </li>
            <li> Bought this scale after reading some favorable professional product reviews and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I decided to follow their steps - and so far, I am not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I originally bought it to replace my old manual, dial non-battery, non-digitable scale which lasted over 10 years, but was beat up looking...</li>
            <li> Just make sure to place it on a flat surface.</li>
            <li> Even better that it continues to track a weight loss which I give credit to hard work and an accurate scale!</li>
            <li> Also it came with it down batteries-which I love!.</li>
            <li> if you move it around you can tap it first, wait for the light to go back off then step right on.</li>
            <li> A great bathroom scale that seems to be as accurate as the expensive scales you&#x27;ll find at the gym or doctor&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, this guy&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li> Weight is to the tenths of a pound, so if you are a serious weight-watcher, this is great.  </li>
            <li> Bright digital readout, low to the floor, no flipping over.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had it for a few months, it works accurately, stores well, and you can set things on top of it without it activating.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that the numbers are big and illuminated against a blue background making then so easy to read.</li>
            <li> Good investment, I definitely recommend this scale to anyone looking for a simple bathroom scale.</li>
            <li> The look of this scale alone is worth the price; very sleek and modern.</li>
            <li> This scale is pretty, lightweight, and has large numbers.</li>
            <li> It is a good scale but it is very sensitive if I wiggle a toe or even move a little it will not measure right.  </li>
            <li> This is not a perfect scale, but it works fine for the price - better than some that I&#x27;ve paid more money for.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a simple scale that give accurate weight (I compared it right after a doctor&#x27;s appointment</li>
            <li> The one big reason was all the good reviews and also the LARGE back lit LED display.  </li>
            <li> THE LIGHT AROUND IT IS A PLUS- EASY TO READ EVEN IN THE DARK.</li>
            <li> We are both big people and this scale is easy to use, no tapping it first.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because of positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> I chose this scale because it had positive reviews and had the profile &amp; features</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s right on with what my doctor&#x27;s office says I weigh, so I think it&#x27;s a decent product.</li>
            <li> Works great after calibration, step on to turn on and weight displays brightly, no buttons or switches.</li>
            <li> I can step on it without tapping it first to activate it, and the lit display works really well.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend and I were very worried that this was not reporting the correct weight the first week we owned it.  </li>
            <li> This product is very lightweight and almost 99% gives consistent readings.</li>
            <li> I chose this scale because I wanted to see exactly how much I was losing each day.</li>
            <li> The footpads are rubberized in feel and the whole thing looks pretty sleek for the price.</li>
            <li> I freaked out that I had gained weight so fast, but then realized you just have to tap it first and then get on.</li>
            <li> It does its job and really helps me know and understand how much I weigh!  </li>
            <li> This scale is very slim which is exactly what we wanted.</li>
            <li> I recieved this item pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast from Amazon, thanks!</li>
            <li> First weight ever purchased &amp; really like  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend storing anything on top of it long</li>
            <li> For the past two weeks, I&#x27;ve been dieting and exercising, and thought it would be good to track progress as I go with a scale.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and so thin.</li>
            <li> Not sure why others give good reviews.</li>
            <li> Small size that is not ugly or obvious (we were able to slide it under some furniture) and it was very accurate.</li>
            <li> It has a blue light that is easy to view in the dark and easy to read screen.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much more lightweight than our last, and it has a classic design.</li>
            <li> Even though the analog scales may not get your true weight exactly right, they will deliver exactly the same reading every time if you weight doesn&#x27;t change.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Initially, I was going to purchase another scale on Amazon that had a large number of positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> Thankfully this scale is pretty tough and should be a great helping hand in my quest to become healthy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unlike other digital scales which provide extra features and don&#x27;t eventually work, this is the best bet for weight watchers.</li>
            <li> Works fine, looks sharp, nice price, batts have lasted several months and thanks the Maker</li>
            <li> Easy to use, just step on, highly visible display, and also quite accurate when I compared to it to other scales.  </li>
            <li> However, since the second day of use, the Omega has given consistent and highly accurate weight readings.  </li>
            <li> It stays consistent on multiple uses and was accurate when compared to the doctors weighted scales.</li>
            <li> It seems to be accurate as I first weigh myself on this and then on a doctors weight scale, both the same!!  </li>
            <li> It seems to be accurate--I weighed myself on a scale with weights that I know is accurate, and this scale gave almost exactly the same weight.</li>
            <li> It has big numbers I can read easily so that I know to either stop eating cookies or go ahead and have another.</li>
            <li> This slim, digital scale is easy to&lt;br /&gt;use</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice change from my previous scale which did not have replaceable batteries and had to be tossed when it quit working.</li>

            <li> * EASY TO READ DIGITAL DISPLAY.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a simple scale that I think will not break easily.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to read and the weight actually flashes and then stops when it is at your weight.  </li>
            <li> Blue backlit numbers are easy to read without my glasses.</li>

            <li> It is easy to read and stays on a second after getting off of it.</li>
            <li> The read out screen has a blue background, which makes the numbers easy to read from a standing position.  </li>
            <li> (let&#x27;s face it, we occasionally stomp if the first light tap doesn&#x27;t do the trick).  </li>
            <li> It worked well for the first two weeks, then it was off and on with weight fluctuations and now...I can stand on it and have my weight change from 1 to 8 different weights all before the light shuts itself off.</li>
            <li> Easy to read digital display.  </li>
            <li> My Omega is still going strong, on the same batteries that came with it, one year ago.  </li>
            <li> My Omega is still going strong, on the same batteries that came with it, one year ago.  </li>

            <li> The numbers are large and backlit.</li>
            <li> The numbers are large and readable...</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t tried to use it for large packages yet, to get a mailing weight for postage,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m expecting this large display to help with that.</li>

            <li> this one give me a number for my large self.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom because of the large display.</li>
            <li> Although it is slim, it is has a large surface area.</li>
            <li> The numbers are so large I can read them without my glasses.  </li>
            <li> Mom&#x27;s elderly and the large display works well for her</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m a large fellow</li>
            <li> I wish the manufacturers would realize that not all bathrooms are large.</li>

            <li> It certainly scores in the looks department.</li>
            <li> While I cant say for certain that the build quality is an issue, I would have to imagine that the sounds I heard were not in fact part of the feature set of the scale.&lt;br /&gt;- Reliability.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Conclusion: If you&#x27;re in the higher range that thisscale supports, you might be better off buying a slightly more expensive model with higher build quality and more reliable measuring for larger weights.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really bummed and have to believe that the majority of positive reviews are faked.  </li>
            <li> I have yet to see a digital scale that is consistent and accurate for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Its pretty nice tho, thin and light.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Original 3 star review 3/2011:&lt;br /&gt;Scale is nicely priced, very good looking &amp; arrived fast, but the black numbers on a blue background make it hard to read before you put your contacts in/glasses</li>
            <li> I wish it were made sturdier, but I can just slide the magnet back in and it works fine.</li>
            <li> Omega Ultra Slim Digital scale turned out to be a fine choice.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a pretty decent scale.</li>

            <li> It give accurate readings and is large enough that I don&#x27;t feel like I am trying to balance on it.</li>
            <li> yeah, it would be great to weigh that little, but when this scale says 115 and you go to the doctor later that day</li>
            <li> The Omega Ultra Slim Digital bathroom scale is simple, clean, as the name says, slim, the display numbers are large and easy to read.</li>
            <li> This scale is very flat so although my bedroom door opens across it, the door easily clears the scale.</li>
            <li> Very flat and easy to stand on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m unsure how accurate it is since this is the only scale I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s thin, the display is huge, it stays lit for 10 seconds... and it looks nice, too.  </li>
            <li> UNTIL PURCHASING THIS SCALE, I thought that the only accurate weight management tool was the high-priced scales physicians use in their offices...</li>
            <li> The platform is of thick clear glass over the scales weight mechanisms, all covered attractively with a neutral tone color band about two inches</li>
            <li> Our 35-year-old scale just isn&#x27;t accurate enough.</li>
            <li> Accurate to 0.2 lbs and reliable (almost always the same measure,</li>
            <li> Finally one that&#x27;s accurate.  </li>
            <li> I place my feet in the same spots every time to get a really accurate read</li>
            <li> Not as accurate (for the price) as a cheaper one purchased at a later date.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it does give me the same weight 2 times out of 3, but who knows how accurate that is.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Appears to be accurate and was very simple to start.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely accurate, as my weight was the same at home and at my doctors office.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be accurate based on my prior scale and the doctor&#x27;s office scale.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an accurate simple scale and this proved to be just that.</li>
            <li> Only then can you get on it and get an accurate weight reading for yourself.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s accurate and still works months later.</li>
            <li> This scale weighs several pound light, so I never have any idea what my real weight is.</li>
            <li> This digital scale provides the accurate measure, and works with AA batteries.</li>
            <li> Seems accurate enough...</li>
            <li> all the manufacturer says it is - I need to use it daily for health conditions and it is accurate to my doctors scale.</li>
            <li> My only wish would be that it wasn&#x27;t so darn accurate.</li>
            <li> Works very well, gives reliable numbers.</li>
            <li> Sleek, modern, noninvasive disegn</li>
            <li> FAST delivery.  </li>

            <li> It is very lightweigh, and , doesn&#x27;t skid on the floor.</li>
            <li> I was in a real pickle without a scale!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really like this scale as I do not have to tap it before standing on it to get weighed.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping .</li>
            <li> Very sleek looking.</li>
            <li> My goodness never knew there was so much scale competition</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to this scale.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still amazed at how much bathroom scales can cost</li>
            <li> * THIN, SLEEK, AND ATTRACTIVE.  </li>
            <li> Thanks bunches.</li>
            <li> Thanks   </li>
            <li> Very acurate.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, and well-done.</li>
            <li> People, read and follow the simple instructions and your scale will always work precisely the way it was meant to work.</li>
            <li> For the men, myself being one, they are very sturdy made, which I like a lot.  </li>
            <li> then you&#x27;re ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> like the blue light-</li>
            <li> Although I really like the product, I may not have made the purchase had I noticed this.  </li>
            <li> Scale works really well.  </li>
            <li> This scale is very inaccurate.</li>
            <li> I have no idea how much I weigh.  </li>
            <li> Very slim, compact, and</li>
            <li> Very inconsistent weights&lt;</li>
            <li> I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this scale!</li>
            <li> Then on two visits to our doctor we found that the Omega&#x27;s numbers were very close when clothing was taken into account.  </li>
            <li> This works very well.</li>
            <li> but if you shift your weight it can swing as much as 10 pounds.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really like this scale.</li>
            <li> It is not however, very consistant.</li>
            <li> I suspect if i had spent a bit more it might not have the issues I have noticed.  </li>
            <li> Much more than I expected for the price.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> the scale itself is slim and really compact.</li>
            <li> You have to stand real still for it to register.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Then it is ready to use.  </li>
            <li> One of the things I really like about it is that you don&#x27;t have the tap the scale and wait for it to &#x27;tare&#x27;.</li>
            <li> The batteries (2 AAA type) are primarily used for the Digital LED numerical display.    </li>
            <li> When we got it, all we had to do was put the batteries in and set it on the ground and it was ready to use.  </li>
            <li> I would really like to know how to contact the manufacturer</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely reccomend this scale.</li>
            <li> Response time is also very quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very slim and compact.</li>
            <li> The picture and title is very deceiving.&lt;br</li>
            <li> VERY WELL.  </li>
            <li> Readout is readily visible standing up.</li>
            <li> (let&#x27;s announce to the whole house we are getting on the scale)</li>
            <li> We really like this scale.</li>
            <li> Very sleek and modern design.</li>
            <li> This is so much easier than the tap, wait.</li>
            <li> In fact, the light will actually turn off while you&#x27;re standing on the scale.</li>
            <li> I really like this scale.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight and efficient and does not require an intense set up procedure by the user.</li>
            <li> Works very well for me.  </li>
            <li> I really like that I don&#x27;t have to tap and then step on -</li>
            <li> I really like that this scale feels so sturdy.</li>
            <li> I really like that the read out lights up when you step on it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this one fore 2-3 months and works very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a simple, cheap scale that works well.</li>
            <li> So it doesn&#x27;t consume that much</li>
            <li> It is extremely attractive, thin, but sturdy.  </li>
            <li> Works very well</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It does the job of weighing very well.</li>
            <li> It looks modern and feels well made.  </li>
            <li> The scale arrived incredibly fast, well packed and shipped.</li>
            <li> and she really likes it.</li>
            <li> The final number persists for a bit with the light.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon Prime</li>
            <li> I received the package very promptly</li>
            <li> The Sense-on Technology works really well, as soon as I stand on the scale it calibrates the weight.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> So much so that the slim form factor is an inspiration to become slimmer :</li>
            <li> and it has held up through much use and a couple of moves.</li>
            <li> I really like this scale.</li>
            <li> I really like my Omega Ultra Slim bathroom scale.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It works when it wants to work and not all of the time.</li>
            <li> so there is t much wobble when standing in</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s ready to go.</li>
            <li> The price was reasonable also.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t wobble around too much.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t been very meticulous in looking at the scale or it&#x27;s functions.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not supposed to do much else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like these scales.</li>
            <li> It is very helpful to see results in increments of .2 pounds.</li>
            <li> it seems like it&#x27;s very accurate.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I could put it in a very convenient place</li>
            <li> thanks.</li>
            <li> Doesnot even occupy much place .</li>
            <li> the sizes, but somehow it didn&#x27;t really register in my mind.  </li>
            <li> I knew it was very  close if not</li>
            <li> Plus the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very please with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The weight amounts jiggle around too much and don&#x27;t stay still.</li>
            <li> What I really got the scale for was to weigh my cat, who is overweight, according to the veterinarian and is supposed to lose weight.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable as well.</li>
            <li> Plus delivery is fast.</li>
            <li> , it couldn&#x27;t be much easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> when it shuts off it&#x27;s calibrated and ready to go.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> Vendor send it fast and well packaged.</li>
            <li> too much waiting</li>
            <li> If you even move the scale an inch on the floor, the weight really changes.  </li>
            <li> The weight may change as much as 2 or 3 pounds.</li>
            <li> It has been working very well.</li>
            <li> it is very slim.</li>
            <li> Also shipped to receive fast.</li>
            <li> This produt will not take up much room.</li>
            <li> But the scale is very INACCURATE.  </li>
            <li> Very acccurate.  </li>
            <li> I really do like this scale.  </li>
            <li> Very inaccurate.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this scale!</li>
            <li> It also weighs in decimals, so I can see my weight loss progress...which is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does its job and tells me how much I weigh.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a cheap product and definitely not with the money</li>
            <li> I really like that the scale is sleek</li>
            <li> : Tells me how much I weigh</li>
            <li> : Now I know how much I weigh</li>
            <li> but I think that&#x27;s pretty normal</li>
            <li> and it was ready to use.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> AND THEY WERE VERY CLOSE,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fond of this scale.</li>
            <li> It is slim and does not take much space and results</li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also had mine for not even a year, and I guess too much water got on it from the shower...</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this scale to everyone!</li>
            <li> Absolutely.</li>
            <li> (very helpful trying to weigh your luggage).</li>
            <li> It is also very slim.  </li>
            <li> The scale helps him stay on target as often as he wants now.</li>
            <li> Makes it much easier to view.</li>
            <li> Slim and does not take up much space.</li>
            <li> Arrived ready to use and as advertised.</li>
            <li> I am getting ready for bariatric surgery, and will need to closely monitor my weight after the operation.  </li>
            <li> THanks</li>
            <li> When it computes the final reading, an indicator light blinks.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the product, although not happy when I read my WEIGHT.</li>
            <li> I appreciate that the numbers light up and stay lit for several seconds after you step off the scale.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> My husband and I really like this scale.  </li>
            <li> This one is stable and doesn&#x27;t make me guess how much I really weigh.</li>
            <li> The directions do request that you store it on the ground as if you were to step on it at any time, but it doesnt take up much space anyways.&lt;br /&gt;Takes 4 AAA batteries which are provided in the box.</li>
            <li> Weight fluxuates too much.  </li>
            <li> This is a great scale with a thin profile, that I like.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for the speedy service.</li>
            <li> Not to insult her, but because she found herself getting very discouraged and upset</li>
            <li> how much she weighed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shipped out fast.</li>
            <li> (not standing straight and still can alter your reading...</li>
            <li> Out of the box, pop in the batteries and you are ready to go.</li>
            <li> So much nicer not having to tab or stomp just to get it to work.</li>
            <li> Also, the price is extremely reasonable.  </li>
            <li> Really needed one since we are on the road for months at a time.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> LIke really?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> Very dissatisfied ,I will be returning it.  </li>
            <li> The weight is very close to my doctor&#x27;s scale.</li>
            <li> Very sleek design</li>
            <li> I really like these scales.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping ...</li>
            <li> really like the company I bought this from.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin and attractive for a scale.  </li>
            <li> The results vary by as much as 5 to 8 pounds.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Omega Ultra Thin Digital Bathroom Scale\\&quot; is an excellent quality and value...    </li>
            <li> But I liked them enough to buy a second one.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for ease of use then the Omega Ultra Thin Digital Bathroom Scale is perfect!</li>
            <li> And I love that I can see the screen so big and clear.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with how thin the scale is and how the weight is illuminated on the digital display.</li>
            <li> Once I established a good firm foundation for it, I had absolutely no trouble.  </li>
            <li> It gives the same reading when you get on and off it several times and agrees with another scale I own.</li>
            <li> I love the bold numbers and bluelight, as now I can see my weight even in the dark!!</li>
            <li> I like my new scale very much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very accurate and extremely convenient to use.</li>
            <li> It is very accurate after comparing to two other scales.</li>
            <li> No complaints; light small easy to use and sleek design</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and sleek and fit easily in a corner of my bathroom.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve only had it for a few weeks, but so far, so good!  </li>
            <li> I completely understand the non-slip rubber for the feet, but the metal that can apparently wear through the rubber in no time seems like a pretty significant design flaw.</li>
            <li> We have ONE truly level spot in our old home and that is right inside the bathroom.</li>
            <li> Honestly it&#x27;s just plain inaccurate.</li>
            <li> The blacklight is useful and the screen is easy to see when looking down.</li>
            <li> More seriously, it would also be great for someone having trouble seeing around their expansive tummy---or perhaps to weigh yourself and then yourself with an object you would like to weigh---like your toddler, or the dog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;and easy to step up on for us who are not young anymore, and&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far the scale is usually the bringer of good news as far as my weight is concerned!I was able to lose 30 pounds with the help of this scale by dieting and exercising,with a keen eye on my weight almost daily..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nice looking and small enough to put in a corner of our bedroom but large enough to feel comfortable standing on it.  </li>
            <li> I like the aesthetic appearance, the blue led light is bright enough to read even in the dark.</li>
            <li> This scale is very slim, easy to read, easy to calibrate, and displays your information seconds longer than my other digital units.</li>
            <li> It seems quite accurate and gives repeatable results, though as others have noted it needs a perfectly flat floor.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also sharp looking in comparison to most bathroom scales.</li>
            <li> We love that this scale lights up, like our other one did that bit the dust.  </li>
            <li> I have used other beriatric bathroom scales and this one is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to find a website, phone number, or any other contact information for EPI or Epica.</li>
            <li> When other scales just tell me &amp;#34;E&amp;#34;  (which I suppose must mean Excellent)</li>
            <li> Just be sure to check the box carefully for batteries, I almost threw them away!</li>
            <li> He says he is very happy with the product and has just broken through 340!!</li>
            <li> All you need to do is step on it and in a few seconds your actual weight is displayed in a pleasant blue light.  </li>
            <li> Another great feature about these scales is that they run on regular batteries rather than a disc battery, so it costs so much less to operate then my old Frontgate scales.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a second scale for a friend, who apparently is having slightly better luck with his.</li>
            <li> Work great, small enough for our bathroom.</li>
            <li> There is nothing fun about buying a scale when you need to lose weight, so other than this little flat square being my sworn enemy, it&#x27;s a good product, easy to read and to store.</li>
            <li> The scale is small, fairly lightweight, but has a large easy-to-read display that could be easily read in the dark!</li>
            <li> Just make sure you don&#x27;t look down until it is done and stay very still.</li>
            <li> Switching back between kg and lb is good and the metric stays for 3-5 seconds after you get down</li>
            <li> I needed a scale that was accurate to record my weight daily for medical reasons.&lt;br /&gt;After looking at many different ones and reading reviews, I chose this Omega.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s very modern and classy  Recommended</li>
            <li> It is ultra slim as described, and has a modern, high tech look to it.  </li>
            <li> This scale appears to be highly inaccurate and very unreliable.</li>
            <li> It was very easy to calibrate, only needed to be placed on a flat surface (floor).  </li>
            <li> the blue lighted read out area is more then large enough to see your weight.  </li>
            <li> Love the low-profile of these scales;  Small bathroom, and the door opens right over them.</li>
            <li> Definitely the right choice!</li>
            <li> This scale replaced a very old clunker and has been amazingly accurate next to my doctor&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li> I like it pretty accurate with my other two scales,</li>
            <li> it was accurate, on point, and didn&#x27;t take long to calculate my weight</li>
            <li> This scale is really accurate, and it doesn&#x27;t take long to load.</li>
            <li> Very low profile, big bright digital display.</li>
            <li> This scale is accurate, looks good, and thin enough to store away when you don&#x27;t like the number it shows you.</li>
            <li> Why did I wait so LONG to order this fantastic scale??</li>
            <li> All that was true until recently.  </li>
            <li> I also had checked the various scale market and finally after much  reading of many reviews opted for these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep this review short and sweet...</li>
            <li> thought the error in this scale would be relative to my true weight, but there the error seems to be redrawn each time you step on the scale.</li>
            <li> We are both pretty health conscious and run.  </li>
            <li> far it reads consistently and the illumination is great.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> nice and small, compact.  </li>
            <li> It is worth a few extra dollars to get a scale that has the nice features this one has.  </li>
            <li> It is small and unobtrusive, but also nice looking.</li>
            <li> I so far think this scale is pretty descent.  </li>
            <li> I love that the display is backlit also, so you can see it in the dark.</li>
            <li> and I love how it doesn&#x27;t immediately go dark when I step off of it.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be much sturdier and fancy then the last scale I had, but I did weigh more back then.</li>
            <li> Short and sweet</li>
            <li> Since my main use is to weigh my overweight cat that is on a special diet, the speed is a definite asset.  </li>
            <li> It is also very accurate, weighing me exactly what my physician&#x27;s office weighed me a few hours before!</li>
            <li> the more my weight is going down.</li>
            <li> so if you are too big to see it when you&#x27;re on the scale, you can still see what you weigh; it doesn&#x27;t wobble even if the floor is not absolutely flat; it doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of excess functions most of us don&#x27;t want</li>
            <li> Very comfortable to stand on and love the blue black lit digital display.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s brand new!</li>
            <li> New diet , lost 12 pounds in three weeks!</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s my third (even though the name on the top changes frequently, it&#x27;s still the same exact design).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other over the counter scales, and not been particularly happy with the accuracy of digital overall.  </li>
            <li> My husband has decided he wants to live longer.</li>
            <li> If I move its location, a whole new set of weights show up.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this because it had more good than bad reviews.</li>
            <li> The scale&#x27;s style, value (much less than those shown in most stores), easy-to-read LCD, quality and simplicity make it a pleasure to weigh in every morning.  </li>
            <li> Now he is eating less so he won&#x27;t weigh more.  </li>
            <li> Easy to set up, minimal learning curve.</li>
            <li> changes it by half a pound or more, even after I reset it as instructed.</li>
            <li> This is a much more reliable scale than our previous 20-year-old Healthometer scale.   </li>
            <li> I particularly like that you don&#x27;t have to tap it to make it work.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so sad; we&#x27;ve shared so many diets together; so many successes and failures.</li>
            <li> This scale replaced an older dial model that had about a five pound swing, depending on how my feet were positioned and weight was shifted.  </li>
            <li> You can switch from Kilos to Pounds and vice versa by pressing the button located on the bottom side of the device (upper area, in the middle of the top row).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We bought this scale to replace an older Taylor model.  </li>
            <li> Crystals\\&quot; (that&#x27;s the actual \\&quot;techno\\&quot; for how most all these type scales work) which converts Mechanical Forces (weight) into an Electrical force (voltage &amp; current), that feeds the Electronic Measuring Circuitry.  </li>
            <li> At this price you&#x27;ll be hard pressed to find a better scale!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Omega Ultra Slim Digital scale to replace an old, cheap scale that - for whatever reason - I&#x27;ve been hanging onto for years.</li>
            <li> My 20 month old son especially loves stepping on and off of it to see it light up.</li>
            <li> My one year old sits on it and likes to tap the light, and my cat occasionally perches on the thing, and no harm done.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty simple - exactly what I need.  </li>
            <li> Love the big numbers, and you weigh the same, no changes by getting on and off.  </li>
            <li> No need to touch it beforehand - you just step on it, stand still, and it lights up and flashes your weight then shows it steady.  </li>
            <li> Also, the slim and contemporary design fits well in my batchlor pad.</li>
            <li> Nice big wide area to stand on so your not teetering while trying to weigh.  </li>
            <li> I recently purchased this scale at Amazon and it arrived quickly in the mail.</li>
            <li> I finally bought myself a digital scale and love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve re-weighed myself several times in a row and never gotten a result that was different than more than a tenth or two.</li>
            <li> It works decently.  </li>
            <li> It is much lighter than my old scale and much prettier.  </li>
            <li> We bought this scale to replace a different brand model which wasn&#x27;t old or cheap but</li>
            <li> The scale is flat enough for him to comfortably stand on and the numbers are just in the right place.</li>
            <li> Delivered in two days and is exactly as shown -- very thin, accurate and easy to read all at a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> Secondly, there are 4 wheels/suctioned that enable the scale to stay solid and be accurate, but ever since the first time I took the scale out of the box, one or another of these suctions have always popped out of alignment and this causes a 100 lb variation in my weight.</li>
            <li> We needed a digital scale that was accurate to the tenths as our son is a wrestler and knowing exact weights is necessary.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been very consistent reading the same thing if I weigh myself within minutes to get two readings.  </li>
            <li> Pretty simple scale, digital, light, sleek, instructions included.</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s just not true of a cheap weighing machine!</li>
            <li> Packaging was not excessive, so not too much trash, delivery was prompt and issue-free.</li>
            <li> The digital display is large and backlit, making it easy to read and avoiding the hunching over effect caused by smaller scale read-outs.  </li>
            <li> I like the no-nonsense ability to just get on and obtain a digital reading and step off - that weight reading stays lit/visible for several seconds before it shuts off making it easy to see/read the large numbers visible.</li>
            <li> Easy to see in the dark thanks to the backlit display.</li>
            <li> You just step on and be still for a few seconds and the readings are very accurate.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> have used this scale for a couple of weeks now, and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> reccomend this scale highly.</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend it.</li>
            <li> and the weight differs from the other scale, (the accurate one) by as much as 3-4 lbs.</li>
            <li> because I don&#x27;t really care if its a pound or less off from time to time, im really just looking for a fairly accurate \\&quot;ballpark\\&quot; weight...which is what this gives me.</li>
            <li> We got this product a few weeks ago and so far it&#x27;s been a quick and accurate scale.  </li>
            <li> It was very simple to setup and is pretty consistent on the weight it shows if calibrated properly following the instructions (which are pretty simple).It is also very sleek and the display is large and clear.</li>
            <li> The display is large and clear.</li>
            <li> Readout is large and clear to read.</li>
            <li> The display on this weighing scale is large and clear.</li>
            <li> weighed myself at home with it and then went to the doctor and used their large, professional electronic scale</li>
            <li> The numbers are large and can clearly be seen.  </li>
            <li> This scale is very accurate, although I wish it would lie to me every once in a while, or at least console me when it reads a higher result than it is used to.</li>
            <li> my friend&#x27;s scale worked ok for a little while</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for an estimation of your weight, this scale will work for you, but if every little bit matters, you better look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I also love the fact that it weighs so little, enabling me to take it with me when I go on trips.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great and with other similarly priced scales that don&#x27;t look nearly as sleek or reliable as this one I would definitely recommend this one over others.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s accurate (agrees with my doctor&#x27;s scale), repeatable to the tenth of a pound, and has a large back-lit display that I can read in the dark without my glasses.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, no waiting for flashing settings etc., like some other scales.</li>
            <li> In other words easy to do.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly larger than I expected, which is bonus for anyone with large feet :).</li>
            <li> device looks decent with its nice big illuminated display but I don&#x27;t want to have to bend down and test the scale for any wobbling whenever I want to take it out to weigh myself.</li>
            <li> Just one day it worked great and the next time I used it a few days later, I couldn&#x27;t get a reading.  </li>
            <li> so far we have weighed ourselves and every animal in the house haha.</li>
            <li> Modern low-profile looks fantastic...not your grandma&#x27;s old clunky scale.  </li>
            <li> the scale is very slim and classy looking</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d be surprised how much those gym shoes weigh.</li>
            <li> So, I put it out on the concrete slab in my garage.  </li>
            <li> It is very slim, clear to read</li>
            <li> So far this scale performs very well.</li>
            <li> I bought this one in the hopes it would work properly because I have since exceeded the weight limit of my old scale and needed one with a greater capacity to track my current weight loss program.</li>
            <li> Most were heavy and just an eye sore in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> Not just by a few ounces, but by 1, 2, or more pounds.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this scale a few months ago &amp; it gave me precise, consistent readings.</li>
            <li> I used it to check my weight and find it is between 2 and 3 lbs difference from a normal scale.</li>
            <li> It does take quite a few batteries, but battery life is OK.</li>
            <li> This digital scale is definately worth it.</li>
            <li> weight fluctuates around 2-5lbs a day, this is COMPLETELY NORMAL because of water weight which can be gained and lost rapidly.</li>
            <li> Love that the weight lasts for a few seconds after I get off the scale.</li>
            <li> I love this scale and weigh myself everyday.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this product for the past one month and so far no issues of any kind.</li>
            <li> Our former scale required the bathroom light on to barely see the display.</li>
            <li> My parent&#x27;s scales (not this one - they&#x27;ve had more than a few over the years)</li>
            <li> I love this scale, I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not a complaint, but at my size I guess I sort of expect things to be HUUUGE, and this wasn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous brands of fresh batteries since and it does not turn on.</li>
            <li> Bought way more pricey scales and they were nothing but trouble.  </li>
            <li> This scale is thin, good looking and works well.</li>
            <li> Material feels good despite the thin build and is sturdy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this scale based on the many positive reviews but even after following the manual instructions very carefully &amp; replacing the batteries I have never gotten the scale to stop with one reading nor did the weight stay on for 10sec seconds after stepping off the scale.  </li>
            <li> The large LED display holds your reading for a few seconds after dismount making it easy to record your weight without craning your neck.</li>
            <li> This scale is very light-weight, has a back-light screen that allows for easy reading of the numbers, and has four little non-skid feet on the bottom so that it will stay in place on a tile or linoleum floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not real big and bulky, either, but slim and easy to fit into a small space.</li>
            <li> in twenty minutes there was more than half a pound of variation in my measured weight!</li>
            <li> Not hard to fix just push the button to switch.</li>
            <li> This scale could never settle on a weight sometimes weighing as much as 200 pounds less than should be accurate.</li>
            <li> Big numbers are easy to see, and it gives you final weight in seconds.  </li>
            <li> They are thin and light so can be stored easily</li>
            <li> This is accurate, thin and easily stored.</li>
            <li> This scale is lightweight, thin, easy to read, and seems to measure weight accurately.</li>
            <li> But this one is unbelievably thin &amp; light, it&#x27;s so easy to carry from one room to another.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the Omega Ultra Slim Digital Bathroom scale and although the scale is simple, it works amazingly and actually looks very modern.</li>
            <li> O.K., it&#x27;s just a Digital Scale for home usage right...  </li>
            <li> After viewing several scales, and reading comments, the Omega scale appeared to be the right choice for me.</li>
            <li> I get the same reading after weighing myself again right after.  </li>
            <li> I reserve the right 2 revise this later if anything should change.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get it to work properly even right after calibration and using it on my wood floors.</li>
            <li> Quick readout, no buttons to reset (as long as you don&#x27;t move it).  </li>
            <li> My husband has a balance issue and cannot easily get on the average scale.</li>
            <li> Backlit screen makes it easy to read in the dark.</li>
            <li> Also easy to read in the dark since it is LED.  </li>
            <li> The readings are quick and the final measurement stays on the screen for a few seconds so you can easily view it.</li>
            <li> Do not buy the cheapest item in any category when a five-star alternate is available for only a few dollars more.</li>
            <li> It is thin, the display is nice and big and the price was right!  </li>
            <li> Overall, pretty decent scale.</li>
            <li> Overall I think it&#x27;s a pretty decent product for the price.</li>
            <li> The large heavy contrasted LED is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> the digital scale is catchy, smart and doesn&#x27;t occupy much space.</li>
            <li> Very rarely, it operates as promised, flashes a few weights then holds constant on your weight even when you step off, but as above, that has been about 1/50th of the time, and yes, I&#x27;ve tried it that many times.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, a fantastic purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a month and have noticed that I&#x27;m having pretty high and low fluctuations of weight.</li>
            <li> My old scale was about 20 years old and not very accurate any more.</li>
            <li> I ordered this scale and it has become his new toy.  </li>
            <li> I returned it, got a refund, and now have a new one.</li>
            <li> Went on a diet for New Years.  </li>
            <li> I used brand new batteries and recalibrated it using all methods mentioned in these reviews, but it still won&#x27;t work correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After that, regardless of me buying new batteries it did not give me a reading at all.</li>
            <li> A NEW ONE</li>
            <li> Now I have to get a new scale.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone needing a new scale - or just wanting one.</li>
            <li> Time to get a new scale</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: I emailed the seller and asked about the warranty and they sent me a new scale.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a new scale to buy</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve already replaced it with a new scale.</li>
            <li> compared the Omega to the new one and found that this one weighs you 4-5 pounds heavier than you are.</li>
            <li> I bought this scale for my new weight-loss regime.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anybody looking a new scale.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to anyone who needs a new bathroom scale.</li>
            <li> it must be the faulty scale&amp;#34;, so I decided to get a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was on groupon and saw one on sale for $25 but decided to check out Amazon for reviews and comparison.</li>
            <li> I ordered a new one to replace it and it is now located in my bed room where it will not see water again.</li>
            <li> AND OF COURSE I COMPARED MY WEIGHT  BETWEEN THIS NEW SCALE AND</li>
            <li> I decided that I could live with that and just add on to whatever the scale told me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> our new scale...</li>
            <li> We both like ouir new scale.</li>
            <li> It came with packaged new batteries</li>
            <li> I bought this scale after I moved out of my family home and into a new apartment.</li>
            <li> I needed a new scale.</li>
            <li> Ah, the New Year.</li>
            <li> The thin design makes it easy to move if necessary and the large numbers are easy to read.</li>
            <li> Appears to be very accurate, and will measure small fluctuations in weight throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, lightweight, and seems to be very accurate.</li>
            <li> It seems accurate enough, although sometimes I can weigh myself, wait 5 minutes and weigh myself again and get a slightly different reading.</li>
            <li> scale is a lot lighter than my previous glass-topped one, so it&#x27;s easy to move.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight, accurate, and low profile, making storage or hiding a very simple task.  </li>
            <li> We wanted something that could be seen reasonably well in different lighting conditions and didn&#x27;t take up too much space.</li>
            <li> The Omega Ultra Slim Digital scale is aptly named because the scale in super thin.  </li>
            <li> It is Easy to clean and it doesn&#x27;t get confused by the cats walking across it</li>
            <li> Overall, it is much better quality than I&#x27;d expected for the price.</li>
            <li> It is thin and light weight and will fit in my bag to take into a nursing visit.</li>
            <li> I especially like that it locks in your weight so that you can stand straight, then get off and see how much you weigh.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s consistent every morning, the scale was extremely well packed, and shipped so darned fast, and it&#x27;s got a very high quality feel to it.</li>
            <li> After putting a board down and the scale on that it worked fine.</li>
            <li> The weight is pretty much accurate, I get the same reading even after 3-4 attempts, the one which I had earlier would show me a different reading everytime.</li>
            <li> This scale is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> This scale is very thin, yet sturdy, looks very nice on my bedroom floor.  </li>
            <li> It has a very classy look in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> This scale is very, VERY sensitive.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re nearing the high end of the range this scale offers, you may encounter troubles with maintaining the scale.  </li>
            <li> Now that I have gotten used to my *new* weight, I love the slim design and the small footprint it takes up.</li>
            <li> display stays lit for just long enough after you&#x27;ve stepped off, and is easy to read.</li>
            <li> well-designed, stylish, so thin it barely rises above the floor, with a large well-lit display and accurate as well</li>
            <li> : it comes w/ its own batteries; it&#x27;s fashionably thin; it&#x27;s large enough for the display to be visible even if you&#x27;ve got a bit of a belly; the display is well-lit and large; the display stays on for about 20 seconds after you get off</li>
            <li> This scale can handle our weight and has huge glow in the dark letters.  </li>
            <li> I love the small design, but it does need to be on a level surface, otherwise the weight will vary.</li>
            <li> Not sorry for my choice and would definitely recommend them.</li>
            <li> not sure why I settled on the Omega, with SO many choices,</li>
            <li> /&gt;Popping in the batteries and, weighing in for the first time, only took a couple of minutes.  </li>
            <li> Just follow the exact instructions in the short manual enclosed</li>
            <li> This scale works well and is consistent when stepped on several times in a row.</li>
            <li> The scale number is big and clear, with blue light in background.</li>
            <li> Such an improvement over those scales you have to tap first to get them to weigh you.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it never worked properly for us.</li>
            <li> Not sure how many words I can write about a scale.</li>
            <li> And while this scale does have a memory - in that it will repeat exactly the same weight</li>
            <li> Of the four pages, two of them are the meat, the other two pages are the front cover and back cover :)</li>
            <li> exactly* the same each time</li>
            <li> ordered my scale the first of the week and received it two days later.  </li>
            <li> My dad ruined the first one I bought - he didn&#x27;t realize it was only the battery that needed changing.</li>
            <li> Just bought this the other day and was excited to try it out.</li>
            <li> It is a small scale and definitely stylish.</li>
            <li> I selected it based on other customer reviews and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> normally 175 to 180 nearly fell over, had no scale and wanted a unit that would show any increase</li>
            <li> Same exact weight as doctor scale.  </li>
            <li> Makes the bath complete!</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase as I gave the first one to my mom.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a pretty big fluctuation.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> This is my first digital scale.</li>
            <li> I got wild results between 500 and 600 pounds!  </li>
            <li> I take the second reading about 2 min after the first.</li>
            <li> Its always first thing in the morning and always in the same spot om the tile floor.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;lie&amp;#34; like I need it to do!  :&amp;#62;)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s consistent, always reads the same number twice if I get off and try again.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a pretty big deal.</li>
            <li> I have gotten back on them a number of times and at first the numbers seem to be zeroing in</li>
            <li> This scale is extremely thin and very handsome.</li>
            <li> This is my first digital scale.  </li>
            <li> so far!</li>
            <li> Also it was never like a 1 or 2 pound difference more like 5 to 10 its a waste of money!</li>
            <li> This is our first digital scale.</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s a pretty big difference.</li>
            <li> Now... if only it could help me LOSE weight, I&#x27;d give it SIX stars...;-)</li>
            <li> When I ordered this scale I specifically requested in the search box &amp;#34;Made in USA only&amp;#34; from an original list of 30-40 scales I was left with only 3</li>
            <li> gives the exact same reading.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t need to know your bone density or other bull then get this very simple and yet stylish bathroom</li>
            <li> When you stand on the scales you MUST be completely still!  </li>
            <li> Only problem I had at first</li>
            <li> that is has tenths in pounds (since every little bit counts) and its easy to read.  </li>
            <li> Seriously this product is good and if you are looking or researching to buy a scale definitely consider buying this one.</li>
            <li> WHEN I FOUND OUT THE VERY LITTLE DIFFERENCE OF MY WEIGHT, I WAS VERY EXCITED</li>
            <li> Very reliable; even in the dark with easy to read digital scale.</li>
            <li> I reviewed many, many digital scales before this one and while there were only 2 reviews on the OMEGA ULTRA THIN scale, I chose it because of the reviews...</li>
            <li> Anyhow, I very much like the LCD&#x27;s soft blue backlighting.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to track their weight on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> The lit blue background is very easily read and the black and chrome looking appearance of these scales is out of this world!</li>
            <li> I bought this scale to replace a 20+ year old scale when i started a new diet  </li>
            <li> I needed to get a new scale as mine was old</li>
            <li> But, I need typically need to get on it three times to get an accurate reading.  </li>
            <li> I took it with me 2 the Dr office &amp; it was accurate within a half pound of their scale.</li>
            <li> One problem is that the light on the scale does not stay on long enough so that you have to hurry and read your weight or get off and try again.   </li>
            <li> We have this tucked into a small, out-of-the-way corner in our dining room and it is very slim and light.</li>
            <li> It was kind of scary stepping on this for the first time.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful and functional bathroom scale, which uses regular AA batteries instead of those expensive, disk-shaped ones.  </li>
            <li> soon as i stepped on it the number started jumping around wildly and then turned off before it settled, i looked to the instructions for help and it seemed to be written by a first year english student from japan</li>
            <li> Embarrassingly, the scale made loud cracking noises and felt physically stressed during my first attempts at using it</li>
            <li> A little wipe-down, and it looks exactly like it did right out of the box.  </li>
            <li> A little wipe-down, and it looks exactly like it did right out of the box.  </li>
            <li> Clear numbers and easy to see in a lighted room or in the dark!</li>
            <li> Works really well (at least in the last month that we&#x27;ve had it), looks exactly as advertised, and the display is clear and easy to read.</li>
            <li> Aside from the obvious &#x27;scale&#x27; parts of the scale&lt;br /&gt; (which I&#x27;ve used a few times against weight balance scales and it seems pretty accurate, or holding plates of weight and seeing what it reads)&lt;br</li>
            <li> But the real problem is that I step on the scale, get a jumpy reading, then step off and on again...and get a different reading, sometimes several pounds off from the first one.</li>
            <li> I find it is consistently about .5 to .75 pounds higher than the doctor&#x27;s scale, but I am not too worried, because at least it is consistent (perhaps the doctor&#x27;s scale is off).  </li>
            <li> super light and thin - fits anywhere.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much better than my previous digital scale.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know anything about bathrooms scales, and I assume that they are basically very similar, but the style design and the black on silver color of the Epica are outstanding.  </li>
            <li> Quick shipping, thin and light scale.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a broken one or what since reviews seem good on this scale, but I&#x27;m trashing this one and finally getting a new one.</li>
            <li> Sleek, thin, easy to use, like the blue light.  </li>
            <li> I received this scale earlier this week, and it&#x27;s very simple to use, easy to read, and does it&#x27;s job in just a second or two.</li>
            <li> I would say that it is as acurate as any scale and it was less expensive than the more popular brands.</li>
            <li> Readings are very consistent, I tested it by stepping on and off several times and always got the same reading!</li>
            <li> The large number display is terrific.  </li>
            <li> I especially like the Sense-On technology and the large display.</li>
            <li> The numbers are blue, and large</li>
            <li> The display is large enough to see well</li>
            <li> And there certainly are things about this Omega Ultra Slim Digital Bathroom Scale that I like.  </li>
            <li> The numbers are large enough to read without glasses.</li>
            <li> I gave it 5 stars for ease of use and sleek low profile with large backit numbers.</li>
            <li> Get on the scale, read the large digital display and do that every morning.  </li>
            <li> The scale goes into a little bit of a fit.</li>
            <li> However, I am still rating this an average as it managed to do all the features it promised, and appears to be a good value deal for those in the lower range who needn&#x27;t worry about the build quality or other issues above.</li>
            <li> I am rating at 4 as the LCD could be a bit bigger but its decent size for normal use.</li>
            <li> the digital reading is large and clear.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it would have been better if they used a hard plastic for the feet, or no feet at all.  </li>
            <li> We love this scale, my elderly Mom was having a hard time reading her scale.</li>
            <li> The display is large and clear in a soft blue backlight.</li>
            <li> The scale arrived quickly, is solid and stylish, reads instantly, and has a large display which freezes for a few seconds after it stabilizes (which helps if you are just out of the shower and do not have your glasses on).  </li>
            <li> However, the number of reviews made me a little suspicious (the number of reviews was higher than almost all other items on Amazon), and I found out that the other company rewards people for posting good reviews, so I didn&#x27;t trust those reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems extremely accurate when I did a few repeated test measures.</li>
            <li> These are the pivoting feet that give the scale balance and allow for accurate readings on uneven surfaces like bathroom tile.</li>
            <li> Accurate, heavy duty well made scale..</li>
            <li> There is a difference if i take my shoes off or am wearing heavy jeans or not so I&#x27;d say the scale is accurate.  </li>
            <li> I had this scale for a few months and then realized it wasn&#x27;t accurate at all.</li>
            <li> see the doctor in a few months to see how accurate it is, &amp; keep you posted.</li>
            <li> Step on, stand still, get a clear read out.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t keep near the bathtub when you have children,  to much water splashed on it will make it not work properly.  </li>
            <li> No misreadings of any sort, and takes about 3 seconds to give you a clear weight.</li>
            <li> I was too busy to contact the vendor, and I really didn&#x27;t have time to package it up and send it back.  </li>
            <li> It is accurate enough for someone to place it, calibrate it, and use it to monitor fluctuations, which is what I expected.</li>
            <li> No waiting for numbers to clear or reset.</li>
            <li> It is slim and lightweight and shows the numbers clearly.  </li>
            <li> Only have it for about 1 month, so far I really like it.  </li>
            <li> No &amp;#34;jiggling&amp;#34; to get a reading -- the reading is quite clear, even without my glasses.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s done the same thing the whole time.</li>
            <li> When it comes to weighing myself, that part of my life is simple and dependable thanks to this scale.</li>
            <li> b/c if we&#x27;re obsessive enough to be weighing ourselves at home we don&#x27;t need a scale to track our weight (do you really want to have to tell it each time that it&#x27;s you &amp; not your SO</li>
            <li> but since we are a weight conscious society guess I should not have been too surprised.</li>
            <li> I have only had it for a short time but so far it works better than I expected.</li>
            <li> It was time to say goodbye to my old faithful friend.</li>
            <li> The majority of the time it will vary by as much as 2 lbs regardless of method used even when stepping in the same area of the foot deck.  </li>
            <li> This item offers me this option.</li>
            <li> It is at least one pound heavier and sometimes more.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that it gives your weight in tenths of a pound (or at least fifths).</li>
            <li> I was looking for a simple and functional scale that doesn&#x27;t take up too much space.</li>
            <li> If you move too much just step off the scale and back on to get your results.  </li>
            <li> After using this Omega digital scale for two months, I can&#x27;t really find anything to complain about for a scale in the twenty five dollar price range.</li>
            <li> so when our old scale died, we contacted them about their scale.</li>
            <li> They sent us the direct link for ordering one and we did so.</li>
            <li> It is consistant enough for me but with in 20 minutes the readings will vary by as much as a pound.</li>
            <li> 6/2014:&lt;br /&gt;After 3 years this scale stopped working correctly and now fluctuates wildly from 3-7 lbs.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 85 year old mother.</li>
            <li> Her old scale had died.</li>
            <li> My old scale had to be tapped</li>
            <li> started reading wild numbers and wouldn&#x27;t \\&quot;lock\\&quot; on to a value and would just shut off.  </li>
            <li> So far, I have not purchased another scale but continue to research them to find one that works well.</li>
            <li> We really like this scale and the only reason it is not five stars</li>
            <li> its streamlined, modern look to the back lit numerals</li>
            <li> The Omega Ultra Slim Digital Bathroom Scale is off as much as 10 pounds at any given time.  </li>
            <li> No problem at all so far.</li>
            <li> I have not owned a scale in about 6 years because my daughter broke my old one by playing with it.  </li>
            <li> Also, so far we haven&#x27;t had any issues with accuracy.</li>
            <li> I bought this weight scale to replace my old one and now i always end up checking my weight on my old one.</li>
            <li> So far, it has been just what we needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a really tall slightly bigger girl</li>
            <li> My weight does not fluctuate as it did on my old scale where I could gain or lose 8-10pounds by stepping on and off the scale.  </li>
            <li> They are far to in-accurate for this</li>
            <li> I have it near.  </li>
            <li> Completely unreliable, and just sits in our cabinet.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my 92 year old Grandmother.  </li>
            <li> Used my old scale worked.</li>
            <li> my master bathroom got accidentally flooded by me and water got in all corners of my master bathroom including my old bathroom scale.</li>
            <li> DO NOT waste your money on this piece of junk.</li>
            <li> Each time I got in the scale it would fluctuate as much as 8 lbs from the prior days readings.</li>
            <li> and I completely regret it.</li>
            <li> We ordered this to track our daughter&#x27;s weight gain since she is now too old for an infant scale.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product directly from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Epica scale on Amazon in early March, and as of August, it is no longer functional.</li>
            <li> It is not a poblem for us as we have the room to leave it be, but it&#x27;s something to consider if you need to move the scale around frequently.  </li>
            <li> If I were naturally given to bends and gyrations, I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased a 400 pound capacity scale.</li>
            <li> I only weigh that much?</li>
            <li> I miss my old scale with the dial.</li>
            <li> It has a low price, it&#x27;s very compact</li>
            <li> but once it hit the year mile mark  it became WAY TOO sensitive (even when i recalibrate it) and takes forever to calculate my weight</li>
            <li> I tried weighing myself before leaving for office (in complete attire) and the weight was within the margin of error.</li>
            <li> (The real professionals even have extensive setups to test the quality of the lens and may buy/</li>
            <li> Our old scale needed replacing.</li>
            <li> Bought this product to replace an old dial type.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This bathroom scale is light on price, but heavy on reliability and design.</li>
            <li> so much I bought a second one for my home.</li>
            <li> The fact that the display lights up when I step on, holds the number for my weight for a few seconds and then dims, automatically is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> so most likely I will just keep this one and weigh myself with the scale in the same position all the time, hoping the margin of error will be minimal.</li>
            <li> It also fluctuated wildly.  </li>
            <li> after my old scale died, i began my search for a scale that didn&#x27;t make you tap dance to see if you lost an ounce or a pound.  </li>
            <li> This scale is completely off.</li>
            <li> I already have been keeping track of my weight and thus far the scale is helping me achieve my goals.</li>
            <li> People say that their weight on it varies, but I wonder how much of that is water weight that they think is actually the fault of the scale.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My old one was an analog spring loaded scale that always said 150 if i was wearing nothing or fully clothed with boots and holding my 20 lb cat.    </li>
            <li> This was a Christmas present for my mom, and everyone immediately started taking turns to see how much they weighed.</li>
            <li> The scale is very inaccurate, it can give you different answer</li>
            <li> i kept tripping over the old scale.</li>
            <li> you have it on a completely level surface.</li>
            <li> I even had my husband step on them directly after me to see if the reading would change, and they gave his correct weight.  </li>
            <li> , so I don&#x27;t know if 150 pounds really is 150 pounds, but I&#x27;ll report back if I find any issues.</li>
            <li> I was COMPLETELY</li>
            <li> Does not waste batteries and can be stored anywhere</li>
            <li> (really, I can&#x27;t possibly weigh this much)</li>
            <li> My 4 year old son loves it as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this scale after our old one died.</li>
            <li> It looks very sleek and low profile in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> No issues so far.</li>
            <li> Completely inaccurate (and by that</li>
            <li> The Omega unltra slim digital scale is big enough to comfortably accomodate everyone in my family&#x27;s feet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought scales that were three times as much for the same quality.</li>
            <li> The digits are very big,too, so you can read them standing further away</li>
            <li> has a modern sleek design, yet is well made and solid.</li>
            <li> Its simple to turn on plus the batteries do not have to be replaced very often.</li>
            <li> WAS NOT DEAD.</li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s working just as advertised.  </li>
            <li> I could not read my old scale (I am 82) but can read this without my glasses.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My old one had a 3 to 5 lb swing, constanatly.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the bathroom scales as I needed an upgrade to my old one.  </li>
            <li> If you move it&#x27;s all over the place, so you cannot really see the actual weight.  </li>
            <li> I like it so far.</li>
            <li> I found out my old scale was off by 6 lbs.</li>
            <li> Just received my scale and so far it has been all that I hoped for.  </li>
            <li> It is important for her to weigh everyday.</li>
            <li> I wish I had paid more attention to the negative reviews before purchasing this.  </li>
            <li> I bought this scale because my old one died and my trainer had an Epica</li>
            <li> this product is complete</li>
            <li> scale has exceeded our expectations by far.</li>
            <li> Using it daily is really helping me stay on track of my weight-maintenance goals.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re nearing the end of the range this scale offers you may encounter issues with unreliable weight measuring.</li>
            <li> We are both pretty heavy, my husband over 300 lbs, and it seems to handle the weight well, and is consistent in readings.</li>
            <li> Love this scale,very thin and also very accurate.i would recomend this scale to any one looking to upgrade.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s likely many will have trouble viewing the numbers from atop the scale).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin and nice looking.</li>
            <li> Nice and thin.</li>
            <li> digital display is large and stays a few seconds after I step off, and the square design makes it easy to fit in a corner of my small bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> that it holds the number for three-four seconds before going dark (alllowing  just the right amount of time for \\&quot;contemplation\\&quot;); and lastly, that it is very sleek and high tech looking.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It needs to be placed on a flat surface, and if you move it, you have to recalibrate it, which, based on reading the tea leaves in the four page user manual, means to tap on the main surface briefly to turn on, not step on it, let it measure 0, then let it turn off on its own, and then measure yourself as usual.</li>
            <li> Ultra Thin Digital Scale, Super Sleek Design VERY TRUE...</li>
            <li> It is very thin with a nice blue back light.  </li>
            <li> I have an Electronics Engineering background, and believe they are all made in China (big surprise, right), and they probably all have the same -or</li>
            <li> Only downside about this scale is that I literally have to check my weight 2 times and the second one is always right.</li>
            <li> In case you haven&#x27;t noticed there are multiple scales being sold on Amazon right now by numerous companies.  </li>
            <li> I put the batteries in and and put them in place and was a little concerned because I had received different weights when I first got on them and took the batteries out for a second time , put them in place and waited until the light went out.</li>
            <li> easily in her small bathroom</li>
            <li> no sound when stepping on it, and the weight shows in Big blue numbers and is very easy to read.</li>
            <li> Wipes clean, larger display than expected.</li>
            <li> It is not accurate at all and not user friendly to turn on.</li>
            <li> I like most everything about this scale ... large base &amp; easy to read.</li>
            <li> Got this scale for my husband &amp; I about 10 days ago because we wanted one that was more specific than the usual dial scales.</li>
            <li> It worked for about 2 days (I think) on the first day I weighed 136lbs and same on the second.</li>
            <li> I consistently get the same weight reading if I do not move the scale, but moving it to a different location</li>
            <li> The scale is consistent in its readout; it does not vacillate at all even when you get on multiple times in a row whereas my last scale was in increments of .5 pounds and changed readouts often.</li>
            <li> This is a particular plus for the middle age+ group who shouldn&#x27;t have to run for their glasses to see the readout.</li>
            <li> First reading was 72.8lbs, Second reading was 73, Third reading was 73.4.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the weight it says is higher than what I would like it to be, but that seems more like a user problem than an issue with the scale itself.</li>
            <li> Weighed myself just before going to the doctors for an annual physical and it was exactly the same.</li>
            <li> You can see the numbers without bending down even in low light situations.  </li>
            <li> It is right on when compared to other scales I use as well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend looking for a different scale.</li>
            <li> bought this scale because Consumer Reports had highly recommended several Escali scales (though they didn&#x27;t review this one).</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s only about an inch high</li>
            <li> We had no problems with customer service so overall I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Ranged from low to high SIX lbs.  </li>
            <li> Having owned several inaccurate scales, I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> i recentley started a new weight loss program with a nutritionist and i took the scale with me to compare it to her professional scale and it was only one pound over!</li>
            <li> My new Omega Ultra Slim Digital Bathroom Scale replaces a 6 year old scale that I never trusted.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I would have expected (and appreciated) that maybe it would lock-in the weight so that it can be viewed from off the scale (after-all, with such a large population of obese individuals in the US</li>
            <li> The numbers are very large, well-lit and much easier to read than my previous digital scale.</li>
            <li> This scale is very sleek looking and can easily be hidden discretely in a corner when not in use where it doesn&#x27;t take up much space.</li>
            <li> Extremely easy to set up, and it arrived in only a few days.</li>
            <li> was easy and scale arrived within a few days using standard</li>
            <li> have no complaints and would STRONGLY recommend this product to someone looking for an affordable bathroom scale with all of the extra features of a more expensive unit!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Furthermore I&#x27;m not very heavy, and I babied this scale the 2 years I owned it.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this scale is accurate because two weeks ago I was 7 pounds heavier, so maybe so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this scale is accurate or just flattering.</li>
            <li> We also enjoy the sense-on technology with no more tapping to turn on the scale.  </li>
            <li> I also really like the clear and big digital screen.</li>
            <li> Works well as long as  you have a very even floor</li>
            <li> I have had many digital scales that have failed and not been worth the investment.</li>
            <li> well designed, sturdy (I&#x27;m a relatively big, well, I&#x27;ll say it, stout, man), and the scale has zero problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last, but not least, the price.</li>
            <li> It is very simple though so not hard to figure out.</li>
            <li> one is small enough to be put out of the way easy, is extremely consistent, never varying a single ounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Large numbers with blue back lighting.  </li>
            <li> The platform is large enough to accommodate almost everyone, unless you&#x27;re Charles Barkley, but it&#x27;s so low to the ground, that it might prevent</li>
            <li> The platform is large enough to accommodate almost everyone, unless you&#x27;re Charles Barkley, but it&#x27;s so low to the ground, that it might prevent</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scale takes four AAA batteries, inserted in pairs of two on the bottom side of the device (upper left and upper right corners).</li>
            <li> Gurin Precision Digital Bathroom Scale w/ Extra Large Backlit Display and Auto-On Technology]]</li>
            <li> This scale is low profile and has large digital numbers that records to the 1/10th of a pound or kg.</li>
            <li> You can get off the scale and stand back and your weight is still available to read for a little while.</li>
            <li> Def recommend this over the super expensive scales, its worth it!</li>
            <li> , looks like new, AND, still with the same battery.</li>
            <li> Tried brand new batteries and got the same result.</li>
            <li> Finally decided to spring for a new one.</li>
            <li> We have tried multiple new batteries and just keep getting a &#x27;LO&#x27; message</li>
            <li> Mailed new one back</li>
            <li> pretty to look at, not very useful.</li>
            <li> The red LED readout on my 15 year old digital scale was beginning to dim and new batteries were not helping.  </li>
            <li> Really like this scale because it is so light and thin.</li>
            <li> I only had this scale for a few weeks but for some reason it&#x27;s not reading my accurate weight and know its not reading at all.</li>
            <li> The scale responds immediately when you step on it and only takes a few seconds to accurately read your weight, which it then blinks so</li>
            <li> I like the fact that the batteries are common and easy to replace.</li>
            <li> If it is than I would be grateful to have finally purchased something to last and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Scale is light and thin so it doesn&#x27;t take up much space in our bathroom.</li>
            <li> I appreciated the step on instant weight showing and the 10 second hold while viewing..</li>
            <li> I have tried resetting it and each time the readings are different, not but much, but they are different.</li>
            <li> I weight myself several times in a week, wearing similar clothes, and the weight did not change much.</li>
            <li> This scale is so thin and has such a nice display.   </li>
            <li> THE COLOR OF THE SCALE IS ALSO ELEGANT, IT IS ALSO NOT HEAVY AND THIN.</li>
            <li> Right out of the box you need to put in the provided batteries, set the scale on a hard floor to let it calibrate and its ready to go.</li>
            <li> Major problem is that the scale does not work on a carpet</li>
            <li> Unlike our last digital scale; you can re-weigh yourself repeatedly with exactly the same results.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a scale to tell you your weight, with no other frills, this is what you want.</li>
            <li> Darn I have some major eating to do till I reach my goal</li>
            <li> I upgraded for a higher quality scale which also reads BMI and other weight-factors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I guess most digital scales these days use those little rubber things on their bottoms, which is the same problem I had with my last scale.</li>
            <li> My major issue, though, is that the wait fluctuates.  </li>
            <li> The last two, different brands,  either quit working or got stuck on exactly the same weight for 4 weeks!</li>
            <li> It has a broad platform to stand on, so you don&#x27;t feel like your going to fall off.</li>
            <li> We tried the scale out five times in a row and each time the scale provided a different weight output, sometimes varying by nearly 10lbs!</li>
            <li> I measured multiple times before and after meals, with and without a coat, before and after an output operation, and the numbers were consistently higher when you expected them to be higher, and lower when you expected them to be lower.</li>
            <li> Very well made, classy with metal accent in the middle, it is thin in stature, but not flimsy or cheap.    </li>
            <li> My old mechanical had long since needed to be put out to pasture, and a digital one seemed the next logical step.</li>
            <li> The quality seems high and it is dead on accurate compared to my other scales.</li>
            <li> I finally decided to get a digital scale for my home, and I picked this one based on the price and the overall positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> , is accurate to within half a pound compared to the doctor&#x27;s expensive scale, has a super sleek profile, is extremely easy to read, and costs less than just about anything else on Amazon or eBay.    </li>
            <li> I use it and the older style to check my weight daily as I have been put on a strict diet by medical staff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to slide it on a smooth linoleum floor.</li>
            <li> Nice wide area to stand on, display is large, and unfortunately it&#x27;s accurate.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> Needless to say this scale is useless for tracking weight loss and honestly I can see any kind of application for it other than a toy for the kids that will get old fast.</li>
            <li> I will get two to three different weights, one right after each other.</li>
            <li> is our first digital scale, and it seems pretty accurate, (matches a very expensive balance</li>
            <li> You get a general idea but not something for someone on a diet.  </li>
            <li> Yes the profile is slim and it is easy to step on, but it does not work well if you have a serious balance problem.</li>
            <li> This scale meets all my criteria for simple and sleek design, space saving size, and clear display.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> let it clear its brain and step back on to get a reading.  </li>
            <li> , I get the same reading every time as long as I stand up straight</li>
            <li> Just wish there was a smaller size version available for small bathrooms</li>
            <li> I have a beaten-up, Taylor scale, that&#x27;s about ten, plus, years old.</li>
            <li> , I did not compare its measurements with professional gym and medical scales, so I can&#x27;t tell you how it performs in that</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to constantly adjust it like the old one.  </li>
            <li> not much else to say, it tells you how much force you exert on the surface of the Earth.</li>
            <li> It was solidly packed and complete with instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Replacing old digital scales.  </li>
            <li> We replaced an old scale with this current technology.  </li>
            <li> nearly the same-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the scale for two months and thus far no problems.</li>
            <li> She had an old scale that wasn&#x27;t digital, so I bought her this as one of her birthday gifts.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for several months now and have had no trouble with it at all.  </li>
            <li> I was really surprised to have it a day earlier than stated,  </li>
            <li> Scale does not work properly, The weight number swings wildly then shuts itself off.</li>
            <li> When this arrived (on time) I was surprised at the actual thinness of the unit.  </li>
            <li> Scale is very sleek and what I expected.</li>
            <li> No regrets of my purchase.</li>
            <li> His old scales only went to 250.</li>
            <li> The scale so far works properly.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast and product is just what I expected.</li>
            <li> Just keep it on a level bare floor (No Carpet)</li>
            <li> No fluff, no stuff.</li>
            <li> My weight is the same on this scale as it is on the one at the gym that I frequent</li>
            <li> Remember to put it on a oard of some type or on the bare floor.</li>
            <li> All scales are different, but I was surprised how close this number was to the office&#x27;s number.</li>
            <li> Have only had the product for one month and no problems thus far.  </li>
            <li> We ordered this scale to be used everyday by an 85 year old, and it has worked well for the first month (and longer we hope).  </li>
            <li> I love these scales, they are thin</li>
            <li> It is ultra thin and stepping on it is more like just a forward move instead of a step.  </li>
            <li> The scale was touching the baseboard in my bathroom causing false readings.  </li>
            <li> First weight is basically 2-3 pounds higher than the second weight every time and it never really settles down on anything.  </li>
            <li> The only disappointing issue was that, while it is \\&quot;Ultra Slim\\&quot; as advertised, it does occupy more floor space than my previous scale and requires a bit more attention on my part to keep from stubbing a toe.  </li>
            <li> My wife wanted a new scale but did not need all the extra features such as programing.</li>
            <li> It also refuses to stay on a single number when I double check my current weight, or even within 5 of the first number it gives me.</li>
            <li> It is reasonable in price, easy to set up, and has performed without fail for me each morning.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I read how other reviewers liked the scale so much.  </li>
            <li> Right before sitting down I just tested again around my house and still the same as day I opened.  </li>
            <li> So to further check the scale I went to my local doctor and gym and found the weighing scales matched the older non digital weight.</li>
            <li> This instantly shows the weight, and not like other weigh machines which first process your weight and then display....</li>
            <li> /&gt;The low profile of the scale means that you do have to look down a decent amount to see the display, so if you&#x27;re bigger you may have to step a little, but the number stays so it should be fine.</li>
            <li> Very thin and fits nicely under a chest of drawers</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and seems to be very consistent regarding weight read outs.  </li>
            <li> I needed a scale with a very small height and this fit the bill.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really lock into a weight like other scales, which I like.  </li>
            <li> I had it on a flat rug, never a problem with my old scale.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday and thus far I have lost 4 pounds--just by keeping track of daily of how much I weigh!</li>
            <li> Thin, not very heavy, easy to put away.</li>
            <li> I weigh a little over 300 pounds and fluctuate somewhere around that number and most scales only go up to 300 or less, but this scale can handle 400,</li>
            <li> i got mine to replace a regular scale that is accurate, but is kinda hard to read.  </li>
            <li> The only down side is that, due to the back color of the reading, black on bright blue, I cannot read the number without my glasses on.</li>
            <li> Many other electronic scales I&#x27;ve used will vary a few pounds almost instantly: step on and you&#x27;re X, step off, step back on</li>
            <li> Like some other reviewers, I also sometimes weigh myself twice in a few minutes, and each time I get the same result, so I feel the scale is pretty consistent.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take up much space, the lighting is very sharp and clear to read (even without my glasses on), and I like the way it holds the total weight for a minute after you get off.  </li>
            <li> We came back from a doctor appointment where I was weighed, I got on the Omega and my weight was the same as it was on the doctor&#x27;s professional scale.  </li>
            <li> Considering it was only about 20 minutes old, it was a simple decision to return.</li>
            <li> After several attempts at getting it to display the correct weight, it eventually died completely and wouldn&#x27;t turn back on.</li>
            <li> most of the times i find myself getting annoyed and not even bothering to try to get it to work, because i can find myself spending up to 5 minutes trying to get it to work properly.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Omega Ultra slim digital bathroom scale because I was tired of touching the scale and waiting before you could get on to weigh.  </li>
            <li> My Omega Scale is thin enough that the bathroom door swings  over it without touching it.  </li>
            <li> But the most irritating thing is that it doesn&#x27;t actually ever decide on a weight.  </li>
            <li> Out of the three times I stepped on the scale, it gave me the exact same reading (down to the .1 of a pound).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> interested in the back story, after checking my weight with the Omega I am down 15lbs.</li>
            <li> The only thing that you need to pay attention to is when you first add batteries, set it down where it&#x27;s going to be so that it can callibrate.  </li>
            <li> (I guess people are completely unaware of this fact... especially since this seems to be the #1 complaint about pretty much every scale on Amazon)&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also uses standard batteries, so you won&#x27;t be searching around the grocery store for some strange size when it needs new ones.</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s thin, light, and wide, with a large backlit display.</li>
            <li> screen is Blue,the body of the scale is Black overall with a Silver line in b/w,so it looks exactly as shown in the product image..</li>
            <li> It does exactly what a scale is supposed to do, no more, and no less.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately the batteries died pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Works much better than old scale, and very thin.</li>
            <li> even in a dark room thanks to the backlit display.</li>
            <li> The Sense-on feature makes activating the scale much simpler than some other digital scales.</li>
            <li> I had such an old scale and this was a big change for me going Digital...</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s complete, which doesn&#x27;t take long at all, the numbers start to flash.</li>
            <li> big, white, square and an eye sore (drawing the wrong kind of attention).</li>
            <li> I had just had surgery and spent 2 weeks in a nursing home eating what was supposed to be the normal diabetic diet.  </li>
            <li> The previous scale I had would give different readings if I stepped off and right back on, but this one gives the same reading.  </li>
            <li> Then 5 minutes later i stepped on again and it went down 5 lbs from the first time which means 8 lbs of difference from the second time.</li>
            <li> Turns out, what these two things mean is that after the first time you put it down for use, and every time you lift it to clean or to move it somewhere else, you have to step on briefly, just long enough for the display to read \\&quot;00\\&quot; &amp; not long enough to show a weight, and get right off, leaving it alone until the display goes dark.  </li>
            <li> It is so sleek and thin, there isn&#x27;t much to clean on it and for an 80 year old</li>
            <li> These reviews really helped in narrowing down the scale I chose.</li>
            <li> So after 3 weeks of juicing I noticed that my weight went down fast but thought &amp;#34;hey</li>
            <li> I am confident that it will meet our needs, specifically to monitor Mom&#x27;s water weight gains due to Chronic Heart Failure.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast, very carefully wrapped!</li>
            <li> but it only works on a bare floor and my entire house is carpeted except for the kitchen and bathroom.</li>
            <li> Thin, easy to handle.</li>
            <li> We needed a scale that was lightweight, thin, and setup easily each time we used it since it can&#x27;t lay on our floor all the time (it&#x27;s in a closet).  </li>
            <li> It takes a while to calibrate as it was giving radically different weights in the first few uses.  </li>
            <li> This is a thin scale that doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space and its easily calibrated.</li>
            <li> I like this scale because it&#x27;s thin &amp; can be stored easily just about anywhere.  </li>
            <li> It is thin and easy for elderly people to step on and off.</li>
            <li> Functional easy to read thin scale</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin and easy to move and store.</li>
            <li> I also like that it only takes a few seconds to register my exact weight.  </li>
            <li> In my own feeble effort to shed a few pounds this year, I decided to invest in a decent scale.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i have Congestive Heart Failure and need a true weight weight</li>
            <li> It is thin, weighs in .2 pound increments, and is easy to read  with large black on blue numbering.</li>
            <li> this scale due to all of the great ratings, my experience unfortunately was not positive.</li>
            <li> If you need to be extrememly accurate due to medical reasons, you may want to make a larger investment if you can aford it, but for everyday monitoring, I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> First day of use you need to allow the scale to \\&quot;break in\\&quot; - the first few times I weighed myself or other objects, the weight reading was widely varied.  </li>
            <li> I do see that the weight that shows is in the same area because I also check the scale at work for verification and it normally gives the same weight plus or minus a couple pounds.  </li>
            <li> First thing I was surprised at is how small this product is!</li>
            <li> Black on white is much easier to see.</li>
            <li> The scale is very accurate, showing just what the one in the doctor&#x27;s office does (unfortunately).  </li>
            <li> It comes on with a touch and provides a clear digital read out of how unsuccessful I&#x27;ve been in my attempt to loose weight.  </li>
            <li> We tried recalibrating, putting new batteries in, tapping, stepping on it, pushing the lb kg selection button, but it had simply BROKEN right after we took it out of the packaging.</li>
            <li> This bathroom scale has a large read out display, stays on for a few seconds after stepping off of it.</li>
            <li> The feature that shows the weight for a few seconds after the object is removed, allows for the weighing of large boxes and suitcases.</li>
            <li> now I can see how much I weigh in the dark too!</li>
            <li> Does not need calibration, large digital numbers display stays lit a few seconds after you step off.</li>
            <li> , sometimes her driving is a little dangerous, lol).</li>
            <li> My only quibble is that the black surface shows dust easily, but that is a small thing.</li>
            <li> And in the rare cases when it did work, it drained the battery in about two months with hardly any usage.</li>
            <li> so finding a tough digital scale is a must for accurate weight readings.</li>
            <li> This scale is very thin and seems to be very accurate.  </li>
            <li> (Which is good or bad, depending on the day for me).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not experienced what one reviewer describes about huge inaccuracy swings.  </li>
            <li> My wife and I placed the batteries in the Omega Ultra Thin Digital Bathroom Scale and it worked only ONCE accurately and then IMMEDIATELY STOPPED WORKING.  </li>
            <li> really well  but its not accurate the same day</li>
            <li> I am very unsatisfied with the product because it is not accurate.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the other reviewers are just plain lucky, but for us,  this scale gives different readings throughout the day.</li>
            <li> previous digital scale..even with a new battery would give me several different weights..</li>
            <li> , to summarize, don&#x27;t judge this product based on a few bad reviews, it&#x27;s one of the best weighing machines available out there at this price point and if you buy it you wont be disappointed; Well at least I wasn&#x27;t :-)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t think of negative thing to say about the scale right now.</li>
            <li> one side i guess gives you an accurate reading and the other side tells your at least 20lbs lighter than you reallly are.</li>
            <li> Have purchased several other scales from Homedic, and this far exceeds all of them.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> so you definitely want this on flat solid flooring.</li>
            <li> The readout is large and in a pleasant blue rather than nasty red, and the numbers stay lit several seconds, so you can step off and then read your weight.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the big read out and its lighted, I love the fact it is close to the ground as I have a bad knee and not good at balancing</li>
            <li> So far I have not had to play with it to work correctly like I have had to do with other scales.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> I settled on this one, since all other parameters (precision, etc) looked identical to my old scale.  </li>
            <li> I had the scale for about 6 weeks then suddenly and for no apparent reason it will no longer lock onto a weight.  </li>
            <li> ship by UPS,which is kinda issue for me as only USPS can deliver me in my flat</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s flat enough to slide beneath the chest in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> Half the time it doesn&#x27;t pick up on new batteries that I put in.</li>
            <li> Also, the digital stays lit long enough for you to remove yourself from scale and look.  </li>
            <li> It was the second time in my long time dealiings with Amazon that I had to send something back.</li>
            <li> My husband and I are both fluffy people and getting older.  </li>
            <li> Our scale fits our large feet and small bathroom.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to get and exact number.</li>
            <li> I assumed the batteries were simply running dead, and put a new set of AAA in.</li>
            <li> Granted it may only be one or two pounds, but that can be really discouraging if you trying hard to lose weight only to find out that you have \\&quot;gained\\&quot; 1.4 lbs and lost .8</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is as important as those meters showing number of calories burned as far as a regulated exercise regime is concerned,measuring your weight daily however can be like a double edged sword and if you&#x27;re trying hard and yet not able to reduce weight or if due to your peculiar metabolism characteristics and/or exercise intensity/food/work habits etc for any reasons,if you do not achieve desired outcome,it can prove depressive 4 U..</li>
            <li> So far it seems accurate but having to reset it each time because the scale location changes daily is inconvenient.  </li>
            <li> so it is at least consistent with how it started.  </li>
            <li> The first was for a friend (sounds like a rude gift, doesn&#x27;t it?).</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s position, but I&#x27;m not sure how much this has affected my weight readings.</li>
            <li> It lasted just long enough to prevent me from getting a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The display comes on as soon as I step on it and stays on just long enough to confirm what I saw.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use on carpet, and store flat.</li>
            <li> It stands flat</li>
            <li> Also note to keep it on a level, flat floor at all times.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also quite flat, so I don&#x27;t have to move it when opening and closing the door</li>
            <li> We use this in our bathroom on a flat linoleum, so there is no wobble, or error in use.  </li>
            <li> Then, for no apparent reason, the display began to malfunction.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ultra slim, ultra flat.</li>
            <li> and flat to the ground</li>
            <li> 1/2 of purch price) apparently not exchange</li>
            <li> ultra flat,</li>
            <li> And your weight number stays alight long enough to read it and remember it.</li>
            <li> Please also note that at no time was the reading actually near the reading I recently had a few days earlier at the doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> This product will last a long time....</li>
            <li> Only been using the produce for a week or two, so will have to wait and see how long it holds up.  </li>
            <li> Pretty design and nice lighting, but mine was not accurate :(</li>
            <li> no more tapping, which I think is the main reason weight scales don&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so sensitive that if you just breathe deep, the numbers change a little.  </li>
            <li> My bathroom is very narrow and it takes the whole space between a storage rack and the washing machine unit.  </li>
            <li> I weigh first thing every morning and write down my progress in a little table I printed out.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t last very long....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very flat</li>
            <li> I will give it no stars if possible - a scale that doesn&#x27;t give you an accurate weight is simply useless.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that you have to be real still for it to lock on a weight.</li>
            <li> It took my fifteen year old daughter less than five minutes to get it out of the package set up correctly and working.</li>
            <li> back light will also randomly come on and stay on, which drains the batteries.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is I weigh to much, but that is not the scales fault.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The blue light would randomly come on throughout the night</li>
            <li> When a product fails at its primary purpose, then it doesn&#x27;t deserve a rating above 1 star.  </li>
            <li> It also weighs much less than my old one.</li>
            <li> It is sleek and thin and the late display is nice, but that&#x27;s about it</li>
            <li> As long as you aren&#x27;t weighing yourself obsessively it should last you a long time.  </li>
            <li> I especially like the fact that its wide enough to stand on.</li>
            <li> The Epica scale is SUPER thin, almost to the point</li>
            <li> Sorry to say (since the design, at least, of the appliance is so good)</li>
            <li> Very frustrated with the inconsistency of our old scale and was happy to see that if we stood on the Omega 10 times, the 10 results were all within 0.4 lbs of each other.  </li>
            <li> The readout is very clear and what I like about it is that after weighing and stepping off the scale, the weight stays displayed for a few moments.</li>
            <li> We had a different scale but learned that it was limited to 350 lbs.  </li>
            <li> The scale might be accurate on average, but the wild (+- 4lbs) swings in value each time it&#x27;s used render it night useless.</li>
            <li> At first I was disappointed, as this scale reads 7# higher than my old scale.  </li>
            <li> It is also very thin, sleek, light, and low profile.  </li>
            <li> In my last scale when the permanent battery starting wearing out, it forced me to buy a new scale.</li>
            <li> My scale is resting on a tile floor that probably is not perfectly level, and it works just fine.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t go wrong with these scales, they are sharp, sleek and for some magical reason, I don&#x27;t mind stepping on them.</li>
            <li> and she not only did not the same reading as she got on the other scale</li>
            <li> Sadly, the 2nd time, I had nothing to be excited about..</li>
            <li> I had it in the same spot and for some reason the weight was around 15-20 less than the actual weight, so I no longer rely on it for telling me my proper weight.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have noted, if you step on it three times, you&#x27;re likely to get three different readings.</li>
            <li> You can find other scales with similar features but priced double what this one cost.</li>
            <li> I had expected to not have to replace the scale for at least a couple of years, and I felt especially assured of the quality since the reviews here seemed so positive.</li>
            <li> These are professional grade lens and usually cost upwards of a couple of grand, however even those it&#x27;s not uncommon to have the odd variant which doesn&#x27;t perform as well as it should.</li>
            <li> Upon examination of the device, we found that two of the little rubber feet have metal discs inside that had completely worn through the rubber.</li>
            <li> so we can slide it under the bathroom cabinet (we have a little space under there) and completely hide it.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it takes a little while to make up its mind, but ultimately settles on just about the same weight as the big, old-fashioned, non-digital scale at the gym.  </li>
            <li> [ So far, this has even withstood my toddler trying to weigh herself by bopping up &amp; down on it!</li>
            <li> The scale seemed accurate for about a year, but is now up to 5 pounds off randomly.  </li>
            <li> but unfortunately the weight wasn’t accurate.</li>
            <li> and I was unable to see if the weight ever did stop fluxuating or to get an accurate reading.</li>
            <li> This may sound stupid, but our scale arrived exactly as pictured, with one difference.</li>
            <li> Thanks - we ordered this rather late but still got it in time for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> To be honest, I&#x27;m completely frustrated with the scale and will probably be Freecycling it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m  a heavier guy trying to lose some weight, or at least not gain too much over the holiday season.  </li>
            <li> The scale is therefore useless to me unless I have another person with me that can read the number before the light goes out.</li>
            <li> Price mark is great...not too expensive not too cheap.  </li>
            <li> These scales were larger than I expected.</li>
            <li> bought this scale for several people in a tent in Afghanistan, both civilian and military.  </li>
            <li> B0032TNPOE Eatsmart Precision Plus Digital Bathroom Scale with Ultra Wide Platform and Step-on Technology, 440-Pounds]].  </li>
            <li> Until now, I have been relying on the balance type scales at the gym with varying degrees of accuracy with wide variations on different days.  </li>
            <li> I received the order a day earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Wish I had ordered this a long time ago . .</li>
            <li> Ive had it for a long time now</li>
            <li> Aboslutely would purchase again, though it seems this won&#x27;t need to be replaced for a long time.</li>
            <li> The scale often takes a long time to get a weight, and often it blacks out before a weight is held.  </li>
            <li> After fluctuating wildly not even close to the correct weight, it turns itself off.  </li>
            <li> I am temporarily living in a dump of an apartment and the tiling on my bathroom floor is not completely level(certainly not noticeable by eye).</li>
            <li> The AAA batteries died a few weeks ago, which made sense, given that the scale was about a year old.</li>
            <li> I wish I had purchased this scale a long time ago.</li>
            <li> but I have issues with how long it takes to lock onto a weight.</li>
            <li> The scale stopped working correctly after a few months and finding the contact information (even with Amazon.com assistance) to have the product fixed</li>
            <li> and since I am on a long run&lt;br</li>
            <li> and thats how long it took.</li>
            <li> The Omega Ultra Thin Digital Bathroom Scale was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> My only minor gripe is that the scale is rather wide</li>
            <li> After using an analog scale for so long (that always had to be calibrated), I finally broke down and ordered a digital one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tough slim, and you just step right on.</li>
            <li> After having if for only 2 months it stopped working, the numbers wouldn&#x27;t settle down to any specific weight.  </li>
            <li> The weight it shows is within very little margin from my previous scale, and it is consistent.</li>
            <li> Ordered the product, received it late, only the scale was in the book(no wrapping no instructions), scale was giving incorrect weight, bought new batteries and was still giving incorrect weight in lbs(I</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was less than pleased with the scale.  </li>
            <li> It always shows my weight about 5 pounds less than my doctor&#x27;s scale (multiple different doctors).</li>
            <li> Our previous digital bathroom scale rounded weight up to the nearest 1/2 pound -- this scale gives the actual tenth which we like.  </li>
            <li> very thin and light scales.</li>
            <li> It is very thin and light.</li>
            <li> The digital read out is sharp and the scale does all the work.</li>
            <li> other digital scales we have bought</li>
            <li> none of that \\&quot;tap-and-wait\\&quot; stuff that other digital scales have.    </li>
            <li> , it gave me 2 different readings within 2 minutes of each other.  </li>
            <li> No setting anything -- you don&#x27;t even have to tap it with your foot as with other standard scales.  </li>
            <li> I do believe I am done ordering anything other than an occasional book from Amazon.</li>
            <li> AND FOR ME TO SEND THE OTHER ONE BACK</li>
            <li> Would definitely buy again, and would consider other products by this manufacturer with no hesitation.</li>
            <li> I like the digital display but not the sharp edges.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other digital scales, no tapping is required.  </li>
            <li> My assumption is that the slim design of this device require an especially level surface compared to other bathroom scales.</li>
            <li> The only problem I had was that the scale was a little larger than I had anticipated.  </li>
            <li> Only wish it was a little smaller, like 10x10</li>
            <li> I looked at a number of different ones, and chose this Omega Bathroom Scale, mainly due to others&#x27; reviews.</li>
            <li> I had a tough time figuring out if the haters on the other ones were real and those scales were garbage, or if they were also paid off (someone mentioned that reviewers get paid on elance - for good and bad</li>
            <li> I expected the usual high quality, and I have been duped.</li>
            <li> It also uses AAA batteries which we expect to last longer that the flat battery used in our previous scale.  </li>
            <li> Currently when I weigh myself repeatedly the reading will swing within a very wide range- 10 to 15 pounds or so.  </li>
            <li> and as a disclaimer, I use this as a rule of thumb only if around 80 - 90% of reviews are positive; On the other hand if most reviews are negative, its  just a bad product!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this scale is it is way too truthful and refuses to lie after I&#x27;ve been bad.</li>
            <li> But, in the last few months, it has gotten quirky.  </li>
            <li> We received the item earlier than expected from the seller and carefully packaged.</li>
            <li> The delivery time was a little slow but the vendors estimate was about right.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before purchasing and it does not live up to the hype.  </li>
            <li> Long story short, this scale does not pass the standard simple scale test: place on hard floor, step on, weigh yourself, step off, repeat 3 times after rotating the scale 90 degrees to one side.</li>
            <li> Right out of the box, you just establish a firm footing for it on a hard surface, then step on it, and you&#x27;re all set.</li>
            <li> Four Industrial brand single use AAA batteries were included in the box.</li>
            <li> I bought this scale about a month ago, and use it since that almost every single day.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to know my current weight, plain and simple.</li>
            <li> Scale will not settle on a single weight and will bounce around for 2 minutes in a range of 20+ lbs before it just shuts off.</li>
            <li> The display is large, clear and backlit, and it is just \\&quot;step-on\\&quot; ready; no need for annoying tapping and then waiting.   </li>
            <li> However, I soon realized the extra weight is usually due to the extra layer of clothing plus the paraphernalia (wallets/cell phones etc) which one typically carries.</li>
            <li> This was a complete waste of money!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly 20mm thin, and sits sturdy on its four rubber legs.  </li>
            <li> I look at the read-out (can&#x27;t resist) and suddenly loose my &#x27;urge&#x27; for sweets.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;its time to loose some fat baby...</li>
            <li> go down when losing weight and stay the same when no changes.</li>
            <li> I stepped on the scale it read some numbers, went up and down a bit and started blinking signaling this is the final weight.</li>
            <li> The reading goes up and down, even when I stand as still as possible.</li>
            <li> is it doesn&#x27;t lock in your final weight the numbers go up and down if you move at all</li>
            <li> its been helpful figuring out my pack weight down to .2 lbs for a hiking trip, as well as my personal weight.</li>
            <li> Down side is that it doesn&#x27;t store numbers and show you the last reading</li>
            <li> It takes me longer to balance my self well enough that I can look down at the weight reading than the reading stays illuminated.</li>
            <li> My old scale just plain wore out and, after reading other reviews, I decided to give this one a try.</li>
            <li> I was confused when it only came with half the batteries needed for it but other than that the directions for putting them in and turning it on are right there</li>
            <li> But these scales at this point not only tell me what I want to hear, but they are very sharp and stream line as well.  </li>
            <li> Even though it doesn&#x27;t work quite as expected, one gets the feeling it will continue to work for a very long time.</li>
            <li> The batteries are rated to last a year, if you weigh yourself less than 3 times a day.</li>
            <li> Black numbers on a blue backlit display.    </li>
            <li> two black pads you see in the picture are the ones that measure your weight, each measuring half the weight of your body left and left, and then adding them to give you your weight.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first reading will always be wrong if you do the no-tap, but if you try it again several times, it will always give the \\&quot;true\\&quot; reading (which thankfully for me is not 5 lbs fatter!).</li>
            <li> This scale worked well while it lasted, but only lasted a year and a half.  </li>
            <li> as with our previous digital scales.  </li>
            <li> yesterday all of the sudden it weighed about fifty pounds less than what I had the day before.</li>
            <li> When I went to my doctors appointment, I  was 11 lbs less than the scale told me that same morning.</li>
            <li> This is the identical scale that I found under a big name brand for half the price.</li>
            <li> No need to &amp;#34;pre-cal&amp;#34; with an initial step like my previous one</li>
            <li> Also, I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see if the battery life is reasonable, but I&#x27;ll report back if battery life turns out to be disappointingly short.&lt;br</li>
            <li> All you need to do is put in the batteries (that come with it) and set it down on a flat surface</li>
            <li> So if you do happen to be unfortunate enough to end up with a faulty version, just send it back to Amazon and order a new one :</li>
            <li> Only issue I have is that our bathroom is quite small and the Scale manual says to store the scale flat on the floor.  </li>
            <li> This scale was both of those as well as thin and smart looking.</li>
            <li> I have to constantly move it a little bit and then tap turn</li>
            <li> With some other digital scales that I&#x27;ve used in the past you have to step on to turn the scale on and then step off for the scale to zero before you can step back on again to get your weight.</li>
            <li> it was not very consistent with the weight</li>
            <li> /&gt;But for the price the scale is inexpensive and it&#x27;ll give you at least 2 years of faithful weighing service 4-5 pounds off until it dies suddenly in the middle of the night.</li>
            <li> how long I wait until it times out and goes dark.  </li>
            <li> It is ultra slim yet feels heavy and solid.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done various approaches - weighing everyday to weighing-stepping-off-for-a-couple-minutes-weighing-again.  </li>
            <li> The scale was every thing I expected.</li>
            <li> It also arrived faster than expected on the delivery date when I placed my order.</li>
            <li> The scale feels solid and substantial (in spite of being ultra-thin) - not cheap or flimsey.      </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wide so it feels sturdy.  </li>
            <li> Weight seems to be roughly correct.  </li>
            <li> Of course, performance over time is an unknown.</li>
            <li> did I notice the problem, the four rubber feet it uses to measure were all chewed up and off center.  </li>
            <li> Trying to be as centered as possible doesn&#x27;t seem to help either, because I still noticed 5-10 pound differences not even a few seconds apart each weigh in.</li>
            <li> Working as expected.</li>
            <li> so now it&#x27;s absolutely no use to us at all.</li>
            <li> i stopped using the scale for a few months and finally decided to work on my weight loss.</li>
            <li> I followed the calibration instructions carefully and even removed the batteries to reset</li>
            <li> Item was as expected.</li>
            <li> I check again a few minutes later to confirm my weight, it tells me I&#x27;m 5-7 pounds lighter or heavier.</li>
            <li> I have had the scale for only a few weeks</li>
            <li> , sometimes it takes 7 tries to even get it to calculate a weight.</li>
            <li> Not much flourish to that review.</li>
            <li> EXCEPT to say that the no-tap feature does not really work.</li>
            <li> the scale does not fit in my tiny bathroom</li>
            <li> I stepped on it a few times and got different weights</li>
            <li> Now, I get two different readings everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a few months, so we&#x27;ll see how well it holds up over time.</li>
            <li> The difference is just a few ounces or once about a pound, so I don&#x27;t see it as a big problem.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I will step on, weigh myself, step off, wait a bit, and then step back on again and my weight changes by a few pounds.  </li>
            <li> The scale works as expected.</li>
            <li> There is really no setup or adjustment.  </li>
            <li> I still recommend the scale, but it should not be used where it might get wet.</li>
            <li> I would like to see it last longer than a few years.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, this thing gives you a different weight everytime you step on it...</li>
            <li> It is a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I bought it, it was delivered when I expected, I put the batteries in it, and it works.</li>
            <li> it was wrapped carefully and we appreciated&lt;br /&gt;everything about this order....</li>
            <li> The order arrived on the expected date.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t really have any problems seeing the numbers from on the scale, it&#x27;s sort of frustrating that the numbers bounce around.  </li>
            <li> Just get on and wet weighed.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve only been using it a few months</li>
            <li> I have specific needs, and did NOT want a glass scale, nor did I want it to be heavy or bulky.</li>
            <li> the only turn off was that the product description said it would come with batteries, which it did, but they were dead.</li>
            <li> It is thin but feels very sturdy.</li>
            <li> The readings are not accurate at all and no two readings are ever the same.</li>
            <li> It is still a decent bathroom scale, but just be a little wary if you only use it once in a short period to weigh yourself.</li>
            <li> This scale has never been accurate, and the worst part about it; a very slight lean to the left or the right makes your weight change</li>
            <li> We had other digital scales that were not accurate or did not work all the time.  </li>
            <li> My kitchen scale is too small for something large but lightweight - too hard to get a reading.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the scale works great......  shows my weight gain in big numbers...  :(</li>
            <li> I never receive random 5lb high (or low) weigh-ins with this product.</li>
            <li> I know this is a cheap scale, i can deal with the difference of a pound or less but 8 is a disappointment</li>
            <li> This can be positioned so that he can balance himself between the commode and the sink, which makes him feel safer, and it is slim enough that he has less trouble stepping up onto it.</li>
            <li> I have a small bathroom so it does take up a bit of space, but I wouldn&#x27;t want it to be any smaller.</li>
            <li> stumbling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I&#x27;m tickled pink!  </li>
            <li> stumbling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I&#x27;m tickled pink!  </li>
            <li> from each other.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need a BMI measurement or other bells and whistles.  </li>
            <li> It also correlated with other factors (how belts and pants feel when gaining/losing weight, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I guess due to the fact that I have not bought a scale in forever, I had no idea, and had not read in any review, that this scale is not supposed to be used on carpet.</li>
            <li> batteries!Don&#x27;t even bother looking at other scales.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the process of returning this scale because I was scared when I saw that I was 11lbs heavier than I expected to be when I tried it out!</li>
            <li> I would recommend looking at other scales before buying this one.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it took a while to actually calibrate.    </li>
            <li> Never seen that in other scales.</li>
            <li> I should have listened to the other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> or kilos or some other unit.</li>
            <li> that some other scales offered...</li>
            <li> Other times, it won&#x27;t turn on at all until I fiddle with it.</li>
            <li> And I do agree with the other \\&quot;bad\\&quot; reviews talking about the variable weight shown if you change your feet position on the scale.</li>
            <li> I was definitely under the 400 pound limit, so I&#x27;m not sure what caused the issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After that the scale became unusable.</li>
            <li> I bought these scales to measure my weight for an extreme course of exercise and nutrition plan.  </li>
            <li> and it is not bulky like other scales.</li>
            <li> a total waste of my money!</li>
            <li> In my mind after looking at other products around</li>
            <li> This scale has lived up to the other reviews I read on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> In fact if you do have some time try reading some of the reviews on Canon L series lens (or equivalent ones from Nikon or any other brand).</li>
            <li> know this because we have 2 other scales in the house and bought this scale to be a bathroom scale).</li>
            <li> other than that</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small enough to stash away on a shelf and you don&#x27;t have to worry about screwing it up every time you move it.</li>
            <li> Some other scales I&#x27;ve used fluctuate in their results.</li>
            <li> You do not need to tap it like some other scales.</li>
            <li> I will need to step on the other scale and lose FOUR pounds</li>
            <li> After buying like 4 scales during the past year, finally I found one that works without the tapping.</li>
            <li> It also came sooner than expected!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get &#x27;stuck&#x27; on one weight as other scales do.  </li>
            <li> The build quality feels extremely sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In other words, don&#x27;t count on 1 year advertised warranty.</li>
            <li> It has to be a material other than glass.  </li>
            <li> other than that it does what i need it to do.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Are these reviewers THAT lazy that they can&#x27;t step on and back off again?  </li>
            <li> We have tried to get a reading out of it several different ways and are unable to get a reading at all besides the constant changing of numbers.</li>
            <li> I was weighed about two weeks ago at the doctor&#x27;s on a digital scale, and this little scale measured me within a few pounds of that</li>
            <li> The price was roughly $2.50 less but the capacity and style was what got me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I especially like the blue lighted up area behind the numbers, so</li>
            <li> would inevitably lead to a broken scale and mostly likely tears and blood.  </li>
            <li> it was always difficult to get it balanced right, and with a grandson&#x27;s little fingers it kept getting changed on me.  </li>
            <li> everytime you step on it, thus very frustrating since you won&#x27;t know your exact weight.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not particularly fond of the rubber fixtures and the little magnet things on the bottom.</li>
            <li> Like several other have complained, readings jump around and are inconsistent.</li>
            <li> All of those being issues commonly noted with other digital scales.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite stable and is less fussy about where I place it than the other scales I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> This scale gives me a weight that is about 3 or 4 pounds less than the two other scales in my house.</li>
            <li> Arrived as promised, ultra-thin design, no glass like other scales so less breakable.</li>
            <li> But you have to use it on hard floor, and you have to stay still for two seconds for it to work properly.</li>
            <li> The scale MUST be on a hard, solid, EVEN floor.</li>
            <li> If you move it every time you use it, you MUST not only put it on a hard, level surface, you must use your forefoot to apply pressure to put some weight on the scale to turn it on, take your foot off, and wait for the scale to turn itself off.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why putting the scale on a hard surface vs carpet makes a big difference, but carpet makes it inaccurate by over 100 pounds.</li>
            <li> Not worth your money</li>
            <li> and then I believe it is taking longer to average all the numbers that were skipping around.   </li>
            <li> Even in the dark, I can see the screen.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is it never seems to \\&quot;lock-on\\&quot; to your weight.</li>
            <li> Not made in USA is was a big negative.</li>
            <li> Definitely holds up to at least 200lbs.  </li>
            <li> Followed the instructions to set it up properly &amp; still didn&#x27;t work in the least.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that it doesn&#x27;t lie about your weight.</li>
            <li> (sometimes it varies like a pound or two if I step too wide or too narrow on the scale).</li>
            <li> I needed to replace an old scale that was broken, so I chose this model.</li>
            <li> In fact got it wet assumed it dead and immediately ordered another&lt;br /&gt;one .IT</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that it seems to take a little longer than other scales to determine the weight.  </li>
            <li> But I found out that this scale is not very accurate, it fluctuates quite a bit even when you&#x27;re standing</li>
            <li> Just not very accurate.  </li>
            <li> My mother weighs every week after a Weight Watchers meeting on a typical physicians&#x27; scale and she has weighed directly afterwards on the OMEGA ULTRA THIN BATHROOM SCALE and the weight is correct down to ounces.  </li>
            <li> This product functions well and will give you an average weight, but the one that I ordered will not settle on a weight and continues to fluctuate even though it is on a hard flat surface.  </li>
            <li> Goes up and down.</li>
            <li> This product does not work, it will break down after 1 week of use.</li>
            <li> This scale reads down to a tenth of a pound</li>
            <li> I hold the dog and weigh, then step off, put the dog down and weigh again.</li>
            <li> I look down as I weigh</li>
            <li> Sometimes, looking down on scales moves the display numbers.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even look down till I step off.  </li>
            <li> I have about 20 seconds of pride or misery depending on whether I am up or down.  </li>
            <li> It fluctuates up and down between a 4 pound range, and I patiently wait, as still as I can, not even breathing, but it never decides on a number.  </li>
            <li> 30 bucks down the drain</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;ounces, which our other one didn&#x27;t, so for any of you out there who, like me, can sometimes obsess just a little about&lt;</li>
            <li> I was a little intimidated to buy a scale but after reading other reviews, ended up picking this one.</li>
            <li> I mean you could get on and the scale would read 160, and then a minute later read 180.</li>
            <li> This affords an extra 10 seconds to berate yourself for failure, or maybe to bask in the victory of dropping a couple of pounds.</li>
            <li> It does need to be placed on a hard flat surface for accuracy.</li>
            <li> I have the scale on a flat, hard floor, so I cannot speak to how it works on carpet.</li>
            <li> Very thin and very compact.  </li>
            <li> The scale is very thin and modern in appearance.</li>
            <li> The scale is really very thin and working properly very well.</li>
            <li> Very thin so it doesn&#x27;t take much room.</li>
            <li> This scale was purchased to replace one that read 6 lbs too heavy, along with other failing functions on it ie bodyfat test, etc.</li>
            <li> Our other scale batteries always went dead, it had 1 button battery.</li>
            <li> My package came quickly, no complaints over here.</li>
            <li> I need simple, life is complicated enough I don&#x27;t want to have to get a master&#x27;s degree to figure out how to operate my bathroom</li>
            <li> No need to tap the corner like my previous scale, which I found rather annoying.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Initially I was skeptical about the product but after using it, I would definitely recommend to others..!</li>
            <li> When it started giving me odd readings, I decided to retire it to the garbage bin and bought the Omega to take its place.   </li>
            <li> but still a slight pain.</li>
            <li> 0.2 pounds difference from previous reading.</li>
            <li> Yes mine just stopped working after 2 and a half months, we did everything, change batteries, reset, remove from bathroom to check if it was humidity, but no use.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s permanent streaks and blobs all over the black surface.</li>
            <li> and there was less than .5 pounds difference between the two scales.</li>
            <li> Got this scale after reading some of the previous reveiws.</li>
            <li> Usually the first one is wrong.  </li>
            <li> each time I stand on it, it gives you a different reading, its the worst, most unaccurate scale I have ever had</li>
            <li> Slim, Black &amp; LED Backlight &amp; Automatic .</li>
            <li> that is black...</li>
            <li> this scale has been unreliable for about half the time I&#x27;ve owned it.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve had it for less than a month and have had to change the batteries 3 times.</li>
            <li> When I weighed myself I noticed I was 10 pounds lighter than I was when I came from the doctor the previous day before getting the scale.</li>
            <li> so the likelihood of accidental breakage is less.  </li>
            <li> Because once you move it even slightly, the scale needs to be calibrated.</li>
            <li> I have purchased scales in the past from Frontgate, which were not cheap, but sad to say that they don&#x27;t last very long, but from what I have read about these scales, they last for years.  </li>
            <li> On Technology definitely NOT TRUE at all...</li>
            <li> The only negative is the instructions, which are in really poor English.</li>
            <li> I like that the display stays on for a few seconds; this gives us time to jot down the weight if desired.  </li>
            <li> Just what the doctor ordered...lightweight, takes up very little space...easy to read, unfortunately it says I weigh too much...</li>
            <li> My previous scale was heavy, bulky and took up a lot of room.  </li>
            <li> guess you get what you pay for, cheaply made crap that breaks down too soon and ends up as landfill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have purchased other scales in the past and have ended up returning them.  </li>
            <li> I was so over purchasing the sales that you usually stub your toe on due to their design.</li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t start lying soon I may have to call in Guido to provide a little persuasion.  </li>
            <li> It may be a little off by +/-</li>
            <li> It lights up and the weight stays on the scale for a little while after you step on it.</li>
            <li> Typography on the front is a little meh, but for the price, who can complain?</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want anything glass in my bathroom because I do not want glass around little kids, and this scale is made of metal and plastic.</li>
            <li> you can &amp;#34;celebrate&amp;#34; those little triumphs.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going on a diet or even a little concerned about your weight and your hefty like me, these are your scales.  </li>
            <li> is a little bit lacking in a scale.</li>
            <li> One of mine has ripped somehow and the little magnet slides out sometimes.</li>
            <li> I also use this to weigh my little ones (4 and 1 yrs) and document their weight gain.  </li>
            <li> It changes every time you shift a little on your feet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the Omega Ultra Slim scale for a little over a month now.</li>
            <li> this one is a little off sometimes, if you stand a little to the side.</li>
            <li> Just a little annoyance.</li>
            <li> , I mean a 25-100 lb difference every single time I stepped on it).</li>
            <li> I have also noted that the reading tends to be off by a little (0.1-0.2 Kg) if you don&#x27;t use the scale for a few days.</li>
            <li> The readout is a little hard to see in the dark, so forget about checking your weight in the dark.</li>
            <li> Such a disappointment after only a year of service!</li>
            <li> just have some trouble getting it to lock in</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> This thing changes everyday.</li>
            <li> Omega Ultra Thin Digital Bathroom Scale, 400 lb.</li>
            <li> within a few minutes.   </li>
            <li> Omega Ultra Thin Digital Bathroom Scale, 400 lb.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks now.  </li>
            <li> ; it&#x27;s thin enough to stash away if not used every day.</li>
            <li> Got it a few days after I was weighed at the doctor&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I step off, give it a few minutes then</li>
            <li> No \\&quot;tapping\\&quot; and it doesn&#x27;t get confused and try to give you your last weight.</li>
            <li> I bought the Omega Ultra Thin Digital on a whim, and everyone in the house loves it.  </li>
            <li> it holds the reading for a few seconds after you step off it.</li>
            <li> I had it for a few years</li>
            <li> What a waste of money...</li>
            <li> For a few days it worked well</li>
            <li> Had scale a few weeks  </li>
            <li> Another problem is that sometimes the scale will turn off not even a few seconds of me being on it, forcing me to weigh myself</li>
            <li> You step on, it continuously reads the weight until the weight is not changing, flashes the weight on the screen a few times and stays on for a few seconds once you&#x27;ve gotten off.</li>
            <li> There were few instances I noticed that the weight shows had +/-</li>
            <li> Since that time, i usually weigh twice and average the two readings.  </li>
            <li> The discrepancy can be a few ounces up to 3-4 pounds.</li>
            <li> You can then step off and the reading will remain on the display for a few seconds so you can still see it.</li>
            <li> Omega Ultra Thin Digital Bathroom Scale, 400 lb.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I am confused with these digital scales.</li>
            <li> Arrived within a few days, no damage done to the box in any way.</li>
            <li> Some bathrooms have uneven tiles or whatnot.  </li>
            <li> Tends to be a few pounds off but it works.</li>
            <li> There are a few others who have noted this problem as well.  </li>
            <li> but I have not confirmed the accuracy of the measurements.</li>
            <li> I received the scale a few months ago.  </li>
            <li> that I&#x27;ve had a few months</li>
            <li> this producted seemed to work for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> It dropped dead 6 months into it&#x27;s being in use.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes It shows my weight increased by 1 lbs in a day and next day decreased by 1 lbs.</li>
            <li> Just weigh yourself on these scales, step off for a few seconds, then weigh again.  </li>
            <li> The problem isn&#x27;t an uneven surface or incorrect weight placement as this had been the problem for all of my family</li>
            <li> If you do diet, don&#x27;t weigh everyday.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few months since I purchased this scale.</li>
            <li> The scale is really thin and so simple to use.</li>
            <li> They do instruct you to hold on to the wall if you have trouble staying still.</li>
            <li> Instead of telling my weight, it became dead weight in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now</li>
            <li> waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> If you try to weigh yourself on a rug or an uneven tile floor</li>
            <li> I have grown tired of scales that give inconsistent readings, varying 1-4 pounds at various weights.</li>
            <li> One of the few items purchased on Amazon that I&#x27;ve had to return.</li>
            <li> Weight is dead on everytime.</li>
            <li> But there are a few things you must consider.</li>
            <li> It goes through a few preliminary numbers and in a couple of seconds it settles on my weight.  </li>
            <li> It then blinks a few times with the weight and then displays the weight for a few seconds after I step off the scale.  </li>
            <li> What I did not appreciate was the fact the batteries included were already dead.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not reliable and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> We received the scale in just a few days...</li>
            <li> Its a waste of money don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are a few issues, though....</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace a dead one.</li>
            <li> buy this scale if you&#x27;ll just need to replace it in a few months.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I would weigh myself a few minutes apart and the weight would change by up to 5 lbs.</li>
            <li> just step on and step off, the display will even leave the number of your weight up for another few seconds.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a few months ago.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s been a  few months</li>
            <li> Its a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I had trouble after charging</li>
            <li> It was waste of MY MONEY.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday sometimes two or three times a day.</li>
            <li> this scale does not accurately take your weight.</li>
            <li> It is not accurate.</li>
            <li> This scale is not accurate.  </li>
            <li> not accurate and no way to zero</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like having my bathroom scale in plain sight, so the ability to hide it behind a door is a definite plus.  </li>
            <li> Maybe the reviews that complained of it being inaccurate weren&#x27;t using it on a hard, flat surface?</li>
            <li> It took me a long time to get around to writing this review, and I should&#x27;ve returned it when I could, but seriously, the weight fluctuates up to 10 pounds (usually around 5-7 lbs.).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind leaving it out in plain view in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> - Not easy to use&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I also like that it is small, compact, and also holds your weight for a little longer after you step off, on its screen so you can get a look in case you haven&#x27;t seen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned heavy scales in the past.</li>
            <li> I like that it takes AAA batteries instead of the weird flat ones which are expensive and caused me all kinds of problems with my old scale.</li>
            <li> I am not sure where I read that it did, but apparently I was wrong, so that is my mistake.</li>
            <li> , it takes multiple tries stepping on and off it to get the numbers to stop going crazy and settle on a weight.</li>
            <li> Well, by \\&quot;fine\\&quot; I mean the weight fluctuates a pound or two up and down while you are trying to read it.</li>
            <li> This digital scale is dumb!</li>
            <li> Since its accuracy is not good , all other things like shape , weight don&#x27;t matter anymore.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scale failed due to my daughter getting on to it weigh while soaking wet.</li>
            <li> It is slim and takes up very little space in the closet.</li>
            <li> Being ultra slim, it takes up very little space.</li>
            <li> That just leaves my kitchen, and a very little spot in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> just so I could post it here and people could see it clearly shows the 10lb weight and the scale reads crazy numbers.</li>
            <li> so I headed to Amazon like usual.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it is variable by several lbs.  </li>
            <li> As is usually the case, Amazon had it cheapest.  </li>
            <li> The scale is also small and discrete</li>
            <li> Still not sure if I&#x27;ll keep it.</li>
            <li> I can not tell how to contact the company directly about the problem and being out of the country it is inconvenient to just order another one from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I received the omega scale last week and I&#x27;m having a difficult time calibrating it.</li>
            <li> Small problem</li>
            <li> was skeptical about the accuracy, so I did the standard dumbell test with 2x20lb, 2x10lb and 2x8lb weights.</li>
            <li> How difficult is it to make a simple weighing machine and how can u make machines which would just stop working one day.</li>
            <li> I tried it as soon as I put in the batteries, in the usual way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After going through a few others on here.. the scale is almost secondary.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if those are off or it is this.</li>
            <li> aluminum is pone to denting if something like a small bottle or can falls on it.</li>
            <li> Small glitch tho.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for anyone who is looking for seen but unseen in a small bathroom.</li>
            <li> No more tapping the scale to wake it up.  </li>
            <li> It stay on \\&quot;00\\&quot; reading on the screen, not sure if this product are getting any quality check before shipping.</li>
            <li> At least i know i am within a few pounds 1-3 pounds of what i weigh in at.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even tried stepping on and off while carrying small items and it does detect the weight difference.</li>
            <li> I checked mine against the doctor&#x27;s scale as well as picking up small weights to see if it regerstered the change.</li>
            <li> It is a small bathroom so there is no room for a scale in there.&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re too lazy, forget it.</li>
            <li> You just step on, hold still for a few seconds, and voila!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure this has held up over time.</li>
            <li> No more \\&quot;tapping\\&quot; or turning it on, just step on</li>
            <li> but alot I have bought in past max weight is 300</li>
            <li> Since I have a small bathroom I have no place for scale (stored in cabinet)</li>
            <li> The instructions are in translated English, so they are difficult to understand.</li>
            <li> Used for the past three years.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s small and fits well into our bathroom.</li>
            <li> I ordered this scale in hopes of having something sleek and small for my bathroom.</li>
            <li> Every time I weigh myself its off 1-3 lbs but atleast its not more....</li>
            <li> I have small children and a glass scale</li>
            <li> This scale failed the last test, accuracy.  </li>
            <li> Ill step on the scale and it wont give me a final number it will just shut off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several digital scales in the past and all of them disappointed me in some way.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to keep track of my weight loss through dieting and exercise, and received it this past</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this is an issue that exists within lower ranges of the scale, as I had someone else test it</li>
            <li> and i hate doing it, since you have to get the timing right and</li>
            <li> Very thin so not a big tripping hazard.</li>
            <li> works like it is supposed to do and, because it is very thin, it pass below the door when I open it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a simple scale and it&#x27;s very thin which I like.</li>
            <li> The instructions are in very broken english, and contradict themselves.  </li>
            <li> We did have to learn how to reset the -zero- weight by reading the enclosed papers as we are unable to store it flat.</li>
            <li> I chose the less expensive one, the Omega Ultra Thin Digital Bathroom Scale.  </li>
            <li> What a infuriating experience &amp; a total waste of my time and money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit annoying that it has to be calibrated every time it&#x27;s moved, but that&#x27;s really simple, so it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li> She bad trouble reading her old scale....</li>
            <li> It was so disappointing and such a waste of my money</li>
            <li> We have very little hard flooring in our senior apartment</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve gotten past the confusing set up instructions</li>
            <li> At first I chocked it up to changes in one&#x27;s body weight over the day, but have now realized that this a worthless scale.</li>
            <li> At least it covers my chipped tile in the bathroom. :-/</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to think about this scale, bend down to operate or do anything unnecessary.  </li>
            <li> According to this one, I lost over 35 pounds so far - which is impossible.</li>
            <li> I guess a year and half is not too bad, but we will try some thing else next.</li>
            <li> And it changes depending on which hard floor space</li>
            <li> so it can not be used in my carpeted bedroom and must be placed on a hard surface like the tile in a bathroom.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to find a place where she can use her walker to get on the scale, but then not have it exposed when she rides her power chair (at 86</li>
            <li> When I step on the readings are all over the place, and that is while using on a hard wood floor.</li>
            <li> I HAD A HARD TIME FINDING WHERE I COULD GET ANY INFORMATION</li>
            <li> So you&#x27;ve got to put it in a perfectly hard, level spot, or move it to one when you use it.</li>
            <li> &amp; I didn&#x27;t trust the readings anymore, &amp; it was hard to read the numbers.</li>
            <li> not worth the hassle to try to return it!!!</li>
            <li> I used to have a cheaper Taylor scale that failed on me for unknown reasons after about 6 months.</li>
            <li> It arrived a day late.</li>
            <li> This scale is really wonky.  </li>
            <li> I can now see why there was some negative comments about the accuracy of the scale.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s too late to return it.</li>
            <li> So I went on Amazon to read the reviews hoping I would find out why this was happening and ironically in the 10th review I read , which was a highly negative one</li>
            <li> Even though I feel that this scale must be at least 50 lbs.</li>
            <li> My only disappointment is I can&#x27;t also use them to weigh my cats or packages (unless I weigh them with me) because of the raised centre section.</li>
            <li> To maintain my &amp;#34;obsessive / compulsive&amp;#34; habits, which do work (albeit slowly), I thought I should get a scale for traveling.  </li>
            <li> This scale takes up very little space on my floor!</li>
            <li> I mean if I re do my weight immediately it doesn&#x27;t fluctuate and hoping on with objects does change the reading accordingly.</li>
            <li> Not much more you can ask for!</li>
            <li> I mean, it&#x27;s a scale.</li>
            <li> I mean</li>
            <li> if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> It is very thin compared to other models I&#x27;ve seen over the years.</li>
            <li> an average, the weight reading is wrong by +/-</li>
            <li> Edit review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having this product for several months, for whatever reason it has gotten very difficult to weigh myself.</li>
            <li> As much as I hate too, I will be looking for a new scale.</li>
            <li> I had a regular scale, but it was impossible to read.</li>
            <li> but dint take them seriously.</li>
            <li> this is a terrible product right out of the box it did not work for me at all even after trying to calibrate it at least a dozen times</li>
            <li> The bad news is that you are just as likely to gain 3 pounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With some trial and error, you&#x27;ll figure it out, but if bad English makes you weary of products then you might look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, a few months into owning the scale it would randomly switch from lbs to kg, ect.</li>
            <li> Not a good return on my investment.  </li>
            <li> because it&#x27;s one step (not that it&#x27;s difficult to use those, just an annoyance for impatient people).</li>
            <li> well, I *could* be happier if it would just show lower numbers, but I can hardly blame the scale for that!</li>
            <li> I have no other words to write and it is annoying that you require it.</li>
            <li> Otherwise you&#x27;re in for a rude awakening when you hop on an uncallibrated scale!</li>
            <li> You can just stick this anywhere upright, it&#x27;s about 1/2-3/4 inch thick!  </li>
            <li> So I was very disappointed when the scale started being very erratic and varying by about 7 pounds during a weighing before settling on a weight that I know is way off.</li>
            <li> and unfortunately all the fake reviews and bribed reviews made it near impossible to figure out what to</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of time reading reviews of scales before deciding on this one - it seems like every product has at least one very unhappy customer.</li>
            <li> weight is locked in, for approximately 10 seconds, after weighing.  </li>
            <li> But in spite of being so thin, it appears sturdy and well made.  </li>
            <li> But in spite of being so thin, it appears sturdy and well made.  </li>
            <li> the weight does stay on for quite awhile after you get off, so if your numbers are a secret (like mine, ahem) - plan on hovering around them until they disappear.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it is thin and the readout lights up.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes it it is worse.</li>
            <li> Have had for about a year, and problems keep getting worse.</li>
            <li> Not happy with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really thin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really irritating.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this scale.</li>
            <li> Thin and lightweight.</li>
            <li> i like thin design</li>
            <li> Not particularly happy with this product.  </li>
            <li> We are not happy with this scale.</li>
            <li> i did not realize how thin this product is.</li>
            <li> thin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin &amp; lightweight.</li>
            <li> It is surprisingly thin.</li>
            <li> It is thin and compact.  </li>
            <li> For me that is mildly annoying, but it is a solid, sturdy, compact, sleek scale, so</li>
            <li> and I too am not happy.</li>
            <li> I am not happy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nearly a total piece of crap, in MY opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I can keep it behind the door.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s a VERY small bathroom!).  </li>
            <li> Instead, just randomly weigh yourself when you think about it, so there&#x27;s less disappointment and/or encouragement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d owned a doctor&#x27;s scale for years, but hated how big and noisy it was.  </li>
            <li> For me all 24 dollars are wasted, will have to find another one now :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely disappointed and it&#x27;s a waste of money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some people may take this negatively, but one has to understand that it&#x27;s almost impossible to have 100% quality control.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be a few lbs lighter than before!!!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the weight is calibrated wrong.</li>
            <li> cause the purpose is useless.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a scale to be close, but not perfect, then I recommend this one.</li>
            <li> but, unfortunately, as I said, it&#x27;s in the garbage.</li>
            <li> This is a fancy and expensive looking scale...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s useless now.</li>
            <li> The friction must have caused the rubber to fail against my tile floors in my bathroom.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If it fails to register, just step off and try again.</li>
            <li> SO THEY COULD SEE WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THE SCALES.  </li>
            <li> something is wrong with it</li>
            <li> Calibrating and re inserting batteries failed to make change.</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> but I am not impressed with this scale then again</li>
            <li> Do NOT fall into the trap believing all of these fake reviews.</li>
            <li> and it was unable to perform.</li>
            <li> the weight reading is wrong and it does not work</li>
            <li> Forcing me to go through all sort of silly bends and gyrations to see the LCD.</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;m using it correctly, but it just blinks and comes up with some random number.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I ended up spending an additional $50 on a scale at Bed Bath and Beyond.  </li>
            <li> Scale does NOT work on carpet, which almost made it useless to me.</li>
            <li> With this scale I am getting random results within 5 pounds of my 190 lb weight.   </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I&#x27;m giving this thing a workout every time I get on it</li>
            <li> but I have the unfortunate honor of saying it agrees 100% with the doctor&#x27;s scale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The problem is it fails to do</li>
            <li> Needless to say, the tile floor won.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with it.  </li>
            <li> I did try using it on the carpet, but it unfortunately isn&#x27;t made to do so.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this scale.</li>
            <li> since it takes 4 AAA batteries it&#x27;s going to get expensive</li>
            <li> With the scale not setting in on one weight, that becomes sort of complicated.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s about as complicated as I want it in the morning, before I had my coffee.</li>
            <li> I was wrong and sorely misled.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, that&#x27;s where the positives end.  </li>
            <li> Some might think my review is a bit unfair, seeing as how the scale meets three out of my four criteria.  </li>
            <li> , in the wrong direction.</li>
            <li> For the price Ill deal with it.</li>
            <li> inaccurate scale is a useless scale.</li>
            <li> The scale shows random weights at random times.</li>
            <li> My other one just frustrated the heck out of me!</li>
            <li> It does not know what its doing always wrong and random.</li>

            <li> I honestly do not see how anyone could be disappointed in the decision to purchase this scale.  </li>
            <li> This is very very inconvenient, not to mention icky, because I did not spend 25 bucks on a bathroom scale that I need to realign and touch its bottom before every use.</li>
            <li> I fell for all these crazy fake reviews!&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it was driving us crazy.  </li>
            <li> this scale seems to go crazy</li>
            <li> I have never been as unhappy with a product purchased through amazon as I am about this one.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;Very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the scale didn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s spot-on with my Dr&#x27;s very expensive scale and the scale at my workplace.  </li>

            <li> This is very random, I don&#x27;t recommend this product at all.</li>

            <li> Bad investment just there for the looks</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I just got a bad one or what</li>
            <li> Maybe I got the bad one at of all the rest.</li>
            <li> I have read bad reviews</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t get frustrated trying to tap it</li>
            <li> It arrived about two weeks ago and I am shocked at how consistant it is.</li>
            <li> Just so disappointed.   </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Good scale easy to read just have some trouble getting it to lock in could also be that I&#x27;m on the higher limit of this scale</li>
            <li> Good value for the price</li>
            <li> Nice scale seems to be very accurate. Easy to read and looks good.</li>
            <li> The scale is lovely.  Clean lines, simple and elegant.  Step on, stand still, get a clear read out.  That&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> Terrific product. Accurate, attractive, easy to read.</li>
            <li> I have had lots of bathroom scales before but none of them&lt;br /&gt;would compare to the omega ultra slim digital ones that I&lt;br /&gt;ordered A few weeks ago. I love these scales, they are thin&lt;br /&gt;and easy to step up on for us who are not young anymore, and&lt;br /&gt;the lighted window makes them very easy to read. I am glad I Have&lt;br /&gt;them and would recomend them to others&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank&lt;br /&gt;Linda</li>
            <li> I have to say this scale looks good and works great. I have always had a scale in the my bathroom since I was a child. So it&#x27;s kind of mandatory that I have one in my bathroom. My last scale was was just like the rest.... big, white, square and an eye sore (drawing the wrong kind of attention). This scale is nothing of such, it&#x27;s  sleek and well crafted... with a great price to boot!!! Whom ever put their energy into designing this scale also put their energy into engineering it because it has to be the most accurate scale I have ever owned. It may be TMI but I&#x27;ve weighed myself before and after going \\&quot;number 1\\&quot; and the scale detected the difference.  Great buy</li>
            <li> Stopped working after 1 year.</li>
            <li> I received the scale on time.  It was in original packaging and it works like a dream.  Sleek and attractive.  The large LED display is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t keep near the bathtub when you have children,  to much water splashed on it will make it not work properly.  Otherwise, the best scale we have used.</li>
            <li> Simple step on and weigh, no need to start it up with a tap.  I love the small design, but it does need to be on a level surface, otherwise the weight will vary.</li>
            <li> So far so good much better and accurate than our older scale.....</li>
            <li> I love it: reads out fast and is very accurate. This is a good buy for anyone and has all good reviews</li>
            <li> Just what we were looking for.  Works well.</li>
            <li> Works great. Just get it!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the weight is calibrated wrong. Both my boyfriend and I find it over by about 4 lbs. And it changes depending on which hard floor space we place it on for weighing ourselves.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about 2 years now and it&#x27;s still working. I&#x27;m unsure how accurate it is since this is the only scale I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this scale. It&#x27;s lightweight and matches the readings I get at doctor&#x27;s appointments. It&#x27;s also sharp looking in comparison to most bathroom scales. -Cindy</li>
            <li> This thing changes everyday. Sometimes by 6 or 7 lbs. I&#x27;m dieting and exercising and trying to track my weight a couple times a week. I&#x27;ve tested multiple times in a day and it changes every time. I&#x27;ve had it since April 2013 and it&#x27;s done the same thing the whole time. I want to send this thing back and buy a different one.</li>
            <li> This is even prettier in person easy to slide out of the way and works well. The screen is very easy to read.</li>
            <li> We love that this scale lights up, like our other one did that bit the dust.  The cool thing about this one is that it also show&lt;br /&gt;ounces, which our other one didn&#x27;t, so for any of you out there who, like me, can sometimes obsess just a little about&lt;br /&gt;a couple of pounds, this is for you.  It&#x27;s not real big and bulky, either, but slim and easy to fit into a small space.</li>
            <li> Works very well, gives reliable numbers. Also, we like that you can switch from Lb to kilos.&lt;br /&gt;The numbers on display are very large, so even I can see. Sleek, modern, noninvasive disegn</li>
            <li> Very, very nice scale.  I particularly like that you don&#x27;t have to tap it to make it work.  It is nice looking and just what we wanted at a very nice price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Great scale, I love it!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this scale on the recommendation of a friend.  I must say that I am really impressed.  It looks really nice and always gives me accurate readings, compared to the scale at my gym.  It is very thin with a nice blue back light.  The display is nice and large, and easy to read even when I&#x27;m standing straight. It looks great in my bathroom . I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> LOVE this scale. It&#x27;s thin and nice looking. No tapping needed!! just stand and boom! reading :) the 400 lb capacity is great too so both myself and my husband can use it.</li>
            <li> Great service by seller.  Great product.  Solid feel.  Fast and accurate.  Made in the U.S.A.  VERY slim profile and easy to read.  Large numbers with blue back lighting.  FAST delivery.  Great price.  Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I love this scale.  It was very easy to put the batteries in it.  I like that it is easy to \\&quot;set it up.\\&quot;  It weighs as acurately or more so than any home scale I have had.  I have used other beriatric bathroom scales and this one is my favorite.  I also like the back lighted display.  Excellent scale for the price.</li>
            <li> This scale is great! It is consistently accurate each time we use it. I have a small bathroom so it does take up a bit of space, but I wouldn&#x27;t want it to be any smaller. The digital numbers are great and are easy to see, even when I don&#x27;t have my glasses on.</li>
            <li> I have only good things so far to say about this scale.  It&#x27;s slim, easy to read, lights up so you don&#x27;t even have to put the bathroom light on if you decide to weigh yourself early in the am!  Quick readout, no buttons to reset (as long as you don&#x27;t move it).  It&#x27;s great!  Price was reasonable, showed up on-time and in perfect condition (with directions and the batteries too).</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s thin, the display is huge, it stays lit for 10 seconds... and it looks nice, too.  what else do you need? i&#x27;ve only had it for a few weeks, but so far, so good!  &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> There is nothing fun about buying a scale when you need to lose weight, so other than this little flat square being my sworn enemy, it&#x27;s a good product, easy to read and to store. My package came quickly, no complaints over here.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B003ATS2QC Omega Ultra Thin Digital Bathroom Scale, 400 lb. Capacity, Super Sleek Design,Precision Accuracy,Sense-On Technology]]    Purchased this for our daughter but may keep it for ourselves! The scale&#x27;s style, value (much less than those shown in most stores), easy-to-read LCD, quality and simplicity make it a pleasure to weigh in every morning.  On second thought, I am going to just order another one!</li>
            <li> At this price this scale is a great value! No misreadings of any sort, and takes about 3 seconds to give you a clear weight. Very durable.</li>
            <li> it looks very good, much better than the photos allow.  also it works great, no set up, nothing, you just put the batteries and step on it, read your weight and the thing turns itself off. as I said, great scale</li>
            <li> This scale was delivered on time, is attractive looking and accurate. I received an email from Brian Kay atEpic Products asking if I had any questions and if I was satisfied, I think this might be a first and a reason to use this company.</li>
            <li> Love this scale brought this last month the best scale I ever purchase!</li>
            <li> This scale was purchased to replace one that read 6 lbs too heavy, along with other failing functions on it ie bodyfat test, etc. I like the aesthetic appearance, the blue led light is bright enough to read even in the dark. The most important thing for me was its accurate and looks good! No bodyfat tester on this model, which is fine. The digital read out is sharp and the scale does all the work. Pop in the included batteries and make sure the scale reads 0.0 before stepping on,simple. The batteries are rated to last a year, if you weigh yourself less than 3 times a day. Check it out!</li>
            <li> Love the lighted dial.  Nice, big numbers too.  Slim, easy to use.  It is easy to calibrate if moved.  You just tap it, the light goes on, then goes off in 10 seconds.  Done.  I guess that&#x27;s a nice feature to be able to just step on the scale, but in my case I have to move it each time I use it, so have to do the easy calibration thing.  I would recommend this scale.  Much better than others I have used.</li>
            <li> This scale is much more precise and steady than the one I bought and returned before it. Also it&#x27;s good looking.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it is very easy to read and use.  Ten pounds from now, I&#x27;ll love it even more.</li>
            <li> The Omega Scale was just as discribed on your website. The scale recorded my weight with the same accuracy as my doctor&#x27;s scale. It is very lightweigh, and , doesn&#x27;t skid on the floor.</li>
            <li> Got this scale to replace a (very) cheap one that seemed to vary by 5-10 lbs every time we used it.  This new scale is great--very precise, matches just what the doctor&#x27;s office reports.  I like the blue backlight--makes it easy to read, no matter what the light.  The scale is slim and unobtrusive as well.</li>
            <li> I needed a good, accurate bathroom scale so I headed to Amazon like usual. Once I started reading the reviews, I was amazed at the fierce competition in the bathroom scale world...and unfortunately all the fake reviews and bribed reviews made it near impossible to figure out what to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I eliminated the brand with the gazillion reviews on all their scales after reading that their reviewers were promised free goods among other things if they left a good review. I had a tough time figuring out if the haters on the other ones were real and those scales were garbage, or if they were also paid off (someone mentioned that reviewers get paid on elance - for good and bad reviews).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here I was, wanting to eat cookies but not knowing if I&#x27;d gain 20 pounds from said cookies. Do I eat 2, 4 or 10? What would the weighty damage be? I was in a real pickle without a scale!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I checked out the Omega brand and overall they seemed the least controversial (and Amazon is awesome about returns) so I took a chance on this one. I&#x27;m glad I did. It works. It&#x27;s accurate (yes lady that asks everyone if they put weights on it to test it...I actually did that). It has big numbers I can read easily so that I know to either stop eating cookies or go ahead and have another. Best of all, it&#x27;s simple. I need simple, life is complicated enough I don&#x27;t want to have to get a master&#x27;s degree to figure out how to operate my bathroom scale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it every day and it has performed perfectly every single day. When it comes to weighing myself, that part of my life is simple and dependable thanks to this scale. I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATED AUGUST 2014 - this is still working fantastically. It agrees with the scales at my doctors offices so I&#x27;m happy.  Three years with this scale and no signs of it quitting anytime soon.</li>
            <li> The numbers are large and backlit. I can see it w/o my glasses.</li>
            <li> Great scale, great price, thank you so much for your business!! Good products at really affordable prices! Thanks! Will definitely buy again if I need anything!</li>
            <li> I really like this scale as I do not have to tap it before standing on it to get weighed.  Also, the digital stays lit long enough for you to remove yourself from scale and look.  Very visible and easy to read.  Very thin and very compact.  I would recommend this to those who are looking for a scale.  My sister also likes hers.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this scale after reading some of the reviews claiming the scale was inaccurate but I am so glad that I bought it!  I have found this scale to be much more accurate than my last scale ever was.  I tested it out standing on it with various weights and it came back spot on every time.  It has a nice sleek look to it too which makes any bathroom look nicer.  Overall, it is an amazing scale.  Maybe the reviews that complained of it being inaccurate weren&#x27;t using it on a hard, flat surface?</li>
            <li> This is an awesome scale. It has a sleek design and is very thin.  No need to have to tip the scale to turn it on, you just stand on it and wait for your weight to pop up.  It has a nice display that is easy to read and I find the scale results to be very accurate.</li>
            <li> This scale is right on point!! the best for my money. I highly recommend buying this scale. This scale is accurate and I love the blue background!</li>
            <li> My original review is below.  All that was true until recently.  I had the scale for about 6 weeks then suddenly and for no apparent reason it will no longer lock onto a weight.  The display just keeps fluctuating no matter how long I wait until it times out and goes dark.  If I step off the scale before that, the weight decreases as I&#x27;m getting off until it shows 00, instead of showing my weight for about 20 seconds as it used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never abused it in any way.  It wasn&#x27;t even in a damp bathroom.  I kept it in the bedroom on a hardwood floor.  Just one day it worked great and the next time I used it a few days later, I couldn&#x27;t get a reading.  It lasted just long enough to prevent me from getting a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you&#x27;ve gotten past the confusing set up instructions this is a very nice scale.  A label on it tells you to \\&quot;auto-calibrate\\&quot; and says, \\&quot;Place scale on floor and allow to turn off without stepping on the scale\\&quot;.  Huh?  It doesn&#x27;t even go on w/o stepping on it, so how can you \\&quot;allow it to turn off\\&quot;?  The separate instructions inside the box say that each time you move it you should turn it on by stepping on it, then letting it turn off after \\&quot;or the scale will add its own weight\\&quot; to the number displayed.  (And give the person getting weighed a panic attack.)  Turns out, what these two things mean is that after the first time you put it down for use, and every time you lift it to clean or to move it somewhere else, you have to step on briefly, just long enough for the display to read \\&quot;00\\&quot; &amp; not long enough to show a weight, and get right off, leaving it alone until the display goes dark.  From then on until you pick it up again it will stay correctly calibrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice things about it: it comes w/ its own batteries; it&#x27;s fashionably thin; it&#x27;s large enough for the display to be visible even if you&#x27;ve got a bit of a belly; the display is well-lit and large; the display stays on for about 20 seconds after you get off so if you are too big to see it when you&#x27;re on the scale, you can still see what you weigh; it doesn&#x27;t wobble even if the floor is not absolutely flat; it doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of excess functions most of us don&#x27;t want b/c if we&#x27;re obsessive enough to be weighing ourselves at home we don&#x27;t need a scale to track our weight (do you really want to have to tell it each time that it&#x27;s you &amp; not your SO being weighed b/c it&#x27;s tracking 2 people&#x27;s weights?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I can&#x27;t swear it&#x27;s accurate, the weights I&#x27;ve been getting seem to make sense.  Can&#x27;t think of any negatives, but I don&#x27;t yet know about its durability.</li>
            <li> Great price for a modern sleek design. Easy to keep clean. Love the fact that one can step off and view the readings, which so far have been consistent and accurate each time. So far so good ... let&#x27;s hope it lasts.</li>
            <li> It is a gift to a friend who over 200 pound. This scale can handle up to 400 lb and look very nice as a gift.</li>
            <li> Have only had it a month, so longevity is not something I can speak to. I like it. The weight matches my weigh ins at Weight Watchers exactly so I believe it to be accurate. What more could you want in a scale?</li>
            <li> Have purchased other scales in the past and have ended up returning them.  This slim, digital scale is easy to&lt;br /&gt;use and accurate.  So far I have not had to play with it to work correctly like I have had to do with other scales.&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied...</li>
            <li> Fast shipping . Great price. Scale works great</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product.  The wife loves it.  It&#x27;s been very consistent reading the same thing if I weigh myself within minutes to get two readings.  Came with the batteries it needed, just popped them in and started using it.</li>
            <li> Just what the doctor ordered...lightweight, takes up very little space...easy to read, unfortunately it says I weigh too much...oh wait a minute...that is because I do.  You will be delighted with this scale.</li>
            <li> We love this bathroom scale.  It is ultra slim yet feels heavy and solid.  I love that is has tenths in pounds (since every little bit counts) and its easy to read.  It is the best value for the product from my comparison shopping. Thank you!</li>
            <li> These scales were larger than I expected. Very sleek looking. I love the fact that the numbers are big and illuminated against a blue background making then so easy to read. Also  they register decimal for those of us who want to know exactly what we weigh. Nice to is the fact that you don&#x27;t have to tap them to turn them on. Just step on and you get your readout. I also had checked the various scale market and finally after much  reading of many reviews opted for these. My goodness never knew there was so much scale competition but since we are a weight conscious society guess I should not have been too surprised. Not sorry for my choice and would definitely recommend them. Nice price. Very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I have only had it for a short time but so far it works better than I expected. Only question I have is it water proof?? The last scale I had in my bathroom and it got moisture inside so the digital readout was unclear. If it is than I would be grateful to have finally purchased something to last and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I have a beaten-up, Taylor scale, that&#x27;s about ten, plus, years old. I resisted getting rid of it, because it&#x27;s the most accurate scale I&#x27;ve ever owned.  It&#x27;s spot-on with my Dr&#x27;s very expensive scale and the scale at my workplace.  But, in the last few months, it has gotten quirky.  It remains accurate, but I have to jump around on it like a trampoline, to make it come on.  It was time to say goodbye to my old faithful friend. It&#x27;s so sad; we&#x27;ve shared so many diets together; so many successes and failures. Sigh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure why I settled on the Omega, with SO many choices, but I&#x27;m glad that I did. The scale is very thin and modern in appearance. It would be attractive in any setting and, it functions exactly as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the features including: auto on, the extra large LCD display, the weight units in kg, or lbs, the 0.2 lb graduation and the fact that it does come with batteries to get you started.  I&#x27;m also glad there is a \\&quot;lo\\&quot; battery indicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your weight is locked in, for approximately 10 seconds, after weighing.  How cool is that! This affords an extra 10 seconds to berate yourself for failure, or maybe to bask in the victory of dropping a couple of pounds. More seriously, it would also be great for someone having trouble seeing around their expansive tummy---or perhaps to weigh yourself and then yourself with an object you would like to weigh---like your toddler, or the dog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Popping in the batteries and, weighing in for the first time, only took a couple of minutes.  And, I&#x27;m ecstatic, because I obtained the same weight as my old Taylor scale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the clean lines of the scale, it appears it will be very easy to keep clean, which is a bonus, too.  I&#x27;m wondering about battery life, because this thing lights up like a landing strip, but it sure does make it easy to see, particularly if stumbling into the bathroom first thing in the morning, sans glasses or contacts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this would be a great scale for seniors, or anyone with balance issues. The platform is large enough to accommodate almost everyone, unless you&#x27;re Charles Barkley, but it&#x27;s so low to the ground, that it might prevent stumbling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I&#x27;m tickled pink!  Of course durability will remain to be seen, since it has only just arrived. But in spite of being so thin, it appears sturdy and well made.  We&#x27;ll see, but right now, I&#x27;m happy, happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONE YEAR anniversary (May 2011) UPDATE:  My Omega is still going strong, on the same batteries that came with it, one year ago.  It has been used two, to three times daily, for the last year.  Accuracy remains dependable, and, it shows no wear.  A little wipe-down, and it looks exactly like it did right out of the box.  So, in conclusion, I&#x27;m still happy, happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 06/24/13:  Still functioning well, looks like new, AND, still with the same battery.s would be a great scale for seniors, or anyone with balance issues.

            <li> It is thin, the display is nice and big and the price was right!  I like it.</li>
            <li> This scale is really nice. Easy to set up, has a great display readable in low ambient light levels, signals&lt;br /&gt;when it has found the correct weight, and remains on for a short period after stepping off.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other digital scales we have bought, this one has accurate repeatability, and a good price.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this scales. Light weight and fit perfect in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> Reliable and good-looking scale. No complaints about their performance. One thing to remember - they do not work on the carpet.</li>
            <li> This scale is thin, good looking and works well. I&#x27;ve been pleased with it so far.</li>
            <li> Replaced an old Taylor that was ok but started giving inconsistent  weights. So far this scale is great- worked immediately after installing the batteries that were included. We like the slim style. The company even followed up with an email asking if everything was ok and we were satisfied. VERY refreshing. I would buy their products again.</li>
            <li> It is a very easy to use, sleek looking scale. I also think it is accurate.</li>
            <li> Slim shape, easy to hide when I don&#x27;t want to think about it.  Excellent readout in any weight measurement.  Cool.</li>
            <li> I like the scale very much!</li>
            <li> Love the blue light-up display  Nice that you don&#x27;t have to tap it before you step on  Pretty accurate  Slim, sleek design that&#x27;s very modern and classy  Recommended</li>
            <li> UNTIL PURCHASING THIS SCALE, I thought that the only accurate weight management tool was the high-priced scales physicians use in their offices...NO LONGER TRUE!  This scale has it all, but most importantly, gives an accurate reading every time.  My mother weighs every week after a Weight Watchers meeting on a typical physicians&#x27; scale and she has weighed directly afterwards on the OMEGA ULTRA THIN BATHROOM SCALE and the weight is correct down to ounces.  At first I was just impressed at the sleek design and slender but sturdy-built design, bright blue LCD backlit area with easy read of weight without bending forward, and ease of use------no-nonsense readings......... but the ACCURACY says it all!  I reviewed many, many digital scales before this one and while there were only 2 reviews on the OMEGA ULTRA THIN scale, I chose it because of the reviews...they were definitely honest and real.  I honestly do not see how anyone could be disappointed in the decision to purchase this scale.  The name says it all.........super sleek design, precision accuracy, and sense-on technology.  And, it uses 3 \\&quot;triple a\\&quot; batteries, always easy to replace if needed.  USA VITAMINS includes 3 with the scale already so you can hop on right away.  Just follow the exact instructions in the short manual enclosed and you&#x27;re on your way to an accurate weight management tool.  Way to Go USA VITAMINS!  Great customer service from USA VITAMINS TOO! A++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</li>
            <li> this product exceeded all my expectations! i cant believe i found a scale of this quality for this price,great product-----tom baner</li>
            <li> I bought this scale as a first step in finally losing weight and getting healthy. The price and the many positive reviews made it the obvious choice. I was a bit worried about if the maximum weight was true or not, as I&#x27;m a large man that comes pretty close to the limit. Thankfully this scale is pretty tough and should be a great helping hand in my quest to become healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also received and email shortly after the scale arrived from Epica and I was pretty impressed by the company&#x27;s dedication to serving it&#x27;s customers.</li>
            <li> Cheap junk.  Weights are all over.   First weight is basically 2-3 pounds higher than the second weight every time and it never really settles down on anything.  Just so disappointed.   Tried to find some contact information for this company and quickly gave up.  I would say it is going to go back but I may keep it around as a reminder about what being so cheap gets me.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to this scale.  Unfortunately, it is variable by several lbs.  I would not buy this product ever again as I can never get a constant reading.  After stepping off and then back on, the scale would provide a totally different reading.  Granted it may only be one or two pounds, but that can be really discouraging if you trying hard to lose weight only to find out that you have \\&quot;gained\\&quot; 1.4 lbs and lost .8 within a few minutes.   I highly recommend looking for a different scale.</li>
            <li> Hi there,     i have bought this product and i am very satisfied withe quality of the product. Furthermore, the shipping stuff and everything is worth of buying. i enjoyed buying stuff from this seller. I hope that i purchase more product from this seller in future. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Great item. Sleek, attractive. I am very satisfied with the quality. And the scale seems to be very accurate. I weigh myself in the morning and before going to bed, and the readings are very consistent. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> As to the scale, very nice product. It is a good buy for a really nice scale.    As to the company, very fast ship, carrying the right product. A+</li>
            <li> I was expecting something passable, and I got something excellent.  Many other electronic scales I&#x27;ve used will vary a few pounds almost instantly: step on and you&#x27;re X, step off, step back on and you&#x27;re Y.  Not this Omega -- I&#x27;ve been nothing but pleasantly surprised by its consistent accuracy, easy of use, and good looks.  Hopefully its durability is on par with its quality elsewhere!</li>
            <li> After reading reviews and the price, I took a chance and bought this model.  I should&#x27;ve gone with a different brand.  The scale fluctuates with every weighing.  I&#x27;ve done various approaches - weighing everyday to weighing-stepping-off-for-a-couple-minutes-weighing-again.  The majority of the time it will vary by as much as 2 lbs regardless of method used even when stepping in the same area of the foot deck.  The 2 stars are for its sleek design; however, since its main function is to measure, I can&#x27;t give it a good rating.  I&#x27;d recommend looking elsewhere even if you have to pay more.  Update Feb 2016 - I&#x27;m increasing the star rating to 4 based upon longevity.  After 6 years, it still works - no cracks or chips; and, the display is still crisp.  Accuracy is at same level so it is at least consistent with how it started.  I&#x27;ve not experienced what one reviewer describes about huge inaccuracy swings.  I don&#x27;t use mine for precision anymore, but directional / ballpark range.  Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li> The scale has stopped working properly after a couple months. Like several other have complained, readings jump around and are inconsistent.</li>
            <li> The scale was every thing I expected. It looks great. Its easy to read. I am very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> This product turned out good. Seriously this product is good and if you are looking or researching to buy a scale definitely consider buying this one. I looked at about every scale they sell on amazon and I made the choice to buy this one because of the price and specs. It also arrived faster than expected on the delivery date when I placed my order. All and all, it was a good buy and a good scale.</li>
            <li> This scale replaced a very old clunker and has been amazingly accurate next to my doctor&#x27;s office.  The scale arrived quickly in adequate packaging and worked as soon as the batteries were added.  I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 2 months of using this every day and so far, I&#x27;m very pleased. Love the large easy to read digits. Looks sleek and seems to be accurate. I&#x27;m still amazed at how much bathroom scales can cost but I guess if you want a durable accurate one, you have to pay the price. I used to have a cheaper Taylor scale that failed on me for unknown reasons after about 6 months. All of a sudden one day after I got on, it kept trying to calculate the weight for a l-o-n-g time before finally displaying an error message &#x3D;[ So far, this has even withstood my toddler trying to weigh herself by bopping up &amp; down on it!</li>
            <li> The product is excellent and the service was prompt and accurate.  The company sent the product on time and as advertised.</li>
            <li> THIS OMEGA SCALE IS EXCELLENT.  I HAVE HAD MANY MANY BATHROOM SCALES  (I AM 88) AND THIS ONE IS THE BEST I EVER HAD.</li>
            <li> This scale works well and is consistent when stepped on several times in a row. The display is large and clear. When you step on the scale there is fluctuation, but when it stabilizes, the correct weight flashes twice and remains on display in the window for a moment after you step off (handy if you aren&#x27;t wearing your glasses)  The battery compartments are easy to access. It&#x27;s a nice change from my previous scale which did not have replaceable batteries and had to be tossed when it quit working. The vendor offered a fair price and the item arrived timely.</li>
            <li> Accuracy of +/- 0.2lb is consistent and spot-on!  This scale returns the same weight when tested back-to-back, is accurate to within half a pound compared to the doctor&#x27;s expensive scale, has a super sleek profile, is extremely easy to read, and costs less than just about anything else on Amazon or eBay.    A feature that is overlooked is that you simply step onto it and it turns on for you and reads your weight...none of that \\&quot;tap-and-wait\\&quot; stuff that other digital scales have.    This has become an essential component to my workout routine.  I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I have to say, that I have never been fond of scales... maybe it&#x27;s because of what they tell me?  But these scales at this point not only tell me what I want to hear, but they are very sharp and stream line as well.  I really love the blue screen much more than I ever thought I would!  I also love that you don&#x27;t have to calibrate them every time you get on them, you simply step on and it reads your weight.  I also like that your weight  stays visible for a bit so that you can read it moments after you step off the scales.  I have purchased scales in the past from Frontgate, which were not cheap, but sad to say that they don&#x27;t last very long, but from what I have read about these scales, they last for years.  Another great feature about these scales is that they run on regular batteries rather than a disc battery, so it costs so much less to operate then my old Frontgate scales.  Would I buy these scales again?  Heck Yes!  You won&#x27;t go wrong with these scales, they are sharp, sleek and for some magical reason, I don&#x27;t mind stepping on them.</li>
            <li> So far it works great and is accurate.  It arrived a day late.</li>
            <li> i love my EPI scale.&lt;br /&gt;it is trim, adds to any decor, not expensive, light weight don&#x27;t take up any room and it works like a charm!&lt;br /&gt;just install the included batteries, needs no calibration!&lt;br /&gt; step on it and you are on your way to your a 100% accurate weight.&lt;br /&gt;i have Congestive Heart Failure and need a true weight weight scale.&lt;br /&gt;you won&#x27;t go wrong with this product and by the way this seller is Top notch, Top drawer Honest seller !&lt;br /&gt;:)&lt;br /&gt; john</li>
            <li> This scale is so much more accurate than our previous scale. It is nicely balanced when stepped upon and gives a lighted LCD reading accurate to tenths. I would recommend this scale to anyone!</li>
            <li> Received scale quickly.  Came with 4 batteries which were easy to install; placed the scale on the floor for calibration &amp; its worked great everytime.&lt;br /&gt;Good choice :)</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the product and it is very accurate.  Lights up with powder blue background for easy sight.    Shipping was very quick and packaged for a safe shipping.  Just as advertised.  I will purchase and suggest to friends to purchase from USA Vitamins, as sold through Amazon...      [[ASIN:B003ATS2QC Omega Ultra Thin Digital Bathroom Scale, 400 lb. Capacity, Super Sleek Design,Precision Accuracy,Sense-On Technology]]</li>
            <li> Well, this is a fairly well thing. I m on weight watch for recent weeks. Since I am not used to American scale which is in pound, I prefer Kilogram. This item offers me this option. The scale number is big and clear, with blue light in background. In addition, it is a very nice in design, modern in style. A perfect match for my bathroom.</li>
            <li> Ultra Thin Digital Scale, Super Sleek Design VERY TRUE...Precision Accuracy, &amp; Sense-On Technology definitely NOT TRUE at all...The scale gives various of different ranged weights (when I can get it turned on) with in a couple of min. from each other. It is not accurate at all and not user friendly to turn on. Bad investment just there for the looks cause the purpose is useless.</li>
            <li> Very nice scale,sleek and very light weight-wise. Digital numbers are large and easy to see. Well made and I like it a lot.I do recommend.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with our Omega bathroom scale after about 1 month of daiy usage. It seems extremely accurate when I did a few repeated test measures. The numbers are very large, well-lit and much easier to read than my previous digital scale. I just wish I registered about 6-8 pounds lower! And, the service from USA Vitamins was excellent: fair price, fast shipping and batteries included.</li>
            <li> great scale, works perfectly. Very happy with this purchase. so far we have weighed ourselves and every animal in the house haha.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Omega Ultra Thin Digital Bathroom Scale\\&quot; is an excellent quality and value...    HIGHLIGHTS:    * ACCURATE.  First day of use you need to allow the scale to \\&quot;break in\\&quot; - the first few times I weighed myself or other objects, the weight reading was widely varied.  However, since the second day of use, the Omega has given consistent and highly accurate weight readings.  (Perhaps the single most important quality in a scale.)      * THIN, SLEEK, AND ATTRACTIVE.  The appearance of the scale is modern, sleek, and quite visually attractive.    * EASY TO READ DIGITAL DISPLAY.  The Omega has a large digital numeric display which is easy to read.  Black numbers on a blue backlit display.    *  GOOD QUALITY AND SUBSTANTIAL WEIGHT.  The scale feels solid and substantial (in spite of being ultra-thin) - not cheap or flimsey.      *  EXCELLENT VALUE.  In my opinion, the Omega is priced extremely attractively, and in fact I would be willing to pay $35-50 for the scale.    BOTTOM LINE:  I WOULD DEFINITELY BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN, AND WOULD RECOMMEND TO FRIENDS, FAMILY, AND AMAZON CUSTOMERS.</li>
            <li> Very nice. Excellent scale. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> We have a \\&quot;Biggest Loser\\&quot; contest going on at work so we were excited about getting this new scale since it was affordable and got great reviews.  Unfortunately, no matter what we did, the scale kept adding about 16-20 pounds per person - it was adding the weight of the scale to the people&#x27;s weight.  Following the instructions to remedy this error didn&#x27;t work.      Give it 0 out of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> So... I bought this thinking I&#x27;d be able to accurately judge weight loss/gain. You know, like you would expect from a scale. However, the thing is completely horrible. You get different weights when standing on it multiple times in a row... it isn&#x27;t accurate at all (yes, I followed the instructions for set up)... needless to say, it is worthless. I would return it if I hadn&#x27;t already threw away the box. Save your money.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a scale that depended on an inexpensive battery and was easy to store.  This scale fits both requirements.  It is accurate, nice looking  and fits easily under my small bathroom (Ikea) bench.  The numbers are very easy to read.  The sense-on feature works efficiently.</li>
            <li> I have another digital scale that I love, but i wanted one that was more legible.  I love the display and size of this scale.  However, it has not weighed me consistently since I&#x27;ve had it.  It is at least one pound heavier and sometimes more.  I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks now.  I even tried to weigh a kettle bell and compare on the scales.  There was still an inconsistency.    If you are looking for a scale to be close, but not perfect, then I recommend this one.</li>
            <li> This scale is working great. The display is easy to read. The scale is of a sleek design that looks great.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Sleek, thin, easy to use, like the blue light.  So sweet.  Such an improvement over those scales you have to tap first to get them to weigh you.  Thanks bunches.</li>
            <li> We ended up returning this item shortly after it arrived. Unfortunately it never worked properly for us. Not to mention while testing it out the first day for some reason it would not set to 0 pounds to start it kept doing 26 pounds so every time I got on the scale it&#x27;d make me 26 pounds heavier. I&#x27;m not one for calculating math so there was no question to return.</li>
            <li> My husband has decided he wants to live longer. So he&#x27;s watching his weight.  I ordered this scale and it has become his new toy.  He weighs himself after each meal. Now he is eating less so he won&#x27;t weigh more.  He loves that the numbers light up, day or night. The numbers are large &amp; easy to read.  It has decimal numbers for a more precise weight. And his weight at the doctors office is the same as his weight at home.  He loves this scale. And I love my new trim Hubby.</li>
            <li> I ordered this scale to closely and accurately moniter my weight while I&#x27;m on a strict diet protocol.  I use it daily and works great.  I love the lighted blue display and it&#x27;s sleek design.  It arrived quickly and as described by the seller.  I feel this was a great value for the product and would recommend it to any who are looking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought 3 of these. The first was for a friend (sounds like a rude gift, doesn&#x27;t it?). I liked that one so much, I bought one for myself. I loved it... for a day. Then it stopped working. It would cycle through modes if you pressed the button on the back, but nothing would happen when you stepped on it. I tried new batteries to be sure; nothing.  I returned it, got a refund, and now have a new one. It&#x27;s doing great.  This scale is so thin and has such a nice display.   I&#x27;d recommend it, even though one was a lemon.</li>
            <li> Great Product and fast shipping.... thank you</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work! In fact, after several attempts to use it I just threw it in the garbage! That&#x27;s where it belongs! I only wish I could get the money I paid for this product back but, unfortunately, as I said, it&#x27;s in the garbage. Indeed, the people who gave this product good reviews should pay me back!!</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the scale. It weighs accurately. I was surprised as to how slim the scale was, really nice. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep this review short and sweet...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve waited a full month and have had no problems with my new scale.  What I like best about it is that it&#x27;s so thin that my bathroom door can pass over it while it sits in a place that I couldn&#x27;t really use before. For a basic, dependable digital scale, look no further.</li>
            <li> Thus far we are very impressed with this scale.  Very thin and fits nicely under a chest of drawers so it is handy to slide out to use and then hide underneath when we are finished.  Company delivered this item very fast and prompt.</li>
            <li> This scale is exactly as advertised.  It&#x27;s nice looking, easy to use, inexpensive, and modern.  I have nothing but good things to say for the price.</li>
            <li> Best digital scale I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Very accurate and certainly an attractive addition to the bathroom; sleek and nicely designed.  It is ultra thin and stepping on it is more like just a forward move instead of a step.  Simply touch it with your toe to reset it for proper calibration.  Bright, easy-to-read display.</li>
            <li> It does not work at all. Every time different numbers. Very unhappy with this product. Had to return it. Don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Though I haven&#x27;t had this scale for long it is great. It give accurate readings and is large enough that I don&#x27;t feel like I am trying to balance on it.</li>
            <li> I like it.  It&#x27;s quite stable and is less fussy about where I place it than the other scales I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> This scale is totally delightful. I love the fact that it gives your weight in tenths of a pound (or at least fifths). I can&#x27;t cheat.</li>
            <li> After purchasing (and being very disappointed with) the EatSmart Precision Scale, I returned it and purchased the Omega Ultra Slim Digital Bathroom Scale. It seems accurate enough, although sometimes I can weigh myself, wait 5 minutes and weigh myself again and get a slightly different reading. Other than that, I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li> bought this scale for several people in a tent in Afghanistan, both civilian and military.  We weigh ourselves but also sometimes we need to weigh a box for shipping, so we stand on the scale with   the box. It is nice to know that the scale is designed for the extra weight and that we can use it with out fear  of breaking,  Thanks   [[ASIN:B003ATS2QC Omega Ultra Slim Digital Bathroom Scale, 400 lb. Capacity, Sense-On Technology]]</li>
            <li> This is an astonishingly light weight but very accurate scale. Simple to use and maintain (battery replacement).&lt;br /&gt;At this price there is no reason to keep the &amp;#34;heirloom&amp;#34; !</li>
            <li> I bought this scale about a month ago because I wanted to keep track of the weight loss.  I think it was a great scale that is easy and simple to use.  Its very thin so it stays under the counter and the blue lighted read out area is more then large enough to see your weight.  Also it has a great 5-10sec memory of the last recorded weight just in case you need to step off and look closer.  I am very happy with the product and the whole amazon experience.  These reviews really helped in narrowing down the scale I chose.</li>
            <li> Love this scale. With every scale I&#x27;ve ever had, you could step on the scale three times in a row and get three vastly different weights. This one always reads the same amount. It&#x27;s always within .2 pounds of the weight I get on the scale at Weight Watchers as well.  Shipping was very fast. I would definitely do buisness with Perella&#x27;s again.</li>
            <li> I got this scale about three weeks ago and am extremely happy with it. At first it was reading about 14 pounds off. Then i relized i had not set it up correctly. Since then It has been great! Very acurate. I did notice if you don&#x27;t give it time to reset its self after you weigh the next weight will be different, however if i left ofr 10mins it would give me the same reeding again. The size and look are great as well as the large blue screen.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a simple and functional scale that doesn&#x27;t take up too much space. This scale is exactly what I was looking for. It has a very bright blue backlit display and is very precise! Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Not sure how many words I can write about a scale. It does exactly what I need it to do. The numbers are large and readable... the weight does stay on for quite awhile after you get off, so if your numbers are a secret (like mine, ahem) - plan on hovering around them until they disappear. Otherwise, it does exactly what I bought for it to do.</li>
            <li> ok, I guess haven&#x27;t used it yet</li>
            <li> Nice scale large numbers easy to resd</li>
            <li> Fantastic scale!  Just what we needed.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it is thin and the readout lights up.  The last scale we had only lasted about a year.  I also love the fact that you don&#x27;t have to \\&quot;tap\\&quot; it before you get on it.  Would recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li> The Omega Ultra Thin Digital Bathroom Scale was exactly what I wanted. It&#x27;s easy to use and gives the result quickly. If you move too much just step off the scale and back on to get your results.  I had been using a scale with the sliding weight [like a doctor&#x27;s scale]and it was always difficult to get it balanced right, and with a grandson&#x27;s little fingers it kept getting changed on me.  Now the scale is easily accessible and easy to use. I love the digital display that blinks when you weight has been measured accurately. Definitely recomment.</li>
            <li> A great product @ a great price, this scale does everything it&#x27;s supposed to do; the numbers are easy to see day or night, &amp; it&#x27;s extremely accurate. Bonus; it&#x27;s thin enough to stash away if not used every day.</li>
            <li> Product was good, and was as advertised.  I do notice that if I move the scale to different locations in the house, my weight reading changes by 2-3 lbs.  I have been keeping it in one location now, and am hoping that it gives the correct reading...  Shipping was fast, and well-done.</li>
            <li> i ordered 2 of these, one for me and one for a friend. i got mine to replace a regular scale that is accurate, but is kinda hard to read.  if i step off mine and step back on it gives me a different weight each time.  and the weight differs from the other scale, (the accurate one) by as much as 3-4 lbs. my friend&#x27;s scale worked ok for a little while then it started blinking when not in use.  i would have returned mine but my dog chewed up the box and my friend had already thrown his away.  pretty to look at, not very useful.</li>
            <li> As described, promptly shipped.  Numbers are easy to read, lighted.</li>
            <li> Quick arrival, nice price, it&#x27;s good, and so far it&#x27;s accurate. People, read and follow the simple instructions and your scale will always work precisely the way it was meant to work. Most important, always place the scale in a hard surface and if your weight still shows too high then lay off the sweets and start walking more often.</li>
            <li> The product was excellent.  Haven&#x27;t had any issues till now.  Helps me stay on track with my diet.  It gives a constant reading everytime, by that I mean if I re do my weight immediately it doesn&#x27;t fluctuate and hoping on with objects does change the reading accordingly.</li>
            <li> I have stepped on many different scales but find this one the best of all bathroom scales I have been on, either at others houses or my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is small enough to be put out of the way easy, is extremely consistent, never varying a single ounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are self calibrating, to calibrate one only needs to tap on the scale, wait for about 6 seconds for it to set itself to zero.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are oversize and cannot see the weight, like I am, no problem, the weight light stays on for about 5 seconds after stepping off of them.  Very well lit, easy to read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for the ladies, very attractive scales.  For the men, myself being one, they are very sturdy made, which I like a lot.  The platform is of thick clear glass over the scales weight mechanisms, all covered attractively with a neutral tone color band about two inches wide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very glad to have selected this set and highly recommend them to all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;J W</li>
            <li> This scale replaced an older dial model that had about a five pound swing, depending on how my feet were positioned and weight was shifted.  And while this scale does have a memory - in that it will repeat exactly the same weight if I step on it twice in a row - that measure can be defeated when I pick up a bath towel to add 3/4 of a pound, then weigh again without it.      My husband weighs about 225 and I&#x27;m at about 135; both of us get consistent and seemingly accurate readings.      Scales are supposed to give accurate weights.  I don&#x27;t need a BMI measurement or other bells and whistles.  This scale does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and  at a very reasonable price.  It arrived in perfect condition, was well packaged and came quickly.  Set-up took about two minutes.</li>
            <li> Very light weight and slim.  Seems accurate and gives weight quickly and easily.  very satisfied</li>
            <li> Very nice product, reliable, slim, working as expected. Is one of the best scales we had so far, I like being able to get both kg and lbs numbers.  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This is a fancy and expensive looking scale...well, to me anyways. It&#x27;s easy to set up. All you need to do is put in the batteries (that come with it) and set it down on a flat surface then you&#x27;re ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Edit: 8/31/2013***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you step on it just right you&#x27;ll tip it over to the side. Sometimes the weight is off so I would have to take out the batteries and put them back in to get my \\&quot;real\\&quot; weight. Overall, pretty decent scale.</li>
            <li> After using this Omega digital scale for two months, I can&#x27;t really find anything to complain about for a scale in the twenty five dollar price range. What I need from a scale is the numbers to go up when gaining weight, go down when losing weight and stay the same when no changes. And this is what I got from this one. I measured multiple times before and after meals, with and without a coat, before and after an output operation, and the numbers were consistently higher when you expected them to be higher, and lower when you expected them to be lower. It also correlated with other factors (how belts and pants feel when gaining/losing weight, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One point to note, I did not compare its measurements with professional gym and medical scales, so I can&#x27;t tell you how it performs in that fashion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scale takes four AAA batteries, inserted in pairs of two on the bottom side of the device (upper left and upper right corners). Four Industrial brand single use AAA batteries were included in the box. The blue backlight is a nice touch and very easy to read. The scale shows weight in 0.2 lb increments. You can switch from Kilos to Pounds and vice versa by pressing the button located on the bottom side of the device (upper area, in the middle of the top row).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To weigh yourself, simply step on it, and it will turn on and start measuring. No need to tap the corner like my previous scale, which I found rather annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It needs to be placed on a flat surface, and if you move it, you have to recalibrate it, which, based on reading the tea leaves in the four page user manual, means to tap on the main surface briefly to turn on, not step on it, let it measure 0, then let it turn off on its own, and then measure yourself as usual. Or you can remove and reinsert the batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of the four page user manual, it looks like it was written with computer translation or using a dictionary. Tortured sentences and typos it has,but it manages to communicate what needs to be communicate. Of the four pages, two of them are the meat, the other two pages are the front cover and back cover :)</li>
            <li> Excellent scale. Very accurate. Nice design and easy to read with lit blue screen</li>
            <li> The scale seemed accurate for about a year, but is now up to 5 pounds off randomly.  There is no adjustment that I can find, so it&#x27;s useless now.</li>
            <li> I have had the Taylor brand and while it was good (looked very nice out of glass and long battery life) I hated tapping on it before reading my weight. This omega one is great- just step on and it gives you your numbers. I like the look and materials as I have 3 kids under 5 and the glass one just isn&#x27;t safe to have out. Nice big LCD display and it keeps your number up for a couple seconds after you get off. Comes with batteries.</li>
            <li> I received this scale earlier this week, and it&#x27;s very simple to use, easy to read, and does it&#x27;s job in just a second or two.</li>
            <li> Checked the accuracy of this scale against the ones in my doctors&#x27; office and it&#x27;s pretty accurate. Nice slim design. One problem is that the light on the scale does not stay on long enough so that you have to hurry and read your weight or get off and try again.   Major problem is that the scale does not work on a carpet so it can not be used in my carpeted bedroom and must be placed on a hard surface like the tile in a bathroom. You can&#x27;t jump out of bed and get a quick reading.  Overall it&#x27;s a good scale at a good price.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading many reviews, one of the best reasons to buy on Amazon. I am confident that it will meet our needs, specifically to monitor Mom&#x27;s water weight gains due to Chronic Heart Failure. Our 35-year-old scale just isn&#x27;t accurate enough. However, I guess due to the fact that I have not bought a scale in forever, I had no idea, and had not read in any review, that this scale is not supposed to be used on carpet. We have very little hard flooring in our senior apartment and it&#x27;s hard to find a place where she can use her walker to get on the scale, but then not have it exposed when she rides her power chair (at 86, sometimes her driving is a little dangerous, lol). Is no digital scale able to be used on carpet?</li>
            <li> This scale is incredible. It&#x27;s a really good deal and even arrives with its own batteries!Don&#x27;t even bother looking at other scales. Buy this one.</li>
            <li> Great scale and no pretapping required. I purchased the scale to use at work for a weight loss challenge and it has been extremely accurate.  It is very light to use and that is a good thing since we all go to the bathroom to weigh a couple times a week. If you are thinking about purchasing, stop and just go ahead and buy.</li>
            <li> THE SCALE WORKS GREAT.  LIGHT WEIGHT. DURABLE...WHOPPDIE WHOOP!  NOW ITS UP TO ME TO DO THE REST.  LOOK OUT 295 POUNDS...HERE I COME.</li>
            <li> Got this scale for my husband &amp; I about 10 days ago because we wanted one that was more specific than the usual dial scales. We are both pretty heavy, my husband over 300 lbs, and it seems to handle the weight well, and is consistent in readings. It is weighing about the same as some medical scales I have at work, allowing for the time of day, clothing &amp; so forth. It is easy to use &amp; read. Seems to be a great value. We love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the process of returning this scale because I was scared when I saw that I was 11lbs heavier than I expected to be when I tried it out! To test accuracy, I placed weights on the scale, and sure enough, it was off....Pretty design and nice lighting, but mine was not accurate :(</li>
            <li> I purchased this scale because of the good reviews but it was a mistake. The scale that I receive does not give accurate results, no matter what is placed on the scale it gives a 19.2 weight difference. This was a complete waste of money!</li>
            <li> great product. Worth the penny. its been a month or two since i bought this an it works perfect so far.</li>
            <li> im glad i bought this product. i got it for a good deal and it works like a charm. its a must buy!</li>
            <li> When we visited our son and daughter-in-law, they had this scale. We used it and liked it so when our old scale died, we contacted them about their scale. They sent us the direct link for ordering one and we did so. It arrived timely and so far we are very pleased. It is accurate and readings are very close to the scales in our Doctor&#x27;s offices. When you weigh and get back on it, the readings are always the same. It is definitely a good product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this very classy scale. Seems to be accurate and also very attractive on the bathroom floor. The light is a beautiful blue and stays on long enough for viewing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice looking, light weight and the numbers are big, blue and easy to read.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this scale is it is way too truthful and refuses to lie after I&#x27;ve been bad.</li>
            <li> The two stars are for the sleek design.  I bought this scale after reading all the glowing reviews for \\&quot;accuracy\\&quot;.  I don&#x27;t know if the other reviewers are just plain lucky, but for us,  this scale gives different readings throughout the day. On day 2 of owning it,  it fluctuated between 5 pounds for both my husband and me.  I lost 3 pounds in the morning and gained 5 by evening!  At one point, I gained 2 ounces every 10 minutes.  We have no idea what we actually weigh.  This was a terrible purchase as the scale is virtually useless.</li>
            <li> Accurate and Reliable every time... Made well... easy to read with nice size screen... only wish i could lose that extra 10 lbs...lol!</li>
            <li> Love the sleek design and the larger bright digital numbers.  Came quickly in the mail.</li>
            <li> A very good and consistent scale. All I have to do it step on and off it once and it is tared every morning. After I do that I get readings I feel to be accurate.</li>
            <li> I love this scale. I haven&#x27;t had one in about 10 years so the novelty hasn&#x27;t worn off yet and i&#x27;m using it about 5 times a day. It&#x27;s super accurate and reliable and the light up display is easy to read anytime.</li>
            <li> So, here&#x27;s the thing. My boyfriend and I decided we wanted a scale for our apartment, and we started looking around on Amazon, reading reviews about how various scales are great, but they don&#x27;t do X... and it was driving us crazy.  We settled on this scale, which was affordable and looked stylish enough.  And guess what?  It does exactly what a scale is supposed to do, no more, and no less. It tells us our weight.  It tells us our weight accurately enough for us to track our weight loss / gain over time.  So if you&#x27;re looking for a scale, this one is reasonably priced, accurate enough for normal use, and looks great in a bathroom.</li>
            <li> Got this scale after shopping around on the internet and reading reviews.  As is usually the case, Amazon had it cheapest.  Nice, big lighted reading. Nice slim scale.  It&#x27;s wide so it feels sturdy.  Can switch from lbs. to kgs.  Been using for only about a month, but so far so good and I don&#x27;t expect (hope not) to have any problems with it.  Also, love that USA Vitamins (from which this came) let it qualify for Amazon&#x27;s free shipping.</li>
            <li> This scale is very nice looking, accurate, and a good purchase for the money. The number display is large and vibrant, and its nice not to having to tap it initially (you just step on to get a reading). I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think that this scale was very accurate. It seems to not be consistent. I&#x27;ll weigh myself and then to see if it is right I will weigh myself again 3 seconds later and it sometimes says something completely different. I would recommend looking at other scales before buying this one.</li>
            <li> Have had this for years and love it!! Definitely does the job, looks sleek, and lasts!!</li>
            <li> My old scale just plain wore out and, after reading other reviews, I decided to give this one a try. It has large numbers which are easy to read, and is attractive. My husband has a balance issue and cannot easily get on the average scale. This can be positioned so that he can balance himself between the commode and the sink, which makes him feel safer, and it is slim enough that he has less trouble stepping up onto it. This scale is stable and does not wobble like the one it replaced.</li>
            <li> Great product. Shipping was fast. I&#x27;m glad I decided to purchase this one. Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Weight seems to be roughly correct.  It doesn&#x27;t get it *exactly* the same each time, but it&#x27;s always within .2 or so.  Anything more precise is going to cost you a lot more.  Looks nice.</li>
            <li> Very thin scale, takes 4 AAA (included). Works great after calibration, step on to turn on and weight displays brightly, no buttons or switches. Can display lbs, kg, or stones. Accurate to 0.2 lbs and reliable (almost always the same measure, if not ±0.2lbs) tested many times in a row. Material feels good despite the thin build and is sturdy. Display is large and bright. Overall a good buy, very satisfied</li>
            <li> Very happy with my new scales. I have not had any problem with mine, and they seem to be accurate. Nice design and I like the blue light- makes it very easy to read and the way the numbers stay on the screen for a few seconds when you step off is great for when you are carrying something and can&#x27;t see your feet. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> The scale is small, fairly lightweight, but has a large easy-to-read display that could be easily read in the dark! So far it seems to work just fine and does what it&#x27;s supposed to - give an accurate reading of weight. I must say that, after a lifetime of analog scales, the precision of this one with it&#x27;s 1/10th of a pound is disconcerting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried to use it for large packages yet, to get a mailing weight for postage, something I&#x27;m looking forward to. My kitchen scale is too small for something large but lightweight - too hard to get a reading. I&#x27;m expecting this large display to help with that. And that&#x27;s where the 1/10th of a pound breakdown will come in very handy...</li>
            <li> This scale is attractive, slim and simple to use.  You just step on it  without having to push anything before you do.  It is also very easy  to read.</li>
            <li> bought this ALONG TIME AGO. still works. love it.</li>
            <li> Product arrived within a couple days of purchase.  Performed well, looks good.  Now here&#x27;s a \\&quot;but.\\&quot;  There&#x27;s no warranty! Rereading the Amazon page, I find I neglected to notice this before purchase.  Although I really like the product, I may not have made the purchase had I noticed this.  This is worth adding as a factor in your consideration of which scale to buy.  It would have had 5 stars, otherwise.  Of course, performance over time is an unknown.</li>
            <li> Scale works really well.  Got it a few days after I was weighed at the doctor&#x27;s and it&#x27;s in the same range.  Didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d need the light on it, but I keep it in the closest and the light is super useful.  Good value and accurate.</li>
            <li> read the reviews and was happy with what i got. good price and does the trick! recommended to all. five stars man.</li>
            <li> I have had no problems with this scale.  I love that you just step on and that it has a 400# capacity since my partner and I are taller and bigger than most.  The light up indicator and slim design are also very nice.</li>
            <li> Thanks - we ordered this rather late but still got it in time for Christmas.  Great service - product exactly what we wanted.  [[ASIN:B003ATS2QC Omega Ultra Slim Digital Bathroom Scale, 400 lb. Capacity, Sense-On Technology]]</li>
            <li> This is the worst scale I have ever stepped on. I didn&#x27;t get the same reading twice in over 10 times on and off the scale in a matter of 5 minutes. I have a tanita digital scale and that one is much more consistent and accurate. I bought this one in the hopes it would work properly because I have since exceeded the weight limit of my old scale and needed one with a greater capacity to track my current weight loss program. I got reading that differed by over 200 lbs within just 10 secs of coming off this scale. I had my wife try it also and she not only did not the same reading as she got on the other scale (it was 10 pounds off) but after stepping on this scale the second time got a reading 10 pounds heavier and gained 10 - 20 pounds with ever attempt according to the scale. Needless to say this scale is useless for tracking weight loss and honestly I can see any kind of application for it other than a toy for the kids that will get old fast. I returned the scale to amazon the next day. That goodness for Amazon&#x27;s easy return policy.</li>
            <li> The scale came in before Christmas, in time to start a diet after the holidays.  It measures accurately; you can tell if you gained or lost in 0.1 pound increments.  It automatically turns on and shuts off by stepping on the scale, and the reading is backlit so it&#x27;s easy to see in dim light.  Very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son. He is a wrestler and has to check his weight a couple of times a day. He likes how accurate it is and very light weight so he can take it with him when he travels to tournaments. The company has followed up several times to ensure we are completely satisfied... Which is amazing. I would buy this scale again and I would definitely shop with these fine folks again!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slim, and it does its job quickly and with ease. Nice looking to boot!</li>
            <li> This is a great scale and was much cheaper than the ones I found elsewhere. Very stylish as far as scales go, haha :)</li>
            <li> Slim, attractive and always accurate. Large easy-to-read display. Unlike our last digital scale; you can re-weigh yourself repeatedly with exactly the same results. A keeper.</li>
            <li> large numbers easy to see.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother for Christmas. It pleased her alot and I like the auto cut on when you step on it to get weighted! It is very thin compared to other models I&#x27;ve seen over the years. Don&#x27;t know about battery life yet as it shuts off by itself and only had it a month.</li>
            <li> This scale is very inaccurate. I stepped on the scale it read some numbers, went up and down a bit and started blinking signaling this is the final weight. 2 minutes later i stepped on it again to check the consistency and the weight went up by 3 lbs. Then 5 minutes later i stepped on again and it went down 5 lbs from the first time which means 8 lbs of difference from the second time. I know this is a cheap scale, i can deal with the difference of a pound or less but 8 is a disappointment</li>
            <li> Big Man, 250 lbs.Suits me fine, Quick and Easy....Thanks!</li>
            <li> This scale looks nice.  Hence, the one star rating.  But since it doesn&#x27;t know how to register a correct weight, I can&#x27;t give it any more stars.    I step on the scale and read the numbers.  I step off, give it a few minutes then step back on.  My weight has gone up 4 to 7 pounds.  Amazing!!  I do this on and off for 10 to 15 minutes and get a different weight each time.  This occurs any day that I try to weigh myself.    I put two 10 pound weights on the scale and the weight registered 16 pounds.  There is no way to correct this.    I have no idea how much I weigh.  Which may be a good thing...  :~\</li>
            <li> Its a good scale. It&#x27;s not to high tech. It&#x27;s just a simple scale that I think will not break easily.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased with this bathroom scale.  Better than the picture - the service from this vendor was excellent.  Price and product was extremely great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a scale.  It weighs stuff.  It weighs stuff just fine.  It&#x27;s thin and nice looking and the numbers are very easy to read.</li>
            <li> This scale is great! Great quality! I like that you do not have to step on it before to zero it out.</li>
            <li> I received the shipment on time as stated by the seller. Moreover the scale is really strong,sturdy and accurate. Its worth the money. Initially I was skeptical about the product but after using it, I would definitely recommend to others..!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to finally have a scale that actually works and gives an accurate weight measurement. We like this scale so much more than our last one.</li>
            <li> We bought this scale to replace an older Taylor model.  This scale is way beyond our expectations.  We love the combination of stunning style with high quality digital accuracy.  The readings are consistent and accurate every time.  The large number display is terrific.  You can see the numbers without bending down even in low light situations.  We also enjoy the sense-on technology with no more tapping to turn on the scale.  You simply step on and get a reading.  Would highly recommend to others.</li>
            <li> FYI I have had this scale for one week and it worked perfectly and then just stopped working. It still turns on but will not read a weight. Not worth your money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with this scale. I had it for over a week and it works great (hopefully it will continue to do so). It looks very nice and is light,</li>
            <li> I received my scale on yesterday - when I placed two 5 pounds weights on it it didn&#x27;t register so I stood on it, it gave me 2 different readings within 2 minutes of each other.  So I took another reading without the weights and one with the weights it was more accurate then.  Since then the weight has been consistent.  I am not sure if it took a while to actually calibrate.    Also, check to make sure you receive all the batteries - I only received 2 in the box and the scale calls for 4.    Would have given a perfect score of 5 stars but took off for the inconsistenties of the first weigh in as well as batteries missing.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this scale is accurate because two weeks ago I was 7 pounds heavier, so maybe so. *shrugs*   I will weight myself at the gym to see comparison otherwise, it&#x27;s a pretty decent scale.</li>
            <li> Great scale at a reasonable price.  Very easy to read,, accurate and consistent. Simple step on and read display. I have had none of the digital scale problems that seem to come up here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This scale is basically a rebadged Escali US180B Ultra Slim Bathroom Scale. Although I have the Escali scale, the review should apply equally to this scale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Very slim, compact, and storable&lt;br /&gt;- Large LCD readout&lt;br /&gt;- Attractive design&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Very inconsistent weights&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this scale because Consumer Reports had highly recommended several Escali scales (though they didn&#x27;t review this one). I love that it is compact and attractive. The problem is that it just doesn&#x27;t work for someone who is trying to track your weight because it is so inconsistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Example:&lt;br /&gt;One day, I weighed myself ten times within 20mins. These are the weights that came out.&lt;br /&gt;1: 148.2&lt;br /&gt;2: 148.2&lt;br /&gt;3: 147.8&lt;br /&gt;4: 147.8&lt;br /&gt;5: 147.8&lt;br /&gt;6: 147.8&lt;br /&gt;7: 147.8&lt;br /&gt;8: 148.4&lt;br /&gt;9: 148.4&lt;br /&gt;10: 148.2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With in twenty minutes there was more than half a pound of variation in my measured weight! Sometimes it it is worse. Last week, there was a two pound difference when I weighed myself in succession. This destroys any confidence I have in this scale for tracking my weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the error in this scale would be relative to my true weight, but there the error seems to be redrawn each time you step on the scale. I don&#x27;t need to know whether I weigh exactly 148.2, but I do need a scale which will accurately capture my weight changes. This scale doesn&#x27;t cut it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to be purchasing an analog scale as it seems that many digital scale suffer from this problem. Even Consumer Reports admitted that the analog scales they reviewed were much more consistent than the best digital scales. Even though the analog scales may not get your true weight exactly right, they will deliver exactly the same reading every time if you weight doesn&#x27;t change. If you want to track your weight changes and care about a 0.5lbs like I do, then get a good analog scale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you found this review helpful let me know with your vote. :)</li>
            <li> The scale is very easy to set up (no tapping, just step on it). The numbers are easy to read, even for my mother, whose eyesight is failing. Excellent value for the price!</li>
            <li> The scale is extremely accurate and easy to use.  Very sturdy and not bad looking (plus you can&#x27;t beat the price).  I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this scale!</li>
            <li> Bought this scale after reading some favorable professional product reviews and was not disappointed. Very frustrated with the inconsistency of our old scale and was happy to see that if we stood on the Omega 10 times, the 10 results were all within 0.4 lbs of each other.  Then on two visits to our doctor we found that the Omega&#x27;s numbers were very close when clothing was taken into account.  The low price, easy readability, and stylish appearance were all just bonuses.  I would recommend this scale to everyone.</li>
            <li> Awesome, great scale...Adds to the bathroom, stays lit after you get off plus goes up to 400lbs. Great buy, very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> Went on a diet for New Years.  I didn&#x27;t have a scale to measure my progress.  Bought this scale, and it&#x27;s great.  Big numbers are easy to see, and it gives you final weight in seconds.  Wish it would automatically subtract ten pounds.</li>
            <li> I received my scale in a timely manner.  I love the scale.  I can read it and it gives me the exact weight.  I don&#x27;t have to constantly adjust it like the old one.  I am always happy with the service I get from Amazon.  Prices are right!!! Service is great!!!</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted in a scale. Delivered on time.  The only negative is that you have to be real still for it to lock on a weight. Do not try and get to close to the wall.</li>
            <li> This is the best Bathroom scale I have ever owned.  The accuracy of weighing and the large display and illumination is a plus for someone like me who has a vision problem.The shipping was fast, very carefully wrapped! I highly recommedded this scale.</li>
            <li> This works very well. Pretty sure it is mostly accurate. I just wish it had body fat measurement on it too. For some reason, I was under the impression that it did. I am not sure where I read that it did, but apparently I was wrong, so that is my mistake. I probably shouldn&#x27;t have knocked off a star for my inability to read.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I was interested in purchasing one of the older model that did not use batteries, but I am very please with this product.  I would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using the scale, it is easy to use and seems to be quite accurate. The scale is also small and discrete therefore it&#x27;s not an eyesore to look at.</li>
            <li> It is mostly accurate but if you shift your weight it can swing as much as 10 pounds. Never seen that in other scales. Sometimes if I stand still it will still swing 2-5 pounds. Still not sure if I&#x27;ll keep it.</li>
            <li> We love the new scale!  it&#x27;s easy to read, nice looking, and very accurate.  It&#x27;s not bulky like some scales are.  The slim lines are very attractive, and it slips under smaller areas to slide out of sight.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> This scale is accurate, easy to read, and looks nice. I highly recommend it! It also works well for people of all weights.</li>
            <li> The scale that I received does not work like the one in the video.When I step on the readings are all over the place, and that is while using on a hard wood floor.</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  As advertised.  Much better than prior scale.</li>
            <li> Very thin and well built scale. Incredibly responsive, easy to read and the battery life seems to be top notch. I highly recommend this scale, it even looks great in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> I love this scale. It is so easy to read and the weight actually flashes and then stops when it is at your weight.  One thing is that when the batteries are dying it will flash the entire time you are on it and will give you an inaccurate reading.  So if it has been working fine and seems to go haywire just put in new batteries.</li>
            <li> I should have listened to the other reviewers.  This scale is so innacurate.  Within minutes, I would get readings within 20 pounds!  For someone who is trying to lose weight and moniter things weekly if not daily, it is maddening.  Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> Love this scale....easy to use right out of the box. Very accurate and the battery is seeming to last a while.</li>
            <li> I really like this scale. It&#x27;s small and seems to be very consistent regarding weight read outs.  The bright blue light for the weight read out is easy to read. The scale appears to be very accurate and consistent re weight adjustments in relation to my diet and activity. Thank you for this very nice product. I would recommend this scale to others.</li>
            <li> Good scale, good price.  I like that I can step on it without tapping it first to activate it, and the lit display works really well.</li>
            <li> This scale is pretty, lightweight, and has large numbers. It is not however, very consistant. It is consistant enough for me but with in 20 minutes the readings will vary by as much as a pound.</li>
            <li> I bought this scale so that I could reliably track my weight loss journey. It has everything that I wanted in a scale: LARGE display of the numbers, lighted display, slim profile, step on to turn on, etc. I&#x27;ve had this scale for three weeks and I love it so far!!</li>
            <li> Worst scale I have ever owned. It worked for about 2 days (I think) on the first day I weighed 136lbs and same on the second. Then on the 3rd day i weighed 104lbs. Although I wish that transformation was true, it&#x27;s not the reality. Don&#x27;t buy this unless you want a warped version of reality.</li>
            <li> Super slim scale as described.  Super easy to use also.  Seems accurate, although I have nothing to compare it with.  Swift shipping &amp; good packaging.  Happy with seller.</li>
            <li> For the price I think it&#x27;s a bargain.  Very thin and space efficient.  The display comes on as soon as I step on it and stays on just long enough to confirm what I saw.  It shows a tiny bit more than I would like to see (it&#x27;s not the scale&#x27;s problem, I know) but overall I think it&#x27;s a very good deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a month and have noticed that I&#x27;m having pretty high and low fluctuations of weight. Tonight I checked the scale three times within two minutes and received three quite significant figures.. I&#x27;m sending this back.</li>
            <li> I had this shipped to my daughter&#x27;s dorm in the US and then she brought it to me out of the country at Christmas. One reason I got it is it is light and would not add much weight to her baggage. I really liked this scale when I got it and I have used it almost daily for almost 6 months. Close monitoring of my weight is important to me while I have been on a weight loss program and while adjusting my eating and activity to maintain that loss. So I was happy that it could weigh within a 2/10s of a pound. I hadn&#x27;t found any scale to do better except for my WII which weighed within 1/10th of a pound. So I was very disappointed when the scale started being very erratic and varying by about 7 pounds during a weighing before settling on a weight that I know is way off. Then if I weigh immediately again it will behave similarly and come up with a completely different weight. When it started doing this I replaced all four batteries with new good quality batteries and it did not improve at all. I can not tell how to contact the company directly about the problem and being out of the country it is inconvenient to just order another one from Amazon. A mechanical scale will probably work for decades but an electronic scale can have problems. I knew this but hoped that this electronic scale would work for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update. Don&#x27;t give up too soon if your scale seems off. Somehow mine started functioning perfectly well again. Maybe it was a battery issue .</li>
            <li> This product was delivered on time and the packing was great.  The scale is lite weight and easy to read.  I like the idea of regular batteries being used instead of those disk batteries.  Would recommend this scale highly.</li>
            <li> I was so over purchasing the sales that you usually stub your toe on due to their design. Most were heavy and just an eye sore in my bathroom. As soon as this arrived, it was so easy to put it to use-open, add batteries-and use. That simple! Great purchase overall I am very happy with the scale.</li>
            <li> If one can fall in love with a scale, then this has happened to me.  I was skeptical when I read how other reviewers liked the scale so much.  I decided to follow their steps - and so far, I am not disappointed.  We have had this scale for over a month and it works flawlessly.  It is quite slim so it is very easy to step onto it.  And the numbers are large and illuminate for easy reading.  If you have to buy a scale, this is a great choice!</li>
            <li> Easy to set up, minimal learning curve. No \\&quot;tapping\\&quot; and it doesn&#x27;t get confused and try to give you your last weight. All of those being issues commonly noted with other digital scales. I love using this thing.</li>
            <li> This is ok for the money.  I suspect if i had spent a bit more it might not have the issues I have noticed.  My only complaint is you have to be perfectly still for it to get a good reading.  most of the time it times out before getting a lock on your weight.  that said i am on the high end of the scale&#x27;s weight limit.</li>
            <li> The scale is really very thin and working properly very well. I am going to recommend it to my friends too!</li>
            <li> Ordered a scale from them which arrived right away and was very well packaged. Very pleased with the service. Would order again.</li>
            <li> I bought this scale about a month ago, and use it since that almost every single day. It&#x27;s very precise and is easy to carry. So I think it&#x27;s a great scale to own.</li>
            <li> It is a good scale but it is very sensitive if I wiggle a toe or even move a little it will not measure right.  It has a tendency to add the scale weight to it.  But now that I know how it works it works better.</li>
            <li> This is very nice. The slim design is very attractive. Blue backlit numbers are easy to read without my glasses. And I needed one that went up to 330 lbs.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a scale that was precise as I am going on a weight loss program, it is just what I was looking for, seems to be fine.</li>
            <li> Works fine, looks sharp, nice price, batts have lasted several months and thanks the Maker they are regular aa&#x27;s instead of coin cells. not much else to say, it tells you how much force you exert on the surface of the Earth.</li>
            <li> The scale arrived quickly, is solid and stylish, reads instantly, and has a large display which freezes for a few seconds after it stabilizes (which helps if you are just out of the shower and do not have your glasses on).  The measurements are also quite repeatable.  Much more than I expected for the price.</li>
            <li> Works great. Quick turn-around on shipping.</li>
            <li> I had such an old scale and this was a big change for me going Digital...But I love it ...Love the big read out and its lighted, I love the fact it is close to the ground as I have a bad knee and not good at balancing so the product worked wonderful and I am very pleased with my order.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d owned a doctor&#x27;s scale for years, but hated how big and noisy it was.  I bought the Omega Ultra Thin Digital on a whim, and everyone in the house loves it.  No setting anything -- you don&#x27;t even have to tap it with your foot as with other standard scales.  The readout is large and in a pleasant blue rather than nasty red, and the numbers stay lit several seconds, so you can step off and then read your weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered my scale the first of the week and received it two days later.  It was solidly packed and complete with instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my better recent Amazon.com experiences!</li>
            <li> My wife and I placed the batteries in the Omega Ultra Thin Digital Bathroom Scale and it worked only ONCE accurately and then IMMEDIATELY STOPPED WORKING.  We tried recalibrating, putting new batteries in, tapping, stepping on it, pushing the lb kg selection button, but it had simply BROKEN right after we took it out of the packaging. [...]</li>
            <li> I have had many digital scales that have failed and not been worth the investment. However these scales are great no tapping just step straight on, they are slim, elegant and worth the money. I like the blue digital reading you can check your weight first thing in the morning in the dark lol.</li>
            <li> This scale was easy to set up. It took my fifteen year old daughter less than five minutes to get it out of the package set up correctly and working. It is sleek and nice looking to keep set out in the bathroom. Will not work on carpet but works great on hard wood floors or tile. It stays consistent on multiple uses and was accurate when compared to the doctors weighted scales. Very nice quality for the price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because it had such good reviews, so I decided to give it a try. It works perfectly fine and I am happy with the purchase. Seems like it was priced just right and it is a nice scale. Lightweight, thin, stylish, doesn&#x27;t take up too much space, perfect for the bathroom!</li>
            <li> Updated Review 6/2014:&lt;br /&gt;After 3 years this scale stopped working correctly and now fluctuates wildly from 3-7 lbs. I used brand new batteries and recalibrated it using all methods mentioned in these reviews, but it still won&#x27;t work correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I originally bought it to replace my old manual, dial non-battery, non-digitable scale which lasted over 10 years, but was beat up looking...but it worked! I wish I didn&#x27;t get rid of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess you get what you pay for, cheaply made crap that breaks down too soon and ends up as landfill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original 3 star review 3/2011:&lt;br /&gt;Scale is nicely priced, very good looking &amp; arrived fast, but the black numbers on a blue background make it hard to read before you put your contacts in/glasses on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Occasionally I have to get on off the the scale several times before it will settle on one weight. It&#x27;ll fluctuate from a 2 to 5 lbs. difference when it does this.</li>
            <li> So easy to work and accurat</li>
            <li> easy to store and to use, the display is large and easy to read. it automatically turns on and off. good buy.</li>
            <li> Shipped VERY fast from USA Vitamins. No problems with the product. Works great and comes with batteries! ;-) If you read and follow the instructions as soon as you receive it, you should have no problem with the product. It is very accurate. The appearance is nice and sleek too. Not \\&quot;tacky\\&quot; or \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; looking whatsoever (if you&#x27;re even concerned about that). I ended up choosing this over a glass scale for the sole reason that it WASN&#x27;T made of glass. Definitely the right choice! Love it.</li>
            <li> I received the omega scale last week and I&#x27;m having a difficult time calibrating it. I followed the directions on the box but it&#x27;s still not working. Can someone please help me. Thanks. S.B.</li>
            <li> The scale is affordable, great looking, and accurate for the most part. I consistently get the same weight reading if I do not move the scale, but moving it to a different location changes it by half a pound or more, even after I reset it as instructed. Other than that, a fantastic purchase.</li>
            <li> I like the size as it is easier to stand on plus it is more stable. Readout is large and clear to read. The readout can be in lbs. or kilos or some other unit. This is the best I have found to give me what I need to keep track for my fluid for CHF readings for the doctor. Betty</li>
            <li> My dad ruined the first one I bought - he didn&#x27;t realize it was only the battery that needed changing. But I liked them enough to buy a second one.</li>
            <li> The display on this weighing scale is large and clear. the scale itself is slim and really compact. it holds the reading for a few seconds after you step off it. Overall a very nice and accurate weighing scale!</li>
            <li> I bought this scale because it received a lot of good reviews.  I really had high hopes for it -- most people realy liked it and many people said how accurate, etc it was.  Unfortunately, I was less than pleased with the scale.  Although it appears to be well-made, I could never get a consistent reading on it.  I would weigh myself and if I stepped on again 5 minutes later, without moving the scale at all, it gave me a completely different weight.  Not just by a few ounces, but by 1, 2, or more pounds.  Obviously this does not inspire confidence in its accuracy.  I calibrated it as the manual suggested, stood in the same place on the scale, kept the scale on the same place on our bathroom floor, and still, I never weighed the same weight twice in a row.  To be honest, I&#x27;m completely frustrated with the scale and will probably be Freecycling it. I&#x27;ve already replaced it with this one: [[ASIN:B0032TNPOE Eatsmart Precision Plus Digital Bathroom Scale with Ultra Wide Platform and Step-on Technology, 440-Pounds]].  This scale has a nice large platform on which to stand, is very well made, and gives me consistent weight readings.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 85 year old mother. Her old scale had died. This was just what I wanted. Very thin so not a big tripping hazard. Large and easy to read digital display.</li>
            <li> I love the scale!! It is accurate. You have to stand real still for it to register. I like it so much better than the one I had that would never give me the same result each time!! I love it and highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Modern low-profile looks fantastic...not your grandma&#x27;s old clunky scale.  Big, bright easy-to-read digital dial works well in any light.  Love the step-on/step off feature.  My old scale had to be tapped and then you had to wait for calibration prior to each weighing.  This one is so quick and easy.  you only need to cal each time you move it to a different place so if you just leave it be you are on and off in seconds.</li>
            <li> I simply love this scale. I find it easy to read the display in any lighting, and it is very responsive. The size makes it easy to stand on even with size 14 feet, and it is extremely lightweight and easy to move.</li>
            <li> The scale arrived quickly, but was defective.  I was too busy to contact the vendor, and I really didn&#x27;t have time to package it up and send it back.  The scale was erratic, giving different weights when I stepped on it and then off and then on again! It ranged from 4 to 5 pounds off.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Great product. A+++</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the scale works great......  shows my weight gain in big numbers...  :(</li>
            <li> Good product, I like the large screen and do not have to tap. We have been using it for 2 months with no problem. I recommend this scale, it is a good buy.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, no waiting for flashing settings etc., like some other scales. Seems durable. Like the option of switching between kg and lb. Bright large display.</li>
            <li> This scale is great - just step on and it turns on, sleek design as well. Best if you can find a spot for it to stay permanently, apparently because you have to recalibrate it whenever you move it...</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I was so excited to get this scale.  Upon first use it worked wonderfully and was extremely accurate, as time went on it started reading wild numbers and wouldn&#x27;t \\&quot;lock\\&quot; on to a value and would just shut off.  I thought it was my bathroom floor that was causing the issue but moving it to my wood floors resulted in the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t until I flipped it over to see if there was a reset button did I notice the problem, the four rubber feet it uses to measure were all chewed up and off center.  This no doubt was caused by my wife and I sliding the scale from the wall and then sliding it forward after we were done.  The friction must have caused the rubber to fail against my tile floors in my bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it would have been better if they used a hard plastic for the feet, or no feet at all.  I was able to repair and recenter the rubber feet with a rubber repair kit and its back to reading accurate numbers but it was a pain and I will have to keep doing it.</li>
            <li> Sleek, slim design. Super bright and big read out. Easily gets my weight (300lbs). I don&#x27;t need it to be &amp;#34;accurate&amp;#34; I just need it to change when I lose weight, and it does. Great for the price tag.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product so far.  Although this is the first scale I have bought and have nothing to compare, it has served me well.  Until now, I have been relying on the balance type scales at the gym with varying degrees of accuracy with wide variations on different days.  I sometimes would gain as much as 5 pounds in one day!  I finally decided to get a digital scale for my home, and I picked this one based on the price and the overall positive reviews.  Setup was very easy.  Once you install the batteries, you place it on the floor where it will reside and lightly step on it to turn it on until it reads zero to calibrate the scale.  Then it is ready to use.  Once you step on it, the weight will be determined, then flashes once the reading has stabilized.  The readings are very consistent as well.</li>
            <li> We were quite pleased with this scale.  It was very easy to calibrate, only needed to be placed on a flat surface (floor).  It has a very sleek look and design and according to what we knew about ourselves, was right on target with our weight.  Thank you for prompt delivery, a nice price and a great product.</li>
            <li> I Googled \\&quot;bathroom scales\\&quot; and printed information for 7 different models.  Then I made a table to compare them.  Two stood out on top.  I went to Amazon.com to compare these two further.  I chose the less expensive one, the Omega Ultra Thin Digital Bathroom Scale.  Have used it daily for seven weeks.  It is accurate, precisely repeatable and looks good in a corner spot in our bedroom.  I weigh first thing every morning and write down my progress in a little table I printed out.  I made the right choice.  The numbers are easy for me to read (I wear tri-focal glasses) and looking down at my feet area requires good lighting and larger letters and numbers...this is a major good factor for me.      I recommend this bathroom scale to anyone looking for a reliable, easy to use and accurate scales.  The Amazon.com order process is very friendly and the supplier, USA VITAMINS, sent it promptly in well secured packaging.  Oh, I must mention, my wife uses and likes it also!</li>
            <li> Replacing old digital scales.  If I weighed four times in a row, I weighed four different amounts.  These are right on and consistent.</li>
            <li> I purchased this scale a few months ago &amp; it gave me precise, consistent readings. After that, regardless of me buying new batteries it did not give me a reading at all. Numbers appeared on the LED display, but I was NOT given an exact number.</li>
            <li> This is a very sleek and modern looking digital scale and is pretty accurate.  I love that you don&#x27;t have to \\&quot;activate\\&quot; it or anything.  You step on it and it instantly tells your weight.  Awesome!</li>
            <li> I had a scale that I bought on amazon (EatSmart Precision Digital Bathroom Scale) and I hated it. I had it for a few years and it&#x27;s not that it did not work it was not very consistent with the weight it gave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally gave up and bought this one because of the reviews. I like the look. It&#x27;s sleek and very thin. It&#x27;s about the size of a record.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great. One of the things I really like about it is that you don&#x27;t have the tap the scale and wait for it to &#x27;tare&#x27;. You simply step on it and the number pops up immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this scale to anyone.</li>
            <li> This scale is the best.  It arrived in a timely manner and works perfectly.  Its display is awesome.  Lights up and is big enough to read without my glasses.  It is accurate and lightweight.  My entire family uses this scales and thinks it is great.  We replaced an old scale with this current technology.  I would recommend this scale and I think the price is priced right.  Weigh-in!</li>
            <li> O.K., it&#x27;s just a Digital Scale for home usage right...  My mission was to give my wife a Digital Scale as a nice surprise gift.  Well after looking &amp; reviewing the dozens of makes, models, reviews, pricing, perceived quality of manufacture, etc. in Amazon... I simply chose this model.  I have an Electronics Engineering background, and believe they are all made in China (big surprise, right), and they probably all have the same -or nearly the same- \\&quot;Strain/Weight Pressure Sensor Piezoelectric Crystals\\&quot; (that&#x27;s the actual \\&quot;techno\\&quot; for how most all these type scales work) which converts Mechanical Forces (weight) into an Electrical force (voltage &amp; current), that feeds the Electronic Measuring Circuitry.  The batteries (2 AAA type) are primarily used for the Digital LED numerical display.    So O.K., now that you have, but did not ask for, or need to know \\&quot;how they work\\&quot;... Bottom line, hey this Scale works, reads very accurate, nice Blue Numbers, is aesthetically nice looking, and the wife is happy!   Hence a winner.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice and simple piece of equipment.  When we got it, all we had to do was put the batteries in and set it on the ground and it was ready to use.  Easy to read and the display doesn&#x27;t disappear right away.  I gave it a four because it is just a good scale.  It isn&#x27;t the best I have ever seen but for the money, it is a really good buy.  Especially if you are not looking for one that is supposed to read your percent body fat.  I definitely recommend this scale to anyone looking for a good functional and professional looking scale.</li>
            <li> I was a little intimidated to buy a scale but after reading other reviews, ended up picking this one. Great scale, high range, and my toddler has dropped it a few times and it still works fine!</li>
            <li> I bought this item in June 2011.  It is now April 2012.  I went to replace batteries for first time and now the scale does not even power on.  I would really like to know how to contact the manufacturer please let me know if anyone has their information?</li>
            <li> My girlfriend and I were very worried that this was not reporting the correct weight the first week we owned it.  We are both pretty health conscious and run.  Obviously we thought it was reporting we were a couple pounds too heaver.  We both now agree after comparing it to the scales that gym, this scale is accurate.  We like it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, looks great in my place, plenty big text on the screen, and seems to be very accurate. At this price you&#x27;ll be hard pressed to find a better scale!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied, looks nice and accurate without any adjustments.</li>
            <li> I bought this scale on 2/5/11. When I got it everything was fine. However, a few months into owning the scale it would randomly switch from lbs to kg, ect. Not hard to fix just push the button to switch. Well, last week it just died. It will not work at all. I&#x27;ve tried everything to get it working again and I&#x27;m just going to buy another brand. What a waste of money...</li>
            <li> Scale does what it promises.  It comes on with a touch and provides a clear digital read out of how unsuccessful I&#x27;ve been in my attempt to loose weight.  If it doesn&#x27;t start lying soon I may have to call in Guido to provide a little persuasion.  I am happy with the purchase.  That is all.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this bathroom scale and really loved the way it looked when it arrived.  I inserted the batteries and used it right away.  It worked great, or so it seemed.  When I got off the scale and got back on I was at a different weight.  For a few days it worked well but then the batteries died so I inserted more.  It worked for another day or so and then the same thing happened.  After using up another set of four batteries I decided to return this scale.  I was very satisfied with the way Amazon handled my return and refund in a timely manner.  So far, I have not purchased another scale but continue to research them to find one that works well.</li>
            <li> simple to set up, sleek design, easy to use. awesome. There is nothing bad i can say about this item at all</li>
            <li> I purchased the Omega Ultra Slim Digital scale to replace an old, cheap scale that - for whatever reason - I&#x27;ve been hanging onto for years. When it started giving me odd readings, I decided to retire it to the garbage bin and bought the Omega to take its place.   This scale is thin, sleek and works perfectly. The display is large, clear and backlit, and it is just \\&quot;step-on\\&quot; ready; no need for annoying tapping and then waiting.   I wasn&#x27;t looking for anything fancy; I don&#x27;t need all the BMI calculators, body fat monitors, weight trackers, etc. that some other scales offered... I just wanted to know my current weight, plain and simple. This is exactly what I wanted, and I am very happy with it. Another good point: Takes simple AAA batteries which, amazingly, were included!</li>
            <li> It works perfectly and the design is also nice. It was also a good value for money. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> We really like this scale and the only reason it is not five stars is that we don&#x27;t a place to leave the scale and push it under the bed after every use, so every time we use it we have to wait for it to calibrate. Small problem I know but still a slight pain.</li>
            <li> very good scale. Will not work on carpet.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. very nice packaging. Quick setup and calibration. I would absolutely reccomend this scale. sleek look and goes great with my bathroom.</li>
            <li> We received our scale promptly, and it looks good.  The readout is large and easy to see.  Would recommend this item to others.</li>
            <li> The scale was simple to set up and is easy to read and use.  I would recommend it to my friends</li>
            <li> The Epica Ultra Slim Digital Bathroom Scale is wonderful.  Everything about it is &amp;#34;consumer friendly.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;From its streamlined, modern look to the back lit numerals, it is a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> WE have purchased Omega Ultra Slim Digital Scale, till now this is working excellent. The design is very slim and light weight. Response time is also very quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is Great BUY .... Full Recommendation.</li>
            <li> This scale came for a good price and seems to give accurate weights. It looks nice and is very readable.</li>
            <li> Had scale a few weeks  and I like it&#x27;s accuracy. The scale I used to use fluctuated with the readings.This seems to be true.Very slim and compact.</li>
            <li> Terribly inaccurate and inconsistent.  It will vary your weight every time you step on it. I stepped on it 5 times in a row this morning and every time that I stepped I got a different weight. I tried to give it the benefit of the doubt but I wish that I would have returned it asap.</li>
            <li> For the past two weeks, I&#x27;ve been dieting and exercising, and thought it would be good to track progress as I go with a scale. According to this one, I lost over 35 pounds so far - which is impossible. This scale is very sensitive. While weighing myself, I&#x27;ve noticed up to a 20 pound variation just by putting my weight on my toes or heels. Trying to be as centered as possible doesn&#x27;t seem to help either, because I still noticed 5-10 pound differences not even a few seconds apart each weigh in. I can&#x27;t even say this scale is good for a general idea of how much you weigh, because every week I weigh myself it goes down 10 pounds or more. It also refuses to stay on a single number when I double check my current weight, or even within 5 of the first number it gives me. Another problem is that sometimes the scale will turn off not even a few seconds of me being on it, forcing me to weigh myself multiple times just to see the inaccurate number it&#x27;s trying to give me. Other times, it won&#x27;t turn on at all until I fiddle with it. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone for any purpose.</li>
            <li> I purchased this scale in order to aid me in my push toward a healthier lifestyle. The scale works great. The scale seemed to work intermittently at first, but I adjusted the batteries and it appears that I hadn&#x27;t fit them in snugly. Everything is working great now. Numbers are highly visible and the backlit panel makes it easy to pop into the bathroom for a quick weigh-in without having to turn on a slew of lights.</li>
            <li> A nice scale---slim, attractive look, operates as advertised by simply stepping on it, unlike older models.&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied so far.</li>
            <li> Attractive, easy to read, slides easily across tiled floor, wide enough to stand on comfortably, gives consistent weights to a fraction.  Uses 4 AA batteries, included.  Also, it has a toggle underneath to switch from kilos to pounds.  What more can you want?</li>
            <li> - Not easy to use&lt;br /&gt;- doesnt work on the carpet&lt;br /&gt;- I tried to weight a luggage but it couldn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Easy to use, just step on, highly visible display, and also quite accurate when I compared to it to other scales.  I also like the use of easy to find triple A batteries.  Best scale I have owned.</li>
            <li> Really like this scale because it is so light and thin. It wil be easy to move from one bedroom to the next.</li>
            <li> Very nice scale. Easy to read and setup. Very consistent  Update! No longer consistent. Reset several times. Had only 6 weeks and non returnable.</li>
            <li> I like it pretty accurate with my other two scales, yes i use three different scales, so sue me</li>
            <li> After reading a million reviews on scales with many people complaining of accuracy I finally decided on this one. Who knew there was a mini bathroom scale war going on here?&lt;br /&gt;This scale is a lot lighter than my previous glass-topped one, so it&#x27;s easy to move. It comes with a removable sticker that instructs you to re-calibrate it when moved.&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical about the accuracy, so I did the standard dumbell test with 2x20lb, 2x10lb and 2x8lb weights. Well, it&#x27;s definitely accurate. And my 10lb weights are not actually 10lbs each...&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a no-tap, just step-on scale which is nice. You step on, it continuously reads the weight until the weight is not changing, flashes the weight on the screen a few times and stays on for a few seconds once you&#x27;ve gotten off. Simple, effective. No bells.</li>
            <li> Do not buy. The scale turns on but does not weigh anything. it just stays on 0 no matter what you do. Piece of crap.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a great scale, great design and accurate.  I always like to come home and weigh myself after visiting the doctors and this scale was right on.</li>
            <li> Just received the scale. It is Epica scale, not Omega scale. The picture and title is very deceiving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scale is fine.</li>
            <li> Thin, easy to look at, and thoughtfully sized to fit in the smallest space, the scale was an excellent choice. Certainly it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Terrible scale. Have had for about a year, and problems keep getting worse. My wife just weighed herself without shoes and then with--it added TEN POUNDS. So inaccurate. At first I chocked it up to changes in one&#x27;s body weight over the day, but have now realized that this a worthless scale.</li>
            <li> I purchased this bathroom scale along with a kitchen scale as tools towards my healthier lifestyle.  Both are junk.  The Omega Ultra Slim Digital Bathroom Scale is off as much as 10 pounds at any given time.  I&#x27;ve held a 10# weight, step on the scale and weigh 20# more.  The scale won&#x27;t even display a weight when I put a 5# hand weight on each side.  I&#x27;m returning both scales tomorrow.  I&#x27;m really bummed and have to believe that the majority of positive reviews are faked.  I do believe I am done ordering anything other than an occasional book from Amazon.</li>
            <li> The scales works nicely. It showed the same results when I tried it at different places or just at the same place several times during one hour.  So I&#x27;m satisfied with it. Would recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> My scale works great.  I received the order a day earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> My wife and I weren&#x27;t looking for a health-club-quality scale. We wanted something that could be seen reasonably well in different lighting conditions and didn&#x27;t take up too much space. The best part about the scale is you just \\&quot;step on.\\&quot; No extra \\&quot;press to turn on,\\&quot; then step on. You may not think that extra step matters, but think about what you could do with an extra 2 or 3 seconds each day, plus the joy of not having to remember a two-sequence behavior chain in the morning behavior you&#x27;ve had your coffee. If multiple people are using the scale, the time-saving quality is, of course, multiplied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, this is a great, slim, no nonsense scale that is very easy to use. Not for those who want to calculate body fat %, a WiFi connection, or an mp3 player.</li>
            <li> After using an analog scale for so long (that always had to be calibrated), I finally broke down and ordered a digital one. My parents have been using a digital scale for years (Weight Watchers) which I always thought was quite good, but I actually like the Omega better because you don&#x27;t have to tap it for it to come on - you simply step up.  Like some other reviewers, I also sometimes weigh myself twice in a few minutes, and each time I get the same result, so I feel the scale is pretty consistent.  Overall, I am very happy with this scale and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and excellent product.</li>
            <li> Came quicker than expected and in good condition.  My 10 yo granddaughter unpacked and set it up.  In other words easy to do.  Easy on and easy off as advedrtised.  Seems to weigh accurately.</li>
            <li> Pretty simple scale, digital, light, sleek, instructions included. Super reliable so far. If it fails to register, just step off and try again. Delivery and price from Perella&#x27;s Amazon was quick, cheap, fast (I said that).</li>
            <li> I needed the scale when I decided to lose some weight and wanted to track my loss. It has a blue light that is easy to view in the dark and easy to read screen. Also is a very accurate scale.</li>
            <li> Unreliable measuring result. Big different results come out when measure at the same time in a day!! 😠</li>
            <li> Eh I have to weigh myself about 3 times. Usually it adds about 3 lbs the first time I step on it. But it still works. Cheap price.</li>
            <li> The numbers are large enough to see easily. It is very slim and fits nicely in our smaller bathroom.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I got a lemon, but the scale did not give me consistent readings. My fiance and I tried it, and the readings were 5-10lbs off from what the doctor&#x27;s office told us, with fluctuating, inconsistent readings. Tried brand new batteries and got the same result.</li>
            <li> This scale is picky about your feet placement and turns off too quickly to get it right. Not happy with it.</li>
            <li> This scale looks really nice in the bathroom but doesn&#x27;t shout its presence. The scale is very accurate, showing just what the one in the doctor&#x27;s office does (unfortunately).  Definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li> This product is very lightweight and almost 99% gives consistent readings. There were few instances I noticed that the weight shows had +/- 0.2 pounds difference from previous reading. In our household, we were all below 160lbs, so dont know how well it holds for the 300lb rating.</li>
            <li> I bought this scale to replace a 20+ year old scale when i started a new diet  I wanted to get accurate weights so I could track my progress. The display is great, easy to read.  It looks good in my bathroom.  I noticed the inconsistency one day when, excited about a signifigant weight loss, i weighed myself twice, minutes apart.  Sadly, the 2nd time, I had nothing to be excited about.. Since that time, i usually weigh twice and average the two readings.  Not the accuracy I was hoping for. The discrepancy can be a few ounces up to 3-4 pounds.</li>
            <li> It came on time and works as advertised, and it is pretty slim. No problem at all so far. I Recommend it.</li>
            <li> This scale is unlike many others I&#x27;ve used - it doesn&#x27;t require you to &amp;#34;wake it up&amp;#34; by tapping it before you step on. All you do is just calibrate it after each time you move the scale otherwise it doesn&#x27;t need calibration. Then you just step on when you want to use it, and it quickly measures your weight, blinking the lighted display once it has settled. You can then step off and the reading will remain on the display for a few seconds so you can still see it. This would be useful for trying to weigh luggage, etc, as you don&#x27;t need to try to read it while the luggage is on the scale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t experienced any problems as yet with this scale, so it gets a 5-star review!</li>
            <li> It does everything a bathroom scale should do. I like the large numbers, which makes it easy to see you weight.</li>
            <li> How difficult is it to make a simple weighing machine and how can u make machines which would just stop working one day. Yes mine just stopped working after 2 and a half months, we did everything, change batteries, reset, remove from bathroom to check if it was humidity, but no use. And I do agree with the other \\&quot;bad\\&quot; reviews talking about the variable weight shown if you change your feet position on the scale. DO NOT buy this scale ever, save your money. For me all 24 dollars are wasted, will have to find another one now :(</li>
            <li> Bought  this scale to replace older analog scale, while weight does flucuate it is much more acurate than old scale.  The display is very visable and the design is slim &amp; stylish</li>
            <li> This scale is very accurate, easy to read, and easy to use.  I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> On-time delivery...and the scale&#x27;s a beauty.  Finally one that&#x27;s accurate.  Quality design and construction. Numbers are large and easy-to-read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would recommend it to anyone wanting a dependable, nicely designed scale for home use.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this scale, which arrived quickly from the seller.  Haven&#x27;t had any problem getting a consistent reading.  Very low profile, big bright digital display.</li>
            <li> In one day it showed 145lb, 147lb, 144lb &amp; 149lb. This is very random, I don&#x27;t recommend this product at all.</li>
            <li> Am very happy with my decision to purchase this scale .  I agonized over which scale to buy because I  weigh  myself every day.  I hate to gain weight so if I am heavier in the morning, I watch what I eat that day.</li>
            <li> I had this scale on a tile floor because I heard that a hard floor gives you the best results. But I found out that this scale is not very accurate, it fluctuates quite a bit even when you&#x27;re standing still.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The back light will also randomly come on and stay on, which drains the batteries.</li>
            <li> Just not very accurate.  Can step on the scale, save a weight and step back on and come up with a + / - 3lb difference.</li>
            <li> I ordered this scale because I was looking for a good scale that did not cost a lot of money.  I have not owned a scale in about 6 years because my daughter broke my old one by playing with it.  I found this scale to be very easy to use, lightweight, and does not take up a lot of space in my bathroom.  I highly recommend this scale to anyone who is looking for lots of value for their money.</li>
            <li> works like a charm. good price. just step on and it will read your weight. the scale is consistent so no worries about mixed readings. if you move it around you can tap it first, wait for the light to go back off then step right on. highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the scale for about 3 weeks now.  It&#x27;s not a bad scale, but not the best either.    PROS:  Attractive  Thin / light-weight  Comfortable to stand on  Bright LCD makes digital reading easy  Easy to clean    CONS:  Fluctuates by a couple pounds in weight (even if I step off then step on again)  Grossly underestimates weight from day to day  Needs to be reset or re-calibrated often in order to give an accurate reading    CONCLUSION:  There are a lot more expensive scales on the market today.  This scale is cute, affordable, and it&#x27;ll give you a good reading if you reset it before stepping on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this scale.  It reads the same as the much more expensive digital scales at my doctor&#x27;s office.  It is consistent if you weigh yourself more than once in a short time.  I like the way it locks on your weight and then displays it for about ten seconds after you step off.  It&#x27;s actually a very attractive product.  Well designed.</li>
            <li> It is exactly as advertised. Scale is light and thin so it doesn&#x27;t take up much space in our bathroom. The display is big, bright and easy to read. Also, so far we haven&#x27;t had any issues with accuracy. Great product.</li>
            <li> THE FIRST SCALE I GOT, IT WOULD NOT WORK.  I HAD A HARD TIME FINDING WHERE I COULD GET ANY INFORMATION AS TO WHAT TO DO WITH IT.  AFTER I FOUND A TELEPHONE NUMBER, I HAD TO LEAVE A MESSAGE.  IT TOOK TWO DAYS BEFORE THEY RETURNED MY CALL.  THE GENTLEMAN WHO CALLED WAS VERY COURTEOUS.  HE EXPLAINED TO ME HOW TO PUT THE BATTERIES IN.  IT STILL DID NOT WORK.  HE TOLD ME HE WOULD SEND ME A NEW ONE AND FOR ME TO SEND THE OTHER ONE BACK SO THEY COULD SEE WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THE SCALES.  THE SCALES THEY SENT ME WORK VERY WELL.  THEY WEIGH THE SAME AS THE SCALES IN MY DOCTORS OFFICE.</li>
            <li> i find the scale was easy to use and very reliable</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really thin but it seems to be pretty accurate.  Time will tell if it remains calibrated but so far so good. I read a lot of good reviews on it so I decided to give it a try.  Had a Weight Watchers scale but it fluctuated too often.  Finally decided to spring for a new one.</li>
            <li> Works great and easy to read.</li>
            <li> We have been using a digital scale for many years.  We have had several different brands.  None have compared to the Omega.  It has a very large, easy-to-read display.  It does not require a tap before getting on the scale.  You just step on and be still for a few seconds and the readings are very accurate.  We came back from a doctor appointment where I was weighed, I got on the Omega and my weight was the same as it was on the doctor&#x27;s professional scale.  The scale is light weight and not an eyesore in our bathroom.  We are considering purchasing this same scale as a gift for our daughter.  This scale is truly a great buy at under $25.</li>
            <li> deliver promptly and works great</li>
            <li> Totally satisfied. Looks good, works good. There are many bathroom scales out there, many different prices, and features, and variable quality. Went through several before finding this one. Good price and quality. Buy it and save yourself a headache.</li>
            <li> After viewing several scales, and reading comments, the Omega scale appeared to be the right choice for me. I appreciated the step on instant weight showing and the 10 second hold while viewing.. I&#x27;ve only had the scale for two months and thus far no problems.</li>
            <li> Very good shipping speed. Would have preferred better padding. Digital scales are very good, and accurate. Work first time and every time. Readout is readily visible standing up. Uses AAA batteries (convenient). Don&#x27;t use on carpet, and store flat. Very good scales.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the scale, I am Weight Watcher and have found it to be right on with the Weight Watcher scales.  I also like that you can just step on it you don&#x27;t have to tap it first.</li>
            <li> Just bought this the other day and was excited to try it out. Unfortunately, the scale didn&#x27;t work! I put a five pound weight on it and it read 0, then I tried adding another ten pound weight and still, it read 0. When I weighed myself it was easily 10 pounds off from the scale I used to own. I really wanted this to work because I liked the design and when looking for a scale of similar price, the Eatsmart scale reviews seem really fishy. Planning on going into a brick and mortar store and buying an analog scale. I feel they are more accurate. I have yet to see a digital scale that is consistent and accurate for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> great scale, easy to read</li>
            <li> Just as described, easy to read and perfect if you don&#x27;t have a lot of room in the restroom.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with these Scales. The numbers are large and easy to read. They are so slim, the bottom of our bathroom door can swing across them without touching. I didn&#x27;t want scales with all the bells &amp; whistles. Just wanted easy to read,  accurate weight scales and that&#x27;s exactly what I got. These are perfect. Best of all. MADE IN THE USA!</li>
            <li> avoided electronic scales for a while since they seemed to all have sounds (let&#x27;s announce to the whole house we are getting on the scale) OR /AND saved weight so rest of household was privy to this information.&lt;br /&gt;Like the sleek design, simplicity, and displaying the weight after stepping off.  Using scale to weigh small elderly cat held in arms--works great.</li>
            <li> bathroom scale was just as described, packaged well and arrived timely.  I have no other words to write and it is annoying that you require it.</li>
            <li> The best digital scales ever. Very accurate.</li>
            <li> Piece of CRAP!!! Don&#x27;t buy it. It broke within a week and I&#x27;m so pissed I can&#x27;t return it because I threw out the box</li>
            <li> Shipped very quickly. Am happy with the product so far ! Easy to use, would like to be able to input data (similar to the WW scale)</li>
            <li> This product definitely works great and I have no issues with it. It may be a little off by +/- .5 when I compared it to another scale. You don&#x27;t have to tap on it and the reading is very quick.  However, I came across one problem when I was cleaning it. Don&#x27;t use rubbing alcohol or anything abrasive. The Matte finish rubs off easily and now my good looking scale is ruined. There&#x27;s permanent streaks and blobs all over the black surface. Maybe I should continue using rubbing alcohol to smooth out the damage.</li>
            <li> It is a very pretty scale.   If you are not concerned about accuracy.  It worked fine for a week.  Now I can&#x27;t seem to get a correct weight.  I followed directions for stepping on and off and on again and it gives a different weight each time.  Oh Well you get what you pay for.[[ASIN:B003ATS2QC Omega Ultra Thin Digital Bathroom Scale, 400 lb. Capacity, Super Sleek Design,Precision Accuracy,Sense-On Technology]]</li>
            <li> If you are looking for ease of use then the Omega Ultra Thin Digital Bathroom Scale is perfect! I was looking for a scale that wasn&#x27;t going to take up a lot of room, was easy to set up, and simple to use. This scale met all of those needs plus it is an attractive scale for those of you who are concerned with the aesthetics. I have compared it&#x27;s accuracy with the self-adjust scale at my gym and at my doctors office and so far it is showing accurate information. After I find out what the battery life is like I will update my review.</li>
            <li> After looking around for weeks for a good deal on a quality scale we found and purchased this one. We love it!</li>
            <li> It is a small scale and definitely stylish. It&#x27;s nice to just step on the scale and get an instant residing rather than have to tap it first. Definitely the best scale I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think I could love a scale so much!  Quality.  Excellent!</li>
            <li> I love my new scales..They are slim line &amp; attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I weigh  there is no tapping required, and the weight is consistent&lt;br /&gt;everytime I get on, instead of fluctuating with back to back weighings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not checked to see if scales are the same as the Dr office but it doesn&#x27;t matter to me , because I use them more to&lt;br /&gt;evaluate my diet changes ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with scales</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed in this scale.  I did a lot of research before purchasing and it does not live up to the hype.  Actually, I can only get it to work 1/50th of the time!&lt;br /&gt;From getting it out of the box and inserting the batteries it has not worked.  Weight alternates, flashes through various numbers, then goes off.  I traded out the provided batteries with a name brand thinking maybe that was the problem, no improvement.  Very rarely, it operates as promised, flashes a few weights then holds constant on your weight even when you step off, but as above, that has been about 1/50th of the time, and yes, I&#x27;ve tried it that many times.  I did calibrate it the way the instructions said, something is wrong with it and I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this scale after reading fairly good reviews, but upon receiving it, and using for almost a week my weight varied daily by up to 7 pounds! No matter what surface I tried it on, the results were nothing but inconsistent! Returned.</li>
            <li> This scale is sleek looking, low profile, easy to use and accurate. At a great price, what more could you possibly need?</li>
            <li> Looks nice, that is it. First calibration, spot on weight. All subsequent weights: grossly inaccurate. 50 pounds off then 25 then 12 than 70. Calibrating and re inserting batteries failed to make change. Sent back to amazon.</li>
            <li> Thin, easy to handle. large display of the weight makes it a pleasure to use. Wish I had ordered this a long time ago . .</li>
            <li> Excellent scale; very quick; works well; order come very quickly; very happy; very slim; I very happy with this scale; You would be happy overall;</li>
            <li> After 3 months of use the scale wouldnt turn on when i stand on it.I have to constantly move it a little bit and then tap turn and then again stand on it.Even then it wont turn on at times.I bought this weight scale to replace my old one and now i always end up checking my weight on my old one.Waste of money.</li>
            <li> This scale is wonderful; it very light in weight (about 6 or 7 lbs), beautiful design, and provides accurate results every time.</li>
            <li> I love my new scale! I selected it based on other customer reviews and I am not disappointed. It is extremely accurate. I can get on and off and get the same number each time. The good look of this scale is an added bonus!!!!</li>
            <li> Attractive scale that is easy to set up and to use.  Will weigh up to 400 pounds. Was a Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> It works, it is slim enough the the bathroom door goes easily over it.  So far, it has been just what we needed.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because of positive reviews.  I didn&#x27;t want anything elaborate.  It looked like it would work out for me, and it does.  It is lightweight and simple.  There was a follow-up email from Perella&#x27;s customer service, which impressed me.  Since the unit is not \\&quot;fussy\\&quot;, there isn&#x27;t much more to say about it.  If you are looking for a scale to tell you your weight, with no other frills, this is what you want.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with my Ultra Slim Digital Scale.  Very comfortable to stand on and love the blue black lit digital display.  It has been a big hit with everyone in the family.</li>
            <li> I am confused with these digital scales. I use it and the older style to check my weight daily as I have been put on a strict diet by medical staff. I used it to check my weight and find it is between 2 and 3 lbs difference from a normal scale. So to further check the scale I went to my local doctor and gym and found the weighing scales matched the older non digital weight. Sorry but I am not impressed with this scale then again I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a fairly accurate digital scale and I am happy with it so far.&lt;br /&gt;I weighed myself at home with it and then went to the doctor and used their large, professional electronic scale and there was less than .5 pounds difference between the two scales. So I believe it is fairly accurate.</li>
            <li> It seems accurate , easy to read #s , easy to handle &amp; low to floor very pleased. So improved over the one we had</li>
            <li> The scale just arrived today. completly accurate. the scale is very slim and classy looking i just love it. hopefully me and this scale will become friends lol</li>
            <li> This scale is accurate, looks good, and thin enough to store away when you don&#x27;t like the number it shows you.</li>
            <li> Very slim so very easy to store. The number are big and bright!! So very easy to read. As for accuracy.. I hope it&#x27;s right :)</li>
            <li> I was exceedingly disappointed in this scale.  After having if for only 2 months it stopped working, the numbers wouldn&#x27;t settle down to any specific weight.  I re-calibrated it per manufacturers instructions several times but that didn&#x27;t work either.  Now I have to get a new scale.  Save your money and keep looking!</li>
            <li> This bathroom scale worked at first, for about two or three months.  After that, I began to constantly get errors when trying to weight myself. I was definitely under the 400 pound limit, so I&#x27;m not sure what caused the issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After that the scale became unusable.</li>
            <li> Item arrived exactly as described and it works flawlessly. Would buy again. Well worth the purchase price that was paid.</li>
            <li> This scale is really wonky.  I can weigh myself 5 different times and get 5 different weights.  If I move its location, a whole new set of weights show up.  I just don&#x27;t get it.</li>
            <li> This product functions well and will give you an average weight, but the one that I ordered will not settle on a weight and continues to fluctuate even though it is on a hard flat surface.  I would not buy this scale if I had known it was not going to be accurate, it fluctuates more than a pound in either direction.  If you do not need accuracy though, it is good for the price</li>
            <li> I like the scale for its looks.  It&#x27;s slimline is attractive and the fact that you don&#x27;t have to first tap the scale before getting on is a plus.</li>
            <li> We really like this scale. It stands flat so it&#x27;s easy to balance yourself. The readout is large and legible. I just wish a scale would be made that didn&#x27;t require weights twice when moved because we store the scale out of the way.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment before holidays, my mom is very happy with it and says it&#x27;s pretty nice and looks like it made of durable quality.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> The bathroom scale is exactly what I ordered, it arrived on time and works perfectly.  So far I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this scale. It&#x27;s very accurate and extremely convenient to use. It lights up and the weight stays on the scale for a little while after you step on it. It&#x27;s really slim and light weight too which makes it easy to slide around with my foot so I can just slide it out of the way when I&#x27;m not using it. My 20 month old son especially loves stepping on and off of it to see it light up.</li>
            <li> my bathroom scale arrived well within the stated shipment date and was packaged well.  the large digital reading lights up which makes makes seeing your weight very easy.  it is easy to store as it is very slim.  i definitely recommend this scale from this vendor.</li>
            <li> I love this scale. It is sleek, a nice fit in my bathroom, the bright purple digital numbers are very readable (large) and it is accurate. If you are looking for a new scale, this is perfect, including the price!</li>
            <li> I like the design but I don&#x27;t always get an accurate weight every time. I find I need to step on it a couple of times before it reads correctly. I have followed the instructions and calibrated the scale but still have the problem. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> No problems yet with the Omega Ultra Slim Digital Bathroom Scale.  It has been very accurate so far.  Very sleek and modern design.</li>
            <li> VERY HAPPY with price, appearance, and function of this scale. Would definitely buy again, and would consider other products by this manufacturer with no hesitation. Great purchase!</li>
            <li> I chose this scale because I wanted to see exactly how much I was losing each day. It works! And I love that I can see the screen so big and clear. Love it.</li>
            <li> This scale fits our needs perfectly.  We travel full-time in an RV and space and weight are primary concerns.  We needed a scale that was lightweight, thin, and setup easily each time we used it since it can&#x27;t lay on our floor all the time (it&#x27;s in a closet).  This scale fits all those requirements. The accuracy is excellent (brutally honest!), and the large numbers are very easy to read.  Shipping was very fast, and you can&#x27;t beat the value.  This was a homerun purchase.</li>
            <li> Super-streamlined, super-thin, weight &amp;#34;locks on&amp;#34; with no question. Excellent value for the price.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a nice sleek look and it is a great value for the price that amazon is charging.  Glad I got it.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Bought 3 for different rooms. Recommended this product to my friends. Low cost and good quality. Worth buying.</li>
            <li> I purchased this scale based on the many positive reviews but even after following the manual instructions very carefully &amp; replacing the batteries I have never gotten the scale to stop with one reading nor did the weight stay on for 10sec seconds after stepping off the scale.  In fact the LED display turns off before giving a solid reading fluctuating between 5-20 lbs while standing on the scale.  What a infuriating experience &amp; a total waste of my time and money.</li>
            <li> This is so much easier than the tap, wait. then weigh scales.  Much better looking too. My son-in-law had just been to the doctor , then weighed on this scale and it was spot on. 5 stars for accuracy!</li>
            <li> So far so good. Arrived within a few days, no damage done to the box in any way. I&#x27;m a really tall slightly bigger girl so I have to make sure I place my feet in the same spots every time to get a really accurate read (sometimes it varies like a pound or two if I step too wide or too narrow on the scale). Overall I think it&#x27;s a pretty decent product for the price.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this scale.  It seems to be very accurate, consistent with my weight at the doctor&#x27;s office.  My weight does not fluctuate as it did on my old scale where I could gain or lose 8-10pounds by stepping on and off the scale.  Now I guess any weight loss is on me!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this scale!  Very attractive, large readable display, slim profile.  And the customer service is impeccable!  Couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> So happy I decided on this scale. Love the design and it appears to be very accurate and consistent.  I tried it as soon as I put in the batteries, in the usual way. Step on, get a reading; step off, wait for reset then step on again and the reading was the same.&lt;br /&gt;For consistency,  design and price it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with this scale in all its beauty...until I actually received and used it. Ultra slim, beautiful light, inaccurate to the max. I ordered this scale because I needed a new bathroom scale that would be more precise and accurate, but so far I have been greatly let down. First off, the beautiful blue light will not stay lit which means that I can not get a reading of my weight because that&#x27;s where the numbers display. In fact, the light will actually turn off while you&#x27;re standing on the scale. Secondly, there are 4 wheels/suctioned that enable the scale to stay solid and be accurate, but ever since the first time I took the scale out of the box, one or another of these suctions have always popped out of alignment and this causes a 100 lb variation in my weight. This is very very inconvenient, not to mention icky, because I did not spend 25 bucks on a bathroom scale that I need to realign and touch its bottom before every use. I am giving this product a 1 star review because it has been very disappointing, and I regret my purchase.</li>
            <li> Super customer service...  will use again.</li>
            <li> Good bang for the buck. I like the product and would buy it again. I need a scale this size</li>
            <li> This bathroom scale has a large read out display, stays on for a few seconds after stepping off of it. It&#x27;s slim and sleek looking. Love it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on the reviews that have been written about it.  I can now see why there was some negative comments about the accuracy of the scale.  The design and look of the product is very good, but this is not the reason for purchasing a set of scales.  I was looking for a very accurate scale and this is NOT what these are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have weighed myself several times per day and conducted various tests to check its accuracy and they are all over the place.  I weighed myself at 10pm and again at 7am and had lost 2 lbs.  I then weighed myself several times through out the day and could gain or lose up to 3 lbs in 1 hour without eating a meal.  I bought these scales to measure my weight for an extreme course of exercise and nutrition plan.  They are far to in-accurate for this that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of the reviews on this scale and others and decided on this one. I got it and really loved it. It worked great, was easy to use and was accurate. However after having it for 9 months, it has stopped giving accurate weights and is WAY WAY off. I didn&#x27;t save the box so I can&#x27;t figure out how to get it replaced since it is supposed to have a two year warranty.</li>
            <li> It takes a while to calibrate as it was giving radically different weights in the first few uses.  Also note to keep it on a level, flat floor at all times. Some bathrooms have uneven tiles or whatnot.  It does take quite a few batteries, but battery life is OK. As long as you aren&#x27;t weighing yourself obsessively it should last you a long time.  The blacklight is useful and the screen is easy to see when looking down.</li>
            <li> Works just as I hoped.  It is light weight/slim.  Easy to calibrate as I don&#x27;t keep it in my bathroom and must reset each time I use it.</li>
            <li> I would give this product a five, but it shows me weighing more than I want so it only gets a four.  Seriously, this guy&#x27;s great.  I love the digital preciseness and the lit panel.  Now if I could just teach it to fib a bit!</li>
            <li> This scale delivers what it promises and words like a charm. Feels very high quality and is easy to read and sturdy.</li>
            <li> Tends to be a few pounds off but it works.</li>
            <li> Purchased this scale to replace a glass top one that only lasted a year.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier with it!  It is sturdy, quick on soon as you step on it, easy to read, accurate, and remains on just the right amount of time after you get off.  As always Amazon delivery was superb.</li>
            <li> Still working years later. Seems pretty accurate too and seems like it&#x27;s consistent, which is good. Great product. I really like this scale.</li>
            <li> Once the scale is properly set on the floor and is validated, it is excellent. It&#x27;s brand new! Also it came with it down batteries-which I love!. I use it everyday and thus far I have lost 4 pounds--just by keeping track of daily of how much I weigh! Love this product</li>
            <li> The scale is a great product. It is lightweight and efficient and does not require an intense set up procedure by the user.</li>
            <li> Not as accurate (for the price) as a cheaper one purchased at a later date.</li>
            <li> I have owned this scale for just over a year.  I didn&#x27;t write a review initially because there are already so many, and I agreed with the majority as to its many good features. However my scale has recently stopped working. There are a few others who have noted this problem as well.  Such a disappointment after only a year of service!</li>
            <li> This is a thin scale that doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space and its easily calibrated. I love it!</li>
            <li> This scale is very nice looking and unobtrusive with great readability for my old eyes!  Great product for a great price!</li>
            <li> This item was shipped and delivered very quickly.  It&#x27;s exactly as pictured, and shows weight to the tenth of a pound.  It&#x27;s also quite flat, so I don&#x27;t have to move it when opening and closing the door I have it near.  Very happy with this item as well as the service of the vendor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very nice looking, easily stored and accurate scale. It also seems well built and durable. We are very satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> The Omega Ultra Slim Digital scale is aptly named because the scale in super thin.  It&#x27;s like the size of a record album for those who remember what those are.  The read out is large and easy to read.  Great scale for the price.</li>
            <li> this is a terrible product right out of the box it did not work for me at all even after trying to calibrate it at least a dozen times</li>
            <li> Regret getting this as the frame is coming apart. Only lasted 5 months or so. No exchange policy so going in the trash. If you want a good scale that is built to last, buy the [ASIN:B006JTNWVK Gurin Precision Digital Bathroom Scale w/ Extra Large Backlit Display and Auto-On Technology]]</li>
            <li> The scale is all it was advertised. I am very happy with it. I like the slim design and it is not bulky like other scales. I highly recommend this dealer and would purchase from them again. Also , it shipped and was delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> this is a really great product. Good value and is extremely accurate. super light and thin - fits anywhere. clear display that turns on quickly.</li>
            <li> I ordered this based on mostly good reviews, but once I received it, I couldn&#x27;t get the same weight twice.  I followed the instructions by turning it on and then letting it turn off after you install the first time, but no go.  Then it wouldn&#x27;t turn on and I had to remove the batteries and put them back in.  Considering it was only about 20 minutes old, it was a simple decision to return.</li>
            <li> This scale meets all my criteria for simple and sleek design, space saving size, and clear display.&lt;br /&gt;The display stays lit for just long enough after you&#x27;ve stepped off, and is easy to read.</li>
            <li> Works like a champ. It is Easy to clean and it doesn&#x27;t get confused by the cats walking across it</li>
            <li> Very nice product which is exactly as described when I purchased it. I especially like the Sense-On technology and the large display.</li>
            <li> works great. I need to check my weight for competition and this scale is just as accurate as a $300 electronic one. No complaints; light small easy to use and sleek design</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick and scale is great.  Durable, accurate, easy to read.  I am on to a healthier life !  Biggest loser...</li>
            <li> First, this scale isn&#x27;t accurate for me. It always shows my weight about 5 pounds less than my doctor&#x27;s scale (multiple different doctors). But the real problem is that I step on the scale, get a jumpy reading, then step off and on again...and get a different reading, sometimes several pounds off from the first one. What I normally end up doing is stepping on and off 7 or 8 times and just going with the weight that comes up more than once. It&#x27;s really irritating. I don&#x27;t know if I got a broken one or what since reviews seem good on this scale, but I&#x27;m trashing this one and finally getting a new one.</li>
            <li> love this scale Ive had it for a long time now and it has worked great ever since I got it.</li>
            <li> The scale is a nice slim size and the display is easy to read in a dark or lighted room.  I use it on a wood floor and it seems to be pretty stable and repeatable.</li>
            <li> Accurate. Worked right out of the box. Nice and thin. Seems sturdy. Large well lit numbers. And, the 10 second memory display is terrific. Highly recommend this scale. Especialy for the price.</li>
            <li> This scale was working fine for the firsts 4 months. Now that I can&#x27;t return it anymore, it just stopped working properly!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty sure I didn&#x27;t drop 20 pounds over night, and even with the reset step that you had to do to calibrate, it&#x27;s still not working!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Such a waist of money!!!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sleek, visually appealing, easy to store, and accurate.  (I always check what it tells me against the one at the gym!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful scale!</li>
            <li> Item is easy to set-up and has a great feature to &#x27;auto zero&#x27; itself to ensure the weight shown is accurate.  The slim design is great as in my bathroom I can put it near the door and not worry about the door hitting the scale as it opens.</li>
            <li> this scale does not accurately take your weight. every time I get on it, its different. The scale keeps going off and on and sometimes doesn&#x27;t even give you a weight TERRIBLE</li>
            <li> Scale arrived quickly and as advertised. It is very precise but I have not confirmed the accuracy of the measurements. There however seems to be no need to question its readings.</li>
            <li> Very nice product. Sleek, low profile. Works easily, turns on with a light touch and settles quickly on the final weight. Arrived quickly and was very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> The scale was delivered in great packaging.  The scale is easily accessible, light weight and coverage is up to 400 lbs.&lt;br /&gt;Great value for the money!</li>
            <li> got out of the hospital,, they weighed me and I was 155 lbs, normally 175 to 180 nearly fell over, had no scale and wanted a unit that would show any increase LOL  it did and my wife will not go on it,, LOL for now anyway,, works great, great price, delivery was quick,, recommend this to anyone and everyone,,</li>
            <li> This thing works great, i love you do not have to step on and off, just step on and the weight comes up. Its display lights up, which is great. Have had it two months now and no problems, I take weight weekly. My one year old sits on it and likes to tap the light, and my cat occasionally perches on the thing, and no harm done. Its a good durable scale, and dosent slide around on my hardwood floor. Best of all, its not an eyesore.</li>
            <li> The scale works great right out of the box. Just installed the batteries. Would recommend to any one else to purchase.</li>
            <li> This scale performs exactly as advertised. It is inexpensive, easy to read, and it calibrates itself. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It works and is accurate. What more could you possibly want in a scale? Also is is easy to use and read.</li>
            <li> I needed a scale with a very small height and this fit the bill.  It is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t bother with anything but your weight.</li>
            <li> This scale is excellent. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it. I am very glad that a well-designed scale is available for this price. Very much worth it.</li>
            <li> I use this scale to weigh in weekly. It has to be calibrated constantly. I can weigh myself 5 times in a row by simply steppng on and off the scale and it will give me different weights each time...a total waste of my money!</li>
            <li> The nice thing about Amazon is that I can do all my research on products right here. This is exactly what I wanted in a scale, the perfect size and works flawlessly!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my needs and precisely as described.  Works very well for me.  Thanks for the quick and efficient service.</li>
            <li> Working as expected. I really like that I don&#x27;t have to tap and then step on - I can just step on. Huge bonus!</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I chose this one.  I had a regular scale, but it was impossible to read. I love that this stays on for 10 seconds after stepping off so that I can read it easily without my glasses on.</li>
            <li> When we first ordered this scale, over six months ago, I thought I really liked it.  As the weeks and months went on, it continued to get more and more temperamental.  We use this in our bathroom on a flat linoleum, so there is no wobble, or error in use.  Each time you step on this scale it varies between 1-7 pounds now, this is weighing one after another.  Completely unreliable, and just sits in our cabinet.  I would not recommend this scale.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful piece of equipment. It is slim and sleek, feeling good to the feet when stepped upon. It weighs one quickly and by the ounce. It flashes when the weight is set so you can monitor precisely loss/gain. The delivery of the scale was on time and packaged securely. I am highly satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 92 year old Grandmother.  She lives in a different state than me but likes to track her weight daily.  She had an old scale that wasn&#x27;t digital, so I bought her this as one of her birthday gifts.  She said it was easy to put the batteries in and use and she loves the large led readout!</li>
            <li> I liked the clean look of the scale and it is pretty accurate as per description. works well for the purpose purchased.</li>
            <li> A nice scale that is really accurate. My daughter attends Weight Watchers and their scale and this one is always on the money.</li>
            <li> I received the scale a few months ago.  When I first got it I wanted to make sure it was accurate.  So I brought it to kitchen floor stepped on 3x, same weight every time.  brought to bathroom, stepped on 3x same weight every time, and same as kitchen, did the same thing on wood deck outside.  same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;ve had a few months, I still get same results.  I once weighed myself with all clothes and shoes still on in middle of day right before I went to doctor office.  Same exact weight as doctor scale.  Right before sitting down I just tested again around my house and still the same as day I opened.  I like that it has a big bright screen.</li>
            <li> I love how easy it is to see the large, blue neon readout!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly. easy set up instructions. seems accurate. fits space nicely. Now I need to do something about what it tells me!</li>
            <li> Makes the bath complete!</li>
            <li> I like the digital display but not the sharp edges.  It&#x27;s hard to slide it on a smooth linoleum floor.</li>
            <li> This stays in the bathroom but is not water proof.&lt;br /&gt;Water fell on it and it doesnt work anymore :(</li>
            <li> I like this scale because it&#x27;s thin &amp; can be stored easily just about anywhere.  I like that you don&#x27;t have to tap it to turn it on, you just step on, it tells you your weight, then it turns off. It goes to the tenth of a pound, which is nice.  It&#x27;s pretty simple - exactly what I need.  It also takes AAA batteries instead of those hard-to-find watch batteries, which is a huge convenience.  Overall, it is much better quality than I&#x27;d expected for the price.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> Does not weigh right. Goes up and down. Used my old scale worked. Used my doctor&#x27;s scale same weight. Not happy with this scale.</li>
            <li> Love this digital scale being able to see results in fractions of a pound.I like the black/silver color because it is easy to keep clean vs clear glass. It is thin and easy for elderly people to step on and off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the service provided by Amazon and this company as well as the scale itself.  It&#x27;s very attractive and compact.  It&#x27;s also accurate.  I would recommend it to anyone needing a new scale - or just wanting one.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent, I couldn&#x27;t believe it gave me my actual weight, it helps me to manage my weight</li>
            <li> This is a great scale, so much better than my old digital scale.  Love the big numbers, and you weigh the same, no changes by getting on and off.  Very pleased!</li>
            <li> In order not to gain weight anymore, I was looking for a scale and found this one.&lt;br /&gt;This is perfect and stylish scale!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this!</li>
            <li> my master bathroom got accidentally flooded by me and water got in all corners of my master bathroom including my old bathroom scale. After spending a great deal of time getting that mess straightened out...i began to look for a newer and better bathroom scale.&lt;br /&gt;I found this Omega slim to be the best value for the money and it has large clear numbers easily contrasted against a pleasant blue background.&lt;br /&gt;I good value. I read many reviews of other scales but for my money this was a perfect purchase.</li>
            <li> We bought this scale a month ago and it&#x27;s been great. It&#x27;s accurate, it&#x27;s lightweight, it&#x27;s easy to tuck away to rid myself of the temptation to compulsively weigh myself. Great value, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have the Epica Ultra Slim Digital Bathroom Scale,&lt;br /&gt;400 lb. Capacity, Sense-On and it was delivered&lt;br /&gt;very quickly and was packged great too.&lt;br /&gt;We have the scale and right now it seems&lt;br /&gt;like it is the very best scale that we have ever&lt;br /&gt;owned!  It is easy to read the weight, gives&lt;br /&gt;an accurate amount, it is light to carry, looks&lt;br /&gt;good and we got it for a great price from&lt;br /&gt;Amazon.  We recommend this scale with&lt;br /&gt;the highest amount of recommendations.</li>
            <li> This scale was great for a short while but unfortunately the batteries died pretty quickly. We have tried multiple new batteries and just keep getting a &#x27;LO&#x27; message so now it&#x27;s absolutely no use to us at all.</li>
            <li> I really like that this scale feels so sturdy. When you step on it doesn&#x27;t move at all because of its low profile. The numbers are easy to read and a good size. The reading only takes a moment which is nice. Overall very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> This scale was delivered very quickly and works great. I like that you can just step right on to get your weight and you don&#x27;t have to tap it and wait for &#x27;00000&#x27; to show up before stepping on.</li>
            <li> Great size and works perfect. I highly recommend it this scale. Easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take very much space.</li>
            <li> It is what it is and it does it well.  It&#x27;s a simple scale that give accurate weight (I compared it right after a doctor&#x27;s appointment and it was &amp;#34;spot on&amp;#34;).  Nothing fancy but it works, it looks good and the price was right.</li>
            <li> The Omega ultra slim digital bathroom scale works perfectly. It feels good underneath your feet/body weight, it&#x27;s constructed well, and has a sleek, slim design. It looks great in our bathroom. I really like that the read out lights up when you step on it. The numbers are easy to read and I feel the scale is accurate. The price is great too :)</li>
            <li> I chose this scale for the slim line and the easily read dial.  We do like it very much and would recommend it to others.  It was a good buy for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carol Lewis</li>
            <li> I bought this scale to replace a different one I had purchased that had broke only after 2 months of use. I&#x27;ve had this one fore 2-3 months and works very well.</li>
            <li> Kind of closed my eyes and pointed when I was searching for a scale. I have to say, I have never closed my eyes and picked better.  This scale is super solid, and it is very easy to zero out so you can use it immediately.  The bright blue screen where your weight is displayed is very bright and easy to read.  it&#x27;s only about an inch high so it&#x27;s easy to store out of the way if you don&#x27;t want it on your floor all the time.  A scale is a scale I suppose, but this one seems to be in the highest quality for a good price.  I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> cheap, step on once and gets your weight, happy with it so far, would recommend&lt;br /&gt;large display easy to see</li>
            <li> works great got it quick and used out of the box simple to use would recomend for anyone to get</li>
            <li> This scale seems fine.  Only issue I have is that our bathroom is quite small and the Scale manual says to store the scale flat on the floor.  We have to prop it up against the wall.  We&#x27;ll see how that works out.............</li>
            <li> Works very well, stylish looks. I would buy this scale again at the same price, if thus offered to me.</li>
            <li> I love the slim design and accordingly light weight of the unit. The large heavy contrasted LED is a huge plus. I recommend this scale over more expensive alternatives. A very affordable and effective solution!</li>
            <li> Works great and stores easily so that it is not in the way. Thank you for this product, could not have asked for something better.</li>
            <li> This worked well for just about one year exactly, then it suddenly stopped being able to provide a consistent reading.  I have plenty of experience calibrating it so I know that is not the problem.  I also tried replacing the batteries but that didn&#x27;t fix it either.  Currently when I weigh myself repeatedly the reading will swing within a very wide range- 10 to 15 pounds or so.  Time to get a new scale I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I emailed the seller and asked about the warranty and they sent me a new scale.  That was nice!  I hope this one works for longer.</li>
            <li> This bathroom weight scale is very classy and very easy to use. I recommend it a lot !&lt;br /&gt;The light allows to see perfectly, even in the dark.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a simple, cheap scale that works well. Looks pretty decent for the price. Typography on the front is a little meh, but for the price, who can complain?</li>
            <li> Easy to read...wt. remains for a short time even after you step off&lt;br /&gt;Attractive &amp; easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;Compact &amp; light wt.&lt;br /&gt;400 lb. capacity is not always available;  this is nice&lt;br /&gt;Accuracy seems to vary but is close</li>
            <li> The platform is not glass, so you know its more durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two black pads you see in the picture are the ones that measure your weight, each measuring half the weight of your body left and left, and then adding them to give you your weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are amazingly precise and reliable, but you can&#x27;t weight luggage, or anything that doesn&#x27;t have two legs.</li>
            <li> Accurate, easy reading scale that looks great.  I like that you just step on and pause, and it locks on your weight and retains it for 10 seconds after you have stepped off.  Sleek, easy to clean and affordable, this scale has it all.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> this producted seemed to work for a few weeks. i stopped using the scale for a few months and finally decided to work on my weight loss. this scale seems to go crazy everytime you step on it, it takes multiple tries stepping on and off it to get the numbers to stop going crazy and settle on a weight. most of the times i find myself getting annoyed and not even bothering to try to get it to work, because i can find myself spending up to 5 minutes trying to get it to work properly. DO NOT waste your money on this piece of junk.</li>
            <li> The scale is slim lined, modern and dquite accurate.  It didn&#x27;t last very long....It dropped dead 6 months into it&#x27;s being in use.  I won&#x27;t buy another one.</li>
            <li> This scale delivered on all its promises, and it is easy to use. It&#x27;s much more lightweight than our last, and it has a classic design. Not much more you can ask for!</li>
            <li> For the first time, a scale that provides an accurate weight.</li>
            <li> Studied reviews and decided this was the scale for me. It worked perfectly for the first nine months. Then, for no apparent reason, the display began to malfunction. It came with a two-year warranty for which Amazon says to contact the manufacturer. I have not been able to find a website, phone number, or any other contact information for EPI or Epica. For that reason alone, I would not recommend purchasing any of their products.</li>
            <li> Great scale! Seems very exact, lightweight and durable. Very happy with this purchase.  I would definitely recommend this scale over one I bought from a store that didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> it is light. But it keeps showing different weights each day. Sometimes It shows my weight increased by 1 lbs in a day and next day decreased by 1 lbs.</li>
            <li> I Had high hopes foe this scale due to all of the great ratings, my experience unfortunately was not positive. Each time I got in the scale it would fluctuate as much as 8 lbs from the prior days readings. I followed the calibration instructions carefully and even removed the batteries to reset and I just couldn&#x27;t get stable readings. Returning for another brand/model.</li>
            <li> The scale came very well packaged and in time.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with the batteries and it works perfectly. I could adjust it to kg which is the unit I use. It is very light and easy to carry. Most importantly it is very precise.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible scale. I purchased it because the reviews were good and I completely regret it. You truly get what you paid for.&lt;br /&gt;When you step onto the scale, you never get a consistent number. At first it was 3-4 pounds off from the reading I would get from the manual gym scale. &amp; then the numbers would just start fluctuating, reading after reading. I mean you could get on and the scale would read 160, and then a minute later read 180. What is the purpose of a scale if it won&#x27;t give you accurate readings?! I&#x27;m extremely disappointed and it&#x27;s a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY.</li>
            <li> Its a very nice scale,. gives accurate readings. Without a digital scale, I was always  having to guess if my  weight off by 3-7 pounds. The digital scale is very accurate, classy looking for any bathroom and very light weight,</li>
            <li> Love the product.  Extremely consistent.  Thin and lightweight.</li>
            <li> I purchased this weight scale last December and I am very happy about it!&lt;br /&gt;Although it is mentioned as a bathroom scale,I keep it @ MY bedside and mostly I weigh almost all mornings,I keep track of my weight that way!&lt;br /&gt;So far the scale is usually the bringer of good news as far as my weight is concerned!I was able to lose 30 pounds with the help of this scale by dieting and exercising,with a keen eye on my weight almost daily..&lt;br /&gt;It is as important as those meters showing number of calories burned as far as a regulated exercise regime is concerned,measuring your weight daily however can be like a double edged sword and if you&#x27;re trying hard and yet not able to reduce weight or if due to your peculiar metabolism characteristics and/or exercise intensity/food/work habits etc for any reasons,if you do not achieve desired outcome,it can prove depressive 4 U..&lt;br /&gt;However,so far my experience has made me feel good about it,and the item is like the cheapest out there,with 22 USD for Amazon Prime 2 days shipment,this is a best buy 4 me!&lt;br /&gt;The screen is Blue,the body of the scale is Black overall with a Silver line in b/w,so it looks exactly as shown in the product image..&lt;br /&gt;It can weigh up to 400 lbs,The scale comes with 4 batteries,a pair of which lasted about 5 months and the second one is just in use..So it doesn&#x27;t consume that much power!&lt;br /&gt;They ship by UPS,which is kinda issue for me as only USPS can deliver me in my flat so that kinda sucked!&lt;br /&gt;Overall 5/5..Don&#x27; think that much,,just buy it,even if U lose 10 lbs it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> Accurate to the 0.0lb</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these scales for my guest bathroom and liked it so much I purchased a second one for my master bathroom!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice bathroom scale.  All you need to do is step on it and in a few seconds your actual weight is displayed in a pleasant blue light.  It seems to be accurate as I first weigh myself on this and then on a doctors weight scale, both the same!!  This scale is very light and attractive.  It doesn&#x27;t overwhelm the bathroom and matches any decor.  I hightly recommend this scale, I am going to order another for the downstairs bath.</li>
            <li> I like the looks of this sleek slim bathroom scale. The display is bright and easy to read. The scale isn&#x27;t always consistent however. To me, its not a big deal because I don&#x27;t really care if its a pound or less off from time to time, im really just looking for a fairly accurate \\&quot;ballpark\\&quot; weight...which is what this gives me. If you want a 100% accurate scale, I dont think this one will be the one for you. I have tried resetting it and each time the readings are different, not but much, but they are different. Nonetheless, its a good price, its sleek and works well enough for me.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised with consistent accuracy with in acceptable error margin. It does need to be placed on a hard flat surface for accuracy. I am rating at 4 as the LCD could be a bit bigger but its decent size for normal use. This is my second purchase as I gave the first one to my mom. It also comes with 4 non-branded batteries for immediate use which is convenient.</li>
            <li> The scale seems to be holding up well.  The style is great and so far seems to give an accurate weight.  It looks great in my master bathroom.</li>
            <li> I love this scale.  Unlike other digital scales, no tapping is required.  I tested this scale with my 5 pound hand weights and it&#x27;s accurate.  I really like the big bright screen and that the reading stays on for about 10 seconds.</li>
            <li> This scale is very attractive.  The lighted numbers are large and easy to read.  You do not have to step on the scale first to get it calibrated...just stand on it and your number lights up.</li>
            <li> Although we have had this scale only for a couple of months, so far it is very accurate and easy to use.  If moved, you need to step on it twice to get an accurate reading, but if you can leave it in one location, the &amp;#34;step on&amp;#34; works fine.  It is slim, lightweight, and looks good with any decor.  Very happy with it!</li>
            <li> Slim,unobtrusive and appears to be accurate.The only negative is the instructions, which are in really poor English. Fortunately, the scale is easy to set up and calibrate. Overall a good product for recording a persons weight.</li>
            <li> works well, no problems to date. Only complaint is I weigh to much, but that is not the scales fault.</li>
            <li> But, I weighed myself just before a trip to the doctor and the reading was accurate. It&#x27;s easy to read.</li>
            <li> Fits right under the dresser, its so slim and accurate. You just step on.  I especially like the fact that its wide enough to stand on. This digital scale is definately worth it.</li>
            <li> OMG...this is a Great Scale.  It is very accurate, and gives not only pounds, but ounces as well.  It is extremely attractive, thin, but sturdy.  The price is right.  Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product, and highly recommend this vendor.  Great value!</li>
            <li> Absolutely Perfect!  Took it in my suitcase to our vacation home (very thin and lightweight).  I added batteries, set it on the tile floor, stepped on it and it was perfectly accurate.  No need to touch it beforehand - you just step on it, stand still, and it lights up and flashes your weight then shows it steady.  Great for early morning or in the dark.</li>
            <li> Works great--weight reading is clear and fast and goes off on its own.  Looks great in our modern bathroom.  Would recommend this scale--now if I could only lose weight!</li>
            <li> Overall this scale was nice it went on right away once batteries were put in and is working the way it is suppose too.</li>
            <li> Works very well but I think it is costly. In my mind after looking at other products around I think the right price point is $15. But works well.</li>
            <li> Have purchased several other scales from Homedic, and this far exceeds all of them.&lt;br /&gt;The digital display is large and stays a few seconds after I step off, and the square design makes it easy to fit in a corner of my small bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a new scale to buy I would definitely recommend this scale.</li>
            <li> Very slim and good looking scale. It does not slide around the floor as my old one did, and I just love that I do not need to tap and wait for the scale to show all zeroes before stepping on it. I love that the numbers light up and I can see them without glasses. I didn&#x27;t want anything glass in my bathroom because I do not want glass around little kids, and this scale is made of metal and plastic. It stays lit after you step off, and I hope to use this feature when traveling to make sure my suitcase is below the weight limit - and it will make it much easier. The weight it shows is within very little margin from my previous scale, and it is consistent. But you have to use it on hard floor, and you have to stay still for two seconds for it to work properly. The only thing that makes you pause is the sticker on top of the scale that reads as google translation with instructions on how to calibrate the thing.</li>
            <li> I love the scale! Easy to keep clean. Fast shipping. Great price.</li>
            <li> I gifted the scale, my friend loves it, so easy to use and can see the numbers clearly, blah blah</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple - just step on it and it displays your weight. Step off - 10 seconds or so it shuts off.  Perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After going through a few others on here.. the scale is almost secondary. Programming them reminded me of setting the clock on a VCR. lol</li>
            <li> It does everything it says it will! I love that i can just step right in it and it works</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this scale.  It does the job of weighing very well.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly and the numbers are easy to read while standing on it.</li>
            <li> Want to lose 3 pounds in 30 seconds?  It&#x27;s easy!  Just weigh yourself on these scales, step off for a few seconds, then weigh again.  The bad news is that you are just as likely to gain 3 pounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried using it on a number of different surfaces, but nothing seems to work.  Sometimes it does give me the same weight 2 times out of 3, but who knows how accurate that is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a second scale for a friend, who apparently is having slightly better luck with his.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love it more if it said that I weighed less, but it doesn&#x27;t, so we are no longer friends.  Sure glad I didn&#x27;t get the one that talks, or I&#x27;d have taken a hammer to it already.</li>
            <li> We ordered this to track our daughter&#x27;s weight gain since she is now too old for an infant scale. So far it is working great. We received the item earlier than expected from the seller and carefully packaged. Great service. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this scale is accurate or just flattering. This scale gives me a weight that is about 3 or 4 pounds less than the two other scales in my house. I am not sure if those are off or it is this. But, if it is accurate, then it is an easy to use and easy to read type of scale.</li>
            <li> I suspect most of the 5 star reviews are faked or where created with some incentive. I purchased this product directly from Amazon. This product does not work, it will break down after 1 week of use. Do NOT fall into the trap believing all of these fake reviews. It is junk.</li>
            <li> It seems that a bathroom scale, whether digital or analog, should be durable enough to use on a daily basis. I purchased this Epica scale on Amazon in early March, and as of August, it is no longer functional. I had expected to not have to replace the scale for at least a couple of years, and I felt especially assured of the quality since the reviews here seemed so positive. We noticed that the scale started to feel a bit lopsided, and also that the readings were no longer accurate. Upon examination of the device, we found that two of the little rubber feet have metal discs inside that had completely worn through the rubber. These are the pivoting feet that give the scale balance and allow for accurate readings on uneven surfaces like bathroom tile. I completely understand the non-slip rubber for the feet, but the metal that can apparently wear through the rubber in no time seems like a pretty significant design flaw. Also, the features listed here include a 10 second hold, but in the several months that I have had this scale, it has never held the weight at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the product. It&#x27;s accurate. It&#x27;s slim and light but very well build. I would recommend this item.</li>
            <li> What a great scale--very slim, looks great and most importantly, works accurate. Best scale ever.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this product and would recommend it to buy if you need a new scale.</li>
            <li> Product exactly as described. Very happy with my purchase and the price.</li>
            <li> Works great and it looks nice. The big selling factor for me was it uses batteries that I can recharge. Most scales use watch/cell batteries that end up in landfills since they can&#x27;t be recharged.</li>
            <li> had it for a month now. working well, numbers are bright and big, no button needed for using and making me thinner...almost.</li>
            <li> Accurate and fast! Also, the slim and contemporary design fits well in my batchlor pad.</li>
            <li> I thought I ordered Omega, but what I got was Epica. It must&#x27;ve been the hot weather that makes the item change.</li>
            <li> Been using it for about a month and so far it works great!  Worked just as advertised.  Would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Significantly more accurate than what it replaced.  Easy to read.  Made in the USA!  Aboslutely would purchase again, though it seems this won&#x27;t need to be replaced for a long time.</li>
            <li> Replaced a glass model which you had to pre-step on before weighing. Also, glass surfaced scales need constant cleaning. Bright readout which settles down quickly, and reads in tenths of a pound. I like the fact that the batteries are common and easy to replace.</li>
            <li> Slim and accurate. Very much worth the price.. Switching back between kg and lb is good and the metric stays for 3-5 seconds after you get down which is great ease of use.</li>
            <li> Works well and beautifully designed. Perfect for the Bathroom. The feature that shows the weight for a few seconds after the object is removed, allows for the weighing of large boxes and suitcases.</li>
            <li> Very sensitive, easy to read, large numbers, light weight, seems to me thus far to be very accurate, highly recommended</li>
            <li> Initially was very happy with the scale but only lasted a month!  Quit working this morning and on day 13 of my diet!  A scale is critical to my diet plan in terms of motivation so wouldn&#x27;t recommend this scale to anyone. I will be willing to pay more next time</li>
            <li> love the scale cause it goes to 400 lbs dont see many that way great product. i like thin design</li>
            <li> I loved this scale! This scale weighs accurately and it has a really good-looking and modern display. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend this. I ordered 2 and both always show different numbers. I go on and it shows 154 then step off and on it show 149 then 135 then 160! that&#x27;s a pretty big fluctuation. The only thing a scale is supposed to do is tell you your weight and it was unable to perform. This was the case in both of the scales I got so I think it is a problem in the product rather than the specific ones that I have.</li>
            <li> We are vey happy with this scale.  It came within days of ordering (including four AAA batteries). The scale is very attractive and accurate.  It looks modern and feels well made.  I love the bold numbers and bluelight, as now I can see my weight even in the dark!! The instructions states that you need to reset the scale (step on and off)if it is moved from it&#x27;s place. It is not a poblem for us as we have the room to leave it be, but it&#x27;s something to consider if you need to move the scale around frequently.  I would say this is the best scale I have owned.</li>
            <li> This is a much more reliable scale than our previous 20-year-old Healthometer scale.   It seems quite accurate and gives repeatable results, though as others have noted it needs a perfectly flat floor.  And for Brits out there, it gives weight in stones as well as pounds and kilograms.</li>
            <li> I have had this scale for a month now, and I have found it to be extremely easy to use.  You do not have to tap the scale to start, instead you just stand on it and the screen is large and bright enough to use in a room without the lights on.  So far I am very happy with this scale.</li>
            <li> Works much better than old scale, and very thin. Fit perfectly in bathroom sideways between toilet and trash can. Needs to calibrate each time you step on it, but just step off and re-step and you&#x27;ll be a few lbs lighter than before!!!! (which is a nice incentive program). would buy again.</li>
            <li> Got this scale after reading some of the previous reveiws. Was not disappointed.  Th scale is both beautiful and accurate. I compared it to the results at the doctors office, and it is right on.  What a great value. Comes with batteries too so you can use immediately.</li>
            <li> the weight reading is wrong and it does not work properly.&lt;br /&gt;On an average, the weight reading is wrong by +/- 10 lbs. If possible, please avoid.</li>
            <li> The scale arrived incredibly fast, well packed and shipped. It was a breeze to put together and use, except for one problem. I don&#x27;t know if I just got a bad one or what but that beautiful light up display won&#x27;t stay lit up. About the time it settles on my weight and it locks, the light goes out. Forcing me to go through all sort of silly bends and gyrations to see the LCD. If I were naturally given to bends and gyrations, I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased a 400 pound capacity scale. I still give it four out of five stars, because once I do see my weight it&#x27;s consistent every morning, the scale was extremely well packed, and shipped so darned fast, and it&#x27;s got a very high quality feel to it. Even though it doesn&#x27;t work quite as expected, one gets the feeling it will continue to work for a very long time.</li>
            <li> great product ... as advertised</li>
            <li> This scale has been unreliable. There is a 15 lb variable and every time you step on it there is a different weight. The problem isn&#x27;t an uneven surface or incorrect weight placement as this had been the problem for all of my family</li>
            <li> I love this scale.  It is right on when compared to other scales I use as well. I don&#x27;t find any descrepancies in weight measurements.</li>
            <li> Turns on easy and is reliable. I like the design and the colors.</li>
            <li> Scale arrived very quickly and has worked great. Like the slim style. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Love the slimline design the calibration set up. The I love the best is after my you reach your weight it blinks they final weight. I highly recommend this product. Would make a great wedding or house warming gift.</li>
            <li> Functional easy to read thin scale</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly in good condition and performs as advertised.  An attractive and great scale, especially considering the low price.  If it lasts a long time, it will become an exceptionally good buy.</li>
            <li> I bought this scale for my sister for Christmas - one thing on her wish list and she really likes it.</li>
            <li> Great scale, looks nice in my bathroom and easy to store. It&#x27;s also easy to use - hop on, get an accurate reading and hop off. I highly recommend this scale.</li>
            <li> Great scale for the money. Nice looking and very accurate.No tapping , just step on and weigh. Huge LCD display with back light which is nice.&lt;br /&gt; Weighs up to 400 lbs !</li>
            <li> Item was as expected. Works fine.&lt;br /&gt;Top aluminum is pone to denting if something like a small bottle or can falls on it.</li>
            <li> The scale often takes a long time to get a weight, and often it blacks out before a weight is held.  Not particularly happy with this product.  Should work better.</li>
            <li> Works well and weighs accurately. The footpads are rubberized in feel and the whole thing looks pretty sleek for the price. It seems to take a few sample numbers and average them to get the best weight, which is great. If you need 1/10th of a lb accuracy this seems like a good option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to have no way to calibrate it, so the setup is pretty easy. Batteries are included. The scale just lights up when you step on and does its work. The final number persists for a bit with the light. If you stay on the scale it will go off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The entire thing fits easily under my shelf and would also fit under my bed so it can be out of the way.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Omega Ultra Slim Digital Bathroom Scale after giving up on the clunky old gym scale which has a 5-10 lb lb margin of error on the best days. Thanks to Amazon Prime it arrived in two days. I popped in the batteries, hopped on...and voila.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really? I only weigh that much? Darn I have some major eating to do till I reach my goal weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My own body issues aside the scale is exactly what I hoped for. The large LED display holds your reading for a few seconds after dismount making it easy to record your weight without craning your neck. Its super slim profile allows it to slip into most spaces like under the bed or the bathroom sink. Best of all now I can weigh myself stark \\&quot;nekkid\\&quot; in the privacy of my own home. You&#x27;d be surprised how much those gym shoes weigh.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money! I weight myself in the morning it says one thing. I check again a few minutes later to confirm my weight, it tells me I&#x27;m 5-7 pounds lighter or heavier. I miss my old scale with the dial. This digital scale is dumb!</li>
            <li> Based on my comparisons with other scales, this provided the best value for the money.  I received the package very promptly and I have been quite pleased with the scales.  Very consistent and accurate compared against my doctor&#x27;s scale.  I believe they probably have the same technology.</li>
            <li> I am fairly satisfied with this scale. I have to step on it 2 times to make sure I have the right weight - after I move it</li>
            <li> I have had the scale for only a few weeks and so far has worked as expected. I like the display, which lights up when I step on the scale. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> no complaints. No reason not to buy this scale. Works great and has a clear display. Now to just get that number lower :) We&#x27;ve had it for quite a while now. The best thing about this scale is it&#x27;s really low profile so we can slide it under the bathroom cabinet (we have a little space under there) and completely hide it.</li>
            <li> Pretty good scale.I check my weight every morning.  Only downside about this scale is that I literally have to check my weight 2 times and the second one is always right. Small glitch tho. Not a biggie. You just need to know how to work it.</li>
            <li> This is a piece of crap. I still can&#x27;t get get it to work right. I know I&#x27;m using it correctly, but it just blinks and comes up with some random number.  At least it covers my chipped tile in the bathroom. :-/</li>
            <li> When I first got this, I was using it in my kitchen.  But I quickly realized that because the floor bent and flexed, the readings were being skewed. I read the directions, and am calibrating every time I move it. According to this scale, I was between 330 and 360 lbs.  So, I put it out on the concrete slab in my garage.  Once I got it there, I was getting more consistent readings.  However, I recently started having troubles again.  This morning the scale thinks I&#x27;m either 331 or 352 lbs.  This is definitely not acceptable, I&#x27;m going to have to find a scale elsewhere that is more reliable.</li>
            <li> Very good scale. Sleek looking -- Easy to use -- Accurate reading -- Also no need to tap it before use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good necessary piece of gadget for bathroom.</li>
            <li> This scale has lived up to the other reviews I read on Amazon.  It is accurate and I feel confident using it in my weight loss plan.</li>
            <li> Bought this 2 years ago and have been very happy....now I&#x27;m about a week beyond the warranty and it&#x27;s no longer accurate. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get the same as replacement...just a bit annoying.</li>
            <li> Everything about this product is superior.  It is light, slim, and easy to set up.  Once it&#x27;s set up it couldn&#x27;t be easier to use.  The display is attractive and easy to read.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The reading on this scale is the same as the doctor&#x27;s office. It gives the same reading under the same circumstances every time. Once the lighted number stops blinking the reading is stable.    This is all a vast improvement over my last digital scale.</li>
            <li> It looks pretty and the battery life is great. That is the only good thing about this scale. It is not accurate. I will get two to three different weights, one right after each other. I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Excellent design, function and overall &#x27;perfect&#x27; for our bathroom. Step on, wait two seconds and you are done. Very low profile, no stubbing your toes on this one! Wipes clean, larger display than expected. Would buy it again, if necessary! Great, simple to use scale.</li>
            <li> the scale shipped super fast which is always nice.  the scale itself works great and looks great. weight is always accurate. me, my husband, and my daughter all use it and it&#x27;s been consistent for all 3 of us.</li>
            <li> This is a very good scale. I looked into buying scales a lot before I bought it and I&#x27;m glad that I found this one. It has a low price, it&#x27;s very compact and it&#x27;s just a good scale in general. I recommend this a lot!</li>
            <li> This is a great scale, it gives me an accurate number after stepping on it several times. Another scale I had would bounce all over the place. I really like how the number stays on the screen for a few seconds after you step off and the backlight. It takes 4 batteries but that&#x27;s cheaper than the special kind of battery I had to use with my other scale.</li>
            <li> I needed to replace a scale.  I chose the Omega because of it sleek styling.  I wasn&#x27;t disapointed.  It functions smoothly and consistently.  It also has good price point.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Sale is very accurate.</li>
            <li> The Sense-on Technology works really well, as soon as I stand on the scale it calibrates the weight. The weight is pretty much accurate, I get the same reading even after 3-4 attempts, the one which I had earlier would show me a different reading everytime. The display is nice and sufficiently big to view. I would recommend to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> The numbers are large, well illuminated and easy to read. The display flashes twice when the correct weight is registered and weight then stays lit for about 10 seconds after stepping off scale. Consecutive weighing shows consistent weight. I tested it and there are no discrepancies from one time to the next. This scale is very flat so although my bedroom door opens across it, the door easily clears the scale. The scale is attractive and not at all obtrusive. No need to tap - just get on the scale and it does its job well. Excellent scale and excellent value.</li>
            <li> This is a good value and an attractive scale.  The easy to read display and sense-on technology sold it for me.</li>
            <li> Prefect scale, styling and size. Don&#x27;t care for the number it gives me but that is not the scales fault.</li>
            <li> I like this scale very much. I&#x27;ve had it for several months now and have had no trouble with it at all.  It gives your weight to the nearest 2/10 of a pound, which is convenient for dieters like myself who want to congratulate themselves for every ounce lost!  In addition, it is almost at floor level, which is nice for older people who perhaps can&#x27;t negotiate a step up without assistance. It came with batteries installed.</li>
            <li> I love this scale, its light weight and you barely notice it sitting in the bathroom. I would recommend this product for anyone who is looking for seen but unseen in a small bathroom.</li>
            <li> I received my scale promptly and it came with working batteries, which is always a plus! The display is large enough and it has a backlight for easy reading. And I like how it&#x27;s calibrated with a decimal point that way you can &amp;#34;celebrate&amp;#34; those little triumphs.</li>
            <li> with this review i am being 100% honest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have now owned this scale for a bit over a year (1 year 3 months) and in the beginning it worked well. it was accurate, on point, and didn&#x27;t take long to calculate my weight but once it hit the year mile mark  it became WAY TOO sensitive (even when i recalibrate it) and takes forever to calculate my weight, sometimes it takes 7 tries to even get it to calculate a weight. Im now back looking at different scale. if you are looking for something replaceable and not planning on keeping for more than a year, this is great, but if you want an accurate scale to the teeth, this may not be the most reliable model. hope this helps!</li>
            <li> Good scale for the money.  Every once in awhile it get fidgety and you have to step off let it clear its brain and step back on to get a reading.  Has happened a handful of times over the year or so I have had it.  But for the most part no complaints.</li>
            <li> goes through batteries quickly but no problems after almost 2 years of ownership.</li>
            <li> This scale works. It&#x27;s ultra slim, ultra flat. Becareful if and when you have to move it, it will need recalibrating. Follow the instructions and you will have a very accurate digital scale for life.</li>
            <li> Husband uses this scale at work.  He&#x27;s a large Man and it is quite sturdy. He told me to order one for home. We all love it. We even weigh our dogs on it. Read out is very large.  Needs to be on a non carpeted durface.</li>
            <li> User friendly, nice design.  I really like it.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best weighing machine I&#x27;ve ever owned and I totally love the slim form factor. So much so that the slim form factor is an inspiration to become slimmer :-)&lt;br /&gt;Jokes apart, the machine is accurate and quite effective. I did have an initial scare because the weight on this was almost 6 pounds lower than the weight on my office weighing machine. However, I soon realized the extra weight is usually due to the extra layer of clothing plus the paraphernalia (wallets/cell phones etc) which one typically carries. I tried weighing myself before leaving for office (in complete attire) and the weight was within the margin of error. That apart, I like the large blue LED display, the fact that I don&#x27;t have to tap on it before I stand on it and that it&#x27;s extremely light (Makes it much more convenient to stash or store).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the bigger concerns which people have raised about this weighing machine is the inaccuracy of results or inconsistent operation. I believe this is not a generic problem with the design of this weighing machine but more of a quality control issue. Some people may take this negatively, but one has to understand that it&#x27;s almost impossible to have 100% quality control. The cost of increasing quality control from say 99.5% to 99.9% may be so prohibitive that it may not be practical for either the seller or the buyer. And that&#x27;s just not true of a cheap weighing machine! In fact if you do have some time try reading some of the reviews on Canon L series lens (or equivalent ones from Nikon or any other brand). These are professional grade lens and usually cost upwards of a couple of grand, however even those it&#x27;s not uncommon to have the odd variant which doesn&#x27;t perform as well as it should. (The real professionals even have extensive setups to test the quality of the lens and may buy/replace 2 or 3 versions before they settle on one). So what can we do as customers, just count our losses and move on? Well that&#x27;s where Amazon comesto rescue, they have this amazing 30 day &#x27;no-questions-asked&#x27; return policy (And if any Amazon reps are reading this, I love you guys for it!!) which even covers shipping. So if you do happen to be unfortunate enough to end up with a faulty version, just send it back to Amazon and order a new one :-)&lt;br /&gt;(Oh and as a disclaimer, I use this as a rule of thumb only if around 80 - 90% of reviews are positive; On the other hand if most reviews are negative, its  just a bad product!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, to summarize, don&#x27;t judge this product based on a few bad reviews, it&#x27;s one of the best weighing machines available out there at this price point and if you buy it you wont be disappointed; Well at least I wasn&#x27;t :-)</li>
            <li> Excellent scale in all respects - it is accurate and repeatable, has a large and lighted display, and slim design.</li>
            <li> Our old scale needed replacing. This one works well. I think it is accurate. It is easy to read and remembers that last reading.</li>
            <li> Bought this product to replace an old dial type.&lt;br /&gt;So far it reads consistently and the illumination is great.&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the price</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s extrememly accurate, but it&#x27;s not too far off.  It&#x27;s so sensitive that if you just breathe deep, the numbers change a little.  However, for the price, I&#x27;d day it&#x27;s a good scale.  If you need to be extrememly accurate due to medical reasons, you may want to make a larger investment if you can aford it, but for everyday monitoring, I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re very pleased with the scale. It&#x27;s very easy to read and seems to be accurate. We had no problems with customer service so overall I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Bought this scale to monitor my ever increasing weight and to hopefully manage a decrease through diet and exercise.  Anyhow, I very much like the LCD&#x27;s soft blue backlighting.  It is pleasing to look at and very easy to work.  All you need to do is step on it.  It then turns on and provides the weight.  Really appreciate the simplicity and beautiful design.</li>
            <li> The scale is slim and looks very nice.  It is not complicated and the numbers are large and easy to read.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a scale. It works. Not much flourish to that review. EXCEPT to say that the no-tap feature does not really work. It took  me a couple of weeks to realize that the scale was giving me a reading of 5 lbs too high. I freaked out that I had gained weight so fast, but then realized you just have to tap it first and then get on. The first reading will always be wrong if you do the no-tap, but if you try it again several times, it will always give the \\&quot;true\\&quot; reading (which thankfully for me is not 5 lbs fatter!). So, just tap, get on, you&#x27;re set.</li>
            <li> The item shipped fast and was here before i even knew it! The Scale itself is very durable, easy to read, use and replace the batteries that come included as well. Great Scale I love it!!!</li>
            <li> I have had this scale for quite a while now and it has held up through much use and a couple of moves. It still works great and seems to be extremely accurate. I would definitely recommend this over the competition in this price range.</li>
            <li> Ordered the product, received it late, only the scale was in the book(no wrapping no instructions), scale was giving incorrect weight, bought new batteries and was still giving incorrect weight in lbs(I know this because we have 2 other scales in the house and bought this scale to be a bathroom scale). Gives correct weight weight every now and then.</li>
            <li> This bathroom scale is light on price, but heavy on reliability and design. It is very sleek and modern and works perfectly. I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It took awhile to decide what they meant by press the key to activate, but once that happened the scale was weighing in pounds and ounces.  It looks terrific in the bathroom and I don&#x27;t have to worry about adjusting it.  Good product for the value.</li>
            <li> Love this scale!  Precise and you don&#x27;t have to turn on the light to read it!  Slim, and very easy to use.  Arrived quickly and in perfect condition!</li>
            <li> Great Product, works just as advertised, and I really enjoyed the value. I wish I could rate more than 5 stars!!!</li>
            <li> Half the time it doesn&#x27;t pick up on new batteries that I put in. And every time I wanted to use it, I had to push the reset button. And in the rare cases when it did work, it drained the battery in about two months with hardly any usage. Terrible product.</li>
            <li> Excellent scale and very accurate...Would recommend this scale.</li>
            <li> Sleek design and gets the job done. Also great for weighing luggage to ensure that your bag doesn&#x27;t exceed the maximum weight limit imposed by the airlines. If you&#x27;re in the market for a bathroom scale, I would highly recommend purchasing this product. This is the best bathroom scale that I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li> This is the best scale I&#x27;ve ever owned.  It&#x27;s much better than my previous digital scale.  No more tapping the scale to wake it up.  I just stand on it and it provides a quick reading.</li>
            <li> I chose a rating of one because I used it for two months and within that time, it stopped telling me the right weight anymore. I had it in the same spot and for some reason the weight was around 15-20 less than the actual weight, so I no longer rely on it for telling me my proper weight. Instead I rely on the weight scale at the gym.</li>
            <li> good scale. accurate and easy to read.</li>
            <li> I really like this scale. The numbers are easy to read and as far as I can tell it is accurate. I have no complaints whatsoever with this scale.</li>
            <li> The numbers are easy to read as the weight is calculating.  I will definitely purchase another one.  This is my first digital scale.</li>
            <li> The scale works as advertized&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was shipped when they said &amp; it works as I had hoped</li>
            <li> No tapping on the scale before I weigh myself. All I have to do is stand on the scale to get my weight result.</li>
            <li> NO BUTTON BATTERIES. Our other scale batteries always went dead, it had 1 button battery. This one uses aaa, and lasts longer. The numbers are blue, and large so they are easy to see. Large foot area is very nice, and it seems well made and sturdy.</li>
            <li> I really like my Omega Ultra Slim bathroom scale. It truly is slim and trim and is very modern looking. I like that I can just step on the scale and get a reading without tapping first. The digital numbers are big and bright and easy to read even if I don&#x27;t always like what I see! I would definitely buy another in the future.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a scale for several weeks, reading all the comments and reviews.  For sure I made the right choice.  I wanted it to track the progress in a diet I&#x27;m currently in.  To be sincere I&#x27;m not that kind of person with an obsession about every ounce, so if you just want to track the pounds you are loosing or gaining then this is a great choice.  Also, I love how it looks!!!</li>
            <li> This scale is amazing! i recentley started a new weight loss program with a nutritionist and i took the scale with me to compare it to her professional scale and it was only one pound over! even though you have to get used to the 10 time frame to stand completley still or it will shut off, this item is totally worth it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I bought this scale.  I didn&#x27;t think it was possible to have a good home scale, but it seems to weigh us very accurately and very consistently.  It looks great, and was delivered promptly.  Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I ordered this scale based on the other great reviews and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. It came very quickly, and it is a very accurate scale. I love that you don&#x27;t have to tap it to turn it on, you just step on and it goes. I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> The scale is attractive, easy to use, numbers easy to read. I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s accurate though I haven&#x27;t verified that in any way.</li>
            <li> This is a good product and works as expected. The price also is very reasonable. I do not think you will be disappointed if you buy it.</li>
            <li> We got this product a few weeks ago and so far it&#x27;s been a quick and accurate scale.  Our last scale tended to fluctuate with repeat weighings, but this one stays stable, even if I stand on it several times in a row.  Not to mention the fact that it is an attractive scale.  The shipper sent it very quickly and neatly packaged, as well.</li>
            <li> This scale is accurate and precise.  It gives me the same reading each time I try.  Just make sure you don&#x27;t look down until it is done and stay very still.</li>
            <li> for some reason, no matter how I reset. put the battery on and off, it doesn&#x27;t give a reading . It stay on \\&quot;00\\&quot; reading on the screen, not sure if this product are getting any quality check before shipping. Maybe I got the bad one at of all the rest. I&#x27;ve returned it and ordered a different brand.</li>
            <li> the scale works fine. but it only works on a bare floor and my entire house is carpeted except for the kitchen and bathroom. the scale does not fit in my tiny bathroom so i have to bring it into the bathroom to weigh myself. if i had known i couldn&#x27;t use it on carpet i would&#x27;ve purchased a different model. for now it will have to do. otherwise it&#x27;s accurate.</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 of these scales because the quality and price are unbeatable.     Very well made, classy with metal accent in the middle, it is thin in stature, but not flimsy or cheap.    While many digital scales are touchy after being moved and re set (this one included), it is still pretty accurate the majority of the time and worth the price.    Recommended 100%.</li>
            <li> We are not happy with this scale. It works when it wants to work and not all of the time. We&#x27;ve already replaced it with a new scale.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect after reading all of the reviews for it. But it is perfect for me. Easy to start and the numbers are easy to read. I stepped on it a few times and got different weights but they were like a pound or two different. I love it and can&#x27;t stop using it.</li>
            <li> Fantastic, accurate scale. Nice big surface for my husband&#x27;s big feet :) !&lt;br /&gt;Nice and flat to the ground so there is t much wobble when standing in it.&lt;br /&gt;Love the scale lighting up... Easy to read.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific bathroom scale. Thin, attractive, as accurate as can be. Shipping was quick. Just pop in the batteries and it&#x27;s ready to go. And the price is right. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very nice scale. great price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Weight fluctuates back and forth. Stays consistent sometimes. At least i know i am within a few pounds 1-3 pounds of what i weigh in at. For the price it is what it is..</li>
            <li> I weigh a little over 300 pounds and fluctuate somewhere around that number and most scales only go up to 300 or less, but this scale can handle 400, hope I don&#x27;t need it for that.  It&#x27;s very flat so scooting it under a cabinet or such wouldn&#x27;t be a problem, and best of all, you step up and in seconds you have your weight lit up and easily read in big numbers and it stays lit for a couple of seconds after stepping down, for those of us who are challenged to see below our waist while standing on scales.  We are out there, we aren&#x27;t happy about our weight but there it is.  These are great scales for all sizes.  Nice big wide area to stand on so your not teetering while trying to weigh.  If you&#x27;re going on a diet or even a little concerned about your weight and your hefty like me, these are your scales.  Tip:  If you do diet, don&#x27;t weigh everyday.  About once a week is all you should weigh if your on a diet, even longer if you can stand it.  Those long intervals inbetween weighs will be more significant and make you feel much more confident about losing.</li>
            <li> Works well.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> I bought this scale with great hopes that it would be a welcome addition to my arsenal of tools for weight loss.  Oh no, not so!!!  The scale is highly inaccurate. Having two scales (the first I know to be accurate)side by side, and getting a variance of up to 12 pounds is inexcusable.  My daughter was taking this to college so that she could weigh in.  Unfortunately, I ended up spending an additional $50 on a scale at Bed Bath and Beyond.  I have asked for some form of restitution from the company and to date have recieved nothing, not even an apology.  I have never been as unhappy with a product purchased through amazon as I am about this one.  I expected the usual high quality, and I have been duped.</li>
            <li> I do house calls, and I was looking for a lightweight, accurate scale measures to 400 lbs.  This was the perfect answer.  I like it so much I bought a second one for my home.</li>
            <li> I am a value-type shopper.  As such, I look for products that are excellent at what they do, while maintaing a good competitive price.  This scale is pretty, very slim and very accurate.  I use the scale daily to track weight and have been impressed at it&#x27;s simple design and ease of use.  The fact that the display lights up when I step on, holds the number for my weight for a few seconds and then dims, automatically is fantastic.  I don&#x27;t have to think about this scale, bend down to operate or do anything unnecessary.  Great, simple product that performs very well.</li>
            <li> Arrived as promised...great speed in shipping...very lightweight and easy to read. I got this for my daughter and she loves it. Thanks for honest representation.</li>
            <li> This scale is of very high quality for a great price.  The same scale is sold at Target (and their website) for over $60!  This scale reads down to a tenth of a pound and I have found it to be very accurate (within +/- 0.2 pounds).  It is also very thin, sleek, light, and low profile.  The LED screen is very bright and vibrant, and the big number are easy to read.  Five stars all around.</li>
            <li> Scale does NOT work on carpet, which almost made it useless to me. After putting a board down and the scale on that it worked fine. Well, by \\&quot;fine\\&quot; I mean the weight fluctuates a pound or two up and down while you are trying to read it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this scale (which weighs up to 400 lb.) and have been pleased with it. It is light weight, and quick to operate; we&#x27;re pleased with it.</li>
            <li> works great, i love the big LCD display, easy to read and looks very nice. order was delivered on time, I use this machine almost every day..</li>
            <li> I have had an old reliable scale for a while and was pretty happy with it. Then I saw that the modern generation has the nice feature of turning on without the need to \\&quot;tap\\&quot; the scale first. I settled on this one, since all other parameters (precision, etc) looked identical to my old scale.  Long story short, this scale does not pass the standard simple scale test: place on hard floor, step on, weigh yourself, step off, repeat 3 times after rotating the scale 90 degrees to one side. If a scale is good, your four measurements will not be different by more than half pound. With this scale I am getting random results within 5 pounds of my 190 lb weight.   I never have time to return crap, so most likely I will just keep this one and weigh myself with the scale in the same position all the time, hoping the margin of error will be minimal.</li>
            <li> Satisfied my needs!  The G sensor is really good. It always gives +/- 2 LB accurate reading. I consider it as value for money product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my mom and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I like this scale very much.  It doesn&#x27;t take up much space, the lighting is very sharp and clear to read (even without my glasses on), and I like the way it holds the total weight for a minute after you get off.  I also liked that batteries were included in the box, so it was ready to use right out of the box.  The price was reasonable also.  I would recommend this item to my friends.</li>
            <li> Was a gift for my parents. They love the large numbers and the quick reading. No complaints! Now I need to get one for myself.</li>
            <li> This product was easy to oreder, and came at the correct time that was stated.  Easy to unpack, and directions clear and easy.  I am extremely happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Perfect size, perfect delivery time, perfect product, and perfect company. Thanks and I hope the number gets smaller!  If you are looking for a cool scale with exact computation this one is  for you.</li>
            <li> Inserted batteries, reset to \\&quot;calibrate,\\&quot; turned it on and got a result that wasn&#x27;t even within 50 pounds of the correct weight.  It also fluctuated wildly.  Next time I stepped on it I got wild results between 500 and 600 pounds!  After fluctuating wildly not even close to the correct weight, it turns itself off.  Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> love it, right on the mark every time, give it a day on the surface your going to use to settle in and it will give you accurate readings  dont move around or you have to get on twice</li>
            <li> after my old scale died, i began my search for a scale that didn&#x27;t make you tap dance to see if you lost an ounce or a pound.  Ran upon your scale and thought give it a try, using some brain matter couldn&#x27;t hurt.  I was really surprised to have it a day earlier than stated,  works great an weighs you just my doctors electronic scale does.  I would not hesitate referring this seller and scale to anyone. Just remember, it doesn&#x27;t lie.  This from trial and error.</li>
            <li> My wife and I both love this scale.  We got exactly what was advertised. The slim design and light weight make it easy to place anywhere and leave it out in full view. This is a great product, and I recommend to everyone to have one of these scales.</li>
            <li> I am extremely impressed with the bathroom scale. No errors to worry about and it automatically gives the weight without having to prompt the scale at all!</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m pretty happy! It&#x27;s been a few months since I purchased this scale. I really like the scale a lot! Much better than large name brand manufacturers! If you&#x27;re on the edge, buy it. I love mine!</li>
            <li> Bought this scale because it was slim and no need to tap before you get on it, very accurate with the weight.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because of all the good ratings. For the first two days it worked just fine. Now, I get two different readings everyday. The first reading is always 4lbs heavier that the second. I take the second reading about 2 min after the first. Its always first thing in the morning and always in the same spot om the tile floor.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I cant get an accurate reading because its all over the place.  I have it on a level surface but the numbers just keep changing.  I do see that the weight that shows is in the same area because I also check the scale at work for verification and it normally gives the same weight plus or minus a couple pounds.  Not a deal breaker for me but may be for others.</li>
            <li> This scale is very accurate, and equals the amounts when I weigh in on the doctor&#x27;s scales and gym scales. I just wish it provided different numbers. ;-)</li>
            <li> I was looking for a scale that was digital, but not glass. This scale fits perfectly in the small space under my bathroom vanity.</li>
            <li> Best scale I have ever owned. It&#x27;s my second one so I knew what I was getting. It&#x27;s got a huge readout and is very accurate.</li>
            <li> I love this scale! I&#x27;m a bigger guy so finding a tough digital scale is a must for accurate weight readings. It&#x27;s tough slim, and you just step right on.</li>
            <li> Gives me a different weight every time I step on it.</li>
            <li> I love this scale.My weight on it is the same as my weight on my doctor&#x27;s scale. I love the fact that it is lit, so I do not need a light on to use it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I kept one and gave one away as a Christmas gift.  Appears to be accurate and was very simple to start.</li>
            <li> Simple, easy to use, streamlined and durable.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I seldom write reviews, but I am going to for the Omega Ultra Slim Digital Bathroom Scale.&lt;br /&gt;I like that you do not have to step your toe on the scale before weighing. The thin design makes it easy to move if necessary and the large numbers are easy to read. I wanted a scale that did not require special batteries which is another reason I like this scale.</li>
            <li> I like this scale very much.  It&#x27;s definitely accurate, as my weight was the same at home and at my doctors office.  I like the slim body and that it&#x27;s light weight.</li>
            <li> I am finally writing a review for this. I purchased this scale about 2 years ago and the scale finally died. I upgraded for a higher quality scale which also reads BMI and other weight-factors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I compared the Omega to the new one and found that this one weighs you 4-5 pounds heavier than you are. It does not calibrate well. Often you&#x27;d have to place it on the floor and turn it on, then off, 2-3 times to get a close-to-accurate reading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore I&#x27;m not very heavy, and I babied this scale the 2 years I owned it. I feel like a 2-year lifespan is a little bit lacking in a scale. The one I owned prior to purchasing the Omega lasted 5 years. My recommendation is spending a little more to get one of the nicer scales on the market that read BMI and have better calibrating options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for the price the scale is inexpensive and it&#x27;ll give you at least 2 years of faithful weighing service 4-5 pounds off until it dies suddenly in the middle of the night.</li>
            <li> Great bang for your buck here. No issues with it!</li>
            <li> It does its job and really helps me know and understand how much I weigh!  To the tenth of a pound even!</li>
            <li> I use every day and find it easy to read and store when I don&#x27;t need it. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> It works fine but I&#x27;m not particularly fond of the rubber fixtures and the little magnet things on the bottom. One of mine has ripped somehow and the little magnet slides out sometimes. I wish it were made sturdier, but I can just slide the magnet back in and it works fine. I guess most digital scales these days use those little rubber things on their bottoms, which is the same problem I had with my last scale. (Shrug)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But other than that, I get the same reading every time as long as I stand up straight and I don&#x27;t wobble around too much.</li>
            <li> Read all the reviews and this seemed to be the one....they were right!  Great choice for a bathroom scale.  Looks nice, slim-lined, accurate.  Good buy!</li>
            <li> I purchased this scale because I am on a doctor&#x27;s diet plan. Every time I went for my monthly weigh in my scale was always under by 4 pounds. This scale is almost right on from my doctor&#x27;s scale. I also like that it shows pounds and ounces. Plus it looks nice in my bathroom! Would def recommend</li>
            <li> This scale delivers what it promises. It is stylish, attractive, and a breeze to operate. A great value. We are very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Had to step on it three times before I got consecutive results. However, after that it worked perfectly. The scale is really thin and so simple to use. Also, the LCD screen is really bright and works well.</li>
            <li> It was kind of scary stepping on this for the first time. This thing works GREAT...No waiting just step and go...Seems like it is going to withstand 350lbs. for awhile..Soon it will start reading lower numbers..And if it dont I&#x27;m gonna send it back...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I&#x27;m giving this thing a workout every time I get on it but it works well, seems accurate &amp; is quite cool looking!  No issues at all so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE** Six months later after once weekly use it has died.  Replaced batteries, etc but nothing!  2 messages left with vendor no call backs &amp; AMZ will only refund (1/2 of purch price) apparently not exchange so I&#x27;m out my money and looking for a new &amp; more reliable scale again...</li>
            <li> Very easy to read numbers and comfortable to stand on</li>
            <li> easy to read and can be placed anywhere you want .. slip under chair or whatever</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this scale - arrived packaged well and is nice and slim. Even better that it continues to track a weight loss which I give credit to hard work and an accurate scale! Easy to read and enjoy the flashing of the weight - kind of like a High five sign for my AM weigh in!!!</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness....! Why did I wait so LONG to order this fantastic scale?? Slim....simple....works great (hey, I even weighed myself after going to the bathroom in the a.m, and after drinking some water, and the ounces changed!! :))) lol) So easy...works great...and the numbers are large and easy to read. LOVE THIS SCALE :D Thank you!</li>
            <li> Bought this after returning another scale. I love this scale. Works great. No issues with it at all. Consistent.</li>
            <li> When other scales just tell me &amp;#34;E&amp;#34;  (which I suppose must mean Excellent) this one give me a number for my large self.</li>
            <li> This scale is completely off. The readings are not accurate at all and no two readings are ever the same. Terrible purchase and it&#x27;s too late to return it.</li>
            <li> Easy to set up and accurate.  Never needs batteries.  Maybe I should get on it more often.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this scale at Amazon and it arrived quickly in the mail. After using it a few times I didn&#x27;t think much of it and I didn&#x27;t understand why it suddenly started measuring me in kg. rather than pounds. So I went on Amazon to read the reviews hoping I would find out why this was happening and ironically in the 10th review I read , which was a highly negative one ,the writer mentioned a kg/lb button. I looked on the bottom of the scale and (LOL) there was the button! I hadn&#x27;t been very meticulous in looking at the scale or it&#x27;s functions. Now that I look at it and use it I realize I accidentally purchased a great product. It is appealing in appearance and it measures accurately and the price was good. What else can I ask for in a product?</li>
            <li> My husband and I are both fluffy people and getting older.  This scale can handle our weight and has huge glow in the dark letters.  Not only that but I have the unfortunate honor of saying it agrees 100% with the doctor&#x27;s scale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scale was shipped when the company said it would be and arrived the earliest possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this inexpensive scale to anyone.</li>
            <li> A nice looking scale that is accurate to two tenths of a pound.  Backlit screen makes it easy to read in the dark.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a digital scale - there&#x27;s not a lot of complexity to it! But I like that it can be moved and re-calibrated very easily. It&#x27;s small enough to stash away on a shelf and you don&#x27;t have to worry about screwing it up every time you move it.</li>
            <li> This is a good scale. I like that it&#x27;s thin, light, and wide, with a large backlit display. It&#x27;s a bit annoying that it has to be calibrated every time it&#x27;s moved, but that&#x27;s really simple, so it&#x27;s not a big deal. It seems to be pretty accurate, with good repeatability, but I don&#x27;t really have another scale to compare it to, so who knows. I&#x27;ve only had it for a few months, so we&#x27;ll see how well it holds up over time.</li>
            <li> I only had this scale for a few weeks but for some reason it&#x27;s not reading my accurate weight and know its not reading at all. I even changed the batteries.</li>
            <li> This came a day earlier than scheduled! The scale is extremely accurate. I weighed myself on a beam scale at the Dr office and then at home and it was the same! This scale is easy to use, just step on it! No need to tap it first to turn it on. It works like a scale should, just step on it. The display is large and clear in a soft blue backlight. It comes with batteries, it&#x27;s stylish, works perfectly, very accurate. Fantastic scale!</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying the scale is great. I like the large LCD screen which lets me see without my glasses on how much I weigh. I also like that it is small, compact, and also holds your weight for a little longer after you step off, on its screen so you can get a look in case you haven&#x27;t seen. Overall it is very good in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;My only concern is that it gives different weights within minutes. The difference is just a few ounces or once about a pound, so I don&#x27;t see it as a big problem. I already have been keeping track of my weight and thus far the scale is helping me achieve my goals.</li>
            <li> arrived quickly &amp; looks great however i am returning d/t a different weight reading every time i step on it.&lt;br /&gt;maybe it&#x27;s my floors or something but doesn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> The scale requires you to be perfectly still while it weighs you. I must get use to it.They do instruct you to hold on to the wall if you have trouble staying still.</li>
            <li> I got this about a month ago and have been using it every morning since. So far the scale works well; I had no trouble getting it calibrated at first use and the batteries seem fine. I like that the weight stays on the screen for a few seconds to give you time to convince yourself and make your peace with it! :D</li>
            <li> Good quality product that&#x27;s just as described.  Excellent display that is easy to read and see in any light.  Sense-on works perfectly.</li>
            <li> This scale is an awesome product. I generally dont worry too much about my weight, since i can easily gauge weight gain or loss based on how I look (I guess most people can do this). Nonetheless, an objective number such as weight serves helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scales reads very quickly and maintains consistency over time. I mean, it&#x27;s a scale. It&#x27;s not supposed to do much else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What does bother me, however, is my weight change from before I use the bathroom to after I use the bathroom. The weight change is often a surprisingly higher number (~5lbs) even though it does not look it. Still, wouldbuyagain/10.</li>
            <li> I really like these scales. The numbers are large and clear and it seems to be accurate. They are thin and light so can be stored easily</li>
            <li> What more does one need to say? Instant on is great Finalizes weight quickly and holds a few seconds which is convenient Accurate</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this scale for a couple weeks and I have to say I really do enjoy it. It was very easy to setup once I got it. When you step on it, the screen lights up blue and the scale begins to read your weight. When it&#x27;s complete, which doesn&#x27;t take long at all, the numbers start to flash. One perk I really enjoy is how thin the scale is. I can slide it underneath the cabinet and don&#x27;t have to worry about it. Another perk is that the numbers on the screen are easy to read, which I really like. The design is also very nice. Overall, this is a great product to add to your home if you are looking for a bathroom scale.    Update 2/27/2015  I&#x27;ve noticed that the scale isn&#x27;t always accurate.  Sometimes I will step on, weigh myself, step off, wait a bit, and then step back on again and my weight changes by a few pounds.  I haven&#x27;t done anything during this \\&quot;waiting period\\&quot; besides brush my teeth or comb my hair, etc., something that shouldn&#x27;t change my weight.  Since I&#x27;ve noticed this, I always weigh myself twice to make sure I get an accurate reading.  Because of this, I have dropped my rating from a five star to a four star.  It is still a decent bathroom scale, but just be a little wary if you only use it once in a short period to weigh yourself.</li>
            <li> The Product is OK but seems to have some problem with the weighing.Sometimes machine stop working and shows only dash  instead of showing weight.</li>
            <li> This scale is so light and slim. I especially like how easy it is to see what my weight is. It is very accurate.</li>
            <li> Excellent price for a quality product.  Looks attractive and works well.  I am very pleased with this purchase.  Would recommend to friends looking for a scale.</li>
            <li> My assumption is that the slim design of this device require an especially level surface compared to other bathroom scales. I am temporarily living in a dump of an apartment and the tiling on my bathroom floor is not completely level(certainly not noticeable by eye). I had to fiddle around with the scale because I kept on getting readings within a 10-pound range even though the precision is set to  .4lb (reading is incremented by .4).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device looks decent with its nice big illuminated display but I don&#x27;t want to have to bend down and test the scale for any wobbling whenever I want to take it out to weigh myself. For what its worth, I dont have this problem with a cheap analog bathroom scale</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the scale.  It is lightweight, records weight and light and number remains on for a couple of seconds after one has stepped off, so one can see it well. Price was good. Delivery was as promised and I can highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Read about lots of scales before settling on this one.  I was amused by the posters who said the scale stopped working almost immediately after opening the box.  I&#x27;ve had this about 2 months and haven&#x27;t had any problems at all.  Accurate and consistent.  Great buy for the price.</li>
            <li> Everything works great.  The scale is accurate, the display is bright and I am happy with this purchase.  Just make sure and set it on level ground (like tile or something), carpet doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice scale, somtimes might be off by a few pounds but for the most part its pretty accurate, we are happy with it!</li>
            <li> This is the worst scale I have ever owned. My results are inconsistent and inaccurate. Every time I step on my weight varies by anywhere between .6 and 3 pounds. I recently used it to weigh a suitcase and when I had it weighed at the airport there was an 8 pound difference.</li>
            <li> the scale is good looking, calibrates very quickly. a good purchase and excellent price.very happy with this purchase so far</li>
            <li> The scale stopped working 1 week after it was received.  I replaced the batteries and reset it, and it still measures 100 pounds off. I wish I was only 50 pounds...</li>
            <li> I bought this scale about 4 months ago and just put it in the trash today.  Not a good return on my investment.  It just started giving me all kinds of readings (10+, 8+, correct, 6+,...) and after giving it chance after chance for 4 weeks I gave up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, I store the scale on its side (recommended you don&#x27;t on box I think), but alot of people must because we have to fit it somewhere in the bathroom.  That may have affected it, but I have had scales for years that I keep on the side and no issues....</li>
            <li> A great bathroom scale that seems to be as accurate as the expensive scales you&#x27;ll find at the gym or doctor&#x27;s office.  I also use this to weigh my little ones (4 and 1 yrs) and document their weight gain.  It takes about 2-3 seconds and then flashes to let you know that you can step off and check out your weight.  The weight is recorded for about 3-4 seconds and then erases and turns off.</li>
            <li> This Omega scale seems to be a good basic scale- it&#x27;s relatively cheap, and seems to give accurate and consistent readings.  would reccommend</li>
            <li> So far, this scale is awesome! It seems to be very accurate and it&#x27;s nice that you don&#x27;t have to tap it to turn it on-- you just step on. It has a nice, bright blue screen that&#x27;s easy to read and your weight stays visible for several seconds after you step off (which is nice if you want to record your weight). This product arrived in a very timely manner and was in excellent condition. I&#x27;m not a scale connoisseur, but I&#x27;d say this is a very good value for the price. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Fantastic scale The display is large and bright enough to read easily. It is slim and unobtrusive. We are very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent scale. It is very helpful to see results in increments of .2 pounds. The scale is consistent in its readout; it does not vacillate at all even when you get on multiple times in a row whereas my last scale was in increments of .5 pounds and changed readouts often. The batteries in the Epica are changeable. In my last scale when the permanent battery starting wearing out, it forced me to buy a new scale. Glad I did, though.</li>
            <li> We ordered this scale to be used everyday by an 85 year old, and it has worked well for the first month (and longer we hope).  Visibility is good, and it was very reasonable in price.</li>
            <li> I started using this scale in June and it died by November! I replaced the batteries, it still didn&#x27;t turn on. I tried another set of batteries, it still won&#x27;t work. Instead of telling my weight, it became dead weight in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> This scale is very slim, easy to read, easy to calibrate, and displays your information seconds longer than my other digital units.</li>
            <li> Good quality,  and they took the time to email me with helpful tips in using their product.</li>
            <li> I got this scale in March and it was great until just recently where the scale won&#x27;t give me an accurate reading anymore.</li>
            <li> Very slim and light weight.  No more tapping just step on and get your results....  GREAT purchase and great price !!!!</li>
            <li> I remember I was scared of buying a scale on Amazon because people kept saying theirs wasn&#x27;t accurate. Well, this one totally is! I&#x27;ve even tried stepping on and off while carrying small items and it does detect the weight difference. I checked it against my analog scale at home and they both said I was the same weight, so it seems like it&#x27;s very accurate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great addition to my dorm room - allowed me to keep track of my weight and check that my luggage was ok for air travel. The display is large and bright. My friends would instantly go step on it whenever they came over. The ability to switch from lb to kg is pretty useful. I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now and it&#x27;s still working great! Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> Inserted included batteries and it has worked fine right from start. Nice low profile minimizes any chances of tripping on an item on the bathroom floor. I like it! No warranty but I think that&#x27;s part of what makes such a low price possible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an extremely beautiful scale, slim and lightweight.  The problem is it fails to do it&#x27;s primary function...tell me what something weighs.  I just received it yesterday, 7/18/12, and I&#x27;ve used it on my hardwood floor and ceramic tile and each time I get totally different numbers.  I even did a test weigh-in by using a 10lb. weight and it told me it weighed 0lbs., 13.2 lbs. and 17 lbs. What?  I even took pictures just so I could post it here and people could see it clearly shows the 10lb weight and the scale reads crazy numbers. If this scale did it&#x27;s job it would be perfect, but alas it doesn&#x27;t do it&#x27;s primary function and therefore it must be returned.</li>
            <li> Got in the mail today- Man I didn&#x27;t know I was this fat- I love it... Now time for a Bit of a workout......</li>
            <li> The scale seems sturdy and matched the weight my Doctor&#x27;s office&#x27;s scale read. Setup was easy and I like that you don&#x27;t have to tap before stepping on.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm.  Comes on fast and the large numbers are easy to read.  The only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;lie&amp;#34; like I need it to do!  :&amp;#62;)</li>
            <li> waste of money and time. Every time i get a different weight. This what you can call a good looking piece of junk!</li>
            <li> works like it is supposed to do and, because it is very thin, it pass below the door when I open it so I could put it in a very convenient place</li>
            <li> this product came in on time if not earlier. item was descibed exactly as it was in the description. thanks.</li>
            <li> Very easy to read , lightweight</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom because of the large display. Good value. Not 100% accurate, but for $18 we should not expect a great deal. It is accurate enough for someone to place it, calibrate it, and use it to monitor fluctuations, which is what I expected.</li>
            <li> Best scale we&#x27;ve ever owned.  Don&#x27;t have to tap before we step on, nice large display, feels much sturdier than our last scale.</li>
            <li> Awful, didn&#x27;t work well at all. I returned it.</li>
            <li> This is an accurate, slim scale, and I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I have not had any problems with this scale. People say that their weight on it varies, but I wonder how much of that is water weight that they think is actually the fault of the scale.&lt;br /&gt;My weight fluctuates around 2-5lbs a day, this is COMPLETELY NORMAL because of water weight which can be gained and lost rapidly. (I guess people are completely unaware of this fact... especially since this seems to be the #1 complaint about pretty much every scale on Amazon)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this scale for quite awhile now, and I love it. The design is nice, sleek even... numbers are easy to read, it&#x27;s easy to recalibrate (not that I think it&#x27;s necessary unless you&#x27;re packing this thing up and taking it on trips --- you just step on and step off immediately, rather than tapping the scale).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m rather glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Best scale ever and super sensitive.</li>
            <li> Seems very consistent and accurate. Glad I decided on this one</li>
            <li> Accurate, heavy duty well made scale..</li>
            <li> Great bang for your buck.  Nice display, sccurate reading and slim enough to slide under anywhere.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom...She bad trouble reading her old scale....the dail never seemed to make up its mind...So I decided to get this scale, large numbers, digital, 400lbs maximum weight, backlight for easy read.  So far so good! She&#x27;s losing the weight and happy to be able to see it on her new scale... I highly recommend this scale.</li>
            <li> The scale was exactly as described and works really well! It has been 100% consistent - I never receive random 5lb high (or low) weigh-ins with this product. To me, that is the most important thing I was looking for in a scale. Also this prroduct was shipped quickly and arrived in excellent condition. Very happy with the seller too!</li>
            <li> its perfect !!!  ultra flat, No weight...i love it !!&lt;br /&gt;perfect for the travel....and is very exactly......i bought at Amazon and its price is very good.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, thin and light scale. It seems much more accurate than the cheap one I had before, and I like that it takes standard batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited 10/14/12: The AAA batteries died a few weeks ago, which made sense, given that the scale was about a year old. I replaced the batteries with freshly-purchased AAAs and the scale will not work, giving me a brief \\&quot;Lo Bat\\&quot; message before turning off. I am extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Scale does not work properly, The weight number swings wildly then shuts itself off. I&#x27;m not buying another scale online.</li>
            <li> In my opinion this scale is a pretty good one, it&#x27;s working as supposed it should. Definitely, it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li> very thin and light scales. Like it an have no concerns. Didn&#x27;t check how accurate the measurements, but hope it&#x27;s calibrated fine.</li>
            <li> Bought this scale recently and it&#x27;s working great.  It&#x27;s nice that you can just step straight on and get weighed without all the hassle of tapping on that older electronic scales had.  Works great for the price!</li>
            <li> The scale is exactly what I was looking for.  I&#x27;m  a heavier guy trying to lose some weight, or at least not gain too much over the holiday season.  I needed a scale that is acurate and will have not problem going over 350 lbs.  I like the fact that I don&#x27;t have to step on the middle to turn it on or anything.  I just step right on and it gives me my weight.  It doesn&#x27;t really lock into a weight like other scales, which I like.  I don&#x27;t know if that would be a feature, but instead it adjusts the my weight as I stand there.  So if I picked up a book it would show more weight.  I&#x27;ve used it now for about a month, and I&#x27;ve had no problem with it at all.</li>
            <li> Scale works great.  It seems to be pretty accurate.  I get the same reading after weighing myself again right after.  There is a difference if i take my shoes off or am wearing heavy jeans or not so I&#x27;d say the scale is accurate.  My old one was an analog spring loaded scale that always said 150 if i was wearing nothing or fully clothed with boots and holding my 20 lb cat.    My only complaint would be that it seems to take a little longer than other scales to determine the weight.  It is especially longer if you move and make the weight jump around and then I believe it is taking longer to average all the numbers that were skipping around.   For the price I&#x27;d say it was a great buy.  And 2 day shipping with Amazon Prime is always nice.</li>
            <li> They shipped fast and the product is GREAT!  It&#x27;s exactly as advertised!  I would definitely recommend buying from this company.</li>
            <li> I saw this scale on Amazon it was at a price I couldn&#x27;t pass up.  The scale arrived a week later. I was impressed with how thin the scale is and how the weight is illuminated on the digital display. The display is bright to read and the weight will remain on the scale for a few seconds once you get off the scale. The scale I had never gave the same weight twice where as this Ultra Slim does.  I would recommend the Omega Ultra Slim to anyone considering a scale. The price was good and the shipping quick.   Check it out.  [[ASIN:B003ATS2QC Omega Ultra Slim Digital Bathroom Scale, 400 lb. Capacity, Sense-On Technology]]</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas present for my mom, and everyone immediately started taking turns to see how much they weighed. Everyone thought the numbers were within range of their expectations, so it seems to be pretty accurate. The scale has a nice design and works just as advertised.</li>
            <li> This scale is very attractive.  The display is large enough to see well and it works very quickly.  Since my main use is to weigh my overweight cat that is on a special diet, the speed is a definite asset.  I received the scale very quickly and it was in perfect condition. I am very pleased with the product and the seller.</li>
            <li> I have this sittin in my bathroom. Seems pretty accurate and is easy to use, just tap it then stand on it and wait a couple seconds for it to weigh ya.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful and functional bathroom scale, which uses regular AA batteries instead of those expensive, disk-shaped ones.  Weight is to the tenths of a pound, so if you are a serious weight-watcher, this is great.  The display is large and you just step on and get your weight very quickly.  Nice feature is you can switch from lbs to kgs.</li>
            <li> Scale works great. Thanks for speedy delivery too! No complaints here. Takes aaa batteries. Easy to see in the dark thanks to the backlit display.</li>
            <li> This scale works great! It is used every day and provides us with accurate readings, we have used weights to check.</li>
            <li> The scale is very inaccurate, it can give you different answer everytime you step on it, thus very frustrating since you won&#x27;t know your exact weight.</li>
            <li> This scale looks really nice... but there&#x27;s just one problem: it doesn&#x27;t work. As other reviewers have noted, if you step on it three times, you&#x27;re likely to get three different readings. And, these readings will sometimes be off by just tenths of a pound, but sometimes, they vary by several pounds. In addition, sometimes while I&#x27;m standing on it (as still as possible), it will flip through several readings, never actually settle on any of them, and then just shut off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for an estimation of your weight, this scale will work for you, but if every little bit matters, you better look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> i did not realize how thin this product is. i kept tripping over the old scale. now i can safely walk about the bathroom.</li>
            <li> Readings are consistent for me, but inaccurate. I will give it no stars if possible - a scale that doesn&#x27;t give you an accurate weight is simply useless.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an easy to read digital scale that fit my budget. This scale is easy to use, has a bright blue lighted background, large numbers, has a slim  design, and plenty of foot room. Great product!</li>
            <li> It is a great product,my wife and I are loosing weight and we need a scale,this do the job just fine and great service arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Shipped super quick. The scale works as advertised. It&#x27;s easy to read and the only set up involved is take the packaging off and go! It&#x27;s consistent, always reads the same number twice if I get off and try again. Some other scales I&#x27;ve used fluctuate in their results.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and easy to read....even in a dark room thanks to the backlit display. I checked mine against the doctor&#x27;s scale as well as picking up small weights to see if it regerstered the change. I would say that it is as acurate as any scale and it was less expensive than the more popular brands.</li>
            <li> Arrived as promised, ultra-thin design, no glass like other scales so less breakable. Worked great right out of the box. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> This scale is very consistent. I generally weigh myself twice just to make sure I&#x27;ve gotten an accurate reading, and it always gives me the same reading, even after i re-zero it. It&#x27;s right on with what my doctor&#x27;s office says I weigh, so I think it&#x27;s a decent product.</li>
            <li> We ordered this scale and it was perfect! Adults and kids alike--works great! I recommend this scale and company! The display is clear and as accurate as can be!</li>
            <li> The scale readings were off from +10 to -30 lbs.  Re-calibrating did not fix it.  I had it out of the box 15 minutes before repacking it for a refund.</li>
            <li> I finally bought myself a digital scale and love it. Seems to be accurate based on my prior scale and the doctor&#x27;s office scale. The display lights up so I don&#x27;t have to turn on the bathroom light to get a reading.</li>
            <li> Scales arrived quick and in good shape.  I am having difficulty getting the same reading a second time.  The reading goes up and down, even when I stand as still as possible.</li>
            <li> All in all its just a scale. Its pretty nice tho, thin and light. No tap just step on and it tells you how fat you are. What more could you ask for.</li>
            <li> This scale is a great value. The Sense-on feature makes activating the scale much simpler than some other digital scales.</li>
            <li> The product is great, gives me consistent, accurate readings. I have owned this for two months now, so hoping the product works great long term!</li>
            <li> This scale is very accurate &amp; inexpensive. Takes about 5-7 seconds to determine weight &amp; displays it in large font with a bright backlit light. Great buy.</li>
            <li> It came in perfect conditions, and so far it works perfectly. It&#x27;s super slim and it&#x27;s not heavy at all, so it&#x27;s super easy to move and/or carry.</li>
            <li> Great scale!  Love the modern design!</li>
            <li> I am a physician who has been dieting and weighing himself each morning before taking a shower for 10 years, using a doctor&#x27;s scale (to prevent Type II diabetes, which runs in my family).  To maintain my &amp;#34;obsessive / compulsive&amp;#34; habits, which do work (albeit slowly), I thought I should get a scale for traveling.  Otherwise, I will convince myself I am losing weight and eat hot fudge sundaes.  This scale is easy to use.  I find it is consistently about .5 to .75 pounds higher than the doctor&#x27;s scale, but I am not too worried, because at least it is consistent (perhaps the doctor&#x27;s scale is off).  It will fit into my carry on luggage.  I use it on a tile floor - I doubt it would work on carpet but haven&#x27;t tried it.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, slim scale that fits under our bed easily. It is lightweight and very accurate providing you have it on a completely level surface. If you try to weigh yourself on a rug or an uneven tile floor the numbers never stop. The scale goes into a little bit of a fit. We have ONE truly level spot in our old home and that is right inside the bathroom. So we take it in their to weigh ourselves. It is a small bathroom so there is no room for a scale in there.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, the scale is exactly what I wanted and ordered. The price was right and the shipping quick.</li>
            <li> I love this set of scales.  The numbers are large and brightly lit.  Also, the scales are very accurate regardless of the number of time you step on them in the morning.  I even had my husband step on them directly after me to see if the reading would change, and they gave his correct weight.  The fact that they are very slim and nice looking is, also, a benefit.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality. Very much impressed with LED display, detects fast and quick immediately as we step on.  Useful for Bathoroom , it&#x27;s sleek. Doesnot even occupy much place .</li>
            <li> This scale is very slim which is exactly what we wanted. The display is very bright and easy to read.You do not need to tap it like some other scales. Just step on and once it settles on the correct weight, the weight number will flash. Great purchase for anyone wanting a slim scale.</li>
            <li> Honestly it&#x27;s just plain inaccurate. It took me a long time to get around to writing this review, and I should&#x27;ve returned it when I could, but seriously, the weight fluctuates up to 10 pounds (usually around 5-7 lbs.). I even put lifting weights just to be sure. I originally chose this scale because it wasn&#x27;t glass like many of the others.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re very happy with this scale. It&#x27;s sleek, attractive and light weight. The readout is a little hard to see in the dark, so forget about checking your weight in the dark.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t trust the weight.  Have two of these  never read the same.  One now has issues.  Have stepped on it seven times in a row.  Got seven different weights.  Ranged from low to high SIX lbs.  Off to the trash can.  If I want to lose weight, [which I do]  I will need to step on the other scale and lose FOUR pounds QUICKLY[[ASIN:B003ATS2QC Omega Ultra Slim Digital Bathroom Scale, 400 lb. Capacity, Sense-On Technology]]  This is the worst scale in the world!!  Tried both side by side today.  Same type surface.  Stepped on an d off each to Re-set.  There is a FOUR pound difference.  Have no idea what to trust.</li>
            <li> I like everything about this scale except the tendency to change numbers with the slightest movement of your body. It looks good, comes on when you stand on it, and has easy to read numbers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a bathroom scale, so what&#x27;s the big deal about this one? You&#x27;ll love the low profile, the fact that it doesn&#x27;t need a tap to reset the display, and the ease of reading the large digits. That&#x27;s a pretty big deal. My only minor gripe is that the scale is rather wide so I can&#x27;t slide it under my smallish bamboo free-standing shelves in the bathroom to hide it away until the next use. My tiny apartment bathroom requires that I store it in the vanity under the sink. It must be stored parallel to the floor and under no circumstances should we put any objects on top of it, so it&#x27;s kind of a space hog. But hey, even space hogs need love.</li>
            <li> When this arrived (on time) I was surprised at the actual thinness of the unit.  I had &amp;#34;read&amp;#34; the sizes, but somehow it didn&#x27;t really register in my mind.  Very easy to set up, the batteries included was nice, and since I had just visited one of my doctors and had his balance scale number I knew it was very  close if not &amp;#34;right on&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also impressed with the automatic &amp;#34;on/off&amp;#34; feature, as well as the easy to read numbers which stay on a few seconds so you can step off and read the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CCW</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great scale! Thank you for good quality and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Look no further, this is the perfect scale.  I really love this scale.  It is easy to read and accurate every time! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I had no idea which bathroom scale to order....We liked the description of the&lt;br /&gt;one we ultimately selected....It really is a great scale..Easy to read, and&lt;br /&gt;accurate, when compared to the doctor&#x27;s scales....The company shipped the product&lt;br /&gt;very quickly...And we could not be happier!!!</li>
            <li> I just received my scales today and WOW are these scales gorgeous! The lit blue background is very easily read and the black and chrome looking appearance of these scales is out of this world! I put the batteries in and and put them in place and was a little concerned because I had received different weights when I first got on them and took the batteries out for a second time , put them in place and waited until the light went out. I have gotten back on them a number of times and at first the numbers seem to be zeroing in and then I&#x27;ve gotten the same number the last 1/2 a dozen times. So I guess they are calibrated and giving a more accurate number now that the readings have been the same. Seems that my old scales have been off a couple pounds ..to the good for me. So am I glad that I purchased this set! This scale seems to be doing its job to the greater degree and  are adding beauty to my bathroom as well!</li>
            <li> Bright digital readout, low to the floor, no flipping over.  Best scale we&#x27;ve ever had. Great quality, too.</li>
            <li> I just got it, but it&#x27;s working great and is very easy to use.  Just step on, no tapping or waiting, and within seconds up pops your easily readable weight.  Good deal!</li>
            <li> Our previous digital bathroom scale rounded weight up to the nearest 1/2 pound -- this scale gives the actual tenth which we like.  It also uses AAA batteries which we expect to last longer that the flat battery used in our previous scale.  I like that the display stays on for a few seconds; this gives us time to jot down the weight if desired.  Very pleased with the design and color.</li>
            <li> The Omega Ultra Slim Digital bathroom scale is simple, clean, as the name says, slim, the display numbers are large and easy to read. It&#x27;s also very accurate. Attractive for any bathroom. Plus the price was reasonable. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> We are very pleased with this scale. Accurate and easy to read numbers that are lit by a pleasing blue light. Very flat and easy to stand on.</li>
            <li> Slim and lightweight, and I have noticed no problems with accuracy. Display is nice, bright and big. Great scale and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> Used this item to track my weight loss. What can I say...it&#x27;s a scale. Thin, not very heavy, easy to put away. I recommend.</li>
            <li> Really nice and really sleek. Just step on - no button to push.  Pretty close to my doctors scale which is great.</li>
            <li> Love this scale and so does my husband.  We wanted one very simple scale without all of the bells and whistles.  So far,glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> This was originally a gift for my wife, and she loves it very much.  The display lights up in the dark, digits are large and very easy to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are both very satisfied with this product and will recommend it to our friends.</li>
            <li> I have grown tired of scales that give inconsistent readings, varying 1-4 pounds at various weights. This scale was accurate, unobtrusive and actually sort of attractive. And the price is right. Excellent value.</li>
            <li> Scale is fast and accurate. It&#x27;s attractive, slim, and fits nicely on the square tile in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very please with my purchase. Scale is very sleek and what I expected. Scale was well packaged and had non issues. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I was certainly pleased with the service I got.  Very good.  And there certainly are things about this Omega Ultra Slim Digital Bathroom Scale that I like.  It sure is slim, which to me is a real plus.  And it&#x27;s lightweight.  But, I need typically need to get on it three times to get an accurate reading.  Usually the first one is wrong.  The second and third try give me the duplicate readouts, which are correct.  But I wish it would give the right indication on the first try vs. having to do so three times.  \\&quot;It eventually gets it right\\&quot; the second and third time!</li>
            <li> Got the requested Balance in time. Had difficulty in calibrating but after that it is working fine, but if I move it. I need to calibrate again by removing that battery and then turning it on</li>
            <li> This scale is lightweight and seems to be very accurate.  One of the features that I like is that once it locks into the weight, it blinks so that you know that this is the final number. ALso, I like the blue readout, which enhances visibility of the numbers. This scale was also priced reasonably, and overall, I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Although it is slim, it is has a large surface area. I am constantly stepping on it by accident. I don&#x27;t weigh myself where I keep the scale; I have to pull it out from the wall a bit. Every time I do this, I have to re-calibrate it or it will add on a pound for the weight of the scale.</li>
            <li> We had a different scale but learned that it was limited to 350 lbs.  I had just had surgery and spent 2 weeks in a nursing home eating what was supposed to be the normal diabetic diet.  I gained 42 pounds!  So we purchased the Omega Ultra Slim Digital scale with the 400 pound capacity.  It worked like a charm and I use it often.  Lost the 42 pounds and am back under 350 pounds.  The scale arrived within days of ordering from Amazon so I was very pleased with the quick service.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, responsive, large numbers, back-lit - what more would you want?  No tapping, switches or anything; just stand and get your weight.  I&#x27;m happy with these!</li>
            <li> These scales replaced a set of standard spring type scales and appear to be more accurate with a more visible read-out.  I would recommend them to anyone and may buy another as a gift.</li>
            <li> I bought this scale for my new weight-loss regime.  It was easy to set up and has been functioning well since I got it last month.  All you have to do is step on it and your weight is shown.  No waiting for numbers to clear or reset.</li>
            <li> The weight amounts jiggle around too much and don&#x27;t stay still. I have to try seeral times to get my weight.</li>
            <li> Even my husband uses it. It&#x27;s flat enough to slide beneath the chest in the bathroom. Step on, get my weight (lost 20lbs) step off, out of sight out of mind</li>
            <li> I was looking for an accurate simple scale and this proved to be just that. It has a nice slim design and looks very attractive. The numbers are large and easy to read and I like how you just step on it. None of that tap to turn it on, then let it zero and then jump on. It came packaged well with included batteries. No complaints, exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> The best bathroom scale I ever bought. Does not need calibration, large digital numbers display stays lit a few seconds after you step off. Slim scale fits underneath any piece of furniture or cubby space.</li>
            <li> I was confused when it only came with half the batteries needed for it but other than that the directions for putting them in and turning it on are right there and it is pretty easy to figure out.</li>
            <li> I weight myself several times in a week, wearing similar clothes, and the weight did not change much. What I really got the scale for was to weigh my cat, who is overweight, according to the veterinarian and is supposed to lose weight. The scale is flat enough for him to comfortably stand on and the numbers are just in the right place. His weight is the same every day.  Over several weeks he lost 1/2 pound, which is not enough, but there is hope.</li>
            <li> It is pretty good and I like it a lot! The price is reasonable as well. I would recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> Lovely to look at, reasonably priced, and easy to read (to the tenth of pound!).  Can&#x27;t do better than this scale.</li>
            <li> I recommend buying this scale, its not expensive and you can change the weight options from pounds to kilos.  It shipped out fast and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Easy to steal.  Gives bright clear digital read out.  Very accurate.  Slim line.  Give portions of a pound readings.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Wide so is very comfortable when you see your weight. Light so can carry it around. Product looks very cool too. Shipping was prompt. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I wish I had purchased this scale a long time ago. It is accurate down to the ounces, so you keep track of your weight in an accurate manner. A big plus is that it so attractive and slim.</li>
            <li> Love this scale it does not take up much space in the bathroom. It is easy to read even at night without turning on a light. The scale is spot on with my doctors so it is very accurate. Price is great.</li>
            <li> This is accurate, thin and easily stored. My last scale was glass and I ended up dropping it on our tile floor. Needless to say, the tile floor won. This scale is cheap and no frills - exactly what I and probably 99% of people need. It also uses standard batteries, so you won&#x27;t be searching around the grocery store for some strange size when it needs new ones.</li>
            <li> This scale is very accurate and looks nice in the bathroom.  bright digital display.  I have been very pleased with this scale.</li>
            <li> The step on sensor does not work on the unit I was shipped. I tried switching batteries and that did not help.</li>
            <li> This is a serviceable bathroom scale that quickly delivers accurate weight measurements to 1/10 of a pound.  The digital display is large and backlit, making it easy to read and avoiding the hunching over effect caused by smaller scale read-outs.  The scale responds immediately when you step on it and only takes a few seconds to accurately read your weight, which it then blinks so you know it is the final reading.  My scale is resting on a tile floor that probably is not perfectly level, and it works just fine.  This is a good, daily-use scale.  I was especially happy that it came with the required four AAA batteries.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking fora digital scale for awhile and this one is just perfect. Even in the dark, I can see the screen. Very happy I bought this. Plus delivery is fast. Thank you. A+++++</li>
            <li> This scale is nice, slim, works well. I&#x27;ve had it for about a year now and its still going and weighing.</li>
            <li> Amazing bathroom scale. I like this scale. Descent price, Easy to use, awesome Display, perfect size, Nice battery life and&lt;br /&gt;exactly Serves the purpose.</li>
            <li> This scale seems to work well. I don&#x27;t weigh myself anywhere else, so I can&#x27;t tell how accurate it is to the tenth of a pound. But the number on the scale seems right. It takes about two seconds to read my weight.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good, simple scale to monitor my weight throughout my training process. This inexpensive scale gets the job done!</li>
            <li> You just step on it, it pretty quickly tells you how much you weigh, and you step off it. The display is bright and the numbers are large, but if you can&#x27;t see the display while standing on the scale, your weight will stay up for a few seconds after you step off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it couldn&#x27;t be much easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Repeatability is excellent in my experience. I&#x27;ve re-weighed myself several times in a row and never gotten a result that was different than more than a tenth or two. I haven&#x27;t done anything to test accuracy yet though, so I don&#x27;t know if 150 pounds really is 150 pounds, but I&#x27;ll report back if I find any issues. Also, I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see if the battery life is reasonable, but I&#x27;ll report back if battery life turns out to be disappointingly short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems like there are a million scales on the market, and many of them are probably good. If you want a very simple, easy to use, modern looking scale for a reasonable price, this one should not disappoint.</li>
            <li> Very nice unit and every bit of what was advertised! Would recommend  again to anyone. It fits so nice in a small room and a nice color.</li>
            <li> The scale arrived on time and as advertised. Very nice, easy to use and read. Sleek, stylish appearance will fit in in any bathroom or wherever you use your scale.</li>
            <li> I got my scale quickly and the packaging was secure....it looks awesome and it worked perfectly, very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> this product is easy to use and accurate. it is slim and does not take up the entire bathroom. helpful when watching your weight.</li>
            <li> Simple to operate just insert the batteries that come with it. Large number display makes it easy to read. Good value for a basic scale.</li>
            <li> I am very unsatisfied with the product because it is not accurate. I weigh myself and my 4children and took them to the doctors, the weight was off by 15 to 20 lbs. I wanted to return but I had already threw away the packaging. Would not recomend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> The scale works as expected. It gives true and consistent readings. I would recommend this to anybody looking a new scale.</li>
            <li> Stepped on this scale 10 different times through out the day, got 10 different readings, with up to a five pound difference. Tried it for more than a week, wildly different readings all the time. One of the few items purchased on Amazon that I&#x27;ve had to return. Save your money and buy a different scale.</li>
            <li> This was very easy to set up.  Put the batteries in, select the type of measurement you want,put it where you want it and when it shuts off it&#x27;s calibrated and ready to go.  You just step on it when you want to know your weight.  It shuts off automatically.  The numbers are so large I can read them without my glasses.  I can even leave the room light off and see them clearly.  The scale is very low for people who have balance problems.  This is an excellent scale at an excellent price.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with it.  I highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I like being able to hop on and off this scale without turning it on by tapping it and then waiting for the 8s to clear.  I also like that this scale blinks the number at you when it has reached your weight.  It&#x27;s very nice looking and small enough to put in a corner of our bedroom but large enough to feel comfortable standing on it.  I believe that it weighs accurately because it doesn&#x27;t fluctuate if you get off and on.</li>
            <li> I like most everything about this scale ... large base &amp; easy to read. My only complaint is it never seems to \\&quot;lock-on\\&quot; to your weight. The digital reading keeps jumping around by a pound or so and never seems to set on a final weight before it shuts off. But, you do get an idea of the weight within a pound or so. Because of it&#x27;s inability to lock-on, I only gave it 4 starts</li>
            <li> Have this scale for 2 weeks now.  Work great, small enough for our bathroom. Would recommend it to anyone who interested in a good scale.</li>
            <li> this scale doesnt work!!! each time I stand on it, it gives you a different reading, its the worst, most unaccurate scale I have ever had, I do not recommend this product to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;the only good thing is the cool design, but who wants a thing that does not perform...</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my new scale.  Easy to use,accurate, and so sleek and nice to look at in the bathroom😄</li>
            <li> This scale is very easy to use. I like that I can step on it and the weight displays. With some other digital scales that I&#x27;ve used in the past you have to step on to turn the scale on and then step off for the scale to zero before you can step back on again to get your weight.</li>
            <li> 2 days using it i love it.  If it holds up it will be a great deal.</li>
            <li> Great product, works perfectly, looks slick, love the fact that it keeps your weight for a few seconds after you step off.&lt;br /&gt;Quick delivery as well.</li>
            <li> This little scale is perfect ! It is easy to use and set-up and it is very accurate!! it&#x27;s size makes it easy to store and easy to use. The scale is exactly as advertised and preforms flawlessly!!! Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1FTOT9SKTECO2]] First of all, for the price, I was honestly expecting a cheaply made product. I was COMPLETELY wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the four scales my family owns, this is by far the best!  The Epica scale is SUPER thin, almost to the point I worried how sturdy it was going to be.  After a week of use, I no longer have any worries about the product.  It&#x27;s exactly 20mm thin, and sits sturdy on its four rubber legs.  I did try using it on the carpet, but it unfortunately isn&#x27;t made to do so.  The best part of this product is the fact you don&#x27;t have to manually calibrate it, like many others on the market.  It&#x27;s as easy as stepping on, waiting for the LCD screen to blink, and step off.  Your weight is displayed for 10 seconds before the unit turns itself off.  As you can see from my video, the scale is very accurate.  Out of the three times I stepped on the scale, it gave me the exact same reading (down to the .1 of a pound).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no complaints and would STRONGLY recommend this product to someone looking for an affordable bathroom scale with all of the extra features of a more expensive unit! Hope you guys like my video review! If it is helpful, I&#x27;ll start doing more on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Great scale, always precise.</li>
            <li> This scale is right in line with my doctor&#x27;s office scales.  Stays consistently on target.  The slimline is a nice feature.</li>
            <li> This scale is absolutely fantastic. Easy to read. Weight is dead on everytime. It is compact, yet does not move around when you step on it.</li>
            <li> Very Happy. Price was good and delivery excellant. Seems to work quite well, may be a pound or so under the Doctor&#x27;s Scale when we compared the readings.</li>
            <li> Excellent product - - completely satisfied</li>
            <li> Nice looking, sleek scale. I&#x27;m satisfied!</li>
            <li> This scale worked well while it lasted, but only lasted a year and a half.  We put batteries in twice but the second time the scale ceased to work.  I guess a year and half is not too bad, but we will try some thing else next.</li>
            <li> Excellent!!! It’s just what I had in mind.</li>
            <li> This scale is extremely thin and very handsome. When you step on you can see it searching for exactly the right weight for you at the moment. But there are a few things you must consider. The scale MUST be on a hard, solid, EVEN floor. The slightest variation in the leveling of the floor will prevent the scale from finding your weight. So you&#x27;ve got to put it in a perfectly hard, level spot, or move it to one when you use it. If you move it every time you use it, you MUST not only put it on a hard, level surface, you must use your forefoot to apply pressure to put some weight on the scale to turn it on, take your foot off, and wait for the scale to turn itself off. Only then can you get on it and get an accurate weight reading for yourself. You cannot use this on a carpet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you do all these things, it&#x27;s great. If you&#x27;re too lazy, forget it.</li>
            <li> I bought this scale because I thought mine was wrong,but they were both the same on the weight.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter said her scale was off so I gave it to her. She loves it. It&#x27;s so slim she can store&lt;br /&gt;it easily in her small bathroom and the weight is exact. It&#x27;s really nice looking too, a good&lt;br /&gt;purchase for the price.</li>
            <li> we love this scale.  nice and small, compact.  It works almost immediately upon stepping on the scale.  recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> I love my Omega Ultra Slim Digital Bathroom Scale.  It is accurate because I checked my weight against my weight  on my doctor&#x27;s scale.  It is lightweight, attractive and the numbers are large and bright.  I have enough time to get off the scale and see the number before it turns off.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a great scale. The display is easy to read and the design is slim and modern. I love that it doesn&#x27;t require a &amp;#34;tap&amp;#34; each time, too. You just step on, hold still for a few seconds, and voila!</li>
            <li> Get your weight quickly in large, easily read, numbers.  Looks good in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> Awesome scale! Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for 2 months, and couldn&#x27;t be more happy.  Once I established a good firm foundation for it, I had absolutely no trouble.  I stand on the scale. It goes through a few preliminary numbers and in a couple of seconds it settles on my weight.  It then blinks a few times with the weight and then displays the weight for a few seconds after I step off the scale.  No matter how many times i repeat this process, the weight is always the same for that day.  I love the big display which is super easy to read.  I also love the fact that it weighs so little, enabling me to take it with me when I go on trips.  I also love the display resolution, which is every .2 of a pound.  There is really no setup or adjustment.  Right out of the box, you just establish a firm footing for it on a hard surface, then step on it, and you&#x27;re all set.</li>
            <li> After buying like 4 scales during the past year, finally I found one that works without the tapping. You just step in and the weight is there... easy to calibrate if you move it... no more tapping, which I think is the main reason weight scales don&#x27;t last. Vendor send it fast and well packaged. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Easy to use! Love that the weight lasts for a few seconds after I get off the scale. Easy to store under the bed</li>
            <li> This scale is really accurate, and it doesn&#x27;t take long to load. It turns on when you step on it, so it&#x27;s really user friendly and you don&#x27;t get frustrated trying to tap it just right so it comes on. It&#x27;s thin and easy to move and store. We&#x27;re really happy with it.</li>
            <li> the weight always is 1-3 pounds off unless you reset the scale every time you use it (which is just not helpful and i hate doing it, since you have to get the timing right and too much waiting, i just want my weight checked dammnit not reset a damn machine)</li>
            <li> This is the best scale ever. I love not having to tap-it-on before weighing. I got this for my elderly mother and she loves it too. It is easy to read and stays on a second after getting off of it. It looks great and stores easily.</li>
            <li> You can just stick this anywhere upright, it&#x27;s about 1/2-3/4 inch thick!  Calculation is quick and easy to see.  Great value for the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this scale for about two months now, and it&#x27;s gotten the job done. It seems fairly accurate and hasn&#x27;t caused any problems. The weight display screen is big, bright, and really easy to read. The instructions for this scale states that it needs to be recalibrate every time you move it&#x27;s position, but I&#x27;m not sure how much this has affected my weight readings.</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with his scale.  It works great, and I like the very bright digital readout.  I also like the fact that you don&#x27;t have to \\&quot;tap\\&quot; it to turn it on. The price was very reasonable, and that makes this scale a great value!</li>
            <li> This scale has a nice sleek look to it and comes with batteries! It functions flawlessly and I am happy with my purchase. Would suggest to anyone looking for a scale that is easy to use and looks nice.</li>
            <li> This product works ok but I have issues with how long it takes to lock onto a weight. It changes every time you shift a little on your feet.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Omega Ultra slim digital bathroom scale because I was tired of touching the scale and waiting before you could get on to weigh.  I also liked that it would light up nicely.  Those are the only two features that work.  The scale doesn&#x27;t give accurate weights.  A weight can vary by up to 50 pounds each time you step on.  If you even move the scale an inch on the floor, the weight really changes.  I am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted...works great and weighs right with the doctors office...would recommend this for anyone wanting a nice scale.</li>
            <li> Even compared with the doctor&#x27;s scale, this one is accurate. Easy because it&#x27;s one step (not that it&#x27;s difficult to use those, just an annoyance for impatient people).</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and works great.  The price was good and would definitely recommend buying this product from this company.</li>
            <li> Best scale i have ever purchased...i have had it for years now and its still working and going strong.</li>
            <li> Works great. Looks sleek and modern and very accurate. I am very happy with it. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> We wanted a simple but sleek looking scale for our bathroom. This is perfect, and works quickly and accurately. I would definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> I like these scales. Price was good. Dial easy to see. Just step on and your weigh is visible. What I did not appreciate was the fact the batteries included were already dead. Perhaps if they weren&#x27;t purchased from China, they might have worked. Either include batteries that work or don&#x27;t include them at all. Minus the batteries, it is a good product.</li>
            <li> Most inconsistent scale ever. Literally weight changes by 5 pounds day to day or even within same day.</li>
            <li> Great bathroom scale, very accurate weight (mathes my doctor&#x27;s scale), built in light makes it easy to read. Style works well with sny decor and nice low profile.</li>
            <li> Slim, Black &amp; LED Backlight &amp; Automatic . Just stand on and it weighs. Roomy for legs. I would definitely recommend for others. Trust me, you will not turn back. This instantly shows the weight, and not like other weigh machines which first process your weight and then display.... Go for it!!!!!</li>
            <li> This scale was exactly as described. It is thin and light weight, but the best feature is it is easy to read. The numbers are large and the blue background helps make them stand out more. You can get off the scale and stand back and your weight is still available to read for a little while. I put it in my closet and don&#x27;t need to turn on the light to weigh myself like I had to do with my old scale. It also came sooner than expected!</li>
            <li> The scale changes your weight every time you step on it within minutes. It&#x27;s not reliable and a waste of money. The weight may change as much as 2 or 3 pounds.</li>
            <li> I had this scale for a few months and then realized it wasn&#x27;t accurate at all. My weight varied by about 10lbs each time I used it. I tried replacing the battery but that didn&#x27;t solve the issue. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> good service and products...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure this has held up over time. I feel like everytime I step on this thing (multiple times in a day just to see what it says) the number changes pretty drastically. The scale I use at the gym only deviates 1 or 2 lbs, but this thing is like 7-8 lbs.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome buy! For $25 you get the scale, batteries and free shipping! The scale works wonderfully (don&#x27;t use it on carpet, FYI ;) and the price is great - thank you!!!</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the  Omega Ultra Slim Bathroom Scale.  It&#x27;s slim, looks nice and seems to be very accurate.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and was well packaged. There was NO damage to the product. It was very simple to setup and is pretty consistent on the weight it shows if calibrated properly following the instructions (which are pretty simple).It is also very sleek and the display is large and clear. Overall, an excellent Bathroom scale for the price. Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> This scale was everything I was looking for. The display is bright and easy to read. The scale seems really accurate.</li>
            <li> Light, slim, easy to use and a large digital display.  My previous scale was heavy, bulky and took up a lot of room.  I&#x27;m able to leave this scale out without tripping over it, I can see the display with no problem (even if I don&#x27;t have my glasses on) and I just step on!  No more \\&quot;tapping\\&quot; or turning it on, just step on and the results are there!</li>
            <li> This is my first digital scale.  It was recommended to me by my health care practitioner. It is reasonable in price, easy to set up, and has performed without fail for me each morning.</li>
            <li> Really impressed with this slim beauty. Don&#x27;t have to tap it to get started and best of all, the numbers don&#x27;t go zipping all over the place till the scale decides where to stop (like a roulette wheel.) And your weight number stays alight long enough to read it and remember it. Also easy to clean. All in all, very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product and I am very pleased with it. Ease of use and exact weight match with my doctor&#x27;s scale.</li>
            <li> I received the item before the deadline. It has been working very well. The scale sets up itself so I did not need to do anything.</li>
            <li> The scale is in metric and imperial systems, very simple to use. Does not waste batteries and can be stored anywhere it is very slim.</li>
            <li> Good scale. slim, lightweight, stable, durable and easy to store.Also shipped to receive fast. I have been using it every day and the auto power off is kind of cool. I have tested it by weighing couple of times everytime and it has been consistent. Will definetly recommend this product. No issues till now.</li>
            <li> This scale is lightweight, thin, easy to read, and seems to measure weight accurately. It has a nice sleek design to it, too.</li>
            <li> Great scales. Very easy to read !</li>
            <li> This is a great scale.  It is slim and lightweight and shows the numbers clearly.  I would recommend to anyone who needs a new bathroom scale.</li>
            <li> Nice scale. I love the tenth of a pound measurement. Seems accurate.</li>
            <li> The assisted living facility requires residents to have their own scale so I checked through all offered on Amazon and picked this one. Mom&#x27;s elderly and the large display works well for her plus she doesn&#x27;t have to jumpstart it to get a reading. Not made in USA is was a big negative. Overall, it does what it says and nicely.</li>
            <li> So recently I have been tracking my weight because of a &amp;#34;juicing diet&amp;#34; aka reboot. I’ve had a cheap Wal-Mart scale I got almost two years ago but unfortunately the weight wasn’t accurate. The problem was I would get a different weight every time I stepped on the scale (within 5 minutes). So after 3 weeks of juicing I noticed that my weight went down fast but thought &amp;#34;hey it must be the faulty scale&amp;#34;, so I decided to get a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was on groupon and saw one on sale for $25 but decided to check out Amazon for reviews and comparison. That is when I came across the Omega Ultra Slim. The price was roughly $2.50 less but the capacity and style was what got me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the scale yesterday and I tried it a couple of times and even thou the LCD screen doesn’t always stay lit, once it did the weight was the same regardless of how many times I got on it. Accuracy was my goal and the Omega is very accurate. Only gripe is that I wish the screen would lock my weight more consistently and not turn off causing me to get on it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for those of you interested in the back story, after checking my weight with the Omega I am down 15lbs. Wooohooo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this scale for price and accuracy.</li>
            <li> This is the best bathroom scale I&#x27;ve owned. It&#x27;s accurate (agrees with my doctor&#x27;s scale), repeatable to the tenth of a pound, and has a large back-lit display that I can read in the dark without my glasses. It&#x27;s stable and low profile, and inexpensive. The platform is more than large enough for size 12 feet. I have the scale on a flat, hard floor, so I cannot speak to how it works on carpet. I can&#x27;t think of negative thing to say about the scale right now. I&#x27;ve had the scale for about 6 weeks, and the battery is holding up fine. My wife, child, and I use it daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;The scale failed due to my daughter getting on to it weigh while soaking wet. Water made it&#x27;s way into the electronics and ruined the scale. I ordered a new one to replace it and it is now located in my bed room where it will not see water again. I still recommend the scale, but it should not be used where it might get wet. I&#x27;ve reduced my rating from 5 stars to 4 since it should be water resistant in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice looking bathroom scale.  My wife wanted a new scale but did not need all the extra features such as programing. This scale is very thin and seems to be very accurate.  It was a very good deal for the money.</li>
            <li> This scale looks great, is slim and works very well.  Seems to be pretty accurate.  Very happy w this purchase</li>
            <li> It works decently.  The batteries it came with didn&#x27;t work, but once I replaced them the scale worked just fine.</li>
            <li> Bought this scale to keep track of my weight loss and eventual maintenance. It&#x27;s small and sleek and fit easily in a corner of my bathroom. The step on activation is responsive and accurate, overall I have really enjoyed using this product. Would strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> I am not a big scale person..but alot I have bought in past max weight is 300 and if you dont perfectly balance yourself, weights can be way off.This scale is as accurate as my Dr, price is great, feels solid, no sound when stepping on it, and the weight shows in Big blue numbers and is very easy to read. best scale I ever bought and looks modern and classy. Get one!</li>
            <li> The red LED readout on my 15 year old digital scale was beginning to dim and new batteries were not helping.  I ordered this Omega Ultra Slim digital scale.  It works reliably, is easy to read and doesn&#x27;t require the \\&quot;tap\\&quot; to wake it up like my old scale did.  The price was agreeable, it shipped quickly and arrived in fine condition.  The only disappointing issue was that, while it is \\&quot;Ultra Slim\\&quot; as advertised, it does occupy more floor space than my previous scale and requires a bit more attention on my part to keep from stubbing a toe.  I wish I had paid more attention to the published dimensions.</li>
            <li> Love this scale,very thin and also very accurate.i would recomend this scale to any one looking to upgrade.This produt will not take up much room.</li>
            <li> G reat product! Inexpensive, lightweight and sleek in size. Good investment, I definitely recommend this scale to anyone looking for a simple bathroom scale.</li>
            <li> I fell for all these crazy fake reviews!&lt;br /&gt;This is such a shame because it is such a beautifully designed scale and it is lightweight.  But the scale is very INACCURATE.  I weighed myself one day at 6:30 am then i weighed myself the next day same time and it said i gained 6 lbs.  Now I highly doubt I can gain 6 lbs overnight.  I am highly disappointed in this scale.  I will definitely not purchase a scale from amazon again and neither will I purchase from this buyer again!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m no expert on bathroom scales, but when I find one for $20 that is well-designed, stylish, so thin it barely rises above the floor, with a large well-lit display and accurate as well, I know I have a found a winner. Do not buy the cheapest item in any category when a five-star alternate is available for only a few dollars more.</li>
            <li> Great scale.  Since I have a small bathroom I have no place for scale (stored in cabinet) so you have to get on it a second time after it levels.  Very acccurate.  Love it.</li>
            <li> We needed a digital scale that was accurate to the tenths as our son is a wrestler and knowing exact weights is necessary. This product does that well. We did have to learn how to reset the -zero- weight by reading the enclosed papers as we are unable to store it flat. We as a family are pleased overall.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this scale.  It doesn&#x27;t get &#x27;stuck&#x27; on one weight as other scales do.  It is very slim and has a lot more space for my feet than my older scale did.  I don&#x27;t have to worry about standing still.  I&#x27;ve never had a problem with movement affecting the weight. The size of the numbers is excellent and I love just stepping on without having to touch it first.</li>
            <li> Great scale, seems accurate (wish it could take a few pounds off lol).</li>
            <li> Nice lightweight and compact unit.</li>
            <li> I purchased this scale for my mother about a year ago.  She loved it so much I got one for myself.  Even though I feel that this scale must be at least 50 lbs. off (really, I can&#x27;t possibly weigh this much) I really do like this scale.  The numbers are large and can clearly be seen.  The design is slim and sleek.  It is much lighter than my old scale and much prettier.  It looks so good that now I&#x27;m going to have to redecorate the bathroom.  Take my advice though, don&#x27;t weigh yourself after spending 2 weeks making Christmas candy.</li>
            <li> Gives a very accurate and quick reading.</li>
            <li> This scale is very thin, yet sturdy, looks very nice on my bedroom floor.  It is also very accurate.  Just be sure to check the box carefully for batteries, I almost threw them away!</li>
            <li> This is a good price for a good digital scale.  The seller got it to me on time and as promised.  As importantly, it serves as a conscience prodder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s light, lighted, and likely to stay right where it is - in my kitchen!  I put it in the corner in front of the cabinet where I keep my crackers and cookies, forcing me to climb on it to get at them.  I look at the read-out (can&#x27;t resist) and suddenly loose my &#x27;urge&#x27; for sweets.  It&#x27;s a simple plan, but it&#x27;s working!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can recommend both the scale and the plan.</li>
            <li> The scale lights up and is digital so it&#x27;s easy to read. It even comes with batteries so that you can start to use it right out of the box. It&#x27;s great and with other similarly priced scales that don&#x27;t look nearly as sleek or reliable as this one I would definitely recommend this one over others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done a good amount of testing this with other scales and found that it matches up pretty nicely. I use it almost everyday to weigh myself and it works perfectly. Just make sure to place it on a flat surface. If you put it on tiles make sure the edges that touch the ground are not in cracks, as this may throw off weight by as much as 10 pounds. On good flat surfaces though this works excellent. The number lights up at the top so you don&#x27;t even need light to see your weight. Make sure to stand on the scale for a good few seconds until it blinks, which means that it is done adjusting and is giving you your weight.</li>
            <li> I love this scale and weigh myself everyday.  It is exactly right weather you like it or not.  I check it weekly with 10 lb weight. Keeps me honest!!!</li>
            <li> Very inaccurate. Gives different reading every time. Since its accuracy is not good , all other things like shape , weight don&#x27;t matter anymore.</li>
            <li> I store this vertically at the side of my closet, and it fits nicely because of its slim size.  And it doesn&#x27;t seem to mind being stored upright - it comes right back on easily and without needing to be re-set.</li>
            <li> This item is just what we needed and meet all or needs.  Simple accurate and easy to read.  Just need to train the kids  not to jump on it since it has a load cell not a spring!  Great item!</li>
            <li> This scale works like a charm. No need to tap to start. Weight calculated rapidly and it&#x27;s easy to read. Nice design-looks good.</li>
            <li> I loved the design and the ease of our new bathroom scale--just step on it, wait, and the good or bad news is there. It is also very accurate, weighing me exactly what my physician&#x27;s office weighed me a few hours before!</li>
            <li> The product is slim and lightweight. Works great and is accurate. My 4 year old son loves it as well. Big, bright numbers.</li>
            <li> This was a perfect experience. The product is a fabulous value. It&#x27;s accurate and sleek in design. I highly recommend this scale!</li>
            <li> Its slim profile and accuracy is fantastic. Very consistent, specially now that I am tracking my weight loss. The perfect bathroom accessory!</li>
            <li> The instructions are in translated English, so they are difficult to understand. It is very simple though so not hard to figure out.</li>
            <li> Great scale - looks great and I&#x27;ve had no problems at all with accuracy or consistency.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and to read</li>
            <li> I love the scale. It arrived as promised with no problems. It is very slim, clear to read and I like the fact it uses AAA batteries instead of very&lt;br /&gt;expensive digital ones. Good luck with your company.&lt;br /&gt;Paula</li>
            <li> Seller delivered promptly as promised. Scale was well packaged. The scale is stylish, light weight, and slim and is very accurate.  . Seller requested that I provide a performance review which indicates to me that they care about customer satisfaction. Would use again.</li>
            <li> Got this scale through amazon. It is just what we were looking for. Besides being accurate, it looks very nice in our bathroom.</li>
            <li> Great value.  It works well and seems to be well built.  Easy to use.  It&#x27;s very nice looking.  I don&#x27;t mind leaving it out in plain view in the bathroom.  I highly recommend this purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s accurate and still works months later.</li>
            <li> Came quickly.  No hassles.  Only have it for about 1 month, so far I really like it.  Does the job. No problems</li>
            <li> I tried weighing myself on this scale and every time I tried - i got a different reading. Now that is something you certainly don&#x27;t expect from a weighing scale.</li>
            <li> 6 months later still running strong.</li>
            <li> I bought this scale after our old one died. It arrived about two weeks ago and I am shocked at how consistant it is. Our old one fluctuated a good bit. It is thin and stylish and looks great in our bathroom. It also weighs in decimals, so I can see my weight loss progress...which is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great scale!</li>
            <li> I needed to replace an old scale that was broken, so I chose this model. It looks very sleek and low profile in the bathroom. It seems to be a nice choice. Easy to read--you just have to wait 10 seconds for it to reset after you move it.</li>
            <li> It does its job and tells me how much I weigh. Does the job. Thanks a ton! I love it.</li>
            <li> Unless I some how lose 5 pounds in a couple of minutes or gain it this scale is defective ! Do not but it&#x27;s a cheap product and definitely not with the money</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t held a consecutive weight number one second to the next.  If not for laziness and not knowing where I put the packing supplies, I would have mailed this thing back.  It&#x27;s now strickly a paper weight</li>
            <li> The quality of the product and the price merit a 5 star rating. You just stand on the scale and it reads out your weight -- no waiting required.</li>
            <li> Accurate and attractive bathroom scale. Worthwhile purchase for any family bathroom. The design makes it easy to clean. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed. This scale weighs several pound light, so I never have any idea what my real weight is. Since it had good reviews,  I threw awaythe packaging to this one as I was cleaning, so it will not be easy to return.</li>
            <li> Bought this and it came in the mail right away and was very satisfied with it. Would recommend. very happy!</li>
            <li> Great product, true to the description. Light weight, beautifully designed and very accurate. We&#x27;ve been using this product for the past one month and so far no issues of any kind.</li>
            <li> I have been using for a couple months now.  It registers weight quickly and the numbers are easy to read.</li>
            <li> The screen is bright. Scale remains stable and reports measurements quickly and accurately. No issues so far.I would like to see it last longer than a few years.</li>
            <li> This scale is junk. Don&#x27;t waste your money, this thing gives you a different weight everytime you step on it...minutes, even seconds apart. I wish that I would have sent it back immediately. It is a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> This scale gives me a different weight every time I step on. I have tried to calibrate it according to the instructions but it still does not work. Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> I really like that the scale is sleek and it&#x27;s perfect for my family of 2. I would recommend the product.</li>
            <li> It works fine for me but when my husband steps on, it struggles to land and stick to a weight.  Sometimes it just keeps jumping around.</li>
            <li> At first I was disappointed, as this scale reads 7# higher than my old scale.  Now that I have gotten used to my *new* weight, I love the slim design and the small footprint it takes up.</li>
            <li> I bought it, it was delivered when I expected, I put the batteries in it, and it works. WHat else could you want from a bathroom scale?</li>
            <li> The look of this scale alone is worth the price; very sleek and modern. The function is also fantastic. Battery installation is simple. The scale seems to be very accurate and reliable. It&#x27;s also easy to clean. Just give it a quick wipe and it looks fantastic again. Plus I love that it&#x27;s a high capacity scale. I&#x27;m a large fellow and I don&#x27;t worry at all about stepping onto this scale. The build quality feels extremely sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this scale for about a month now as of this writing.  Scale is easy to use and seems to be accurate.  I also use this to weigh my dog.  I hold the dog and weigh, then step off, put the dog down and weigh again. I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.  I believe it&#x27;s better than I would have found at one of the big box stores at a lower cost</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this scale for about 6 months now and haven&#x27;t had any problems, it works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Tells me how much I weigh&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Now I know how much I weigh</li>
            <li> Omega Ultra Slim Digital Bathroom Scale, Easy, simple scale, easy to adjust use this daily the best scale to have in your home!!!</li>
            <li> Aside from the obvious &#x27;scale&#x27; parts of the scale&lt;br /&gt; (which I&#x27;ve used a few times against weight balance scales and it seems pretty accurate, or holding plates of weight and seeing what it reads)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also keep this in my bathroom, where it does occasionally get splashed with some water from the shower. No problems.</li>
            <li> Really nice scale easy to read only drawback is it doesn&#x27;t lock in your final weight the numbers go up and down if you move at all so it&#x27;s hard to get and exact number.</li>
            <li> I will recommended it highly, great buy . arrived promptly and safely . Looking great has a large display that stays on even when you step of it</li>
            <li> We have this tucked into a small, out-of-the-way corner in our dining room and it is very slim and light. Definitely holds up to at least 200lbs.  It is easy to use and read and I like that it shows your weight just by stepping on it.  It is very accurate after comparing to two other scales.</li>
            <li> This digital scale provides the accurate measure, and works with AA batteries. Will not disappoint for sure. Unlike other digital scales which provide extra features and don&#x27;t eventually work, this is the best bet for weight watchers.</li>
            <li> Looks nice sitting in the bathroom and seems to be accurate. The weight will vary a pound or two at times but I think that&#x27;s pretty normal</li>
            <li> Pros-&lt;br /&gt;Big numbers&lt;br /&gt;No need to tap scale just step on&lt;br /&gt;Really slim&lt;br /&gt;Lighted numbers, and easy to read&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons-&lt;br /&gt;None so far!</li>
            <li> Used for the past three years. Very reliable; even in the dark with easy to read digital scale.</li>
            <li> When I first got the scale it was very nice. Its nice and sturdy, you can see the numbers really well  but its not accurate the same day I received the scale I tested it and every time it gave me a different number. Also it was never like a 1 or 2 pound difference more like 5 to 10 its a waste of money!</li>
            <li> We have only had this scale for a short time, but are very happy with its size, shape, and results. I especially like the fact that I can step on the scale in the semi darkness of the AM and the weight displays in brilliant color. Our former scale required the bathroom light on to barely see the display.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy. All I needed to do was slip the four AAA batteries (included) in the bottom and it was ready to use. I was thrilled the first time I stepped on the scale. The numbers are large enough to read without glasses. It also helps that the display was lighted.</li>
            <li> This scale was perfect. It is slim and takes up very little space in the closet. I love not having to wait for it to turn on before I step up on it. The LED is super bright and easy to read. Great Scale!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for over a year now and never had any problems with it. Has a nice sleek look to it, so it&#x27;s not an eye sore if you put it in the bathroom. I&#x27;m satisfied with both the price and quality. Fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> This scale delivered on its promise.  Easy to read (in the morning, without eyeglasses!), accurate, nice slim line.  Great value.</li>
            <li> WE HAVE A WEIGHING SCALE AT HOME AND OF COURSE I COMPARED MY WEIGHT  BETWEEN THIS NEW SCALE AND THE ONE I ALREADY HAVE AND THEY WERE VERY CLOSE, ONLY BY POINT DIFFERENCE SO I AM VERY HAPPY ABOUT IT. THE ONE I HAVE IS BIG AND TAKES TIME TO WEIGH MYSELF BUT VERY ACCURATE OF COURSE. SO I NEED ONE THAT I CAN PUT IN THE BATHROOM. WHEN I FOUND OUT THE VERY LITTLE DIFFERENCE OF MY WEIGHT, I WAS VERY EXCITED, MY HUSBAND GOT THE SAME RESULT AS WELL. THIS SCALE IS ACCURATE AND TAKES WEIGHT FAST AND I DON&#x27;T HAVE TO TAP THE SCALE TO TAKE MY WEIGHT WHICH IS NICE. THE NUMBER IS ALSO BIG AND THE LIGHT AROUND IT IS A PLUS- EASY TO READ EVEN IN THE DARK. THE COLOR OF THE SCALE IS ALSO ELEGANT, IT IS ALSO NOT HEAVY AND THIN. I HAD BEEN USING THIS SINCE I GOT IT.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fond of this scale. It is easy to see the numbers. It has a very classy look in my bathroom. It&#x27;s nice to step on the lower profile.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS SCALE BECAUSE YOU DO NOT NEED TO TAP IT TO GET ON AND IT GIVES YOU READINGS TO THE TENTH PLACE. GREAT BUY.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a month and found it very useful. It is slim and does not take much space and results are pretty accurate.</li>
            <li> Love this scale. Accurate and I love that is black...dirt doesn&#x27;t show! Great price. I can step on it several times in a row and get the same weight!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this scale after about one month of use. It has an easy to read, lighted display and the numbers are large enough to see easily. The scale feels well constructed solid. I like that it takes AAA batteries instead of the weird flat ones which are expensive and caused me all kinds of problems with my old scale. The rubber feet on the bottom are just tall enough to stay level on my tiled bathroom floor. Love it so far and great value!</li>
            <li> I bought this scale and am very pleased with it.  It is not big and bulky but slim.  It does all I want it to do and I really like it.  I would not hesitate to buy this again or from this company again.  Nice scale!</li>
            <li> This scale is very, VERY sensitive.  I read reviews on it before I bought it and everyone said it was the scale to buy, so I did. I am very disappointed. This scale has never been accurate, and the worst part about it; a very slight lean to the left or the right makes your weight change 2-3 lbs. My weight never matched up with what the Doctor&#x27;s office said.  Don&#x27;t be fooled... even though it looks nice, it is very inaccurate. I&#x27;ve also had mine for not even a year, and I guess too much water got on it from the shower... now it does not work and says I weigh 28lbs. DO NOT BUY.</li>
            <li> Like it it will not slide</li>
            <li> This is not a perfect scale, but it works fine for the price - better than some that I&#x27;ve paid more money for.  It is a bit finicky - you need to recalibrate after moving it, but I like that you can just step on it and don&#x27;t have to hit a switch and wait.</li>
            <li> This scale is thin and light - nice display that is easy to read.  The shipping was fast, and the customer service from the company was great.  (They emailed me tips for use of the scale.)  I would definitely recommend this to anyone that needs a good scale.</li>
            <li> Easily the best bathroom scale I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Great scale. Spot on with my doctor&#x27;s office</li>
            <li> Followed the instructions to set it up properly &amp; still didn&#x27;t work in the least. Completely inaccurate (and by that, I mean a 25-100 lb difference every single time I stepped on it). After several attempts at getting it to display the correct weight, it eventually died completely and wouldn&#x27;t turn back on. Had it out of the box all of 5 minutes. I will never buy another Omega product again if this is the type of equipment they make.</li>
            <li> The product has very large numbers, so it&#x27;s very easy to read.  To take an accurate reading, the scale must be reset every time you move the scale.  The great thing about this scale is that you do not have to wake it up to use it.</li>
            <li> The Omega unltra slim digital scale is big enough to comfortably accomodate everyone in my family&#x27;s feet (I wear a ladies size 9 1/2 and my husband and son wear 13 - so this was an important consideration for us) and give accurate weight very quickly.  The scale has sense on technology, so you don&#x27;t have to turn it on first, it starts working as soon as you step on it.  The read out screen has a blue background, which makes the numbers easy to read from a standing position.  It is ultra slim as described, and has a modern, high tech look to it.  I have been using the scale for 5-6 weeks now, and it is still working great!</li>
            <li> After having an old, worn out, inaccurate, analog scale for so many years, this purchase was a delight.  It is lightweight, accurate, and low profile, making storage or hiding a very simple task.  I&#x27;ve only had it for a month or so, and don&#x27;t know what the battery usage/durability will be, but so far I would rate this one a perfect 5 without reservation.</li>
            <li> This is our first digital scale. Works great so far, no complains, I should have gotten this earlier instead of freaking out about my weight so often.</li>
            <li> Whose scale this is I think I know but he lives in China though. I look down as I weigh and then I often exclaim Oy Vay.</li>
            <li> The scale is stylish, lightweight, and dead-on accurate. The digital numerals are large and easy to read. Your weight registers virtually instantaneously. This is a great scale and a great buy!</li>
            <li> I would have prefered it to come with batteries but that is just a preferece. Qquick service and a great scale!</li>
            <li> This item was delivered quickly and was perfectly packaged.  It&#x27;s truly ultra slim - very attractive, with an easy-to-read display I can read even without my glasses.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Awesome scale. Seems accurate enough... nice that it gives you weight in kilo. It looks elegant also. No regrets of my purchase.</li>
            <li> Does what it says. Love the slim design.</li>
            <li> Bought on May 11, 2011.  Died recently ... one year after warranty ran out.  Worked great during its fairly short lifetime.</li>
            <li> This is a great scale - easy to use, very slim and fits in my bathroom nicely (it&#x27;s a VERY small bathroom!).  I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to track their weight on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> great bathroom scale, works well and the color is nice.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and service.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this vendo and the scale  without resrevation.&lt;br /&gt;The scale is accurate as well as stylish.</li>
            <li> I just had enough of this scale and threw it out. From day 1, it was off by 15-20 lbs. I mean yeah, it would be great to weigh that little, but when this scale says 115 and you go to the doctor later that day and it says 135, that&#x27;s a pretty big difference. I decided that I could live with that and just add on to whatever the scale told me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blue light would randomly come on throughout the night (I kept it on my bathroom floor which is in my bedroom) and would wake me up. I had to start taking the batteries out whenever I would use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it is a lightweight, sleek looking scale. Maybe I just got unlucky with the light thing. I was in a hurry when I purchased and didn&#x27;t read the reviews.</li>
            <li> This is a very, very thin scale that goes up to 400 pounds!  Instant on by just stepping onto it.  Very accurate, (matches my doctor&#x27;s scales).  Quality, solid construction.  Easy to read.  I would highly recommend this scale to everyone!</li>
            <li> The scale was all it was advertised to be.  it responds immediately without &amp;#34;tapping&amp;#34; first, and is easy to read.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the Omega Ultra Slim scale for a little over a month now. I  am extremely pleased with it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Omega Ultra Slim Digital scale turned out to be a fine choice. It definitely is slim, and, as such, unobtrusive. Accurate? Absolutely. It exactly matched up to the scale at my doctor&#x27;s. The digits are *extremely* easy to read - even without my glasses. Once the scale locks on to your weight, there&#x27;s no fluctuation, and therefore no doubt about what you weigh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s well designed, sturdy (I&#x27;m a relatively big, well, I&#x27;ll say it, stout, man), and the scale has zero problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last, but not least, the price. At $22.00, this scale&#x27;s a steal!  Now... if only it could help me LOSE weight, I&#x27;d give it SIX stars...;-)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know anything about bathrooms scales, and I assume that they are basically very similar, but the style design and the black on silver color of the Epica are outstanding.  Besides they are easy to get on and off, and do not occupy much space.  Definite a 5 star!</li>
            <li> This thing was so extremely cheap but yet, is so amazing! You can&#x27;t go wrong with it. It&#x27;s an awesome scale. :D</li>
            <li> So far so good! Easy set up and super thin so it looks nice and sits nice in the bathroom! Hoping it continues to provide correct weight and ill be happy! Def recommend this over the super expensive scales, its worth it!</li>
            <li> Very nice scale. Easy to use and a nice large display that stays for a while.It was delivered quickly and in perfect shape.</li>
            <li> The scale is great and shipping was fast! It&#x27;s a simple scale and it&#x27;s very thin which I like. I also really like the clear and big digital screen.</li>
            <li> very easy to use my husband has a balance problem and most scales do not record well in this case as soon he is stable standing it records the weight since it lights up it is easy to read.</li>
            <li> Large numbers easy to read and also weight stays on for ten seconds.  Just step on nothing to kick to start.  Attractive appearance.</li>
            <li> Product as advertised and works well. Price is right. However, I ended up returning this item because it gave daily weights that varied by up to four pounds.</li>
            <li> Slim, compact, battery lasts and I don&#x27;t have to turn it off and on.&lt;br /&gt;This replaced another scale that was rated high, but I had to replace the battery every month!&lt;br /&gt;This works great, fits well in the room and I can read the numbers without glasses!</li>
            <li> Delivered in two days and is exactly as shown -- very thin, accurate and easy to read all at a very reasonable price.  What more could you ask for.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent bathroom scale.  The digital reading is large and easy to read.  Also easy to read in the dark since it is LED.  The scale also seems to be very accurate.  It is slim and attractive.  We are very pleased with it and recommend it.  We have only had it a month so I do not know about longevity.  The price is very good for what you get.  It is worth a few extra dollars to get a scale that has the nice features this one has.  You can find other scales with similar features but priced double what this one cost.</li>
            <li> I love this scale.  No tapping on it to turn on, just step on and it accurately weighs you to the ounce.  I&#x27;ve bought scales that were three times as much for the same quality.</li>
            <li> Item was as described in the description. Very sleek and easy to set up. Once concern is misspellings in the users guide. Other than that, great product.</li>
            <li> I appreciate this scale. An important thing to remember is that it needs to be calibrated each time it is put on the floor (step on as if to weigh yourself to calibrate, then weigh again for an accurate weight).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s reasonable price  and good reviews, was a strong factor in choosing this unit.&lt;br /&gt;This is our first digital scale, and it seems pretty accurate, (matches a very expensive balance scale)&lt;br /&gt;and appreciate the feature that allows one to view one&#x27;s weight for a few moments, after stepping off the scale.&lt;br /&gt;Display is bright and easy to read, \\&quot;batteries included\\&quot; is a nice feature; allows one to utilize this scale immediately. Speedy, low cost, Amazon vendor shipping, was a definite plus.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the Omega Ultra Slim Digital Bathroom scale and although the scale is simple, it works amazingly and actually looks very modern. I can step on and step of and I have time to read the measurement. The digits are very big,too, so you can read them standing further away (very helpful trying to weigh your luggage). The measurements seem to be accurate and I feel very happy with the product. I compared a lot of scales, but this one was most outstanding. At first I wasn&#x27;t sure if I am going to like the look due to its simplicity, but as stated before the scale is great, I love it!</li>
            <li> This scale came in a timely manner and is very accurate.  You don&#x27;t even have to tap on the scale to start it, you just step right on and your weight appears in seconds!</li>
            <li> The scale stopped working correctly after a few months and finding the contact information (even with Amazon.com assistance) to have the product fixed/replaced proved to be impossible.  In other words, don&#x27;t count on 1 year advertised warranty.</li>
            <li> It works. The numbers are back lighted so you can see them. It is a slim, trim scale. If only I could be so...</li>
            <li> We replaced a much older scale with this model and we are extremely pleased.  It&#x27;s very quick to report the weight and it can be easily read.  It is also very slim.  The only negative is that it doesn&#x27;t lie about your weight.</li>
            <li> GOOD PRODUCT...&lt;br /&gt;auto calibration and auto on and off function is just superb..&lt;br /&gt;its time to loose some fat baby...</li>
            <li> IT WORKED FINE THE FIRST WEEKS BUT AFTER THAT THE WEIGHT THAT WAS READING WASN&#x27;T ACCURATE, I WOULDN&#x27;T RECOMMEND THIS ITEM.</li>
            <li> Product arrived as described, on time and in good condition. Have been using this in our gym for over a month and have not had any problems.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend who has been working on losing weight for two years. He either had to visit his doctor or go to the &amp;#34;feed store&amp;#34; to get weighed. His old scales only went to 250. He finally got under 400lbs and I found this for him. He says he is very happy with the product and has just broken through 340!! The scale helps him stay on target as often as he wants now. Works great.</li>
            <li> good cheap scale I like to have a scale a work its just where I spend most of my time</li>
            <li> I love this bathroom scale. Well some days I don&#x27;t love it AS much.... if you know what I mean. The display is bright and easy to read. I have had it for over a year and still works just fine. Would recommend</li>
            <li> Scale works excellent. Quick reaction time with an accurate measure that will help anyone get a constant grasp on their weight.  No issues at all with my time with the product and I would recommend this to anyone.  Shipped very fast and arrived without any issues in a effective package.</li>
            <li> Nice wide area to stand on, display is large, and unfortunately it&#x27;s accurate.&lt;br /&gt;It has a modern sleek design, yet is well made and solid.</li>
            <li> This scale is a must for every bathroom.  We all need to keep up with our weight and this is an attractive and easy way to do that.  I would buy it again and suggest it to my friends.</li>
            <li> I reserve the right 2 revise this later if anything should change. I took it with me 2 the Dr office &amp; it was accurate within a half pound of their scale. It&#x27;s thin &amp; lightweight. I was worried that it would be too flimsy 4 my \\&quot;man-weight\\&quot; but it wasn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m happy with the scale &amp; the seller</li>
            <li> This scale looks great in our bathroom.  I love the slim line design and the fact I don&#x27;t have to set it to zero-I can just step on the scale.</li>
            <li> This is a scale I would recommend to anyone who is interested in non bulky ans accurate scale. I just love this scale!</li>
            <li> The scale so far works properly. The thing that irks me is that when I looked scales up on amazon, I put, bathroom scale made in USA, and this was one that came up. This scale is made in China. I didn&#x27;t like this at all.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this scaled even though I&#x27;m 5 months pregnant LOL! This scale has large easy to read letters. Its simple to turn on plus the batteries do not have to be replaced very often. Overall a very good scale for the money it was what I wanted and cheaper to purchase than going to the store where it would be overpriced.</li>
            <li> This scale was perfect straight from the box.  (Which is good or bad, depending on the day for me). Very easy to read, clean and store.  I don&#x27;t like having my bathroom scale in plain sight, so the ability to hide it behind a door is a definite plus.  Big Bang for the buck.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with this scale.</li>
            <li> Great little scale works for what it&#x27;s needed for nice slim design for bathroom&lt;br /&gt;So far so good still working great.</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of time reading reviews of scales before deciding on this one - it seems like every product has at least one very unhappy customer. But it isn&#x27;t me this time - the scale arrived on schedule, well packaged, and worked immediately. I have compared its results with my Wii Fit and another scale I have access to, and it is consistantly accurate. It is small and unobtrusive, but also nice looking. The light-up reading means I don&#x27;t have to turn the light on (although I do need my glasses). Overall a great product.</li>
            <li> Super slim scale, and easy to store while not in use. So far accurate readings, and was easy to use. I like that the screen is lit up too.</li>
            <li> We received the scale in just a few days...it was wrapped carefully and we appreciated&lt;br /&gt;everything about this order....efficient/quick/great packaging...and we love, love&lt;br /&gt;love our new scale...it&#x27;s small and fits well into our bathroom.</li>
            <li> Love this scale.  Works great.  On time delivery. Would order from this company again. The best feature is the stand on to operate feature. Much better than the tap to turn on feature.</li>
            <li> I purchased this scale for the slim design and price. Each morning when I get out of bed, I weigh myself and find that it varies up to 3 pounds on any given day. I honestly don&#x27;t believe I gained and lost 3 pounds daily for a week. I tried resetting it but honestly don&#x27;t feel it is 100% accurate.</li>
            <li> The Omega Ultra Slim Digital scale is excellent. It has a large display that lights up and is easy to read if the room is lighted or not. It isn&#x27;t bulky and easy to pick up and move about. It registers the same so if you get a reading and step off and step back on, it will be the same. Therefore I believe it to be an accurate devise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scale was immediately shipped and arrived in excellent condition and in an expedient manner. Very happy with the product and the service.</li>
            <li> this is a very attractive and very accurate scale i compared it&#x27;s accuracy with the scales at my doctor&#x27;s and my gym and it was in a 1/4 of a lb. difference. it is a great buy for the price.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this scale - it is a great price, the design is elegant and the scale is precise in its measurements.</li>
            <li> Easy to set up -- take it out of the box.  Nice looking scale and very easy to read the numbers.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace a bathroom scale that had, or supposedly had, functions to determine BMI etc.  It never worked quite right and was a pain to use.  This Omega ultra slim is straightforward, provides an easy to view backlit digital screen and seems to correspond well to the calibrated scales used in my doctors offices.  The order arrived on the expected date.</li>
            <li> The scale is EXACTLY what I wanted and it works perfectly. Being ultra slim, it takes up very little space. The readout is very clear and what I like about it is that after weighing and stepping off the scale, the weight stays displayed for a few moments. The scale arrived on time and I am very satisfied with the service and delivery.</li>
            <li> I needed this scale to replace the one that Hurricane Sandy destroyed....I lost 10 pounds from the aggravation but this product is slim and attractive...very well made and fits just perfectly....</li>
            <li> Great scale works well and is sturdy. My hubby and I both use it often. Nice clear reading panel for me even without my glasses</li>
            <li> Sorry to say (since the design, at least, of the appliance is so good) this scale has been unreliable for about half the time I&#x27;ve owned it. Junk. Worthless. Getting another.</li>
            <li> I ordered this scale in hopes of having something sleek and small for my bathroom. The scale is just that! I was very pleased with the price as well as the speedy shipping. I recently lost weight and look forward to seeing that my number stays low. I love the big numbers and bright light display.</li>
            <li> This scale is slim and light and fits nice in our bathroom. I especially like the blue lighted up area behind the numbers, so now I can see how much I weigh in the dark too! ;)</li>
            <li> The scale was great, it has a nice blue light and stays lit for 10 seconds after finishing calculating your weight. No tapping required, very consistent. Love the sleek look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sleek and slim and inspires me to strive to be the same!  The Omega delivers a quick, accurate weight in moments with it&#x27;s sense-on technology. It&#x27;s attractive, but unobtrusive. I love the digital display. Makes it much easier to view.</li>
            <li> this scale works fine and looks nice but I&#x27;ve had it for less than a month and have had to change the batteries 3 times. since it takes 4 AAA batteries it&#x27;s going to get expensive</li>
            <li> I bought this scale for a friend as a birthday gift, which she wanted.  I received the scale quickly and well packed. My friend told me that she loves it. She says it is light, contemporary and nice looking, the numbers show up nice and big, and you do not need to tap it, all you need to do is step on it and it displays the weight.  She also said it is accurate.  All and all, a great scale at a great price, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am pretty satisfied with this scale. I think it was worth spending money. I would recommend to get it if you are looking for a good weighing scale</li>
            <li> Not only is it attractive, but it is accurate! When I had my annual checkup, my home weight was exactly my weight at the doctor&#x27;s office!&lt;br /&gt;However, it lasted only 80 days...Shower spray caused it to die.No drying out helped!</li>
            <li> This scale is Slim, attractive,and easy to read. It seems to be accurate--I weighed myself on a scale with weights that I know is accurate, and this scale gave almost exactly the same weight. The weights are also repeatable--almost the same weight when the same person gets on and off it and then back on. Seems to be much more accurate than another electronic scale we have.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent price for a great, easy to read scale. It&#x27;s the only scale I&#x27;ve had that comes close to my doctor&#x27;s scale.</li>
            <li> Just as represented. So great that it weighs right when you step on it. Slim and does not take up much space. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to read and accurate.  AND, NO TOE TAPPING PRIOR TO GETTING ON THE SCALE !</li>
            <li> This item was defective... weight comes up different every time you step on it...with a 20 lb difference each time.  THEN when I sent it back my shipping reimbursement did not cover the cost of shipping AND it was added to a gift card instead of my checking account.  I do NOT recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It broke within 3 weeks or so. Its a waste of money don&#x27;t buy it. one side i guess gives you an accurate reading and the other side tells your at least 20lbs lighter than you reallly are.</li>
            <li> Very happy it reads weight quickly.In fact got it wet assumed it dead and immediately ordered another&lt;br /&gt;one .IT WAS NOT DEAD. Mailed new one back&lt;br /&gt;to Amazon this morning.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied. Everything as described.</li>
            <li> Works well, good quality, nice read out, consistently accurate.  Just wish there was a smaller size version available for small bathrooms</li>
            <li> When I ordered this scale I specifically requested in the search box &amp;#34;Made in USA only&amp;#34; from an original list of 30-40 scales I was left with only 3 and I chose from these.  The scale works fine but I was really disappointed to find that it was Made in China.</li>
            <li> Great scale! Works great! Exactly as promised. Nice and slim to help me get trim. I was worried about it being too slippery in the bathroom but the surface is great.</li>
            <li> This scale is very accurate. It did take a time or two to get it calibrated out of the box, but now it works great.</li>
            <li> These are attractive scales that function smoothly and accurately to tenths of a pound. Measurements consistent after moving scales about room, and repeatedly off and on the scales five times. Arrived ready to use and as advertised. Especially like that there is no need to calibrate by stepping on and waiting for scales to go to &amp;#34;zero&amp;#34; as with our previous digital scales.  Just step on and wait for well lighted reading to appear.</li>
            <li> I recieved this item pretty fast. I like the fact that its a digital and it has a light on the screen. Its nice and durable and accurate as well. The price was cheap....so for what I paid Im glad I choose this scale.</li>
            <li> This scale works exactly as it should, no problems. My only quibble is that the black surface shows dust easily, but that is a small thing.</li>
            <li> This scale is decent for the price, however, I&#x27;ve noticed that the rubber feet on the bottom move quite easily and when they do it causes the scale to be inconsistent.  These can be popped off and re-adjusted back in to place, but it&#x27;s not a permanent solution.</li>
            <li> I have no problems with this scale! It arrived on time and it is very accurate. I love it and it is very stylish.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if its me or what! Every time I weigh myself its off 1-3 lbs but atleast its not more....I keep track of it anyway :) its really high quality tho! Love the presentation (look)</li>
            <li> Omega Ultra Slim Digital Bathroom Scale is a quality, easy, fairly accurate, affordable product. My husband and I like it.</li>
            <li> This scale is very light-weight, has a back-light screen that allows for easy reading of the numbers, and has four little non-skid feet on the bottom so that it will stay in place on a tile or linoleum floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few issues, though.... The first is that the description is ever-so-mildly inaccurate.  It says up to 400 pounds... the scale has a sticker on it that actually says 396.  While I&#x27;m sure that for most people, that&#x27;s not going to be much of an issue at all, there will be one or two for whom it causes a problem.  My major issue, though, is that the wait fluctuates.  When standing on the scale, the numbers bounce back and forth, back and forth... and it doesn&#x27;t settle on something - it just turns off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have expected (and appreciated) that maybe it would lock-in the weight so that it can be viewed from off the scale (after-all, with such a large population of obese individuals in the US, it&#x27;s likely many will have trouble viewing the numbers from atop the scale).  While I don&#x27;t really have any problems seeing the numbers from on the scale, it&#x27;s sort of frustrating that the numbers bounce around.  There isn&#x27;t one weight - it&#x27;s a dozen different possibilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suspect I&#x27;ll probably return the scale... while for most, it will probably work quite well, I need a bit more of a concrete measurement of my weight.  I am getting ready for bariatric surgery, and will need to closely monitor my weight after the operation.  With the scale not setting in on one weight, that becomes sort of complicated.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace a dead one. It looks nice and seems to give consistent readings. The display is easy to read and, most importantly, it really is instant on. Step on it and read your weight. That&#x27;s about as complicated as I want it in the morning, before I had my coffee.</li>
            <li> This little scale is performing great so far.  Sometimes it takes a little while to make up its mind, but ultimately settles on just about the same weight as the big, old-fashioned, non-digital scale at the gym.  It starts thinking as soon as you step on it, which is great since I have a theory that the \\&quot;light tapping\\&quot; some scales require throws off the calibration with time (let&#x27;s face it, we occasionally stomp if the first light tap doesn&#x27;t do the trick).  It&#x27;s as light and slim as it looks in the picture, and very easy to set up.  I would have given it 5 stars if I had been using it longer, and if it were a bit smaller - For the slim design, I find it just about 1-2\\&quot; sq. too big.  Packaging was not excessive, so not too much trash, delivery was prompt and issue-free.</li>
            <li> I so far think this scale is pretty descent.  I like how it locks in the weight for several seconds.</li>
            <li> Works great.  I gave one to my daughter and she loves it.  Her son has Celiac disease so it&#x27;s important for them to have a scale.  THanks</li>
            <li> I am writing this review on behalf of my wife, although I chose this scale for her.  It is &amp;#34;instant-on,&amp;#34; which she likes, and it seems to be accurate with reproducible readings.  She likes the appearance.  It uses standard batteries rather than coin-type.  It has a backlight.  When it computes the final reading, an indicator light blinks.  She has found that it tracks with the scale at Weight Watchers.  Her words:  &amp;#34;I&#x27;m crazy about it!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I ordered this because it had more good than bad reviews. The packaging was great and Amazon did a great job shipping it quickly and the price was great too and the design was great.  It worked well for the first two weeks, then it was off and on with weight fluctuations and now...I can stand on it and have my weight change from 1 to 8 different weights all before the light shuts itself off. I&#x27;ve tried every way of doing it and I did follow directions. As much as I hate too, I will be looking for a new scale.</li>
            <li> This scale has been used for about a month. It has performed faultlessly to date. The high point is the easy to read lighted dial.This is a particular plus for the middle age+ group who shouldn&#x27;t have to run for their glasses to see the readout. No cons to report yet. It arrived well packed and damage free. Set up was a no-brainer.</li>
            <li> The weight seem to be accurate. The scale is attractive. It is surprisingly thin.The numbers are large and easy to read. So far so good.</li>
            <li> I love my scale I weigh myself each week. It is very thin and light. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The scale might be accurate on average, but the wild (+- 4lbs) swings in value each time it&#x27;s used render it night useless. Avoid.</li>
            <li> This scale does exactly what I need it to do without any confusion. I didn&#x27;t have to input a bunch of data to get BMI, weight, etc.  I just wanted a scale that was easy to use and accurate.  I weighed at home, then went to the doctor&#x27;s office and got weighed.  Identical results.  I love that the display is backlit also, so you can see it in the dark.</li>
            <li> We both like ouir new scale. We like the blue background lighting. We specially liked the fact that our old scale was giving a reading 3 pounds heavier than the new one.</li>
            <li> After the initial setup for the desired configuration, nothing needs to be done from then on.  No tapping the unit to initiate the scale.  The only problem I had was that the scale was a little larger than I had anticipated.  It seems that most of the new scales are larger than those of 20-30 years ago.  My bathroom is very narrow and it takes the whole space between a storage rack and the washing machine unit.  I wish the manufacturers would realize that not all bathrooms are large.</li>
            <li> I had a scale for years that I didn&#x27;t like.  Why keep it then?  Wasn&#x27;t sure any would keep the correct weight.  Well, this one does.  I had a gift card leftover from Christmas so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  No tapping the scale first.  Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It weighs you.  Perfect.  The only thing that you need to pay attention to is when you first add batteries, set it down where it&#x27;s going to be so that it can callibrate.  Otherwise you&#x27;re in for a rude awakening when you hop on an uncallibrated scale!</li>
            <li> Attractive and accurate. Love that it works by just getting on it  - no kickstart required - and it weighs in pounds and portions thereof, as well as even in stones!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish the ad material said it wouldn&#x27;t work on carpet, though. Hence my 4 instead of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Great scale. Automatically turns on once you step onto it and turns off soon after to save battery life. Great size also.</li>
            <li> NUMBERS ARE LARGE AND EASILY READ ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE TO WEAR GLASSES.  I LIKE THE SLIM LINES. EASY TO READ INSTRUCTIONS.</li>
            <li> This is a great scale. Very thin so it doesn&#x27;t take much room. Seems to be very accurate. Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> thank you............</li>
            <li> Came quickly, easy to set up, even easier to use. The price was right too.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that the exterior is plastic. So far it seems accurate but having to reset it each time because the scale location changes daily is inconvenient.  Most people I know (including our family) tuck their scale away when it&#x27;s not being used.</li>
            <li> did not work when I got it, had to return.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other over the counter scales, and not been particularly happy with the accuracy of digital overall.  Comparing this scale to a traditional weight scale at my gym has shown great accuracy and consistency.,  Nice product, good quality.</li>
            <li> This company has been extremely considerate in making sure that I am happy with this purchase.  This is my 3rd digital scale and this one is simple to use and I am very happy with it.  The last two, different brands,  either quit working or got stuck on exactly the same weight for 4 weeks!</li>
            <li> I received my scale on time, as promised and it is all the manufacturer says it is - I need to use it daily for health conditions and it is accurate to my doctors scale. This is a product I definitely recommend to anyone. I am enjoying the use of mine.</li>
            <li> When I weighed myself I noticed I was 10 pounds lighter than I was when I came from the doctor the previous day before getting the scale. Then I got back on later that day and my weight increased about 9 pounds. So the scale is not always accurate.</li>
            <li> I looked over a bunch of scales before I got this one..The one big reason was all the good reviews and also the LARGE back lit LED display.  I almost went for the bamboo one, but the display was smaller. That was a biggie to me.  Also I like that you can get off of the scale and it still reads your weight for a while.  Sometimes, looking down on scales moves the display numbers.  I don&#x27;t even look down till I step off.  I also like that it is a good size but not thick.  Seems to be accurate.</li>
            <li> This is a great scale and we love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this scale about four months ago, and it worked perfectly and weighed with precision. No problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then yesterday all of the sudden it weighed about fifty pounds less than what I had the day before. I assumed the batteries were simply running dead, and put a new set of AAA in. I stepped back on. The weight was still wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this scale if you&#x27;ll just need to replace it in a few months. What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I read all most of the pros-cons before buying this.  So far, it&#x27;s working just as advertised.  It&#x27;s slim, lightweight, and easy to read.  I bought it over others because it was made in the USA.  That was one of the big pros that convinced me about this.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the scale I received.  Slim, very modern looking, and the price was right.  Delivery was very quick.  I&#x27;m happy with the product, although not happy when I read my WEIGHT.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase. I appreciate that the numbers light up and stay lit for several seconds after you step off the scale. Appears to be very accurate, and will measure small fluctuations in weight throughout the day.</li>
            <li> What a terrific scale.  Comfortable to stand on and extremely accurate.  Delivery was fast and product is just what I expected.</li>
            <li> Love the slimness of the scale-not scared of it tipping over like my old one.&lt;br /&gt;I see the doctor in a few months to see how accurate it is, &amp; keep you posted.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, low to floor so easy to get on and off the unit. It came with packaged new batteries so I was able to get it operational &amp; working immediately. I like the no-nonsense ability to just get on and obtain a digital reading and step off - that weight reading stays lit/visible for several seconds before it shuts off making it easy to see/read the large numbers visible. After several weeks of daily using the weight scale, I have not had to change the batteries even once and it is still working strong.  The design of the product is great and overall very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. I have had it for a couple months, works perfect. Nice lcd screen. Light and slim design makes it easy to store under the bathroom sink.</li>
            <li> This scale works as advertised. It&#x27;s nice not having to tap on it. Just get on and wet weighed. We&#x27;ve checked the accuracy. It&#x27;s accurate for us. Sometimes it might get in calibrated but its easy to revs librate (tap, get off, let the light go out) then get on to get weighed and that&#x27;s that.</li>
            <li> great product! I especially love that it takes standard batteries, not those dang hearing aid style.</li>
            <li> Great scale, its super thin and works great!</li>
            <li> We bought this when our last scale saw it&#x27;s end of days.  What we love about this one is that it fits under the bathroom door so when you open the door all the way, it clears the scale no problem.</li>
            <li> it is great having a scale that is easy to read and is accurate in the weight</li>
            <li> Beautiful and so thin. Easy to set up with the included batteries. Was worried that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to stand still enough (Parkinson&#x27;s disease) but it works just fine, reads quickly.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased so far.I could not read my old scale (I am 82) but can read this without my glasses.&lt;br /&gt;I was somewhat unhappy with the shipping and handling charges of 22.25 on a 23.50 purchase price.&lt;br /&gt;Do You have Canadian distributor.</li>
            <li> My husband and I really like this scale.  It&#x27;s low to the ground with a large footprint - making it easy to stand on.  Also like the fact that you can just stand on it and not have to touch it first and wait.  Seems to be very accurate.  And it&#x27;s attractive!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice scale. It is thin and light weight and will fit in my bag to take into a nursing visit. The seller is great, answered all questions and provided excellent service!</li>
            <li> does everything as promised. no frills. its been helpful figuring out my pack weight down to .2 lbs for a hiking trip, as well as my personal weight. good value.</li>
            <li> The bathroiom scale apprive, beautifully packed, with easy to understand instructions.  I really do love this scale!  My old one had a 3 to 5 lb swing, constanatly.  This one is stable and doesn&#x27;t make me guess how much I really weigh.</li>
            <li> I waited a couple of months to evaluate this scale based on daily use and overall accuracy.  I prefer not to write reviews that start with...&amp;#34;I just received this item today and it is awesome&amp;#34;.  Anyway, I have owned this scale for a couple of months now and believe that I can give it an accurate and fair review.  So, if you don&#x27;t want to read any further, I would say save your money and buy a different scale.  For those that care to read further, here is my overall impression...In case you haven&#x27;t noticed there are multiple scales being sold on Amazon right now by numerous companies.  Its almost as if there is some sort a cut throat scale industry fighting tooth and nail for your dollar.  Who knew?  I read through many of the reviews and I was lead to believe the Omega Ultra Slim Digital Bathroom Scale would meet my needs.  I was wrong and sorely misled.  I had 4 requirements when shopping for a scale:  1. It has to be a material other than glass.  I have small children and a glass scale would inevitably lead to a broken scale and mostly likely tears and blood.  Therefore, glass was not an option.  2.  It could not be big and bulky.  I wanted a low profile scale I didn&#x27;t have to constantly move around my bathroom.  3.  It had to have a highly visible display.  At 5:30AM or 10:00PM I don&#x27;t want to strain my eyes or put on my glasses to read the scale.  4.  Finally, the most important feature of all, it must be consistently accurate.  This scale met the first three requirements easily.  It seems to be constructed of quality plastic.  I was able to place it in a location on the floor where it is unobstructed by the bathroom door opening.  It has a beautiful large display that is easy to see.  Unfortunately, that&#x27;s where the positives end.  This scale failed the last test, accuracy.  This scale is not accurate.  If I step on the scale, I will get one reading.  When it goes blank and I step on it again within seconds, it is almost as if it has an internal memoryand gives the exact same reading.  If I step on the scale 3 minutes later, I get a completely different reading.  This happens repeatedly.  To test the accuracy of the scale, I placed a 75lb dumbbell on the scale three different times.  First reading was 72.8lbs, Second reading was 73, Third reading was 73.4.  This scale just isn&#x27;t consistently accurate.  Some might think my review is a bit unfair, seeing as how the scale meets three out of my four criteria.  Perhaps, but I bought a scale and the purpose of a scale is to accurately measure weight.  When a product fails at its primary purpose, then it doesn&#x27;t deserve a rating above 1 star.  So, if you are looking for a scale that will give you a ball park weight, then this might work for you.  If you want a scale that gives you an accurate and consistent weight, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I give this scale a 5 star rating.  It is thin, weighs in .2 pound increments, and is easy to read  with large black on blue numbering. And, it is well-priced.  If you&#x27;re looking for a scale, look no further.</li>
            <li> I bought this scale after I moved out of my family home and into a new apartment. My parent&#x27;s scales (not this one - they&#x27;ve had more than a few over the years) never seemed to work. I would weigh myself a few minutes apart and the weight would change by up to 5 lbs. It would also change depending on orientation, where on the scale you stood, etc. I did not want any of this hassle, so I took way more time than I should have reading reviews for different scales on Amazon, and landed on this one. Have had it for 3-4 years now and I have never had a problem with it. I try to screw it up by moving it around the bathroom, standing on the edges, etc, and it always gives the same result. Unfortunately the weight it says is higher than what I would like it to be, but that seems more like a user problem than an issue with the scale itself. This scale is very accurate, although I wish it would lie to me every once in a while, or at least console me when it reads a higher result than it is used to.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Lightweight. Very accurate. Clear numbers and easy to see in a lighted room or in the dark! One of my best buys!</li>
            <li> This scale is great.  It has a beautiful design and it is consistent/ accurate each time I use it.</li>
            <li> The scale came promptly and in great condition.  I have had it now for over a month and I am still really happy with it.  Accurate readings.  Down side is that it doesn&#x27;t store numbers and show you the last reading (my last scale did that).  I would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> This is a nice sturdy scale with excellent accuracy and easy use. There is no annoying sensor to wait for, you just step right on it.  A great value for the low price.</li>
            <li> look nice, easy to get on weighs properly</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this scale.  Just step on it and you have your weight in seconds.  Big bright display is easy to read.</li>
            <li> This is a great scale.It is pretty accurate.Since I first weighed myself I was 198 lbs now I&#x27;m a 190 lbs.</li>
            <li> Came in as described. Works great! And the backlight is great for seeing at night before I go to bed. I would certainly recommend Omega!</li>
            <li> Works great, sleek design and looked nice and clean! Accurate weights taken. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Very easy to calibrate. Very accurate. Very stylish, like it.</li>
            <li> for my elderly mother, i love it!  slim, so she doesn&#x27;t have to step up much to get weighed and easy to read.</li>
            <li> I love this scale, I use it everyday. I like it a lot better the more my weight is going down. It is a pretty scale and light weight. Would recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> Very fast and well lit scale. You have large numbers that are displayed. I think it is lightweight enough to move around. Just keep it on a level bare floor (No Carpet) and you will be fine. The price is right.</li>
            <li> Straightfoward and simple. No fluff, no stuff. No bells and whistles. No need to let &amp;#34;calibrate&amp;#34; after putting the batteries in. just step on and step off, the display will even leave the number of your weight up for another few seconds. If you don&#x27;t need to know your bone density or other bull then get this very simple and yet stylish bathroom scale.&lt;br /&gt;It has a slim frame and is fairly light. The directions do request that you store it on the ground as if you were to step on it at any time, but it doesnt take up much space anyways.&lt;br /&gt;Takes 4 AAA batteries which are provided in the box.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific scale for the price.  It is easy to read, accurate and is not made of glass so the likelihood of accidental breakage is less.  I have purchased many scales over the years and this one is a keeper.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this scale.  Not only does it weigh accurately, it weighs in .2 lb increments to give you better information for weight management.  I highly recommend this scale.</li>
            <li> Weight fluxuates too much.  Step on it the first time it says one thing, step on it again it says something else.  You get a general idea but not something for someone on a diet.  Next time I&#x27;ll get something NOT electronic.</li>
            <li> This is a great scale with a thin profile, that I like. But it&#x27;s my third (even though the name on the top changes frequently, it&#x27;s still the same exact design). I find that these scales only last a year or two before it crashes and stops working.</li>
            <li> 4 months later, numbers continuously move when stepped on. It&#x27;s possessed. Always a 3 pound difference. What else is there to say? It&#x27;s pretty, sure, but don&#x27;t let looks fool you. Look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this scale for about a month and it works just fine. It gives the same reading when you get on and off it several times and agrees with another scale I own. It is very slim and sleek-looking, and I&#x27;m happy with the purchase, since I didn&#x27;t need any of the additional features one finds on more expensive scales.</li>
            <li> Must have recalibrated it a dozen times per the instructions. It would never settle on one weight ever! Gave up and bought a different scale that works! I&#x27;ll use this one for target practice the next time I go to the range.</li>
            <li> This scale works great and is very accurate.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for the speedy service. I am very happy with my new scale.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted easy to read</li>
            <li> Loved it. Can&#x27;t beat the price. Looks beautiful</li>
            <li> Consistent and accurate every time. Very nice looking too.</li>
            <li> Product is exactly as shown, no complaints!</li>
            <li> Accurate. Nice looking. Best price that I could find. Quick delivery.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for several weeks and it works well.</li>
            <li> Scale did not work, I am waiting to send it back.  It was the second time in my long time dealiings with Amazon that I had to send something back.</li>
            <li> I purchased the bathroom scales as I needed an upgrade to my old one.  I love the slim, not bulky shape.  I do however have one issue.  When you stand on the scales you MUST be completely still!  If you move it&#x27;s all over the place, so you cannot really see the actual weight.  I would not purchase again for this reason.</li>
            <li> Very nice scale, love the modern slim design, and accurate of course. What more could you want? Shipped fast from Amazon, thanks! Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I needed to get a new scale as mine was old &amp; I didn&#x27;t trust the readings anymore, &amp; it was hard to read the numbers. I checked with Amazon &amp; settled on this one. I like it so far. The numbers are much bigger &amp; they are lit up with a blue background. I found out my old scale was off by 6 lbs., in the wrong direction. Time to start dieting again. I am glad I got this scale &amp; I did toss out my old one, good riddance. I think you will be happy with this. It also weighs much less than my old one.</li>
            <li> Attractive, stable, and easy to use and read scale.  Appears to be accurate  Buy it !</li>
            <li> the number are large and bright and stay showing a few seconds after I step off the scale for me to look and see it</li>
            <li> The scale is good but it has its flaws. I don&#x27;t know if its the batteries or what, but Ill step on the scale and it wont give me a final number it will just shut off. So I have to step off re step wait until its at 0 then wait for it to shut off and then try again and so on and so on.  For the price Ill deal with it.</li>
            <li> I got this scale for my mom for her 65th birthday. Not to insult her, but because she found herself getting very discouraged and upset everytime she went to a doctor appointment and they would weight her, because she did not have any idea how much she weighed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I told her not to pay any attention to the doctor scales, as now that she has her own, it is the only one that she need pay attention too anymore. She has lost 12 lbs. and is happy as can be, because she can keep better track of her weight herself now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the great service, product, etc.</li>
            <li> This is a great scale. Big bright numbers. Accurate and sleek. Shipped out fast.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this purchase.  It is easy to read and use.  I would definatly recomend this scale.</li>
            <li> The Omega ultra slim digital bathroom scale is perfect.  First weight ever purchased &amp; really like  the slim design.&lt;br /&gt;Was promptly shipped &amp; received on time.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this scale, it just feels high quality when I step on it.  The LCD is very easy to read and I love how it doesn&#x27;t immediately go dark when I step off of it.  I have about 20 seconds of pride or misery depending on whether I am up or down.  My weight is the same on this scale as it is on the one at the gym that I frequent so I would guess that it is accurate.  Overall I would definitely buy this again, especially at this price.</li>
            <li> I like this scale very much. It&#x27;s small, lightweight, and seems to be very accurate. I especially like that it locks in your weight so that you can stand straight, then get off and see how much you weigh.  (not standing straight and still can alter your reading...that&#x27;s why I like the &amp;#34;lock in&amp;#34; feature)</li>
            <li> I love the scale! A great buy for the money! Looks nice, works great! The scale is thin enough to fit anywhere, sleek enough to leave out!</li>
            <li> Product has woked well and is accurate.Easy to use- no waiting to weigh in Very good value for the money.</li>
            <li> We have had this scale for over a month and are very satisfied with it. It is accurate and consistent. We checked it for accuracy using 5 and 10 pound weights and it added exactly 5 or 10 pounds to our body weights. Having owned several inaccurate scales, I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Set it up as per the instructions. Every time I would step on the scale I would get a different reading. Readings were all over the board within a range of about +/- 3 lbs. I took around 20 readings within a 10 minute time frame. Please also note that at no time was the reading actually near the reading I recently had a few days earlier at the doctor&#x27;s office. I shipped this item back and bought a different brand. That scale works perfectly. Consistent readings. Beware of this thing.</li>
            <li> I loke the sleek slim design on this scale.  I looked at others, but glad I chose this one.  Great product!</li>
            <li> This scale is low profile and has large digital numbers that records to the 1/10th of a pound or kg. It has a broad platform to stand on, so you don&#x27;t feel like your going to fall off. Out of the box, pop in the batteries and you are ready to go. Great unit, seems durable.</li>
            <li> Received these bath scales very quickly.  Works great.  Good service.  Love the low-profile of these scales;  Small bathroom, and the door opens right over them.</li>
            <li> Very nice little scale -- works well and the weight stays on the screen for ten seconds, so like others have said, you can either berate yourself or you can reassure yourself that a second cookie is okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sticker on the front cracked me up -- it&#x27;s written in Engrish. \\&quot;Please reset the scale after you moved it.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> OUTSTANDING!!!  Large numbers - can&#x27;t miss them.  Accurate numerical count.  Great in all respects.  Remember to put it on a oard of some type or on the bare floor.</li>
            <li> very nice scale, light the back lighting on the numbers, makes it reel easy to read,</li>
            <li> Awesome scale, very accurate and easy to read.  Looks like it would cost much more.  Highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Blue lights are nice also.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much it works great. So much nicer not having to tab or stomp just to get it to work. Also liked how the company contacted about a week after getting it to make sure that its working well. Thank you and it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Love the design of the scale.  Slimline and stylish!  Works great and readout is bright and easy to read. Great price for this scale as well!</li>
            <li> Wonderful scale works like its suppose to. on and off features or nice, big bold readings for your weight . Look no further this is a scale that will please you!</li>
            <li> Very happy with my scale! Fast &amp; friendly service and well packaged. Price was right too!&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend it to buy. Love digital feature</li>
            <li> Great price and slim profile.  Satisfied with my purchase and recommend this scale.  Only problem I had at first I had it on a flat rug, never a problem with my old scale.  I was getting inconsisrent results (still close but...) so you definitely want this on flat solid flooring.</li>
            <li> The scale is great!  works well and shipped very fast.  I recommend this product and seller and I will buy from them again.  Also the blue backlight makes it very easy to read</li>
            <li> This scale is great.  It is nice looking, slim and the color is attractive.  I love the fact that the numbers are large and easy to read.  Also, the price is extremely reasonable.  All in all, I would recommend this scale to anyone shopping at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Just received my scale and so far it has been all that I hoped for.  Easy to read and very light weight.</li>
            <li> First thing I was surprised at is how small this product is! That&#x27;s not a complaint, but at my size I guess I sort of expect things to be HUUUGE, and this wasn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to assemble, sleek looking, big bright display. Small size that is not ugly or obvious (we were able to slide it under some furniture) and it was very accurate. I was weighed about two weeks ago at the doctor&#x27;s on a digital scale, and this little scale measured me within a few pounds of that, so I&#x27;m going to say I think it&#x27;s pretty close to as accurate as it gets. All scales are different, but I was surprised how close this number was to the office&#x27;s number. I&#x27;m glad of that (if not so happy with the number itself, haha).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The low profile of the scale means that you do have to look down a decent amount to see the display, so if you&#x27;re bigger you may have to step a little, but the number stays so it should be fine. Also, the back light is a nice touch -- helped me to see. My eyes aren&#x27;t great and the numbers are obvious, no issues discerning 8&#x27;s from 0&#x27;s, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, happy so far. Will update if there are any sudden changes!</li>
            <li> My scale was as advertised and here on time. Exactly what I was looking for. It is easy and accurate.</li>
            <li> Very Easy to use and completely accurate....... This product will last a long time....Amazed....</li>
            <li> Accurate and works exactly as described.  We had other digital scales that were not accurate or did not work all the time.  We were concerned about buying another Digital scale.  We took the reviews in consideration and purchased the Omega.  Very Pleased.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product. Very easy to read and seems to be accurate. Easy to store. Slim and lightweight. After researching lots of products was glad I chose this one.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a few months ago. The quality of this product was high and incredible. I recommend this product to you.</li>
            <li> I needed an accurate weight scale to keep track of my efforts to trim 30#(doctors orders, wife&#x27;s delight).  After some research I settled on the Omega Ultra Slim Digital Bathroom Scale from Perella&#x27;s.  They shipped it immediately, it arrived on time in pristine condition and I am extremely happy with the product even though it tells me the truth about my lax attempts to lose the extra poundage.</li>
            <li> This thing is with in 1 pound of my doctor&#x27;s scale and has been really accurate with helping me keep track.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice and wide, and pretty sturdy. Well worth the money. I just love it.</li>
            <li> It stopped working after 3 1/2 months.</li>
            <li> 13 months later its gone haywire and is going in the trash, seems it is another disposable product for the American consumer. Im off to shop for another one, hopefully it will last better than this one did.</li>
            <li> High quality look and feel, extremely accurate and consistent measurement, very affordable.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why putting the scale on a hard surface vs carpet makes a big difference, but carpet makes it inaccurate by over 100 pounds. Also, compared to the scale at my doctor&#x27;s office, the measured weight anywhere between 15-40 pounds less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An inaccurate scale is a useless scale.</li>
            <li> When these scales work, they are great. My old mechanical had long since needed to be put out to pasture, and a digital one seemed the next logical step. At a quite reasonable price, this scale caught my attention, as it&#x27;s attractive as well. They tend to be reliable--though not always--so I crossed my fingers and bought it,..and...so far so good. it&#x27;s been a  few months and I am delighted with it still. It works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If that changes, I&#x27;ll return for an update.</li>
            <li> We love this scale, my elderly Mom was having a hard time reading her scale. It is important for her to weigh everyday. She can read the scale and it is great. Thank YOU</li>
            <li> Best scale I have ever owned. I am sixty years young and have owned many scales, this by far is the best.  Regards; LVB</li>
            <li> This scale is accurate and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;the automatic on feature is great!&lt;br /&gt;Best scale I ever had to use</li>
            <li> The scale works great. I love being able to see my weight gain and loss, even if it&#x27;s a small amount.</li>
            <li> Great scale for the price. I would definitely recommend this scale to others . Timely shipment. Exceptional follow-up by manufacturer following purchase - nice personal touch!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased when I saw the size of the scale.  It is thin and compact.  It fits in my bathroom beautifully.  I also like the size of the numbers, very easy to see.  I also like that it only takes a few seconds to register my exact weight.  Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I sent this to my son in his dorm, everyone uses it and loves having it there!  Great purchase for him!</li>
            <li> This scale could never settle on a weight sometimes weighing as much as 200 pounds less than should be accurate. Within ten minutes I weighed myself three times and one time lost 15 pounds then gained 40 then loss 90. I am returning this and ordering one that hopefully actually works.</li>
            <li> This scale is worth every penny.  I&#x27;ve tried cheap scales before, which were very unreliable.  The Omega is light, sleek and very accurate.  No matter I weigh myself in the kitchen or upstairs in the bathroom, the reading is the same. I enjoy weighing myself now!</li>
            <li> This may sound stupid, but our scale arrived exactly as pictured, with one difference. It says &amp;#34;epica&amp;#34; not &amp;#34;omega&amp;#34; across it. For me that is mildly annoying, but it is a solid, sturdy, compact, sleek scale, so I can&#x27;t complain a bit!</li>
            <li> I bought this because i was on a weight reducing plan so that i can check my weight regularly. I have read bad reviews but dint take them seriously. Now i repent. The scale shows random weights at random times. Its a waste of money.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s a scale, and it&#x27;s digital. It seems to be much sturdier and fancy then the last scale I had, but I did weigh more back then. It&#x27;s quick and as far as I can tell, deadly accurate. Like, this scale could probably assassinate a third-world country&#x27;s disposed monarch, if a scale could fire lethal projections and it had the stomach for that type of work. I don&#x27;t, but that&#x27;s just me. Anyhoo, back to the scale. It fits nicely under my cheap storage shelf for easy morning access. I hear you&#x27;re supposed to weigh yourself in the morning, right? For the first month or so I had this, I weighed myself every morning. Do not do this. Instead, just randomly weigh yourself when you think about it, so there&#x27;s less disappointment and/or encouragement. Just stick to healthy eating and watch your body. Then weigh as needed. I am not a doctor.</li>
            <li> Works great. Matches exactly the weight I get from my Dr&#x27;s office. I also like that you don&#x27;t have to step on step off. You step right on and it gives you your weight.</li>
            <li> Nothing to report except - it&#x27;s a scale and it weighs me without any problems or glitches, which is all I wanted. No big bells or whistles.</li>
            <li> Works great. it shows weight with tenths.  It has background light so you do not need the lights on to read the display even if you wear bifocals.</li>
            <li> Very good .  Exactilly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This is our first digital and we love the sleek look and accuracy. We&#x27;ve only been using it a few months but it is way more accurate than our dial scale and definitely more visually appealing.</li>
            <li> Most excellent! Good quality, good customer service and looks good. Fabulous!!</li>
            <li> This scale is very easy to use,&lt;br /&gt;but I had trouble after charging&lt;br /&gt;the batteries. Several people&lt;br /&gt;tried to help me get it going&lt;br /&gt;again. Be warned that when you&lt;br /&gt;take the batteries out to recharge&lt;br /&gt;them make notes about how they&lt;br /&gt;should be placed.</li>
            <li> The scale works great</li>
            <li> Bought this slim and lightweight scale for use in our motorhome. Really needed one since we are on the road for months at a time. Only wish it was a little smaller, like 10x10 instead of 12x12. Seems accurate as compared to our bulkier scale at home.</li>
            <li> Love it, lost over 20lbs today and this guy has helped keeping track, I used a doc scale then this scale not off at all, worth the $20</li>
            <li> A great scale at a great price</li>
            <li> This scale is very accurate. I bought this for my son &amp; he is very pleased with it. This is a nice, modern looking scale. I am really pleased with it &amp; it arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> This scale is awesome! It&#x27;s lightweight, looks nice and is accurate! The price was great too.</li>
            <li> Works well, and easy to slide under a storage cabinet so it does not cause clutter.</li>
            <li> Its an excellent product. very well design and accurate.</li>
            <li> Our scale fits our large feet and small bathroom.  No &amp;#34;jiggling&amp;#34; to get a reading -- the reading is quite clear, even without my glasses.</li>
            <li> I hate giving bad reviews.  However, this scale isn&#x27;t consistent.  You can step on it and then off, get back on immediately and the difference might be up to 10lbs.  I&#x27;ve waited  a couple minutes, and got back on and it&#x27;s a totally different number.  You&#x27;ll never know what you truly weigh with this. When I went to my doctors appointment, I  was 11 lbs less than the scale told me that same morning.</li>
            <li> This scale gives me different readings each time I step on it.</li>
            <li> Great slimline scale with bright LED display.  I noticed that I was getting some inaccurate readings when I first set up the scale for use (which is VERY EASY) The scale was touching the baseboard in my bathroom causing false readings.  Once I pulled it away from the wall a bit, it seems to work great.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this scale!  LOVE&amp;#62;&amp;#62;LOVE&amp;#62;&amp;#62;LOVE!!!&lt;br /&gt;It reads accurately !!! YEah!!&lt;br /&gt;My previous digital scale..even with a new battery would give me several different weights..and since I am on a long run&lt;br /&gt;health plan of turning myself into a slim and healthy person from an obese one..I NEED A scale that is accurate. My other one just frustrated the heck out of me! A nice little surprise..it has a light that comes on..and NO tapping..you just get on it! Very sleek and looks beautiful in my bathroom!</li>
            <li> The scale is really nice and totally accurate. I couldn&#x27;t have bought a better one. I highly suggest this product.</li>
            <li> I was glad to get a scale that was easily read and maintained. It has been used in a bathroom with alot of moisture and it handles the conditions nicely. I like the fact that the batteries(which are included in shipping) can be easily purchased from stores too,and that it is consumer friendly.I would recommend this scale to anyone interested in accurate weigh-ins for training and diet programs. The scale doesn&#x27;t lie...however, it does motivate me for continued work outs and the bright blue screen is a cheerful reflection of the \\&quot;weigh\\&quot; I see it.</li>
            <li> I needed a new scale. I needed one that was affordable as well as accurate.  This scale was both of those as well as thin and smart looking. It does the job well. New diet , lost 12 pounds in three weeks! Very happy with my choice of a scale.</li>
            <li> Ah, the New Year. When we all vow to cut out the carbs and count the calories. In my own feeble effort to shed a few pounds this year, I decided to invest in a decent scale. I have specific needs, and did NOT want a glass scale, nor did I want it to be heavy or bulky. I chose this scale because it had positive reviews and had the profile &amp; features I wanted. I couldn&#x27;t be happier...well, I *could* be happier if it would just show lower numbers, but I can hardly blame the scale for that!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product.  It arrived earlier than they said and it looks and works great.  It is very easy to calibrate it, the instructions are one page long and easy to follow.</li>
            <li> This is my third digital scale and by far the best. We are both big people and this scale is easy to use, no tapping it first. It fits under counters well (a problem with the others)and I love that I can see the huge numbers even if I do not have my glasses on. Right out of the box you need to put in the provided batteries, set the scale on a hard floor to let it calibrate and its ready to go. I gave it 5 stars for ease of use and sleek low profile with large backit numbers. I can not think of anything else I would need in a scale</li>
            <li> This scale worked right for about three weigh ins. Then one day I moved it to mop in my bathroom and when I put it back on the floor it said that I weighed 356 lbs (which is over 200 more than what I weigh) and continued to error out when I tried to reset it until it just stopped working all together. It was so disappointing and such a waste of my money I wish I had bought a different one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;maybe I got a defective one.</li>
            <li> My Omega Scale is thin enough that the bathroom door swings  over it without touching it.  It displays my weight to 0.2 pounds with a large backlit display so I do not have to turn on the light to read it.  I feel motivated to eat right and exercise every time I weigh myself!</li>
            <li> I did quite a bit of research into the best, most accurate scale for my money, and this one won out. I&#x27;m very pleased with it. It gives me the same weight when I weigh myself multiple times in a row. The screen is very bright, and stays on for ten seconds after I step off. It looks very modern and minimalistic, which I like. It&#x27;s easy to clean, and has a low profile, so I can tuck it under stuff.</li>
            <li> great scale.  just step on and your weight will appear.  no need to weight!  haha</li>
            <li> I found the device to be worth..the digital scale is catchy, smart and doesn&#x27;t occupy much space. The weight is measured in KG, pounds. The weight is accurate and it helps you to maintain a good health.</li>
            <li> This scale is great, to say the least. It is thinner than you could imagine, lightweight, and the screen is brilliant. It conserves battery life by only turning on when you step on it. Not need to tap it or flip a switch. The readings are quick and the final measurement stays on the screen for a few seconds so you can easily view it. The scale is very simple to calibrate, and only requires calibration once. I weigh 250 pounds right now, and the scale felt sturdy. Not once did I feel like I was standing on something flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the scale is a great buy for the price. I&#x27;ve had several digital scales in the past and all of them disappointed me in some way. This one didn&#x27;t even come close. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to gain control of their weight.</li>
            <li> I love love love my new scale.  Hope on and off. That&#x27;s it!!</li>
            <li> i needed a scale. this one is a little off sometimes, if you stand a little to the side. but it still shows me losing weight, so no harm no foul</li>
            <li> not accurate and no way to zero</li>
            <li> Very nice, affordable scale.  Prompt delivery.  Enjoying it&#x27;s sleek, modern style.  Accurate.</li>
            <li> Hesistant at first but nothin to it works as described. the sensors are on the bottom so important for it to be leveled or will be off readings. DO NOT USE on the carpet. Works great for the price but get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> this scale looks charming but isn&#x27;t the best at all. turns off while trying to give you the number,changes the weight in mins. forexample it goes from 140 to 170 in just two mins.LIke really? It was waste of MY MONEY.</li>
            <li> I found the scale to be exactly as described on Amazon. Shipping was quick and this unit is slim and lightweight with s 400 lb. capacity.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, it works well and is easy to see.  It looks nice and was worth the price!</li>
            <li> Step on it, it lights up, shows your weight in nice large numbers, no need for glasses and no need to tap first....&lt;br /&gt;My husband and I use it every morning, seems to be accurate and we like it!  My son recommended it to us as he had just gotten one.  I would happily recommend it to anyone interested in a bathroom scale.</li>
            <li> Great scale. Large numerals that are easy to read. Just step on for measuring. Step off and it goes off.</li>
            <li> I wish I had paid more attention to the negative reviews before purchasing this.  Now I have to pay to ship it back.  The instructions are in very broken english, and contradict themselves.  \\&quot;Don&#x27;t tap\\&quot;, or \\&quot;tap\\&quot; to recalibrate?  Which is it?  Also, weighing several times a few minutes apart gave me readings that varied by as much as 30 pounds.  But the most irritating thing is that it doesn&#x27;t actually ever decide on a weight.  It fluctuates up and down between a 4 pound range, and I patiently wait, as still as I can, not even breathing, but it never decides on a number.  It&#x27;s still fluctuating when the display turns off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointing.  Back to amazon it goes.</li>
            <li> I just got this and I too am not happy. I can&#x27;t get it to settle on a specific weight and it fluctuates between 15 and 50 lbs. I can&#x27;t get it to work properly even right after calibration and using it on my wood floors. I am not happy. I weighed myself yesterday at the doctors, so I know what it should be, but not once as it come close to my accurate weight. It is sleek and thin and the late display is nice, but that&#x27;s about it</li>
            <li> This is a great scale, especially for the price. Works perfectly for me. I read a lot of reviews (yes, for a scale) and I&#x27;m glad I choose it.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the slim profile, and it was advertised as good for people with balance problems. Yes the profile is slim and it is easy to step on, but it does not work well if you have a serious balance problem. It takes me longer to balance my self well enough that I can look down at the weight reading than the reading stays illuminated. The scale is therefore useless to me unless I have another person with me that can read the number before the light goes out. I give the profile 5 stars and the readout 0 stars.</li>
            <li> Works well as long as  you have a very even floor and you have very good balance.</li>
            <li> Great scale. Keeps your weight  visible when you step off.</li>
            <li> This scale has been holding up very good. It doe a great job, easy to read. You can get the app for your iPhone and keep track of your weight, great for when your on a diet.</li>
            <li> I love these scales and had bought them before, but my toilet leaked water onto the floor and they didn&#x27;t quite work right since.  So I bought them again.  Love the lighted display with LARGE numbers.  Very sleek and cool looking too.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Superb service.</li>
            <li> I just got this scale this evening. I opened it and followed the directions to get it on and working. The weight kept fluxuating and not just by a pound or two it was jumping 5 to 10 lbs. Then the backlight would go off after 10 seconds and I was unable to see if the weight ever did stop fluxuating or to get an accurate reading. I&#x27;m very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> Great scale. Accurate, lighted, easy to read, keeps recorded weight on after stepping off. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> This scale works really well and looks sleek and nice on my bathroom floor. I&#x27;m so glad I purchased it!</li>
            <li> The scale is everything that was promised.  Nice sleek design, accurate, easy to read.  I would buy another if I needed one.</li>
            <li> Easy to read digital display.  As best as I can tell it works properly.  Only been using the produce for a week or two, so will have to wait and see how long it holds up.  For now, very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> 1 - Directions were unclear about positioning of the batteries. Finally had to use a magnifying glass to see the + inside the battery compartment.&lt;br /&gt;2 - The digital numbers are CONSTANTLY changing, so they NEVER settle to just one number. I have to ASSUME that the last number I can read, before the screen goes blank, is my weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nearly a total piece of crap, in MY opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just not worth the hassle to try to return it!!!</li>
            <li> The scale is very light and compact. However, i do not depend in what it says. I&#x27;ll weigh myself and then weigh again two minutes later and it says something different! I have reset it numerous times and i still have this issue.</li>
            <li> I loved this scale and then the batteries it came with died. I have tried numerous brands of fresh batteries since and it does not turn on. Very disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> My old scale was about 20 years old and not very accurate any more. I looked at a number of different ones, and chose this Omega Bathroom Scale, mainly due to others&#x27; reviews. I&#x27;ve used it for 2 1/2 weeks now. So far, it&#x27;s very accurate to the tenth of a pound. I have checked it against a more expensive one at my gym. The only down side is that, due to the back color of the reading, black on bright blue, I cannot read the number without my glasses on. It&#x27;s big enough, but the color contrast doesn&#x27;t make it visible enough. Just a little annoyance. Black on white is much easier to see.</li>
            <li> This is a seriously nice scale. It measures in both lbs and kg.</li>
            <li> Ok how excited can you really be about a scale?  This one does the job.  My only wish would be that it wasn&#x27;t so darn accurate. LOL</li>
            <li> The scale is great.  Very accurate.  Extremely easy to set up, and it arrived in only a few days.</li>
            <li> I bought this scale because my old one died and my trainer had an Epica and I wanted some consistency between the scales.  It&#x27;s done a great job!</li>
            <li> Worked good for the first day only. Now it will reads from 100 -400 on any given time. Very dissatisfied ,I will be returning it.  Would not recommend..</li>
            <li> So far this scale performs very well. The weight is very close to my doctor&#x27;s scale. it looks good and so far is very reliable.</li>
            <li> Very happy with purchase</li>
            <li> I received the scale as a gift.  The read out is in large numerals and very easy to read.  Karen Beckman</li>
            <li> I bought an Omega Slim Digital scale about a week ago. The Scale seems a very good value for the money and is very nice looking comparative to the average clunky looking bathroom scale . The quality seems high and it is dead on accurate compared to my other scales. The delivery time was a little slow but the vendors estimate was about right. They had estimated about two weeks and thats how long it took. Since the item apears to be coming from somewhere in Asia the delivery time is no surprise but you are forwarned you won&#x27;t get next day delivery. So far it seems an excellent product for an excellet price.</li>
            <li> What a great looking scale at a fair price and shipped quickly too.</li>
            <li> Very sleek design and I am extremely happy with this scale. It&#x27;s slightly larger than I expected, which is bonus for anyone with large feet :). Scale came well packaged for shipping and is light weight. LOVE the screen - lights up bright and is easy to read. EXCEPTIONAL product and would highly recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> simple as described looks great and works. Also the weight stays consistent good transaction</li>
            <li> Great scale.  Works well and looks great.  Our two kids liked it so much they both have one now as well!</li>
            <li> Great scale.  Weighed myself just before going to the doctors for an annual physical and it was exactly the same.</li>
            <li> Very nice bathroom scales excellent price</li>
            <li> Works really well (at least in the last month that we&#x27;ve had it), looks exactly as advertised, and the display is clear and easy to read. Great value.</li>
            <li> No complaints here. The scale is pretty accurate and for the price I paid I was very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> This scale is awesome! I have tested it out against my doctor&#x27;s scale and my chiropractor&#x27;s scale and it is spot on everytime.  Easy to use, slim features make it simple to find a convenient space location.  Price mark is great...not too expensive not too cheap.  Cheaper scales seem to have more variance in weight accuracy so the reasonable Omega&#x27;s cost is acceptable. Great scale...hope to have years of use!</li>
            <li> the only turn off was that the product description said it would come with batteries, which it did, but they were dead. other than that it does what i need it to do. only took a couple days to arrive.</li>
            <li> this product is complete crap&lt;br /&gt;as soon as i stepped on it the number started jumping around wildly and then turned off before it settled, i looked to the instructions for help and it seemed to be written by a first year english student from japan&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY THIS&lt;br /&gt;i just got it 5 minutes ago and im already gonna throw it in the garbage 30 bucks down the drain</li>
            <li> This Ultra Slim Digital Scale is nice and easy to read, it&#x27;s light weight and always accurate. I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This scale has worked perfect for me ever since I opend the box and inserted the batteries. It is thin but feels very sturdy. You don&#x27;t need glasses to read the large lighted screen. This is the identical scale that I found under a big name brand for half the price. Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I really like these scales. They are accurate, the display is easy to read, and it&#x27;s great they activate by stepping on them. My only disappointment is I can&#x27;t also use them to weigh my cats or packages (unless I weigh them with me) because of the raised centre section. Overall though, a very good product so far.</li>
            <li> Returned because it would not give accurate reading and kept changing from LBS to KGS.  Ten pounds difference from one use to the next.  Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this scale. If you step on it, it there are variations on how you move.  There is no consistency at all. I can&#x27;t get even get w weight that seems correct.  Not sure why others give good reviews. Wish I had known that it was this way. Bummer:(</li>
            <li> Fast shipping ...This is a great product at a great price, buy it!&lt;br /&gt;Keep it by the refrigerator and it will remind you what a PIG you are..ha ha</li>
            <li> We serarch online at Amazon for a bathroom scale and are delighted with the Omega Unlra Slim Digital. It looks great with a slim, modern design and fits well into our decor. It had the price point we were looking for, and the packaging and delivery were both excellent.  It was our first purchase from your company, and we were totally impressed at every level.</li>
            <li> We bought this scale to replace a different brand model which wasn&#x27;t old or cheap but simply a piece of digital junk we got from a local store. Very good looking design but inconsistent, jumping up to 5-7lbs after moving its place, or from AM to PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This scale has exceeded our expectations by far. It is very accurate and most of all very consistent every time, even after moving its place.&lt;br /&gt;Beside being accurate it is also pretty stylish, featuring a blue back-lit LCD display, so ambient light level or angle is not an issue.&lt;br /&gt;Simple to use, just step on and get your reading.&lt;br /&gt;We highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered the omega bathroom scale.  It is sleek and looks good but doesn&#x27;t work!  I followed the directions and put the batteries in and the readout on the scale read 914 when I stepped on it.  I removed the batteries and attempted setup a second time and got the same result.  I then called the customer service number that was listed on the owners manuel.  I got voice mail and left a message regarding the problem I was having.  Five days later they have not returned my call.  Very poor customer service.</li>
            <li> This is a very good scale.  The previous scale I had would give different readings if I stepped off and right back on, but this one gives the same reading.  I also like the large, lit display.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially, I was going to purchase another scale on Amazon that had a large number of positive reviews.  However, the number of reviews made me a little suspicious (the number of reviews was higher than almost all other items on Amazon), and I found out that the other company rewards people for posting good reviews, so I didn&#x27;t trust those reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this scale for a couple of weeks now, and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Never knew what it was going to give me, sometimes it was lower and some times it was higher.  Ex. It would show 112 then you test again and its 130 then again and 172 then 120.  It does not know what its doing always wrong and random.</li>
            <li> This scale is excellent both in terms of form and funtion.  I like that you can step on it and get an immediate read out;  that it holds the number for three-four seconds before going dark (alllowing  just the right amount of time for \\&quot;contemplation\\&quot;); and lastly, that it is very sleek and high tech looking.</li>
            <li> Edit review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having this product for several months, for whatever reason it has gotten very difficult to weigh myself. The scale use to keep your weight for a couple of seconds so you could see it, however now it does not, and I find it to be rather useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love my scale. I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t work well but I think I&#x27;ve had it now for about two weeks maybe longer. It&#x27;s been working beautifully. I use it everyday sometimes two or three times a day. I love the blue from it too and how it automatically shuts off. It&#x27;s a wonderful product and I am behind it 200%</li>
            <li> This is a very attractive scale, also slim and lightweight.  The read-out is large and stays lighted quite a while.  It is just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Short and sweet: We like this scale...and that is from a household that hates clutter and &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; laying about.&lt;br /&gt;I really like the company I bought this from. Their customer service is AWESOME. Thank you to Perella&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> Good Scale.  Great price.  Definitely recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Easy to set up.  Blue numbers lock at weight so you can step off and still see the weight.  No need to &amp;#34;pre-cal&amp;#34; with an initial step like my previous one</li>
            <li> I needed a scale that was accurate to record my weight daily for medical reasons.&lt;br /&gt;After looking at many different ones and reading reviews, I chose this Omega.&lt;br /&gt;I have found it to be accurate within 2 tenths of a pound compared to a professional scale and very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Ordering was easy and scale arrived within a few days using standard shipping.&lt;br /&gt;I reccomend this scale highly.</li>
            <li> BEST SCALE - I have 3 and love them.  They are so accurate, never a problem.  Bought way more pricey scales and they were nothing but trouble.  This is great value, and came so fast.</li>
            <li> This scale takes up very little space on my floor! It works wonderfully, so easy to use, just step on and you have a reading right away! Readings are very consistent, I tested it by stepping on and off several times and always got the same reading! Great investment.</li>
            <li> Fun to use!  Get on the scale, read the large digital display and do that every morning.  It&#x27;s attractive and accurate.  The only drawback for me is that my apartment space is tiny, and the directions say that it shouldn&#x27;t be placed on carpet.  That just leaves my kitchen, and a very little spot in the bathroom.  Other than that, it&#x27;s terrific.  This is my first scale, and I don&#x27;t know how I managed without one.  Using it daily is really helping me stay on track of my weight-maintenance goals.</li>
            <li> This scale is great, very compact and easy to use.  I like it has an auto on and off features</li>
            <li> My new Omega Ultra Slim Digital Bathroom Scale replaces a 6 year old scale that I never trusted.  Every time I used it I could get three or more different&lt;br /&gt;readings.  This new one is very accurate (I checked at the doctors office).  It is so sleek and thin, there isn&#x27;t much to clean on it and for an 80 year old&lt;br /&gt;lady the digital reading is large and clear.  I like my new scale very much.</li>
            <li> The scale is easy to setup. Has a large legible display. It requires 4 batteries though (they provide one set with the scale). It also has an option to change the display units. Overall, a good buy..</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s compact and seems quite accurate.</li>
            <li> First, the usual:  quick shipping, product well-packed, no damage, batteries included.  Quick display response when I step on it.  Seems to correlate with professional calibrated scale in the clinic at my work, so I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I just received this purchase and I&#x27;m very disappointed. We tried the scale out five times in a row and each time the scale provided a different weight output, sometimes varying by nearly 10lbs! This scale appears to be highly inaccurate and very unreliable. Unfortunately I disposed of the packaging so I can no longer return the item. What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> The build quality is excellent. I&#x27;ve owned heavy scales in the past. But this one is unbelievably thin &amp; light, it&#x27;s so easy to carry from one room to another. But that portability itself is its problem. Because once you move it even slightly, the scale needs to be calibrated. It takes 2 or 3 attempts (stepping on it &amp; off it) before it returns the correct reading. I have also noted that the reading tends to be off by a little (0.1-0.2 Kg) if you don&#x27;t use the scale for a few days. The display is nice &amp; large with a blue backlight. It certainly scores in the looks department. And the price is also very reasonable. I hope Omega improves the sensor accuracy &amp; calibration.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  Have only had the product for one month and no problems thus far.  Good product so far.</li>
            <li> This scale looks good, works well and is very inconspicuous. I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase and because of the competitive price, as well as the specific reading (tenths of pounds) I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very accurate scale.  I take some diuretics and have to weigh myself daily so have been very satisfied with the accuracy and ease of using this scale.  I highly reccomend it.</li>
            <li> Very nice scale.  It&#x27;s thin and attractive for a scale.  The numbers are easy to read.  Very happy with the scale, but not too happy with my weight.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to keep track of my weight loss through dieting and exercise, and received it this past Monday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- The screen is nice and bright, the lock in feature is nice&lt;br /&gt;- The scale looks nice and is relatively small, making it an easy fit for any bathroom floor.&lt;br /&gt;- The step on to activate feature seems to work fairly well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Build quality. If you&#x27;re nearing the high end of the range this scale offers, you may encounter troubles with maintaining the scale.  Embarrassingly, the scale made loud cracking noises and felt physically stressed during my first attempts at using it (I am within the higher end of what this scale supports). While I cant say for certain that the build quality is an issue, I would have to imagine that the sounds I heard were not in fact part of the feature set of the scale.&lt;br /&gt;- Reliability. If you&#x27;re nearing the end of the range this scale offers you may encounter issues with unreliable weight measuring. I got mixed readings despite multiple recalibrations of the scale. I am not sure if this is an issue that exists within lower ranges of the scale, as I had someone else test it and they received fairly similar results each time.&lt;br /&gt;- Confusing/Misleading instructions. The instructions state in three different places that you must calibrate the scale before you use it (and any time when you move it afterwards), yet each of the places describes a different method in which it has to be done. The manual will state that you need to just replace the batteries and do nothing with it, while another place will mention that you need to stand on it and let it turn off without getting off, and yet another place will mention tapping the bottom unit button/tapping the scale to get it to calibrate back to 0. With some trial and error, you&#x27;ll figure it out, but if bad English makes you weary of products then you might look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: If you&#x27;re in the higher range that thisscale supports, you might be better off buying a slightly more expensive model with higher build quality and more reliable measuring for larger weights. I myself have returned my product and am now looking for a better scale to utilize. However, I am still rating this an average as it managed to do all the features it promised, and appears to be a good value deal for those in the lower range who needn&#x27;t worry about the build quality or other issues above.</li>
            <li> This is the worst scale I&#x27;ve ever owned. It&#x27;s totally inaccurate and undependable. The results vary by as much as 5 to 8 pounds. You can weigh yourself 3 consecutive times within minutes and it will give 3 different readings. Sorry I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Man, looking for a scale online is like the most intimidating thing ever.&lt;br /&gt;After reading all of these scary threatening reviews, we decided on this one. We&#x27;ve had it for a few months, it works accurately, stores well, and you can set things on top of it without it activating. Unfortunately, because of this, we couldn&#x27;t weigh our cat by himself. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend storing anything on top of it long-term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great, easy to read, holds the weight for a few seconds so you can get off and read it, sturdy, etc.</li>
            <li> Excellent scale. It&#x27;s great to just be able to stand on it and get a reading without having to give it a kick first. Very slim design which works great in my small bathroom, as the bottom edge of the door clears the scale with room to spare so I can keep it behind the door.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  The numbers are clear and easy to see. It is slim, just as described. True to description.</li>
            <li> Safe for those with balance issues.  Great to just step on and get results with large easy to read digital readouts</li>
            <li> Very attractive easy to read scale.</li>
            <li> This scale is very sleek looking and can easily be hidden discretely in a corner when not in use where it doesn&#x27;t take up much space. The batteries are included and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the performance or accuracy of it in the time I&#x27;ve owned it. Highly recommended if you want a nice looking scale that won&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
            <li> I love this bathroom scale.  It&#x27;s super slim, easily fits in a drawer, the numbers in the display are huge, so everyone can easily read them.  No need to turn it on; you just step on it, and it turns itself off.  It&#x27;s also accurate - the readings are consistent with the professional scales at my doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> Got the product I needed, great shipping, overall satisfied. It works great, screen is great and bright, and the numbers are for the most part consistent when doing multiple weigh-ins.</li>
            <li> Now I finally can weigh myself anytime of the day! Great dimension, sturdy, and I believe the scale is accurate. Good display. We will see about the how durable it is after using it some more time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why there are so many complaints about recalibrating the scale every time you move it.  Every digital scale I&#x27;ve ever known has to be recalibrated when yo move it.  Are these reviewers THAT lazy that they can&#x27;t step on and back off again?  Seriously?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the scale to be acurate and I like that it has a low profile and I can hide it under my couch so my kids don&#x27;t play with it.  It worked immediately when I took it out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is the instruction manual needs some proofreading - but that has no bearing on my review of the scale itself.</li>
            <li> Scale will not settle on a single weight and will bounce around for 2 minutes in a range of 20+ lbs before it just shuts off. Read instructions and &amp;#34;tapped&amp;#34; to calibrate, this did nothing. We have tried to get a reading out of it several different ways and are unable to get a reading at all besides the constant changing of numbers. Returned to Amazon and would NOT recommend buying!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is supposed to do and the batteries are AAA. Hooray!!!</li>
            <li> The scale is reliable and has a low profile to not get knocked around.  The LCD is easy to read and is quick.  No balance/tare issues.  The vendor shipped on time and without issue.  It&#x27;s a great value</li>
    </ol>
