            <li>lol.  ; )</li>
            <li>Philips decided to replace the old Kids brush heads without telling, and for that I take one star off what it actually is a very good product.</li>
            <li>Glad to find them cheaper than at the store.</li>
            <li>Better than my kids getting cavities.</li>

            <li>I think it is ok.</li>

            <li>Absolutely fine replacement heads.  </li>
            <li>Perfect replacement for my little Girl tooth  brush.</li>
            <li>These are a bit pricey, but perfectly fit my kid&#x27;s Sonicare electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Heads fit well as the originals which came with toothbrush.</li>
            <li>They are a good size for me - even though I am an adult.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t complain on the original brand heads.</li>
            <li>It seems tighter than the original one when fixing it on the brush.</li>
            <li>Not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>exactly as pictured, we love this toothbrush and the dentist has noticed a difference since we began using it</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve got two older or two younger kids, it would be nice to have more color choice.</li>
            <li>/works exactly like the original</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d be able to replace my old Sonicare heads with these, but they didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>They picked it right up with no complaints, so I have none either.</li>
            <li>we got the right sizes</li>
            <li>You made an investment on the brush, these heads are the right call</li>
            <li>The Sonicare electric brushes are way better than regular brushes.  </li>
            <li>So far cavity free still.</li>
            <li>the red ones are more for kids</li>
            <li>arrived fast!</li>
            <li>There really isn&#x27;t much to say about them because, well, they are toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>The heads fit properly and don&#x27;t slide while the kids are brushing.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping A++++</li>
            <li>At this point, it seems HX6042 is the only available Brush head for Kid Sonicare.</li>
            <li>Bought the electric toothbrush, so I am glad to have these extra heads for when the one I am using gets old and needs to be replaced.  </li>
            <li>his mouth the best way possible when in reality the knock-out head in doing a poor job.</li>
            <li>This is not even clear on Philips website so it took me some time to research and find the right replacement.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are as good as the old ones, very high quality and long lasting.</li>
            <li>the one that fit it are the big adult ones</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves the stop action feature if they put too much pressure on their teeth.</li>
            <li>It is the exact same size as an adult sonicare tooth brush head.</li>
            <li>Your teeth feel more protected because you don&#x27;t have hard plastic vibrating against them at 30,000 rpms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use these kids &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; size for myself and the kids &amp;#34;compact&amp;#34; size for my 7 year old son.</li>
            <li>well i call them adult ones.</li>
            <li>They used to have these labeled by age range now they are calling what was the 4-7 year old toothbrush heads &amp;#34;compact&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>That said, we do have the older, red body and maybe these don&#x27;t work on it quite as well.  </li>
            <li>Recently Amazon emailed me to advise that the old version was discontinued and was replaced by this new version.</li>
            <li>They are durable enough to withstand our kids abusing the heck out of them, and gentle enough that our kids don&#x27;t mind brushing until the toothbrush stops.</li>
            <li>However this is way too big for a five year old.</li>
            <li>A simple note saying it replaced the old heads now discontinued would have saved me plenty of time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For Kids around 10 years old,  I believe the brush head should be smaller than this.</li>
            <li>The Standard size are now those for kids older than 8 or with big mouths, and the compact ones are for smaller kids.</li>
            <li>They were more expensive than the heads I buy for the adult toothbrush I have.</li>
            <li>However, I wish we had a color choice other than red is the smaller head for younger kids &amp; blue the larger head for older kids.</li>

            <li> The only place it is smaller is, it is not as long.</li>
            <li> Our dentist commented on how little plaque developed on our kids teeth since their last visit, accolades attributable to this toothbrush and these heads.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had far less incidence of cavities since switching to this brush.</li>
            <li> One always had the red head and the other the blue.</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it.  </li>
            <li> Brush heads did not fit properly on the sonicare kids toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> Fits my brush and worked as expected.</li>
            <li> Have been a lifelong user, now using it for the the kids.</li>
            <li> These are as expected.</li>
            <li> Not much to say about toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li> Her teeth look a little yellower than normal lately</li>
            <li> I have the fancy Diamondcare handset, but bought my husband the less expensive kid&#x27;s handset since he breaks his down quickly.</li>
            <li> other thing I like about them is the rubberized finish.</li>
            <li> Like: &amp;#34;Same as previous kids 8+ brush heads&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> There is a little piece at the bottom of the toothbrush head that keeps getting stuck on the electronic brush body.  </li>
            <li> But, it is quite expensive and I still debate whether or not I need to keep this brush for my kid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the size of the brush head seems a little boo big.</li>
            <li> Not sure what else to say?</li>
            <li> they are really small.</li>
            <li> so I am not sure if it&#x27;s not brushing as well or maybe if she&#x27;s just not doing as well of a job.</li>
            <li> It is a very small circle.  </li>
            <li> Ridiculous</li>
            <li> A little expensive...</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a pain that they don&#x27;t offer 2 different colors when you have 2 kids sharing a base.  </li>
            <li> I was briefly confused and came online to check if that&#x27;s what I had ordered</li>
            <li> Just wonder why do they make them so expensive.</li>
            <li> Bought the wrong model</li>
            <li> These are all horribly expensive, but that is not the fault of Amazon.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> It replaces the Philips Sonicare HX6042/64 Replacement Brush Heads which are discontinued, if you find them you will have to pay an outrageous amount of money as they are very hard to find.</li>
            <li> The head pops off of the base of the tooth brush head...</li>

            <li> Bought one set of these for my kids on Sep5, 2014 and they lasted to Oct 26th !!...</li>
            <li> Great for the price. Works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Works well for the kids.</li>
            <li> Bought the electric toothbrush, so I am glad to have these extra heads for when the one I am using gets old and needs to be replaced.  They are a good size for me - even though I am an adult.  lol.  ; )</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re tooth brushes.  Not sure what else to say?</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t complain on the original brand heads.</li>
            <li> goes well with toothpaste</li>
            <li> good dental hygiene is achieved much easier by using this product.</li>
            <li> My grandsons say they like the brushes a lot. My daughter loves the stop action feature if they put too much pressure on their teeth.</li>
            <li> Great replacement heads for my daughter&#x27;s Sonicare!  Glad to find them cheaper than at the store.</li>
            <li> very good . for my 6311</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it.  Better than my kids getting cavities.</li>
            <li> No cavities to date while most of my daughter&#x27;s friends have had one or two.</li>
            <li> Brush heads did not fit properly on the sonicare kids toothbrushes.  Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit for my kids&#x27; Sonicare. We&#x27;ve had far less incidence of cavities since switching to this brush. Winners all around.</li>
            <li> Perfect! I use these kids &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; size for myself and the kids &amp;#34;compact&amp;#34; size for my 7 year old son. These replacement heads are great, they are the real sonicare brand and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> just arriving before the estimated delivery date...good price....</li>
            <li> Fits our kids&#x27; sonic care brushes.</li>
            <li> Fits my brush and worked as expected.</li>
            <li> These are replacement heads for the Kids sonicare toothbrush. There really isn&#x27;t much to say about them because, well, they are toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast shipping.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> There used to be a blue and a red brush head in this pack. Recently Amazon emailed me to advise that the old version was discontinued and was replaced by this new version. The problem is we have two kids. One always had the red head and the other the blue. Now there&#x27;s no way of telling the two apart. We&#x27;ll have to mark these with nail polish or something. Ridiculous having to do this every three months...</li>
            <li> The Sonicare toothbrushes are wonderful.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d be able to replace my old Sonicare heads with these, but they didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush works as you would expect it to.. Just wonder why do they make them so expensive.</li>
            <li> Had my doubts I could convince my kids to switch to the electric toothbrush.  They picked it right up with no complaints, so I have none either.</li>
            <li> Works well for my kids&#x27; toothbrushed</li>
            <li> The Sonicare electric brushes are way better than regular brushes.  The dentist is always very pleased with the way my boys&#x27; teeth look!</li>
            <li> Perfect fit/replacement for my kids sonicare toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;Looks/works exactly like the original</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush. However, I wish we had a color choice other than red is the smaller head for younger kids &amp; blue the larger head for older kids. If you&#x27;ve got two older or two younger kids, it would be nice to have more color choice.</li>
            <li> Works great, my kid likes it</li>
            <li> Loves these toothbrush heads.  Going on years with them for the kids and they work wonders.  So far cavity free still.</li>
            <li> Works great on my children&#x27;s sonic care toothbrushes!</li>
            <li> The heads fit properly and don&#x27;t slide while the kids are brushing.</li>
            <li> Great deal on replacement heads.  This is the only toothbrush that my daughter will use.</li>
            <li> Bought the wrong model</li>
            <li> Absolutely fine replacement heads.  Yes, it&#x27;s a pain that they don&#x27;t offer 2 different colors when you have 2 kids sharing a base.  We just put a mark with nail polish to differentiate.</li>
            <li> worked perfectly on the kids toothbrush</li>
            <li> i got the one that comes with both big ones. i did try it out and worked great did not come off or anything. has a nice night fill to it when its stuck on. i wish they came in red. my tooth brush is the red color. the one that fit it are the big adult ones well i call them adult ones. the red ones are more for kids they are really small.</li>
            <li> Great Seller.Fast Shipping A++++</li>
            <li> I have the fancy Diamondcare handset, but bought my husband the less expensive kid&#x27;s handset since he breaks his down quickly. He used the standard head that came with it, so I decided to try out the compact head. I prefer compact heads and I really enjoy the softer bristles -- better for your enamel. I&#x27;m going to keep supplying my husband with these, and myself with the compact heads.&lt;br /&gt;The other thing I like about them is the rubberized finish. Your teeth feel more protected because you don&#x27;t have hard plastic vibrating against them at 30,000 rpms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Edit 7/15/15: I receive these via Subscribe &amp; Save. This month I was mistakenly sent the Diamondcare standard heads. I was briefly confused and came online to check if that&#x27;s what I had ordered and I have not. Packing mistake?</li>
            <li> These do a great job of getting my son&#x27;s teeth clean.</li>
            <li> Need to have two different color for kids.</li>
            <li> It seems tighter than the original one when fixing it on the brush.</li>
            <li> Suitable for Sonicare HX6311/07</li>
            <li> I returned this because it is not the smaller kids brush head. It is the exact same size as an adult sonicare tooth brush head. The only place it is smaller is, it is not as long. However this is way too big for a five year old. They used to have these labeled by age range now they are calling what was the 4-7 year old toothbrush heads &amp;#34;compact&amp;#34;. It would have been nice if they had noted that somewhere in the description. Like: &amp;#34;Same as previous kids 8+ brush heads&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Have been a lifelong user, now using it for the the kids.</li>
            <li> Easy to find replacement brushes for my granddaughters toothbrush convenient and easy to order&lt;br /&gt;And we got the right sizes</li>
            <li> Product is awesome for my 8 year old daughters. Their teeth look beautiful...like they just came from the dentist. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have 3 kids ages 8, 8, &amp; 3 and they have all been using these toothbrush heads (both sizes) since before they could brush on their own and they have never gotten cavities. I guess we owe that to these toothbrush heads along with the sonicare toothbrushes too. I wish these were around when I was a kid.</li>
            <li> A little expensive...</li>
            <li> Philips decided to replace the old Kids brush heads without telling, and for that I take one star off what it actually is a very good product. It replaces the Philips Sonicare HX6042/64 Replacement Brush Heads which are discontinued, if you find them you will have to pay an outrageous amount of money as they are very hard to find. The Standard size are now those for kids older than 8 or with big mouths, and the compact ones are for smaller kids. This is not even clear on Philips website so it took me some time to research and find the right replacement. A simple note saying it replaced the old heads now discontinued would have saved me plenty of time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are as good as the old ones, very high quality and long lasting. Given the price, you might be tempted to go for the generic heads but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it, you will be thinking your kid is cleaning her/his mouth the best way possible when in reality the knock-out head in doing a poor job. That and the possibility of them falling apart on your kid&#x27;s mouth, I&#x27;ve seen that happen. You made an investment on the brush, these heads are the right call</li>
            <li> At this point, it seems HX6042 is the only available Brush head for Kid Sonicare. Therefore, there is no item I can compare against.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush itself is OK to use. But, it is quite expensive and I still debate whether or not I need to keep this brush for my kid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the size of the brush head seems a little boo big. For Kids around 10 years old,  I believe the brush head should be smaller than this.</li>
            <li> These are as expected. Not much to say about toothbrush heads. They do what we want and we like our sonicare brushes so we are happy with these replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Already noticing a difference with my kids teeth. Really great size for them.</li>
            <li> The head pops off of the base of the tooth brush head...if that makes sense.  There is a little piece at the bottom of the toothbrush head that keeps getting stuck on the electronic brush body.  That said, we do have the older, red body and maybe these don&#x27;t work on it quite as well.  Others said it would.  Maybe I have a defective one.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement for my little Girl tooth  brush.</li>
            <li> These are a bit pricey, but perfectly fit my kid&#x27;s Sonicare electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> If you have a Sonicare you know these are awesome.</li>
            <li> I think it is ok. My daughter seems to like it I think. Her teeth look a little yellower than normal lately so I am not sure if it&#x27;s not brushing as well or maybe if she&#x27;s just not doing as well of a job.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are simply the ones that come with the toothbrushes. They are durable enough to withstand our kids abusing the heck out of them, and gentle enough that our kids don&#x27;t mind brushing until the toothbrush stops. Our dentist commented on how little plaque developed on our kids teeth since their last visit, accolades attributable to this toothbrush and these heads. I will buy these again in the future.</li>
            <li> arrived fast! fit great</li>
            <li> Product met expectations. Heads fit well as the originals which came with toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Fits perfect, great price.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my granddaughter for her electric toothbrush .  They work well but I wish they were a bit more cost effective.  They were more expensive than the heads I buy for the adult toothbrush I have.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit.  These are just what I needed.  Make sure you double check if you want the standard brush head, which comes with the toothbrush at purchase.  I accidentally bought the smaller one, it is red instead of blue.  It is a very small circle.  These are all horribly expensive, but that is not the fault of Amazon.</li>
            <li> Not disappointed.  Just as advertised.</li>
            <li> exactly as pictured, we love this toothbrush and the dentist has noticed a difference since we began using it</li>
