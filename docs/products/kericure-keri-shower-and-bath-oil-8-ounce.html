            <li>Life is good.  </li>
            <li>Have always loved Keri</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s a challenge to find a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>And it smells good too.</li>
            <li>Everyone loved them.  </li>
            <li>The product itself is good but the picture misleading.</li>
            <li>I was able to get the best sleep I have enjoyed in years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy to be able to find sources through Amazon for this oil.</li>
            <li>but this stuff is great for so many uses.  </li>
            <li>This oil, applied to my barely wet skin , is the best body softener/moisturizer and the best night moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Have used this oil for years, love it!</li>
            <li>It does soften the water and make it feel nice.</li>
            <li>I have been using Alpha Keri for about 40 years, and it is by far the best bath oil made.  </li>
            <li>I need more words the feedback box says.  </li>
            <li>love my bra.fits comfortable and gives a nice shape.would recommend this bra for it&#x27;s shape and comfort.always</li>
            <li>It moisturizes my skin better than just moisturizer alone, although I will sometimes follow up with a moisturizer in the winter.  </li>
            <li>I love it and the way I use it</li>
            <li>I panicked when I couldn&#x27;t find it for a while and am so glad to see Amazon carry it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much more moisturizing than lotion and easier to apply.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this Product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful after a shower, especially in the Wintertime.  </li>
            <li>It was like Soothing Magic.  </li>
            <li>So glad I found it on Amazon when they stopped selling it in stores.</li>
            <li>Shouldve read better the description instead of letting  myself be fooled by the picture.</li>
            <li>You can not get any better than this.</li>
            <li>It is the finest product I have ever used for the most refreshing and relaxing shower I have ever had.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful for dry skin.</li>
            <li>If anyone has dry skin, this is the best option I have found.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product since I was young, great for eczema.  </li>
            <li>It is good, but price to high.</li>
            <li>Keeps you smelling clean and fresh !!</li>
            <li>Ordering it on line is fine, but it comes in the 16oz.</li>
            <li>Has made a huge difference in the look and feel of his skin.  </li>
            <li>but it isn&#x27;t readily available in my area.</li>
            <li>works great and eliminates itching and red spots....</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re covering yourself in cheap industrial</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin itch free and silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>not as good as Skin so Soft</li>
            <li>I discovered bath oils while in the hospital years ago.&lt;br /&gt;The nurses would use them with water to clean me.  </li>
            <li>It does a good job of helping to control the itching of my eczema and keeping the rash from getting larger.</li>
            <li>I have excessively dry skin and being African-American and having natural hair, this is perfect for all over.</li>
            <li>had a problem finding the right bra to fit.</li>
            <li>delivery was quick.  </li>
            <li>When I became a new Mother, my Wonderful Pediatrician suggested using Alpha Keri when my sons had diarrhea that would sometimes quickly burn their little bottoms.  </li>
            <li>He suggested adding a cap full to a gallon of warm water as her final rinse.</li>
            <li>It never fails!</li>
            <li>;) Will buy again!</li>
            <li>well worth the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no longer carried in stores where I live, and the generic store-brand versions aren&#x27;t nearly as good.</li>
            <li>When I towel dry afterward, the oil rubs in and my skin stays nice and moist all day.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes wonderfully and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I love this product but was suppose to receive two bottles, I received only one.  </li>
            <li>The aroma is 100 times better than the generic brands in the grocery/pharmacies.</li>
            <li>In retail stores it&#x27;s almost 30% higher in&lt;br /&gt;price.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin smooth and soft and you feel comforted by it.  </li>
            <li>bottles which are too large.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this!!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend consistent use of it.</li>
            <li>So, thanks to Amazon,  I once again am using it and my skin is much improved.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li>But it was very helpful when I needed something.</li>
            <li>enjoy using it daily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a very feminine smell that tends to linger.  </li>
            <li>Getting it was much appreciated.</li>
            <li>Too much information, I know,</li>
            <li>I LOVE this - am a senior with very dry skin and this leaves my skin feeling very soft &amp; silky.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t live without it in the winter!</li>
            <li>I actually mix this with a small spray bottle of warm water (one or two drops) and spray my golden retrievers&#x27; coats.  </li>
            <li>It is highly overpriced given the quality of ingredients.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to all.</li>
            <li>Being back home, I use it in conjunction with other products, because I make organic skin and hair care products, just due to my own needs and this fits right in!!</li>
            <li>Used when I was little love smell.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with Keri when I was hospitalized and couldn&#x27;t shower everyday.</li>
            <li>I would rinse their little bottoms with clear water, since the baby wipes also burned, then with a damp wash cloth, patted a small amount of the Alpha Keri on their still damp bottoms, and most important, air drying before putting on a fresh diaper.  </li>
            <li>scent is pleasant but highly fake.</li>
            <li>Just a little in his bath helps keep his skin hydrated and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Keri oil naturally repels bugs.</li>
            <li>Our dermatologist recommended for our 2 year old who has severe eczema.  </li>
            <li>I use this after every shower and it leaves my skin so soft.  </li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve used this bath oil since the 80s - a capful in a bath and it leaves your skin soft and non-greasy.  </li>
            <li>It makes them soft and shiny, tends to keep bugs away, and helps to get rid of the undercoat.</li>
            <li>Actually bought this for our new  member of the family a 10 year old rescue miniature poodle.</li>
            <li>At the recommendation of my vet, I purchased this to mix with water and spray on my shih-tzu&#x27;s coat to help calm down a skin irritation.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little high priced, but in&lt;br /&gt;this case the product is worth it, especially when you get</li>
            <li>Now that it&#x27;s better, I probably won&#x27;t use it anymore, at least not regularly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t generally take baths</li>
            <li>It would soothe and clear up the rash or burn, even before the next diaper change.  </li>
            <li>The skin feels softer but it&#x27;s just from the oil covering the skin and not absorbing very well</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a product to help keep your skin moist and have sensitive skin issues you need look no further</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>It is thinner and lighter than I expected, and I am surprised that it foams up when you rub it directly on skin, but I can feel it on my boys&#x27; skin after the bath, so it does the job.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommended for dry and delicate skin complexions.</li>

            <li> noticed my \\&quot;ashy\\&quot; dry skin totally renewed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time sufferer of dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Later I found that other sellers sell at US$8.99/8oz bottle &amp; US$13.93 for 16oz bottle.</li>
            <li> Years  ago a Dermatologist advised me to use this for my dry  skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this  since I was a child with severe dry skin which a Dr. subscribed....</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermetologist for dry itchy skin.  </li>
            <li> and then I blot my body dry not rub.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to tend to some dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Use after shower and it does help to keep my skin from being so dry</li>
            <li> Air dry well, and wipe off any excess.  </li>
            <li> Put this in bath water, sit back and relax and let the alpha keri due its job!</li>
            <li> Almost 50% less, what a big difference !</li>
            <li> While stationed in very dry climates this product has been a life saver for me keeping my skin moist by helping to retain moisture.  </li>
            <li> The makeup of the oil is primarily MINERAL OIL, and lanolin oil with some artificial perfume additive.</li>
            <li> With Psoriasis my skin gets real dry and patchy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me while on active duty with the military (&#x27;68 through &#x27;88).  </li>
            <li> It has smoothed a previously hardened area.</li>
            <li> so what I do is put a small amount in my hands and rub it over my wet skin before I get out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> Product was doctor recommended for dry skin, but difficult to get locally.  </li>
            <li> Recommend this for anyone who might have serious dry skin.</li>
            <li> Then, a few months ago, I remembered.  </li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t help but read a few from people who didn&#x27;tt care for it.  </li>
            <li> better than those horrible chemicals !</li>
            <li> There is no better bath oil water soluble to treat your skin after every shower or bath.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Step out of tub to apply as it is so slippery it will make tub slick if any gets on iyt.  </li>
            <li> The Family Physician that my Mother worked for would get the small sample sized bottles.  </li>
            <li> A dermatologist recommended I use this 40 years ago due to eczema, but it&#x27;s gotten very difficult to find in local stores.  </li>
            <li> I am just disappointed that it was only 1 bottle when I was expecting 2.</li>
            <li> I would say that is false advertisement wouldn&#x27;t you?</li>
            <li> sadly, I couldn&#x27;t overcome the grandma smell.</li>
            <li> Questionable marketing, they picture 2 items, and sell you one (that is stated, but why show 2??)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it myself, when sick with diarrhea.  </li>
            <li> so I am disappointed in the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Years  ago a Dermatologist advised me to use this for my dry  skin. But over  the years, I stopped using it and forgot about it.  Then, a few months ago, I remembered.  However, when I went into the Pharmacy, I could not find it.  So, thanks to Amazon,  I once again am using it and my skin is much improved.</li>
            <li> Keri oil naturally repels bugs. I have been using it for 25 years on my children, and myself......It never fails! I read about how it repels bugs in a magazine and have been using it ever since. we are now using it for my grandkids.  its truly amazing! better than those horrible chemicals !</li>
            <li> Great product! Our dermatologist recommended for our 2 year old who has severe eczema.  Just a little in his bath helps keep his skin hydrated and smooth.  Has made a huge difference in the look and feel of his skin.  I would highly recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> sadly, I couldn&#x27;t overcome the grandma smell. I prefer the smell of this: http://www.amazon.com/Johnsons-Baby-Cocoa-Butter-Ounce/dp/B0058KEUQC/ref&#x3D;sr_1_13?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1433994020&amp;sr&#x3D;8-13&amp;keywords&#x3D;mineral+oil+shea</li>
            <li> I used this to help with a skin irritation. Now that it&#x27;s better, I probably won&#x27;t use it anymore, at least not regularly. But it was very helpful when I needed something.</li>
            <li> The selling price of Alpha Keri bath oil 8oz varies drastically among different sellers.  The one I bought is US$17.96/8oz . Later I found that other sellers sell at US$8.99/8oz bottle &amp; US$13.93 for 16oz bottle. Almost 50% less, what a big difference !</li>
            <li> This product helped put moisture back in my granddaughter&#x27;s skin; she has eczema. It has smoothed a previously hardened area. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Great.  Works just like promised. What is there to say?  I need more words the feedback box says.  This is good.  I am happy.  Life is good.  The seller is happy.  Bye now...</li>
            <li> not as good as Skin so Soft</li>
            <li> Have always loved Keri but it isn&#x27;t readily available in my area. I was expecting 2 bottles but only got one so I am disappointed in the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall product itself is great and delivery was quick.  I am just disappointed that it was only 1 bottle when I was expecting 2.</li>
            <li> Have used this oil for years, love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this  since I was a child with severe dry skin which a Dr. subscribed....works great and eliminates itching and red spots....can&#x27;t live without it in the winter!</li>
            <li> There is no better bath oil water soluble to treat your skin after every shower or bath.&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy using it daily. Strongly recommended for dry and delicate skin complexions.</li>
            <li> Excellent.  Have used it for decades as a post shampoo rinse for dogs.</li>
            <li> I use this after every shower and it leaves my skin so soft.  I have dry skin so it&#x27;s a challenge to find a good moisturizer. I think I found it! And it smells good too.</li>
            <li> I love this product but was suppose to receive two bottles, I received only one.  I would say that is false advertisement wouldn&#x27;t you?</li>
            <li> This oil, applied to my barely wet skin , is the best body softener/moisturizer and the best night moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;m 79 and have been using it for 40 years!</li>
            <li> Works great. Makes for a relaxing luxuriant bath.</li>
            <li> But now I&#x27;m concerned since it has mineral oil in it.  I&#x27;ll probably not buy anymore unless they can figure out how to make it without the mineral oil.  However, I&#x27;ve used this bath oil since the 80s - a capful in a bath and it leaves your skin soft and non-greasy.  The aroma is 100 times better than the generic brands in the grocery/pharmacies.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product since I was young, great for eczema.  Recommend this for anyone who might have serious dry skin.</li>
            <li> Used when I was little love smell.😇</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t find in local stores, I still like this product</li>
            <li> the perfect bath oil.  Leaves skin silky.  Step out of tub to apply as it is so slippery it will make tub slick if any gets on iyt.  Great!</li>
            <li> Very good bath oil well worth the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, just not nearly as good as reviews here would have you believe. It is highly overpriced given the quality of ingredients. The makeup of the oil is primarily MINERAL OIL, and lanolin oil with some artificial perfume additive. That&#x27;s it. You&#x27;re covering yourself in cheap industrial oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is pleasant but highly fake. Smells a bit like baby wipes / oil. It does soften the water and make it feel nice. The skin feels softer but it&#x27;s just from the oil covering the skin and not absorbing very well (mineral oil is not beneficial to skin).</li>
            <li> love my bra.fits comfortable and gives a nice shape.would recommend this bra for it&#x27;s shape and comfort.always had a problem finding the right bra to fit.</li>
            <li> At the recommendation of my vet, I purchased this to mix with water and spray on my shih-tzu&#x27;s coat to help calm down a skin irritation. It worked like a charm. (The vet only recommended this brand because she had researched the ingredients and found nothing that would be toxic to a dog. I hadn&#x27;t seen it in the stores for years, was very happy to find it through Amazon!)</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermetologist for dry itchy skin.  Rub it on skin when you get out of shower before drying skin with a towel.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with Keri when I was hospitalized and couldn&#x27;t shower everyday. I would do the birdbath thing at the sink and slather this all over....even in my hair. I have excessively dry skin and being African-American and having natural hair, this is perfect for all over. It moisturizes wonderfully and a little goes a long way. It was a relief to have this in the hospital and was determined to find it once I was well again. Being back home, I use it in conjunction with other products, because I make organic skin and hair care products, just due to my own needs and this fits right in!! A must have!!</li>
            <li> I am so happy with the shower gel</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Keri Shower &amp; Bath Oil for years and it never disappoints.  It moisturizes my skin better than just moisturizer alone, although I will sometimes follow up with a moisturizer in the winter.  Great product.</li>
            <li> using product for years, great product</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years, especially in the winter.  I see it has great reviews and it should but I couldn&#x27;t help but read a few from people who didn&#x27;tt care for it.  I simply don&#x27;t understand.  I love it and the way I use it is when I get out of the bath I apply to my damp skin and then I blot my body dry not rub.  It keeps my skin itch free and silky smooth.  I panicked when I couldn&#x27;t find it for a while and am so glad to see Amazon carry it.</li>
            <li> Actually bought this for our new  member of the family a 10 year old rescue miniature poodle. Our vet recommended it for her itching and biting her skin. Well that was in December 2013 and as of today she has not scratched any bald spots or she does not bite her feet. He suggested adding a cap full to a gallon of warm water as her final rinse. I have to say I am unpressed with this product and will be purchasing it again soon. I bought two bottles because I couldn&#x27;t find it in my local store. Now I will not be without it.</li>
            <li> I bought this to tend to some dry skin.  However it is so fragrant that it aggravated my allergies and caused my skin to redden.  It&#x27;s also a very feminine smell that tends to linger.  It does seem to moisturize well though, similar consistency to mineral oil.</li>
            <li> Have always used the oil, especially during my hospital stays. Keeps you smelling clean and fresh !! ;) Will buy again! Over and over.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for dry skin.</li>
            <li> The product is great. I do not understand why the price is 40$ for 8oz. bottle. It is good, but price to high. I will find something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gail LaRose</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time sufferer of dry skin.  This product was recommended to me while on active duty with the military (&#x27;68 through &#x27;88).  While stationed in very dry climates this product has been a life saver for me keeping my skin moist by helping to retain moisture.  If you are looking for a product to help keep your skin moist and have sensitive skin issues you need look no further I highly recommend this product to all.</li>
            <li> Use after shower and it does help to keep my skin from being so dry</li>
            <li> Product was doctor recommended for dry skin, but difficult to get locally.  Getting it was much appreciated.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered it.  It&#x27;s much more moisturizing than lotion and easier to apply.  You can also put it in your bath and let your skin luxuriate in the moisture that way.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy to be able to find sources through Amazon for this oil. It&#x27;s no longer carried in stores where I live, and the generic store-brand versions aren&#x27;t nearly as good. This is the best oil for using on my skin at the end of a shower. When I towel dry afterward, the oil rubs in and my skin stays nice and moist all day. Great product!</li>
            <li> I actually mix this with a small spray bottle of warm water (one or two drops) and spray my golden retrievers&#x27; coats.  It makes them soft and shiny, tends to keep bugs away, and helps to get rid of the undercoat.</li>
            <li> I love this Product.  It&#x27;s wonderful after a shower, especially in the Wintertime.  Air dry well, and wipe off any excess.  Luxury in a Bottle.  The Family Physician that my Mother worked for would get the small sample sized bottles.  Everyone loved them.  When I became a new Mother, my Wonderful Pediatrician suggested using Alpha Keri when my sons had diarrhea that would sometimes quickly burn their little bottoms.  It would soothe and clear up the rash or burn, even before the next diaper change.  I would rinse their little bottoms with clear water, since the baby wipes also burned, then with a damp wash cloth, patted a small amount of the Alpha Keri on their still damp bottoms, and most important, air drying before putting on a fresh diaper.  It was like Soothing Magic.  Worked every time.  I&#x27;ve used it myself, when sick with diarrhea.  Also, used it the day before I had a Colonoscopy, while drinking the Prepping Solution.  Too much information, I know, but this stuff is great for so many uses.  So glad I found it on Amazon when they stopped selling it in stores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly as expected. Pleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering this alpha Keri body oil in the future. Thank you.</li>
            <li> A dermatologist recommended I use this 40 years ago due to eczema, but it&#x27;s gotten very difficult to find in local stores.  I don&#x27;t generally take baths so what I do is put a small amount in my hands and rub it over my wet skin before I get out of the shower.  It does a good job of helping to control the itching of my eczema and keeping the rash from getting larger.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sons who have excema. It is thinner and lighter than I expected, and I am surprised that it foams up when you rub it directly on skin, but I can feel it on my boys&#x27; skin after the bath, so it does the job.</li>
            <li> I have been using Alpha Keri for about 40 years, and it is by far the best bath oil made.  The problem I have is finding it in the stores.  Ordering it on line is fine, but it comes in the 16oz. bottles which are too large.  I prefer the 8 oz. bottles.  If anyone has dry skin, this is the best option I have found.  It was recommended by my doctor years ago, and I use it every day.  I highly recommend consistent use of it.</li>
            <li> Works well as a bath oil. Questionable marketing, they picture 2 items, and sell you one (that is stated, but why show 2??) For the price, will shop elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Shouldve read better the description instead of letting  myself be fooled by the picture. It is only one! The product itself is good but the picture misleading.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this - am a senior with very dry skin and this leaves my skin feeling very soft &amp; silky.</li>
            <li> You can not get any better than this. Put this in bath water, sit back and relax and let the alpha keri due its job!</li>
            <li> I discovered bath oils while in the hospital years ago.&lt;br /&gt;The nurses would use them with water to clean me.  One day&lt;br /&gt;I noticed my \\&quot;ashy\\&quot; dry skin totally renewed. I asked the nurse&lt;br /&gt;what she was using and she showed me the bottle of Keri and&lt;br /&gt;highly recommended it. It&#x27;s a little high priced, but in&lt;br /&gt;this case the product is worth it, especially when you get&lt;br /&gt;it through Amazon. In retail stores it&#x27;s almost 30% higher in&lt;br /&gt;price.</li>
            <li> It is the finest product I have ever used for the most refreshing and relaxing shower I have ever had.  I was able to get the best sleep I have enjoyed in years.  It leaves your skin smooth and soft and you feel comforted by it.  I would highly recommend this product for dry skin.  It works!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this!!  With Psoriasis my skin gets real dry and patchy.  My dermatologist recommended this when I was younger and I still use it today.  This is great to use on infants also.  It doesn&#x27;t leave you so oily like baby oil, and hydrates skin well!  I just bought a bunch for Christmas gifts.</li>
