            <li> I was having problems with my (Clinique) mascara running all down into the already dark circles of my eyes making me look worse than with no mascara at all.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for at least 20 years and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.  </li>
            <li> Lately it seems to be a bit globby.</li>
            <li> very thin mascara and very difficult to pull out the product out with the wand, maybe because it is old or thin or just not plenty of it inside the tube.</li>

            <li> I was having problems with my (Clinique) mascara running all down into the already dark circles of my eyes making me look worse than with no mascara at all.  I remembered I used the Wash-off Waterproof years ago and thought I&#x27;d give it a try again.  It goes on and stays on most of the day, doesn&#x27;t run, but needs to be reappied if you go out again in the evening as it may flake off a little.  Not too much of a big deal for the pay off of not running.  This set of 6 was an excellent value.</li>
            <li> very thin mascara and very difficult to pull out the product out with the wand, maybe because it is old or thin or just not plenty of it inside the tube.</li>
            <li> Great value and right on time!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for at least 20 years and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.  It is washable waterproof.</li>

            <li> This is the only mascara I have or will use.  Over 45 years with their mascara.  Always a wash-off with soap and water.  I have really long lashes and this accentuates without clumping them all together.</li>
