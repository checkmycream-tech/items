            <li>A truly great product.</li>
            <li>Not fancy, but well designed, well built and very effective.</li>
            <li>Good value for the money.</li>
            <li>Good product, but you have to have used almost 1/4 of the toothpaste to get it to hold when rolling it up...</li>
            <li>Good deal b</li>

            <li>These are amazing.  </li>
            <li>tHIS PRODUCT IS JUST AMAZING FOR TOOTHPASTE OR ANYTHING IN A TUBE.</li>
            <li>fits inside nicely as it empties.  </li>
            <li>Works perfect and seems built very well.</li>
            <li>I like this kind better than the kind that just squeeze without rolling up the tube.</li>
            <li>They are very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Great product but some parts look pretty flimsy.</li>
            <li>turning the lever is easy -- amazing design that tube stays bound.  </li>
            <li>Cleaner and more compact and if its rolled toothpaste can&#x27;t backflow into the already squeezed area.</li>
            <li>Once you get to the end you&#x27;re able to slide it out.</li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;m completely pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>It was better than nothing, but</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I switched to this winder.  </li>
            <li>WILL BUY MORE WHEN I NEED THEM.</li>
            <li>I bought a couple different kinds of these and this one is the best.</li>
            <li>The EZ Squeeze is much better.  </li>
            <li>The EZ Squeeze is much better in both regards.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for one for a while now and am so glad I found this company.</li>
            <li>They all love it too.</li>
            <li>Of the ones I have already gifted, they were well received.  </li>
            <li>Winds tube inside and pushes contents to the top.  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a great product at a reasonable price.</li>

            <li>I bought this for them and they love it</li>
            <li>Great quality, exactly what I expected, and at a great price!  </li>
            <li>I was really pleased to find it still available, and I hope to get another 15 years use (or more)  from this one.    </li>
            <li>This is very well worth the money and will pay for itself!!!!</li>
            <li>They were great to do business with, no problems, quick shipping and item exactly as described.</li>
            <li>The quality is good and with very prompt service.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to use -</li>
            <li>It is also easy to remove the emptied tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found one of these in a pharmacy once and liked it so much I bought a bunch more online.</li>
            <li>and it was easy to get it going.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, well designed and a quality made product.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and takes care of the job.</li>
            <li>it works fine</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to fit in the tube.</li>
            <li>Just fine.</li>
            <li>This was a cheep quick solution that work fabulously!</li>
            <li>This little gadget works perfect and there&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Overall a great product for its price.</li>
            <li>This tube winder is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I have to admit, when I got this I was very concerned that it looked flimsy, but it is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Tube fit it, rolled up, keeps squeezing.  </li>
            <li>These tube winders are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It has a key on the side that winds the tube after you get it positioned correctly and it works great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple yet works great.  </li>
            <li>Works smoothly, is sturdy, and appears durable</li>
            <li>This gadget works great to get every last squeeze of toothpaste out &amp; on your brush.</li>
            <li>It is made out of all light plastic</li>
            <li>The winding motion is great and it doesn&#x27;t unwind back.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>but so far so good.</li>
            <li>and so far so good.</li>
            <li>One note--when the tube is ready to be discarded, the best way I found to remove the winder was to unwind it all the way, at which point it was easy to slip off the empty toothpaste tube.</li>
            <li>It was worth every penny!</li>
            <li>The sink counter looks clean and neat</li>
            <li>Full size toothpaste (Crest and Sensodyne) and cortizone cream.  </li>
            <li>Works great, even extra large tubes.  </li>
            <li>Its inexpensive, came quickly and you get every bit of the toothpaste from the tube.</li>
            <li>I bought this a few years ago, and I must say it really works great!  </li>
            <li>I agree the newer vinyl tubes are a pain to roll up because they unwind quickly</li>
            <li>Well I picked this up to fill the tiny free shipping void and this fit the budget I would recommend this to anyone who still brushes their teeth :)</li>
            <li>It fits most tubes, it won&#x27;t fit large tubes such as some shampoos come in but for standard tubes this does a great job of getting all of the product out and isn&#x27;t too bulky.</li>
            <li>I have a draw full of tube squeezers and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>They work really well, are easy to use, and will save lots of money over the years by delivering ALL the toothpaste you paid for from the tube.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled when I found it on Amazon, and have purchased several as Christmas stocking stuffers.  </li>
            <li>Much better than the old school slider types.  </li>
            <li>No wasted toothpaste that&#x27;s for sure</li>
            <li>I received a similar item at a conference many years ago and was excited to see this product.  </li>
            <li>I can imagine it being just right for anyone with arthritis or manual dexterity issues.  </li>
            <li>Sliding in a new tube is easy.  </li>
            <li>It will probably take a while for me to save the cost of the device in toothpaste costs, but it&#x27;s much easier to get full value from your tubes of paste, ointments, etc with this device.</li>
            <li>It goes together easily and makes it easy to squeeze a tube of toothpaste, but the unit isn&#x27;t large enough for a family size tube.</li>
            <li>My beloved old winder finally broke.</li>
            <li>It makes it so easy to use all of the toothpaste in a tube and not waste any or have to struggle to keep pushing it out.  </li>
            <li>My kids, as most do, squeeze the toothpaste tube right in the middle.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>medicine shelf is now much neater and even my grandchildren are finding it fun to keep their toothpaste tubes neatly wound and put away when they come for sleepovers.  </li>
            <li>I plan on buying more in the future.</li>
            <li>When I first rec&#x27;d it, I thought it&#x27;d break immediately as it is made out of plastic and seems a bit chintzy.</li>
            <li>The bottom line is that while you get better results than just squeezing from the middle, you might as well just use your fingers.</li>
            <li>To top it all off, by using the tube winder you actually use all the contents of the tube instead of wasting it just because you couldn&#x27;t squeeze it all out.  </li>
            <li>Will likely purchase more.</li>
            <li>What a simple, satisfying tool!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a lot</li>
            <li>Yes it cost a bit more than what the metal key tube winders do, but there is no comparison.  </li>
            <li>Now my toothpaste sits neatly on the cap and takes but a gentle nudge to dispense:)&lt;br /&gt;!</li>
            <li>I got one of these at a trade fair about 15 years ago, and it worked on every toothpaste tube I had until I accidentally threw it out with the used-up toothpaste tube a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li>It gets every drop out of the tube, easy and fun to use, buy a couple you&#x27;ll definitely use them</li>
            <li>It is not often one can get an item that is not only useful, but does not take up a lot of space, is easy to use and is inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>I honestly had doubts about how long this product might last - it looks pretty cheap and flimsy.</li>
            <li>We loved it so much we purchased quite a few and use them on everything.  </li>
            <li>It is super easy to use, and I love that the empty part of the tube winds up and stays compact instead of sticking out the back.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for thoroughly emptying tubed products while keeping your medicine cabinet or drawer neat.grandchildren are finding it fun to keep their toothpaste tubes neatly wound and put away when they come for sleepovers.  </li>
            <li>Frankly, I am stunned at all of the positive reviews of this product.  </li>
            <li>Simple design but easy to use.</li>
            <li>But I found that together, this and a different squeezer created the perfect product (but only when used together, I&#x27;m much happier with my OTHER tube squeezer).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much easier to use than the other and so much more effective, I&#x27;ve already bought additional ones for other tubes.  </li>
            <li>the key winds smoothly and now my bathroom drawers are much neater,  </li>
            <li>so you have a much tidier arrangement that is easier to store on a shelf</li>
            <li>The design really works.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s an eye for hanging the whole thing on a nail.</li>
            <li>Saves paste and much frustration.  </li>
            <li>(the whole point of the purchase).    </li>
            <li>He asked for one and he seems to really like this one.</li>
            <li>This worked very well in getting the remains out.</li>
            <li>So far it was worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that when you wind it up, it hides the empty part of the tube.</li>
            <li>Not only does it do a good job at squeezing all the toothpaste forward, it also serves as a neat storage for the empty portion of the toothpaste tube.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to be annoyed that my efforts to smooth the tube are defeated by another person using the tube who is not as meticulous as I (nice way of saying anal).</li>
            <li>As a result, this is incredibly helpful to squeeze out all the toothpaste from the tube, resulting in less struggle as we get down to the end.</li>
            <li>I tried those flat push up devices that are available everywhere--horrible.</li>
            <li>Looks clean and is discreet since the ends are rolled inside the winder.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how much the half mangled tube of toothpaste laying on the counter offended my sense of order until I bought this:)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to extract the tube when it&#x27;s empty.</li>
            <li>You wind up with half the tube in the squeezer and no way to get more in.</li>
            <li>I have tried several \\&quot;tube squeezers\\&quot; and most recently bought this one and the EZ Squeeze.  </li>
            <li>Make toothpaste tubes most productive without making a mess.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for thoroughly emptying tubed products while keeping your medicine cabinet or drawer neat.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product over the others.</li>
            <li>But highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It is easy to insert on the end of the tube of toothpaste (or other tubes as well)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m curious to see how long it will last because it is plastic, but so far it&#x27;s doing great</li>
            <li>It would probably work fine with a smaller tube, but if the tube is smaller</li>
            <li>The time spent winding, attaching, and detaching this product makes this more trouble than it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>I find that I can still get a few more uses out of the toothpaste after the tube can no longer be wound up any further, but I think this would be the case with absolutely any toothpaste squeezer.</li>
            <li>I did find that it seems to do a better job of rolling the big tubes if you hold it upside down (tube hanging below the winder) when winding.</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s easy to get the tube started, the winder doesn&#x27;t squeeze the tube very tightly which leads to winding up some of your toothpaste in the tail.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to help store dwindling toothpaste tubes and to get as much toothpaste out of the tube as possible.  </li>
            <li>However, I found myself using another tube squeezer in conjunction with this, since this one didn&#x27;t squeeze nearly as well as I&#x27;d hoped.  </li>
            <li>It really squeezes out every last ounce from the toothpaste tube!</li>
            <li>It works exactly how you think it would, and as long as you don&#x27;t hulk strength your tube out after your done</li>
            <li>Seamless use from beginning to end of tubes.  </li>
            <li>It squeezes out all of the toothpaste and leaves no waste.  </li>
            <li>will say that it takes some getting used to the winding part near the end of the tube and then removing the tube when you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li>The product is extremely flimsy, which I would be fine with if the product actually worked.  </li>
            <li>There is no mess</li>
            <li>It not only squeezes the product out of the tube, it is also easy to insert the tube to begin with, and as you turn the little handle</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the cheap plastic ones where the empty tube would unwind or it would leave the empty part hanging.</li>
            <li>The old slider ones I&#x27;ve used for years, don&#x27;t squeeze the extra toothpaste out like these.</li>
            <li>End rolls up, no mess, practical, and so for that partner that squeezes from the middle--</li>
            <li>Simple little item that is worth its weight in gold.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know why they don&#x27;t tell you these things in the product description, but this is about 2-3/4\\&quot; wide, too wide for a lot of tubes but just right for my purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was wary because of reviews that mentioned \\&quot;cheap plastic\\&quot;, but I found this to be very sturdy, very well designed, ergonomic, simple, useful in that it reduces waste and reduces wasted space.  </li>
            <li>Sure, it was only a few dollars, but it was a waste of money nonetheless.  </li>
            <li>Once the winder has swallowed an inch of tube it becomes very difficult to wind, so much so that my wife isn&#x27;t able to wind it herself</li>
            <li>I use an arthritis cream that comes in a large metal tube that is hard to squeeze near the end.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Good deal b</li>
            <li> Good purchase, Linda.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality product.</li>
            <li> It fit our toothpaste perfectly.</li>
            <li> Works good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be happy to do business with them again  :)</li>
            <li> Great for getting the most out of your toothpaste tube.</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> These are amazing.  </li>
            <li> tHIS PRODUCT IS JUST AMAZING FOR TOOTHPASTE OR ANYTHING IN A TUBE.</li>
            <li> fits inside nicely as it empties.  </li>
            <li> Works perfect and seems built very well.</li>
            <li> I like this kind better than the kind that just squeeze without rolling up the tube.</li>
            <li> They are very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great product but some parts look pretty flimsy.</li>
            <li> turning the lever is easy -- amazing design that tube stays bound.  </li>
            <li> Cleaner and more compact and if its rolled toothpaste can&#x27;t backflow into the already squeezed area.</li>
            <li> Once you get to the end you&#x27;re able to slide it out.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m completely pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> It was better than nothing, but</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I switched to this winder.  </li>
            <li> WILL BUY MORE WHEN I NEED THEM.</li>
            <li> I bought a couple different kinds of these and this one is the best.</li>
            <li> The EZ Squeeze is much better.  </li>
            <li> The EZ Squeeze is much better in both regards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for one for a while now and am so glad I found this company.</li>
            <li> They all love it too.</li>
            <li> Of the ones I have already gifted, they were well received.  </li>
            <li> Winds tube inside and pushes contents to the top.  </li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S JOB :)</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;ve bought four more to give to family members.</li>
            <li> Works much better than the slide across tube squeezers.</li>
            <li> I plan on ordering more.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I will never recover the cost of this thing in toothpaste.</li>
            <li> bought 3 and love them.  </li>
            <li> We just Love it.</li>
            <li> and I am glad he did.&lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Love</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already bought a bunch as gifts :)</li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> This sure helps me from wasting tooth paste.  </li>
            <li> I was tempted to buy the clips, but I&#x27;m glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 more of these for the rest of the family.  </li>
            <li> I love these toothpaste tube winders.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love them.</li>
            <li> i bought 3 more immediately.</li>
            <li> What more can you ask?</li>
            <li> I bought this for them and they love it</li>
            <li> Great quality, exactly what I expected, and at a great price!  </li>
            <li> I was really pleased to find it still available, and I hope to get another 15 years use (or more)  from this one.    </li>
            <li> This is very well worth the money and will pay for itself!!!!</li>
            <li> They were great to do business with, no problems, quick shipping and item exactly as described.</li>
            <li> The quality is good and with very prompt service.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy to use -</li>
            <li> It is also easy to remove the emptied tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found one of these in a pharmacy once and liked it so much I bought a bunch more online.</li>
            <li> and it was easy to get it going.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, well designed and a quality made product.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and takes care of the job.</li>
            <li> it works fine</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to fit in the tube.</li>
            <li> Just fine.</li>
            <li> This was a cheep quick solution that work fabulously!</li>
            <li> This little gadget works perfect and there&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Overall a great product for its price.</li>
            <li> This tube winder is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, when I got this I was very concerned that it looked flimsy, but it is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Tube fit it, rolled up, keeps squeezing.  </li>
            <li> These tube winders are fantastic.  </li>
            <li> It has a key on the side that winds the tube after you get it positioned correctly and it works great.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple yet works great.  </li>
            <li> Works smoothly, is sturdy, and appears durable</li>
            <li> This gadget works great to get every last squeeze of toothpaste out &amp; on your brush.</li>
            <li> It is made out of all light plastic</li>
            <li> The winding motion is great and it doesn&#x27;t unwind back.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> but so far so good.</li>
            <li> and so far so good.</li>
            <li> One note--when the tube is ready to be discarded, the best way I found to remove the winder was to unwind it all the way, at which point it was easy to slip off the empty toothpaste tube.</li>
            <li> It was worth every penny!</li>
            <li> The sink counter looks clean and neat</li>
            <li> Full size toothpaste (Crest and Sensodyne) and cortizone cream.  </li>
            <li> Works great, even extra large tubes.  </li>
            <li> Its inexpensive, came quickly and you get every bit of the toothpaste from the tube.</li>
            <li> I bought this a few years ago, and I must say it really works great!  </li>
            <li> I agree the newer vinyl tubes are a pain to roll up because they unwind quickly</li>
            <li> Well I picked this up to fill the tiny free shipping void and this fit the budget I would recommend this to anyone who still brushes their teeth :)</li>
            <li> It fits most tubes, it won&#x27;t fit large tubes such as some shampoos come in but for standard tubes this does a great job of getting all of the product out and isn&#x27;t too bulky.</li>
            <li> I have a draw full of tube squeezers and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> They work really well, are easy to use, and will save lots of money over the years by delivering ALL the toothpaste you paid for from the tube.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled when I found it on Amazon, and have purchased several as Christmas stocking stuffers.  </li>
            <li> Much better than the old school slider types.  </li>
            <li> No wasted toothpaste that&#x27;s for sure</li>
            <li> I received a similar item at a conference many years ago and was excited to see this product.  </li>
            <li> I can imagine it being just right for anyone with arthritis or manual dexterity issues.  </li>
            <li> Sliding in a new tube is easy.  </li>
            <li> It will probably take a while for me to save the cost of the device in toothpaste costs, but it&#x27;s much easier to get full value from your tubes of paste, ointments, etc with this device.</li>
            <li> It goes together easily and makes it easy to squeeze a tube of toothpaste, but the unit isn&#x27;t large enough for a family size tube.</li>
            <li> My beloved old winder finally broke.</li>
            <li> It makes it so easy to use all of the toothpaste in a tube and not waste any or have to struggle to keep pushing it out.  </li>
            <li> My kids, as most do, squeeze the toothpaste tube right in the middle.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> medicine shelf is now much neater and even my grandchildren are finding it fun to keep their toothpaste tubes neatly wound and put away when they come for sleepovers.  </li>
            <li> I plan on buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> When I first rec&#x27;d it, I thought it&#x27;d break immediately as it is made out of plastic and seems a bit chintzy.</li>
            <li> The bottom line is that while you get better results than just squeezing from the middle, you might as well just use your fingers.</li>
            <li> To top it all off, by using the tube winder you actually use all the contents of the tube instead of wasting it just because you couldn&#x27;t squeeze it all out.  </li>
            <li> Will likely purchase more.</li>
            <li> What a simple, satisfying tool!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a lot</li>
            <li> Yes it cost a bit more than what the metal key tube winders do, but there is no comparison.  </li>
            <li> Now my toothpaste sits neatly on the cap and takes but a gentle nudge to dispense:)&lt;br /&gt;!</li>
            <li> I got one of these at a trade fair about 15 years ago, and it worked on every toothpaste tube I had until I accidentally threw it out with the used-up toothpaste tube a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> It gets every drop out of the tube, easy and fun to use, buy a couple you&#x27;ll definitely use them</li>
            <li> It is not often one can get an item that is not only useful, but does not take up a lot of space, is easy to use and is inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> I honestly had doubts about how long this product might last - it looks pretty cheap and flimsy.</li>
            <li> We loved it so much we purchased quite a few and use them on everything.  </li>
            <li> It is super easy to use, and I love that the empty part of the tube winds up and stays compact instead of sticking out the back.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for thoroughly emptying tubed products while keeping your medicine cabinet or drawer neat.grandchildren are finding it fun to keep their toothpaste tubes neatly wound and put away when they come for sleepovers.  </li>
            <li> Frankly, I am stunned at all of the positive reviews of this product.  </li>
            <li> Simple design but easy to use.</li>
            <li> But I found that together, this and a different squeezer created the perfect product (but only when used together, I&#x27;m much happier with my OTHER tube squeezer).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much easier to use than the other and so much more effective, I&#x27;ve already bought additional ones for other tubes.  </li>
            <li> the key winds smoothly and now my bathroom drawers are much neater,  </li>
            <li> so you have a much tidier arrangement that is easier to store on a shelf</li>
            <li> The design really works.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s an eye for hanging the whole thing on a nail.</li>
            <li> Saves paste and much frustration.  </li>
            <li> (the whole point of the purchase).    </li>
            <li> He asked for one and he seems to really like this one.</li>
            <li> This worked very well in getting the remains out.</li>
            <li> So far it was worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that when you wind it up, it hides the empty part of the tube.</li>
            <li> Not only does it do a good job at squeezing all the toothpaste forward, it also serves as a neat storage for the empty portion of the toothpaste tube.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to be annoyed that my efforts to smooth the tube are defeated by another person using the tube who is not as meticulous as I (nice way of saying anal).</li>
            <li> As a result, this is incredibly helpful to squeeze out all the toothpaste from the tube, resulting in less struggle as we get down to the end.</li>
            <li> I tried those flat push up devices that are available everywhere--horrible.</li>
            <li> Looks clean and is discreet since the ends are rolled inside the winder.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how much the half mangled tube of toothpaste laying on the counter offended my sense of order until I bought this:)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to extract the tube when it&#x27;s empty.</li>
            <li> You wind up with half the tube in the squeezer and no way to get more in.</li>
            <li> I have tried several \\&quot;tube squeezers\\&quot; and most recently bought this one and the EZ Squeeze.  </li>
            <li> Make toothpaste tubes most productive without making a mess.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for thoroughly emptying tubed products while keeping your medicine cabinet or drawer neat.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product over the others.</li>
            <li> But highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It is easy to insert on the end of the tube of toothpaste (or other tubes as well)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious to see how long it will last because it is plastic, but so far it&#x27;s doing great</li>
            <li> It would probably work fine with a smaller tube, but if the tube is smaller</li>
            <li> The time spent winding, attaching, and detaching this product makes this more trouble than it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> I find that I can still get a few more uses out of the toothpaste after the tube can no longer be wound up any further, but I think this would be the case with absolutely any toothpaste squeezer.</li>
            <li> I did find that it seems to do a better job of rolling the big tubes if you hold it upside down (tube hanging below the winder) when winding.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s easy to get the tube started, the winder doesn&#x27;t squeeze the tube very tightly which leads to winding up some of your toothpaste in the tail.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to help store dwindling toothpaste tubes and to get as much toothpaste out of the tube as possible.  </li>
            <li> However, I found myself using another tube squeezer in conjunction with this, since this one didn&#x27;t squeeze nearly as well as I&#x27;d hoped.  </li>
            <li> It really squeezes out every last ounce from the toothpaste tube!</li>
            <li> It works exactly how you think it would, and as long as you don&#x27;t hulk strength your tube out after your done</li>
            <li> Seamless use from beginning to end of tubes.  </li>
            <li> It squeezes out all of the toothpaste and leaves no waste.  </li>
            <li> will say that it takes some getting used to the winding part near the end of the tube and then removing the tube when you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> The product is extremely flimsy, which I would be fine with if the product actually worked.  </li>
            <li> There is no mess</li>
            <li> It not only squeezes the product out of the tube, it is also easy to insert the tube to begin with, and as you turn the little handle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the cheap plastic ones where the empty tube would unwind or it would leave the empty part hanging.</li>
            <li> The old slider ones I&#x27;ve used for years, don&#x27;t squeeze the extra toothpaste out like these.</li>
            <li> End rolls up, no mess, practical, and so for that partner that squeezes from the middle--</li>
            <li> Simple little item that is worth its weight in gold.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why they don&#x27;t tell you these things in the product description, but this is about 2-3/4\\&quot; wide, too wide for a lot of tubes but just right for my purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was wary because of reviews that mentioned \\&quot;cheap plastic\\&quot;, but I found this to be very sturdy, very well designed, ergonomic, simple, useful in that it reduces waste and reduces wasted space.  </li>
            <li> Sure, it was only a few dollars, but it was a waste of money nonetheless.  </li>
            <li> Once the winder has swallowed an inch of tube it becomes very difficult to wind, so much so that my wife isn&#x27;t able to wind it herself</li>
            <li> I use an arthritis cream that comes in a large metal tube that is hard to squeeze near the end.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit disappointed since I spent more on this than I thought it was worth.</li>
            <li> no more wondering how much toothpaste is really left in the tube.</li>
            <li> A little hard to get started, but works fine after that.</li>
            <li> just slide the flat end of your toothpaste tube into the slit and twist the knob as needed.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t know yet how long it will last.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it with big tubes and the entire empty part of the tube</li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s a quick fix for that making this gadget unnecessary.</li>
            <li> This inexpensive little device will assure you have a neat tooth paste tube, and that you will help you get nearly all of the paste out of a tube.</li>
            <li> Then as you turn the handle the inner cylinder turns, squeezing product up the tube and winding the empty part of the tube inside.  </li>
            <li> Why have I waited so long to buy these???</li>
            <li> This little gadget will definitely deliver the last bit of toothpaste but lining up the bottom of the tube with the slot and then cranking it does take some effort.</li>
            <li> It actually works, unlike all the other ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The metal tubes could still be manually rolled up as in old days, but they are the ones that sometimes get a &#x27;crink&#x27; and then that squeezer wouldn&#x27;t advance without excessive effort.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t believe how thin the tube was after the first one we used.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have pointed out, this product has minimal space for the tube once it is turned a few times and is also more difficult to get the tube into the squeezer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d previously tried the only toothpaste tube &#x27;squeezer&#x27; I could find at BB&amp;B, but although it was generally effective at getting the product out of the tube, it had annoying drawbacks</li>
            <li> I thought a tube winder like this would make squeezing the last little bit out of the toothpaste tube easier on my arthritic hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never go another day without this bad boy :)</li>
            <li> it rolls up the empty portion of the tube inside</li>
            <li> I got tired of the toothpaste tube taking up so much room in the cabinet and having to work the toothpaste up from the bottom every time I brush my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Works as described not much to say, stick it ALL the way to the end and twist.</li>
            <li> I started using this a few months ago, and I already can&#x27;t imagine going back to life without it!  </li>
            <li> In any case, the flimsy plastic is not strong enough to roll the tube.  </li>
            <li> , I not only had trouble getting some tubes inserted into the extremely narrow opening to begin with, I had trouble moving it up some of the tubes to push out the paste, especially if they got a &#x27;crink&#x27; in them.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t go out one end like other toothpaste squeezers do -</li>
            <li> The other types dont work as well.</li>
            <li> It came the other day and my husband and myself couldn&#x27;t be happier.  </li>
            <li> I could see using this device for other tubed products, like tubes of silicone, or other adhesives that come in tubes.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t need this, except *other people* in the house do not squeeze the toothpaste tube from the end.  </li>
            <li> My husband squeezes the toothpaste from the top of the tube and it was slowly driving me crazy.</li>
            <li> i am astonished by how complicated it is for an eight year old to properly squeeze his toothpaste tube.  </li>
            <li> When this thing winds down it&#x27;s over and</li>
            <li> It does what I bought it for and squeezes the tooth paste down.  </li>
            <li> As expected !!  </li>
            <li> Perhaps my chosen brand of toothpaste uses a tube made of a slightly thicker material than the average toothpaste tube.  </li>
            <li> and it takes up less and less room as the tube</li>
            <li> Since tubes of toothpaste cost less than fancy dispensing systems like \\&quot;Metadent\\</li>
            <li> Often making a mess of the tube.  </li>
            <li> This one is sturdy and winds the tube up tight.  </li>
            <li> A little clunky for my toiletry bag</li>
            <li> A little cheap/plastic, but what do you want for a few dollars?</li>
            <li> You have to be careful not to turn it too hard that you might break the plastic, but it&#x27;s withheld my two kids for over a year.  </li>
            <li> Within a fraction of a turn the tube is securely trapped, and the outer slot kneads all the toothpaste to the business end of the tube.</li>
            <li> I bought a few &amp; gave them to my parents &amp; friends.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a few weeks</li>

            <li> Great for those that have to get every bit of toothpaste out of the tube!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I hate waste. I thought a tube winder like this would make squeezing the last little bit out of the toothpaste tube easier on my arthritic hands. But the winder part doesn&#x27;t catch the end of the smaller sized tubes I recently bought. I&#x27;m a bit disappointed since I spent more on this than I thought it was worth. Hopefully it will redeem itself on larger size tubes.</li>
            <li> I like this kind better than the kind that just squeeze without rolling up the tube. Cleaner and more compact and if its rolled toothpaste can&#x27;t backflow into the already squeezed area.</li>
            <li> It gets every drop out of the tube, easy and fun to use, buy a couple you&#x27;ll definitely use them</li>
            <li> Works pretty well.  A little cheap/plastic, but what do you want for a few dollars?</li>
            <li> I was trying to replace a roller that I had...this one arrived broken and was not like the one pictured.  This one is 2 pieces.  The inside roller is a seperate piece that falls out.  The turn knobs on the one I received were broken.  I tried to contact company but they did not reply back.</li>
            <li> I honestly had doubts about how long this product might last - it looks pretty cheap and flimsy. However, looks CAN be deceiving. I&#x27;ve had this for about 4-5 months now and it works great! It&#x27;s really easy to use - just slide the flat end of your toothpaste tube into the slit and twist the knob as needed. Not only does it do a good job at squeezing all the toothpaste forward, it also serves as a neat storage for the empty portion of the toothpaste tube. It doesn&#x27;t go out one end like other toothpaste squeezers do - it coils around within the core of the squeezer. Removing the toothpaste from the squeezer is a little harder, but nothing too difficult. You can&#x27;t just slide it out, you have to twist the knob to unwind the toothpaste tube and pull the toothpaste through as you&#x27;re unwinding. Once you get to the end you&#x27;re able to slide it out. Overall a great product for its price. If mine does end up breaking I&#x27;d probably still buy the same one again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d previously tried the only toothpaste tube &#x27;squeezer&#x27; I could find at BB&amp;B, but although it was generally effective at getting the product out of the tube, it had annoying drawbacks so I went looking for something else and tried this item.  Well, I&#x27;m completely pleased with it.  It not only squeezes the product out of the tube, it is also easy to insert the tube to begin with, and as you turn the little handle it rolls up the empty portion of the tube inside so you have a much tidier arrangement that is easier to store on a shelf and it takes up less and less room as the tube empties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the simpler slotted product I&#x27;d been using, I not only had trouble getting some tubes inserted into the extremely narrow opening to begin with, I had trouble moving it up some of the tubes to push out the paste, especially if they got a &#x27;crink&#x27; in them.  The worst part though, was that the trailing empty part of a plastic tube was a pain to store because those tubes don&#x27;t stay rolled up.  The metal tubes could still be manually rolled up as in old days, but they are the ones that sometimes get a &#x27;crink&#x27; and then that squeezer wouldn&#x27;t advance without excessive effort.  It was better than nothing, but limited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I switched to this winder.  It&#x27;s so much easier to use than the other and so much more effective, I&#x27;ve already bought additional ones for other tubes.  The design really works.  There is an inner slotted cylinder and an outer one.  The inner one has a thumb tab type handle attached to the unit at one end.  You line up the slots of both inner and outer cylinders and slide the end of the tube into the winder.  Then as you turn the handle the inner cylinder turns, squeezing product up the tube and winding the empty part of the tube inside.  I&#x27;ve used it with big tubes and the entire empty part of the tube fits inside nicely as it empties.  It is also easy to remove the emptied tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My medicine shelf is now much neater and even my grandchildren are finding it fun to keep their toothpaste tubes neatly wound and put away when they come for sleepovers.  I highly recommend this product for thoroughly emptying tubed products while keeping your medicine cabinet or drawer neat.grandchildren are finding it fun to keep their toothpaste tubes neatly wound and put away when they come for sleepovers.

            <li> about 20 years back i used this product then i couldn&#x27;t find it it works fine</li>
            <li> IT WORKS GREAT ON THE TOOTHPASTE BUT I BOUGHT IT FOR A MEDICINE I GET PRESCRIBED. IT KEEPS EVERYTHING GOING OUT IN THE DIRECTION IT SHOULD GO. WILL BUY MORE WHEN I NEED THEM.</li>
            <li> Love it!  I got tired of the toothpaste tube taking up so much room in the cabinet and having to work the toothpaste up from the bottom every time I brush my teeth.  This little gadget works perfect and there&#x27;s no more wondering how much toothpaste is really left in the tube.</li>
            <li> I found one of these in a pharmacy once and liked it so much I bought a bunch more online. The winder consists of two nested cylinders, each with a slot in the wall. Align the inner and out slots, slip the end of the tube in, and turn the inner cylinder with the wingnut-style knob. Within a fraction of a turn the tube is securely trapped, and the outer slot kneads all the toothpaste to the business end of the tube. It&#x27;s easy to extract the tube when it&#x27;s empty. There&#x27;s an eye for hanging the whole thing on a nail.</li>
            <li> It was worth every penny! My husband squeezes the toothpaste from the top of the tube and it was slowly driving me crazy. This was a cheep quick solution that work fabulously! And the drawer seems cleaner because the unused portion of the tube stays rolled up and compact. I would highly recommend this product over the others.</li>
            <li> I have a draw full of tube squeezers and this is by far my favorite. It fits most tubes, it won&#x27;t fit large tubes such as some shampoos come in but for standard tubes this does a great job of getting all of the product out and isn&#x27;t too bulky.</li>
            <li> I bought a couple different kinds of these and this one is the best. Its inexpensive, came quickly and you get every bit of the toothpaste from the tube. The other types dont work as well.</li>
            <li> My daughter-in-law had a toothpaste winder that she&#x27;d got from a well known store. When I returned home from my vacation I went to every one of those stores in my area only to find out they don&#x27;t carry it.  After searching online I found this one.  It came the other day and my husband and myself couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Over the years we&#x27;ve tried a couple of other winders only to be disappointed.  This one is sturdy and winds the tube up tight.  Once it&#x27;s on you won&#x27;t have to worry about it coming lose or falling off.  I&#x27;m thinking of ordering another one just to have on hand incase something happens to this one.</li>
            <li> I have tried several \\&quot;tube squeezers\\&quot; and most recently bought this one and the EZ Squeeze.  The EZ Squeeze is much better.  As other reviewers have pointed out, this product has minimal space for the tube once it is turned a few times and is also more difficult to get the tube into the squeezer.  The EZ Squeeze is much better in both regards.</li>
            <li> I received a similar item at a conference many years ago and was excited to see this product.  We loved it so much we purchased quite a few and use them on everything.  Actually have had friends want them, so have given them away because they work so well.  Simple little item that is worth its weight in gold.</li>
            <li> This tube winder is fantastic. I&#x27;ve been looking for one for a while now and am so glad I found this company. They were great to do business with, no problems, quick shipping and item exactly as described. I&#x27;d be happy to do business with them again  :)</li>
            <li> I have to admit, when I got this I was very concerned that it looked flimsy, but it is amazing.  Tube fit it, rolled up, keeps squeezing.  This little contraption will save my marriage!! End rolls up, no mess, practical, and so for that partner that squeezes from the middle--No MORE!  I am ordering another one today.</li>
            <li> I got one of these at a trade fair about 15 years ago, and it worked on every toothpaste tube I had until I accidentally threw it out with the used-up toothpaste tube a few weeks ago. I was really pleased to find it still available, and I hope to get another 15 years use (or more)  from this one.    One note--when the tube is ready to be discarded, the best way I found to remove the winder was to unwind it all the way, at which point it was easy to slip off the empty toothpaste tube.</li>
            <li> I bought a few &amp; gave them to my parents &amp; friends. They all love it too. Could not find this at any store, but Amazon came thru again. No more hassle with the tube.</li>
            <li> It is not often one can get an item that is not only useful, but does not take up a lot of space, is easy to use and is inexpensive.  I had received one of these toothpaste tube winders as a gift and all my relatives asked where I got it.  I was thrilled when I found it on Amazon, and have purchased several as Christmas stocking stuffers.  Of the ones I have already gifted, they were well received.  The quality is good and with very prompt service.  I plan on buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> Product works well as advertized.  Winds tube inside and pushes contents to the top.  Saves paste and much frustration.  No longer leaves paste at the bottom of the tube.</li>
            <li> When I first rec&#x27;d it, I thought it&#x27;d break immediately as it is made out of plastic and seems a bit chintzy. However, we&#x27;re almost through one tube of toothpaste and it has DONE IT&#x27;S JOB :) Thank you, Amazon--you always have what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> Works great. Inexpensive. It will probably take a while for me to save the cost of the device in toothpaste costs, but it&#x27;s much easier to get full value from your tubes of paste, ointments, etc with this device. And great service from the distributors. Very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this &#x60;tube winder&#x27; for my wife and neither she nor I have been very impressed. While it&#x27;s easy to get the tube started, the winder doesn&#x27;t squeeze the tube very tightly which leads to winding up some of your toothpaste in the tail. Once the winder has swallowed an inch of tube it becomes very difficult to wind, so much so that my wife isn&#x27;t able to wind it herself (the whole point of the purchase).    The bottom line is that while you get better results than just squeezing from the middle, you might as well just use your fingers. The time spent winding, attaching, and detaching this product makes this more trouble than it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> These are amazing.  For years I&#x27;ve hated the way large-sized plastic toothpaste tubes worked.  Growing up toothpaste came in metal tubes with a key attached to the base.  You could roll them up as the toothpaste was used up and the tube would stay rolled up.  These tube winders are fantastic.  They are heavy-duty, not flimsy.  It is easy to insert on the end of the tube of toothpaste (or other tubes as well) the key winds smoothly and now my bathroom drawers are much neater,  To top it all off, by using the tube winder you actually use all the contents of the tube instead of wasting it just because you couldn&#x27;t squeeze it all out.  I bought 2 to start with for my husband and I.  Now I&#x27;ve bought four more to give to family members.</li>
            <li> This product works great!  It definitely helps to get everything out of the tube!  Works much better than the slide across tube squeezers.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to help store dwindling toothpaste tubes and to get as much toothpaste out of the tube as possible.  However, I found myself using another tube squeezer in conjunction with this, since this one didn&#x27;t squeeze nearly as well as I&#x27;d hoped.  But I found that together, this and a different squeezer created the perfect product (but only when used together, I&#x27;m much happier with my OTHER tube squeezer).</li>
            <li> We have been using this for a couple months now and it&#x27;s working well. It really squeezes out every last ounce from the toothpaste tube!</li>
            <li> It cost very little money and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to.    I did find that it seems to do a better job of rolling the big tubes if you hold it upside down (tube hanging below the winder) when winding.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how well this works.  I plan on ordering more.  It&#x27;s a great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Anyone who says this is hard to use or flimsy must have been dropped on their head. It works exactly how you think it would, and as long as you don&#x27;t hulk strength your tube out after your done it won&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li> As expected !!  Good value for the money.</li>
            <li> I was wary because of reviews that mentioned \\&quot;cheap plastic\\&quot;, but I found this to be very sturdy, very well designed, ergonomic, simple, useful in that it reduces waste and reduces wasted space.  Since tubes of toothpaste cost less than fancy dispensing systems like \\&quot;Metadent\\&quot; (talk about a space hog!  It has to be on the counter to work, so that&#x27;s where it ends up staying), so the winder even reduces cost.  I can imagine it being just right for anyone with arthritis or manual dexterity issues.  Will likely purchase more.</li>
            <li> Frankly, I am stunned at all of the positive reviews of this product.  The product is extremely flimsy, which I would be fine with if the product actually worked.  But it doesn&#x27;t.  Perhaps my chosen brand of toothpaste uses a tube made of a slightly thicker material than the average toothpaste tube.  In any case, the flimsy plastic is not strong enough to roll the tube.  Sure, it was only a few dollars, but it was a waste of money nonetheless.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This little gadget will definitely deliver the last bit of toothpaste but lining up the bottom of the tube with the slot and then cranking it does take some effort. I bought several to use for Xmas as stocking stuffers.</li>
            <li> tHIS PRODUCT IS JUST AMAZING FOR TOOTHPASTE OR ANYTHING IN A TUBE. i BOUGHT SEVERAL AND AM USING THEM ALL.</li>
            <li> Why have I waited so long to buy these??? They work really well, are easy to use, and will save lots of money over the years by delivering ALL the toothpaste you paid for from the tube. Not fancy, but well designed, well built and very effective.</li>
            <li> I may not be the smartest person on the plante but for the life of me I have no idea how this product works. It came in plastic wrap with no indication on how to get my toothpaste into the winder. Sadly, this product ended up in the trash.</li>
            <li> Works well, I&#x27;d buy it again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I will never recover the cost of this thing in toothpaste. However it has solved my wife&#x27;s OCD squeezing of the tube. Now there&#x27;s no leaving a crinkled tube way past it&#x27;s prime in the bathroom. When this thing winds down it&#x27;s over and there&#x27; s no concern that there might still be some toothpaste in there.</li>
            <li> Great design.  Sliding in a new tube is easy.  turning the lever is easy -- amazing design that tube stays bound.  A lot of engineering in a compact device.  bought 3 and love them.  Full size toothpaste (Crest and Sensodyne) and cortizone cream.  Seamless use from beginning to end of tubes.  Minimal effort and no waste.  I don&#x27;t have to be annoyed that my efforts to smooth the tube are defeated by another person using the tube who is not as meticulous as I (nice way of saying anal).</li>
            <li> Received this from GroupMedShop before what they had estimated which was wonderful.  Immediately put on my toothpaste tube and it was easy to get it going.  So far so good.</li>
            <li> Good product, but you have to have used almost 1/4 of the toothpaste to get it to hold when rolling it up...</li>
            <li> This is going to Austria, to my nephew who saw mine last summer.  What a simple, satisfying tool!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a lot</li>
            <li> I bought this a few years ago, and I must say it really works great!  I don&#x27;t know how I lived without it before.</li>
            <li> Luv it, got one in my Christmas Stocking last year and threw it away with the&lt;br /&gt;tube of tooth paste - went through 2 garbage bags looking for it.  But I found&lt;br /&gt;this one, works great - no fuss or muss.  Luv it.</li>
            <li> We just Love it. I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money but Hubby bought it and I am glad he did.&lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This item is great because the tube winds up inside of the roller. I&#x27;m a bit concerned about the plastic key snapping off but so far so good.</li>
            <li> This works perfectly. Love it.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t believe how thin the tube was after the first one we used. I&#x27;ve already bought a bunch as gifts :)</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. Works great and great price.</li>
            <li> I love these. I just don&#x27;t like to see toothpaste tubes all squeezed up and looking bad. I had one on our toothpaste and after visiting my son&#x27;s house, saw the need for them there. They are very easy to use. They might not be for everyone, but if you like things looking neat, they are for you. It is the end to the middle of the tube squeezers.</li>
            <li> Great product but some parts look pretty flimsy. I have had it for almost a month and so far so good.</li>
            <li> Worked well. A little clunky for my toiletry bag</li>
            <li> Make toothpaste tubes most productive without making a mess.  I could see using this device for other tubed products, like tubes of silicone, or other adhesives that come in tubes.</li>
            <li> Works great, even extra large tubes.  Good deal b</li>
            <li> My beloved old winder finally broke. I tried those flat push up devices that are available everywhere--horrible. This winder, though, works like a charm. Would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t need this, except *other people* in the house do not squeeze the toothpaste tube from the end.  As a result, this is incredibly helpful to squeeze out all the toothpaste from the tube, resulting in less struggle as we get down to the end.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why they don&#x27;t tell you these things in the product description, but this is about 2-3/4\\&quot; wide, too wide for a lot of tubes but just right for my purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d ordered Colgate toothpaste in 8oz tubes from Amazon and the tube is supposed to stand upright, on its cap, on the counter.  Well, mine kept falling over before I found this.  It has a key on the side that winds the tube after you get it positioned correctly and it works great.  No more falling-over toothpaste.  Good purchase, Linda.</li>
            <li> Works as described not much to say, stick it ALL the way to the end and twist. The knob can make difficult for twisting but it works and doesnt fall off.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do!</li>
            <li> Works good no problems !!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just as it was advertised.  It squeezes out all of the toothpaste and leaves no waste.  You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Excellent.  Easy to use.  Neat. I love it.</li>
            <li> This sure helps me from wasting tooth paste.  This is very well worth the money and will pay for itself!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a good quality product. It was meant to be a simple stocking stuffer for my brother during Christmas time. He asked for one and he seems to really like this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple yet works great.  No instructions included, but it was obvious where the tube should go.  I was tempted to buy the clips, but I&#x27;m glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> Much better than the old school slider types.  I bought 3 more of these for the rest of the family.  The old slider ones I&#x27;ve used for years, don&#x27;t squeeze the extra toothpaste out like these.</li>
            <li> I like my toothpaste tube neat and this does the job well. There is no mess and it&#x27;s easy to fit in the tube.</li>
            <li> Great quality, exactly what I expected, and at a great price!  Saves a lot of $ compared to buying it elsewhere!</li>
            <li> Works smoothly, is sturdy, and appears durable</li>
            <li> Out of all the plastic &#x27;pieces-of-crap&#x27; you could buy - this one is the best! I&#x27;ll never go another day without this bad boy :)</li>
            <li> Well I picked this up to fill the tiny free shipping void and this fit the budget I would recommend this to anyone who still brushes their teeth :)</li>
            <li> I could not get this toothpaste winder to work. I ended up throwing ir in the garbage.</li>
            <li> The last quarter of a toothpaste tube has always been my nemesis.... but no more. This gadget works great to get every last squeeze of toothpaste out &amp; on your brush. Give it a try. You&#x27;ll become a believer too.</li>
            <li> I love these toothpaste tube winders.  It makes it so easy to use all of the toothpaste in a tube and not waste any or have to struggle to keep pushing it out.  Buy these.  You&#x27;ll love them.</li>
            <li> It fit our toothpaste perfectly. Looks clean and is discreet since the ends are rolled inside the winder.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I use an arthritis cream that comes in a large metal tube that is hard to squeeze near the end. This worked very well in getting the remains out.</li>
            <li> This is the only brand that I will ever buy.  It actually works, unlike all the other ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> These work well. I have bought others which did not. Simple and they work the way they are supposed to.</li>
            <li> Works great. Excellent prompt service. Happy customer.</li>
            <li> Simple design but easy to use. I was concerned about it being plastic but, I have used it to squeeze the smallest amount out of the tube and it still works great.</li>
            <li> A truly great product. Works good. Just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Piece of crap, broke after 3 days of usage don&#x27;t waster your money on this. It cracks under the pressure halfway through the tube.</li>
            <li> This is the best tube winder.  Yes it cost a bit more than what the metal key tube winders do, but there is no comparison.  Easy to use, well designed and a quality made product.  This is the only one I will buy in the future.</li>
            <li> i am astonished by how complicated it is for an eight year old to properly squeeze his toothpaste tube.  this tube winder has saved me a lot of headaches, and my son no longer has toothpaste all over the sink.  i bought 3 more immediately.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and takes care of the job. Not too pricey either. What more can you ask? I am able to eke out the last bit of my expensive facial moisturizer so it works for me.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how much the half mangled tube of toothpaste laying on the counter offended my sense of order until I bought this:) Now my toothpaste sits neatly on the cap and takes but a gentle nudge to dispense:)&lt;br /&gt;!</li>
            <li> Purchased 2 of them based on reviews and wasnt disapointed. Works perfect and seems built very well. No wasted toothpaste that&#x27;s for sure</li>
            <li> I agree the newer vinyl tubes are a pain to roll up because they unwind quickly but there&#x27;s a quick fix for that making this gadget unnecessary. After you roll up the tube, use a clothespin, paper bag clip or similar clip and attach it to the end of the rolled up tube keeping it from unfolding.</li>
            <li> It does what I bought it for and squeezes the tooth paste down.  It is made out of all light plastic so don&#x27;t know yet how long it will last.  So far it was worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Great for getting the most out of your toothpaste tube. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a few weeks and it is wonderful.</li>
            <li> My kids, as most do, squeeze the toothpaste tube right in the middle. Often making a mess of the tube.  I bought this for them and they love it - I do too.  You have to be careful not to turn it too hard that you might break the plastic, but it&#x27;s withheld my two kids for over a year.  I would definitely get another one.</li>
            <li> I started using this a few months ago, and I already can&#x27;t imagine going back to life without it!  It is super easy to use, and I love that the empty part of the tube winds up and stays compact instead of sticking out the back.  I find that I can still get a few more uses out of the toothpaste after the tube can no longer be wound up any further, but I think this would be the case with absolutely any toothpaste squeezer. I&#x27;m curious to see how long it will last because it is plastic, but so far it&#x27;s doing great (and if it does eventually break, I know I&#x27;ll be buying another)!!</li>
            <li> Just fine. A little hard to get started, but works fine after that. For big tubes of toothpaste, etc., I would suggest the &amp;#34;Tube Squeezer.&amp;#34; It is bigger.</li>
            <li> This inexpensive little device will assure you have a neat tooth paste tube, and that you will help you get nearly all of the paste out of a tube.</li>
            <li> It goes together easily and makes it easy to squeeze a tube of toothpaste, but the unit isn&#x27;t large enough for a family size tube. You wind up with half the tube in the squeezer and no way to get more in. It would probably work fine with a smaller tube, but if the tube is smaller it&#x27;s not so hard to squeeze it all out.</li>
            <li> This $5 device is the best thing ever. I&#x27;ve been using it for over 1 month now for toothpaste. I love the fact that when you wind it up, it hides the empty part of the tube. The winding motion is great and it doesn&#x27;t unwind back. I&#x27;ve used the cheap plastic ones where the empty tube would unwind or it would leave the empty part hanging. The sink counter looks clean and neat now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that it takes some getting used to the winding part near the end of the tube and then removing the tube when you&#x27;re done. But highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I could not get it to work and finally threw it away. What a disappointment.</li>
