            <li>Beautiful and smooth.</li>
            <li>Nice sandalwood comb.</li>
            <li>nice comb, however I have to agree with most that it has a strong scent</li>
            <li>It gets out tangles better</li>
            <li>Love this comb.</li>
            <li>I love the weight it has to it.</li>
            <li>As shown nice smooth wood construction</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this Sandlewood comb.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair very smooth and is static free.</li>
            <li>It looks fantastic and is very smooth and does not catch my hair.</li>
            <li>Does a very good job of de-tangling and even regular combing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does have a strong scent to it but that does not bother me and it will fade eventually anyway.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair smooth, and does not rip my fine hair out when i comb it.</li>
            <li>It a a very good wide tooth comb.</li>
            <li>A fantastic comb.</li>
            <li>Really helps with dandruff, avoiding hair damage, and static electricity.</li>
            <li>This comb has helped my hair tremendously.  </li>
            <li>It is more then I would normally spend on a comb</li>
            <li>Perfect, with a little diluted conditioner, for taming my five year old&#x27;s curly locks.</li>
            <li>The wood allows natural oils to be evenly distributed leaving consistent healthy hairs.</li>
            <li>It kept snagging my hair; however, this is an easy fix that only requires a light sanding in between the teeth.</li>
            <li>This wooden comb is not as smooth as my horn comb, but it&#x27;s still smooth, and I really like it.</li>
            <li>Nice feel in the hands and no imperfections to snag my hair on like a previous hand made wood and ox horn comb that i had purchased.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t been using it because I have very curly hair and am experimenting with not combing at all.</li>
            <li>but I imagine this will last longer then a plastic one and is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>no more static</li>
            <li>Glides nicely through even wet, thick hair.</li>
            <li>(of course I try to keep it out of the spray, but it certainly gets wet)</li>
            <li>However the scent wears off quickly and it works wel to detangle curly hair wet or dry and will help move some sebum in the process.</li>
            <li>I prefer wooden or horn combs to any other material, and this comb is very well made.  </li>
            <li>The comb does have a faint woodsy / incense-like smell, but to me it&#x27;s actually a pleasant scent, and it&#x27;s not a strong smell at all</li>

            <li> A bit small in my adult male hand.</li>
            <li> I use a horn wide tooth comb at home, and bought this wooden comb to use at work or bring along in my purse.</li>
            <li> I plan to buy these for gifts for friends and family with long hair.</li>
            <li> I use it after I shower to detangle my hair while it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li> Just as expected.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my girlfriend and it works wonders on her thin, straight hair.</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower when my hair is wet and leave it in the shower and it hasn&#x27;t warped or gotten water damage</li>
            <li> The wood is somewhat on the dark side.</li>
            <li> Sturdy, thick, solid, and the teeth don&#x27;t look like they&#x27;d break at all.  </li>
            <li> i feel my hair breakage has come down substantially since I started using this product.</li>
            <li> A lot less tangles than using a brush.</li>
            <li> It was sitting on a shelf in my bathroom and turned green in the wood grain.</li>
            <li> This is a decent comb, but the wood at the base of the teeth is rough and unfinished.</li>
            <li> The width between the teeth is a little too small for thick, curly hair though.</li>
            <li> an ordinary comb.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers complained about the smell.</li>
            <li> A bit disappointing..</li>
            <li> The one thing I didn&#x27;t like was the bad smell it had when I got it.  </li>

            <li> Love this comb! It gets out tangles better then I thought it would and no more static plus I adore the sandal wood smell. It is more then I would normally spend on a comb but I imagine this will last longer then a plastic one and is well worth the money. Amazon shipping was also great :)</li>
            <li> Love this comb. Perfect, with a little diluted conditioner, for taming my five year old&#x27;s curly locks.</li>

            <li> I love this comb! It looks fantastic and is very smooth and does not catch my hair. I use it after I shower to detangle my hair while it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li> As shown nice smooth wood construction</li>
            <li> This comb has helped my hair tremendously.  It keeps my hair smooth, and does not rip my fine hair out when i comb it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beau it smells great but when it arrived it was cracked. A bit disappointing..</li>
            <li> This is the comb I purchased for a family member.  It&#x27;s part of a birthday gift.  Her birthday is February 28th.</li>
            <li> I prefer wooden or horn combs to any other material, and this comb is very well made.  Sturdy, thick, solid, and the teeth don&#x27;t look like they&#x27;d break at all.  The one thing I didn&#x27;t like was the bad smell it had when I got it.  It didn&#x27;t smell like sandalwood at all, instead it smelled acrid and almost rancid until I washed it thoroughly.</li>
            <li> Nice feel in the hands and no imperfections to snag my hair on like a previous hand made wood and ox horn comb that i had purchased.&lt;br /&gt;It does have a strong scent to it but that does not bother me and it will fade eventually anyway.</li>
            <li> nice comb, however I have to agree with most that it has a strong scent and it does not smell like what I know to be a sandlewood smell. However the scent wears off quickly and it works wel to detangle curly hair wet or dry and will help move some sebum in the process.</li>
            <li> I use a horn wide tooth comb at home, and bought this wooden comb to use at work or bring along in my purse. This wooden comb is not as smooth as my horn comb, but it&#x27;s still smooth, and I really like it. It&#x27;s a good buy at this price. Some reviewers complained about the smell. The comb does have a faint woodsy / incense-like smell, but to me it&#x27;s actually a pleasant scent, and it&#x27;s not a strong smell at all (I don&#x27;t smell anything when combing my hair).</li>
            <li> Love it.  A lot less tangles than using a brush.</li>
            <li> A fantastic comb. I use it on my beard and have noticed fewer hairs falling out since using.</li>
            <li> Nice sandalwood comb. A bit small in my adult male hand. The wood is somewhat on the dark side. Glides nicely through even wet, thick hair.</li>
            <li> It a a very good wide tooth comb. Does a very good job of de-tangling and even regular combing. i feel my hair breakage has come down substantially since I started using this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a comb. It is sturdy and wooden. Just as expected.</li>
            <li> I love this Sandlewood comb. The smell is great, lingers on the hair. The width between the teeth is a little too small for thick, curly hair though. I gave this to my girlfriend and it works wonders on her thin, straight hair. Really helps with dandruff, avoiding hair damage, and static electricity. Great for the circulation to the scalp, too.</li>
            <li> After a lot of search online I found this product and these are my findings:&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;The wood carving is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Not anti-static.&lt;br /&gt;No sandal wood fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Just an ordinary comb.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t been using it because I have very curly hair and am experimenting with not combing at all. It was sitting on a shelf in my bathroom and turned green in the wood grain. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s mold or rot or what. It didn&#x27;t respond to hydrogen peroxide.</li>
            <li> Love it. It&#x27;s beautiful and perfect for detangling curly hair.  I use it in the shower when my hair is wet and leave it in the shower and it hasn&#x27;t warped or gotten water damage (of course I try to keep it out of the spray, but it certainly gets wet)</li>
            <li> This is a decent comb, but the wood at the base of the teeth is rough and unfinished. It kept snagging my hair; however, this is an easy fix that only requires a light sanding in between the teeth.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and smooth. Makes my hair very smooth and is static free. The sandalwood scent doesn&#x27;t stay in my hair though</li>
            <li> My hair is over 2 ft in length and this comb has improved its shine. I will never buy another plastic comb. I plan to buy these for gifts for friends and family with long hair. (although i think it would satisfy hair of any length). The wood allows natural oils to be evenly distributed leaving consistent healthy hairs.</li>
