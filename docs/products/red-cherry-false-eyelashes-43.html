            <li>These are by far my favorite lashes!</li>
            <li>I also find that these lashes are only good for one or two wears before they look ratchet.</li>

            <li>really good lashes especially for the price!</li>

            <li>These are amazing quality and actually last.</li>
            <li>*NOTE::: If you&#x27;re looking for something more natural looking, these are NOT for you.</li>
            <li>but i took the risk and it was worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was looking more for a natural look and these are not that.</li>
            <li>Love them they look so natural.</li>
            <li>They were bigger than I liked but I will use them eventually for a costume.</li>
            <li>These look fabulous if you&#x27;re going for the natural look!!!</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, remove, clean and store right back in its original case.</li>
            <li>will never buy other brands red cherry is the best and</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like getting the ones that right off the bat</li>
            <li>I have very large eyes.  </li>
            <li>These lashes are nicely tapered, but way too long for my taste.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many styles of lashes from the Red Cherry line but the #43 lashes are my absolute fave!!</li>
            <li>they are very durable and I can wear them multiple times and they still look good as new!</li>
            <li>And shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re  perfect to wear everyday and they&#x27;re reusable if cared for properly.</li>
            <li>and when I&#x27;m wearing them &amp; yes they are so pretty.</li>
            <li>Totally recommend these!!!! :)</li>
            <li>that was funny</li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s exactly what these eyelashes gave me.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t feel pretty at all.</li>
            <li>Definitely stocking up on these :)</li>
            <li>so i still have 2 more pairs left to wear for formal</li>
            <li>i would buy more shorter styles the next time.</li>
            <li>I found them first on &amp;#34;Pinterest&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>They are pretty and good quality, just far too long for me.</li>
            <li>Also, the shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>They are exactly like I wanted them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these and some really expensive MAC lashes,and I like these so much better!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light to wear and I barely feel them.</li>
            <li>These lashes were a great price for as thick and luxurious as they were!</li>
            <li>these are my absolute favorite lashes other than the ardell demi wispies, they&#x27;re both first place in my book.</li>
            <li>Great for those days when you need a little extra length.</li>
            <li>I really recommend these.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Do identify specific attributes (e.g. comfort &amp; fit of a shirt or the battery life of a camera) and whether they met your expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>u can google search the numbers and look at some makeup artists/bloggers to see what they lashes really look like on people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They shipped so fast.</li>
            <li>Worked very well an stayed on.</li>
            <li>I get I much compliments</li>
            <li>They look so real yet add so much volume to your lashes.</li>
            <li>Their just too much for my eyes.</li>
            <li>Red Cherry DOES make more natural looking lashes.</li>
            <li>Do explain why you liked or disliked this</li>
            <li>They give my eyes that soft, glamorous look with the right amount of length and flare.</li>
            <li>So far I have worn my first pair 4 times.</li>
            <li>this particular #43 are</li>
            <li>/&gt;the price is sooo cheap, the lashes are 100% natural human hair</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more in the future!</li>
            <li>I am going to order several more in different styles.</li>
            <li>I really love these lashes for an everyday use..</li>
            <li>I really loved these lashed the band is really thin</li>
            <li>I liked my overall look but wish they were a little shorter.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a little longer than I expected, but overall great buy for the price.</li>
            <li>everytime I wear them, they look natural and not too over powering!</li>
            <li>These are very full lashes that are soft and not to heavy.  </li>
            <li>There is nothing natural with a lash that touches your eyebrows.</li>
            <li>if you want a natural looking ones then I recommend #213</li>
            <li>if you want natural hair lashes that will look natural on you</li>
            <li>so natural looking that no one comes to know youre wearing falsies.</li>
            <li>brothers gf came to know my moms were falsies and thought mind were my natural lashes</li>
            <li>That really caught my attention &amp; I will definitely be ordering again!!</li>
            <li>The packaging is different in the picture than what it arrives in, however, they are the real deal.</li>
            <li>Far prettier in person than in the photo.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for natural looking lashes these are the ones to go with.</li>
            <li>Buying eyelashes online is a scary thing for me since I always have a 5 min inspection at the store just to make sure they&#x27;re just the right ones I want.</li>
            <li>The product itself is lovely it you like lashes that are dramatic (never pass as real--</li>
            <li>I prefer something more subtle.</li>
            <li>These are VERY dramatic and I only use them on special occasions :)</li>
            <li>I love the length and how thick they look with my actual lashes.</li>
            <li>I use the DUO LASH glue and no other brand because this does not irritate my contact lenses.</li>
            <li>knocked a star down because I wanted something less VA VA VOOM and was sure that this is gonna be it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>these particular lashes were toooo long.</li>
            <li>Might order again but in a different size( natural looking one)</li>
            <li>I love false lashes.</li>
            <li>but u could tell i was wearing fake lashes, so if u want a more real looking length try a different # from red cherry.</li>
            <li>so they&#x27;d look like your own lashes, the only thing that would show they&#x27;re fake is the LENGTH.</li>
            <li>They are long and natural looking.</li>
            <li>I wear lashes pretty much everyday to work, and I received these beauties yesterday and could&#x27;t</li>
            <li>you can tell I&#x27;m wearing fake eyelashes, I prefer them looking as natural as possible with also a little question if I was blessed with gorgeous eyelashes</li>
            <li>Love the lashes but shipping was very slow!</li>

            <li> but i took the risk and it was worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was looking more for a natural look and these are not that.</li>

            <li> Easy to apply, remove, clean and store right back in its original case.</li>
            <li> will never buy other brands red cherry is the best and</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like getting the ones that right off the bat</li>
            <li> I have very large eyes.  </li>
            <li> These lashes are nicely tapered, but way too long for my taste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many styles of lashes from the Red Cherry line but the #43 lashes are my absolute fave!!</li>
            <li> they are very durable and I can wear them multiple times and they still look good as new!</li>
            <li> And shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re  perfect to wear everyday and they&#x27;re reusable if cared for properly.</li>

            <li> Totally recommend these!!!! :)</li>
            <li> that was funny</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s exactly what these eyelashes gave me.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t feel pretty at all.</li>
            <li> Definitely stocking up on these :)</li>
            <li> so i still have 2 more pairs left to wear for formal</li>
            <li> i would buy more shorter styles the next time.</li>
            <li> I found them first on &amp;#34;Pinterest&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> They are pretty and good quality, just far too long for me.</li>
            <li> Also, the shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> They are exactly like I wanted them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these and some really expensive MAC lashes,and I like these so much better!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light to wear and I barely feel them.</li>
            <li> These lashes were a great price for as thick and luxurious as they were!</li>
            <li> these are my absolute favorite lashes other than the ardell demi wispies, they&#x27;re both first place in my book.</li>
            <li> Great for those days when you need a little extra length.</li>
            <li> I really recommend these.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do identify specific attributes (e.g. comfort &amp; fit of a shirt or the battery life of a camera) and whether they met your expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> u can google search the numbers and look at some makeup artists/bloggers to see what they lashes really look like on people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They shipped so fast.</li>
            <li> Worked very well an stayed on.</li>
            <li> I get I much compliments</li>
            <li> They look so real yet add so much volume to your lashes.</li>
            <li> Their just too much for my eyes.</li>
            <li> Red Cherry DOES make more natural looking lashes.</li>
            <li> Do explain why you liked or disliked this</li>
            <li> They give my eyes that soft, glamorous look with the right amount of length and flare.</li>
            <li> So far I have worn my first pair 4 times.</li>
            <li> this particular #43 are</li>
            <li> /&gt;the price is sooo cheap, the lashes are 100% natural human hair</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more in the future!</li>
            <li> I am going to order several more in different styles.</li>
            <li> I really love these lashes for an everyday use..</li>
            <li> I really loved these lashed the band is really thin</li>
            <li> I liked my overall look but wish they were a little shorter.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a little longer than I expected, but overall great buy for the price.</li>
            <li> everytime I wear them, they look natural and not too over powering!</li>
            <li> These are very full lashes that are soft and not to heavy.  </li>
            <li> There is nothing natural with a lash that touches your eyebrows.</li>
            <li> if you want a natural looking ones then I recommend #213</li>
            <li> if you want natural hair lashes that will look natural on you</li>
            <li> so natural looking that no one comes to know youre wearing falsies.</li>
            <li> brothers gf came to know my moms were falsies and thought mind were my natural lashes</li>
            <li> That really caught my attention &amp; I will definitely be ordering again!!</li>
            <li> The packaging is different in the picture than what it arrives in, however, they are the real deal.</li>
            <li> Far prettier in person than in the photo.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for natural looking lashes these are the ones to go with.</li>
            <li> Buying eyelashes online is a scary thing for me since I always have a 5 min inspection at the store just to make sure they&#x27;re just the right ones I want.</li>
            <li> The product itself is lovely it you like lashes that are dramatic (never pass as real--</li>
            <li> I prefer something more subtle.</li>
            <li> These are VERY dramatic and I only use them on special occasions :)</li>
            <li> I love the length and how thick they look with my actual lashes.</li>
            <li> I use the DUO LASH glue and no other brand because this does not irritate my contact lenses.</li>
            <li> knocked a star down because I wanted something less VA VA VOOM and was sure that this is gonna be it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> these particular lashes were toooo long.</li>
            <li> Might order again but in a different size( natural looking one)</li>
            <li> I love false lashes.</li>
            <li> but u could tell i was wearing fake lashes, so if u want a more real looking length try a different # from red cherry.</li>
            <li> so they&#x27;d look like your own lashes, the only thing that would show they&#x27;re fake is the LENGTH.</li>
            <li> They are long and natural looking.</li>
            <li> I wear lashes pretty much everyday to work, and I received these beauties yesterday and could&#x27;t</li>
            <li> you can tell I&#x27;m wearing fake eyelashes, I prefer them looking as natural as possible with also a little question if I was blessed with gorgeous eyelashes</li>
            <li> Love the lashes but shipping was very slow!</li>
            <li> It is absolutely obvious that it&#x27;s not your eyelashes, because it&#x27;s so big and long.</li>
            <li> I like to curl them cuz they come in the packaging quite flat.</li>
            <li> Too long for daily wear.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;Do compare to similar products and share how long you&#x27;ve used this</li>
            <li> Omg these lashes are extremely  long.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;ll look a bit long.</li>
            <li> Durable, lightweight, long, thing everything you want in falsies but for me....</li>
            <li> I was one of those people with the long eyelashes everyone envies</li>
            <li> Looking at these lashes in the packaging I was like whoa WAY too long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are INCREDIBLY long, though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;those were a bit long for me.</li>
            <li> Too long for me.</li>
            <li> These lashes were quite too long for my liking, they made my eyes look like they had fans on them.</li>
            <li> They are extremely long for me.</li>
            <li> The band is not to thick and the lashes really make your eyes pop without making your lashes look like you have falsies on.</li>
            <li> Was too long than I expected.</li>
            <li> However, I realized curling them about a half a centimeter away from the lash line shortens them and people actually think they are mine!</li>
            <li> Although they have a dramatic look to them, I always get compliments on how real they look!</li>
            <li> I have pretty long lashes without false lashes, but always like a little &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> These were a little too long for me</li>
            <li> Just a little long in length</li>
            <li> I work two part time jobs one at a computer all day and the other on my feet all day cleaning.</li>
            <li> but they need to be treated carefully if you want to reuse as they can easily mess up.</li>
            <li> I personally hate these lashes on myself but as a freelance MUA I love having these in my kit.</li>
            <li> I thought the lashes would be thicker and don&#x27;t really recommend wearing dark eye shadow or thick eyeliner if you&#x27;re looking for a dramatic look.</li>
            <li> Eyelashes were so fake looking and don&#x27;t blend well w natural lashes.</li>
            <li> but there are ladies out there that like them for everyday use</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend them if u want a bit of a dramatic look.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately everyone knows that now and the price has doubled in the last year and a half.</li>
            <li> I know it sounds crazy but the just didnt look natural on me whatsoever.</li>
            <li> My eyes are small</li>
            <li> this is my first time ever purchasing and wearing fake lashes!!</li>
            <li> These are too long for me, and look really fake.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;i wore it with thick makeup</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Not much more to say about fake eyelashes........</li>
            <li> These are very dramatic, I would not recommend for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted</li>
            <li> everyone knows they are false).  </li>
            <li> false lash.</li>
            <li> Then when I applied them they still were a bit too dramatic for me.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not overly too dramatic.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with #43s.</li>
            <li> cause they looked weird.  </li>
            <li> if you buy glue for fake lashes from a beauty shop like sephora or ulta</li>
            <li> Unfortunately these were not what I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I would be so sad if they stopped making these and you can use them over &amp; over again.</li>
            <li> Another bonus, is it doesn&#x27;t have a thick band at the base like cheaper knock offs.</li>
            <li> im obsessed!</li>
            <li> and they sucked, bad quality and horrible design!</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really love these lashes for an everyday use.. They lasted me a really good amount of time and they are to dramatic but they still make your eyes look beautiful. I really recommend these.</li>
            <li> These are amazing quality and actually last. I bought these because of all the recommendations on YouTube. One user had mentioned that a pair of these could be used as many as twenty times. So of course, me being me, I had to buy these. ***NOTE::: If you&#x27;re looking for something more natural looking, these are NOT for you. Red Cherry DOES make more natural looking lashes. These are VERY dramatic and I only use them on special occasions :) But I love them nonetheless. Probably my favorite falsies ever!!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re doing a smokey eye or a cateye these are perfect! the length at the outer corner makes your eyes pop!</li>
            <li> I know a lot of great makeup artists that use these eyelashes and I was very impressed with them. They are super light weight which is the best part. They say on well and look amazing. I would recommend these to anyone who loves lashes. I will stock pile on these!</li>
            <li> I wear these lashes everywhere. They&#x27;re so comfy &amp; these are fave lashes im obsessed! I&#x27;ve tried so many different kinds but these beat them all because I love how you can&#x27;t see the b  and when I&#x27;m wearing them &amp; yes they are so pretty.</li>
            <li> Iam in love withy red cherry #43!!! Just what i was looking for! Easy and beautiful!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with #43s. They are perfect for all eyeshapes. Unfortunately everyone knows that now and the price has doubled in the last year and a half. I&#x27;m on to find my next perfect lash that fits my budget. I also find that these lashes are only good for one or two wears before they look ratchet. But if I buy an Ardell or Andrea lash they can with stand over 5 wears so keep that in mind too.</li>
            <li> Omg these lashes are extremely  long. There is nothing natural with a lash that touches your eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast, looks and feels amazing!</li>
            <li> Nice for going out good price</li>
            <li> These lashes are very easy to use, creates a great dramatic lash look. Great for those days when you need a little extra length.</li>
            <li> I own many many MANY pairs of lashes and these are my go-to! and so affordable, you get Makeup Forever quality lashes for waaaaaaaaaaay cheaper! Totally recommend these!!!! :)</li>
            <li> Love them! They look AMAZING with eye makeup BUT without eye makeup it&#x27;ll look a bit long. if you want a natural looking ones then I recommend #213</li>
            <li> These lashes are perfect. Received many compliments on them. And shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li> I love false lashes. These were just as good as my Ardell wispies. I would buy from this company again. They delivered on time and gave me a quality product.</li>
            <li> if you want natural hair lashes that will look natural on you then this is the brand for you! will never buy other brands red cherry is the best and this particular #43 are so natural looking that no one comes to know youre wearing falsies. At a party my mom was wearing falsies from walmart and i this RD #43 and brothers gf came to know my moms were falsies and thought mind were my natural lashes haha!! that was funny bc she also wears glasses.</li>
            <li> I bought these lashes because Emily Noel a YouTube beauty guru was praising them in her videos. I personally don&#x27;t like them at all. These lashes are nicely tapered, but way too long for my taste.</li>
            <li> Love these! Recently wore them to a party and got lots of compliments. They are full on glam! Have a nice curl to them.</li>
            <li> I loved my lashes! I also received a personal note thanking me for my purchase! That really caught my attention &amp; I will definitely be ordering again!!</li>
            <li> They are great.  Will probably order again later.</li>
            <li> red cherry lashes are great! Durable, lightweight, long, thing everything you want in falsies but for me....these particular lashes were toooo long. I know it sounds crazy but the just didnt look natural on me whatsoever. i will definitely be buying from this company again!! Great price, wonderful product</li>
            <li> these have become my fav lashes, good price and fast shipping</li>
            <li> I get compliments on these whenever I wear them. They make a statement. I like to curl them cuz they come in the packaging quite flat. It&#x27;s light to wear and I barely feel them.</li>
            <li> Quality is great and everything, I was just expecting them to look a bit more natural. I haven&#x27;t worn them yet.</li>
            <li> They are great for the price even on my hooded eyes.</li>
            <li> Buying eyelashes online is a scary thing for me since I always have a 5 min inspection at the store just to make sure they&#x27;re just the right ones I want. I don&#x27;t like getting the ones that right off the bat you can tell I&#x27;m wearing fake eyelashes, I prefer them looking as natural as possible with also a little question if I was blessed with gorgeous eyelashes or if they&#x27;re store bought? And that&#x27;s exactly what these eyelashes gave me. Not only are they 100% human hair, which is a BIG plus! But they are light weight look gorgeous, and after wearing them I got so many compliments it&#x27;s ridiculous. People honestly thought they were my own by how natural they looked. I was one of those people with the long eyelashes everyone envies lol but yes I completely recommend these, not only are they great but also very cheap!</li>
            <li> I love these lashes! The band is not to thick and the lashes really make your eyes pop without making your lashes look like you have falsies on. Will be stocking up on these!!!</li>
            <li> Love the lashes but shipping was very slow!</li>
            <li> My favorite lashes ever!!!!</li>
            <li> These were a little too long for me but I trimmed them up and they looked so amazing. Not fake, just FULL! Try these out!</li>
            <li> so long&lt;br /&gt;The smaller size of the eye</li>
            <li> Absolutely Beautiful!</li>
            <li> These are by far my favorite lashes! A nice in between of &amp;#34;those are fake&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;those are natural&amp;#34;. I love the length and how thick they look with my actual lashes. I have huge blue doe eyes and these just bring them out even more!</li>
            <li> I love them they make ur eyes look beautiful I definitely recommend them if u want a bit of a dramatic look.</li>
            <li> These lashes look amazing. They are good quality lashes. These lashes are the best price I have found anywhere. I will be ordering these again.</li>
            <li> I bought these after seeing so many reviews on youtube.com. I recently bought a value pack online also on amazon and they sucked, bad quality and horrible design! So i decided to upgrade and try the RED CHERRY brand. I work two part time jobs one at a computer all day and the other on my feet all day cleaning. They stay put all day for both jobs. I use the DUO LASH glue and no other brand because this does not irritate my contact lenses. I found this brand to be the best if you wear contact lenses and apply makeup daily. I rock the winged eyeliner daily and these lashes are the perfect accent. Easy to apply, remove, clean and store right back in its original case. Another bonus, is it doesn&#x27;t have a thick band at the base like cheaper knock offs. Love, love these and will continue buying different styles.</li>
            <li> these are my absolute favorite lashes other than the ardell demi wispies, they&#x27;re both first place in my book. they are very durable and I can wear them multiple times and they still look good as new! they make your eyes look huge and doll like i love it!</li>
            <li> I personally hate these lashes on myself but as a freelance MUA I love having these in my kit. They&#x27;re a hit with my clients and real human hair!</li>
            <li> These lashes look great. They fit my eyes perfectly so I didnt need to trim them at all. They also are a great length and really make your eyes pop...I will definetely be purchasing these again in the future. Also shipper sent these in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because it was recommended on youtube.  The lashes looked good on the video--not to over the top.  The product itself is lovely it you like lashes that are dramatic (never pass as real--everyone knows they are false).  The ends flare out quite a lot.  I want to emphasize that this is a a good product, just not for me.  I prefer something more subtle.</li>
            <li> I have very large eyes.  Maybe I can&#x27;t put them on too well cause they looked weird.  Didn&#x27;t feel pretty at all.</li>
            <li> These lashes were a great price for as thick and luxurious as they were! I ordered several packs and have used them for the last three weddings I&#x27;ve done...clients love them too... great quality!</li>
            <li> Looking at these lashes in the packaging I was like whoa WAY too long. Then when I applied them they still were a bit too dramatic for me. However, I realized curling them about a half a centimeter away from the lash line shortens them and people actually think they are mine! So far I have worn my first pair 4 times. Each time they look the same and feel lightweight. If only you guys could see the pictures. Definitely stocking up on these :)</li>
            <li> These are very fancy, very high class and good quality lashes.&lt;br /&gt;They are INCREDIBLY long, though. It is absolutely obvious that it&#x27;s not your eyelashes, because it&#x27;s so big and long. It&#x27;s gorgeous, but it&#x27;s for a night out or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knocked a star down because I wanted something less VA VA VOOM and was sure that this is gonna be it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s still awesome, though.</li>
            <li> Too long for daily wear.</li>
            <li> These be makin my eyelashes look super cute and full. I double up for that Beyonce look. Guys be tellin me I look all cute and stuff. Buy a lot at a time so you can save on the shippin cost cus that be adding up.</li>
            <li> I love these! They&#x27;re  perfect to wear everyday and they&#x27;re reusable if cared for properly. I&#x27;m addicted</li>

            <li> this is my first time ever purchasing and wearing fake lashes!! so i was kinda worried coz i purchased them for my wedding, and its risky to try something for the first time on your wedding day!!!, but i took the risk and it was worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;those lashes are amaaaaaaaazing. such a good quality, although i havn&#x27;t tried any before but u can tell the quality is better than the unnatural ones sold in drug stores. dont worry about them falling , coz they wont fall. if you buy glue for fake lashes from a beauty shop like sephora or ulta they will last all day when u wear them. i put them on and then applied mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the price is sooo cheap, the lashes are 100% natural human hair so they&#x27;d look like your own lashes, the only thing that would show they&#x27;re fake is the LENGTH. for my wedding and for the proffessional photo session those looked perfect but for a normal occasion or attending someone else&#x27;s wedding or party i&#x27;d buy a shorter length #.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;those were a bit long for me. they looked perfect in the wedding pictures but u could tell i was wearing fake lashes, so if u want a more real looking length try a different # from red cherry. u can google search the numbers and look at some makeup artists/bloggers to see what they lashes really look like on people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;theres 3 pairs in the pack so i still have 2 more pairs left to wear for formal occasions.&lt;br /&gt;very satisfied with my purchase. i would buy more shorter styles the next time.</li>
            <li> I really loved these lashed the band is really thin so there easier to apply &amp;last longer! Just had to go but glue</li>
            <li> Nice and good price üëçüèª</li>
            <li> Very short not in length but in width but i love this brand love the quality love the price!</li>
            <li> Great lashes , look very pretty and natural . Shipping was great . Would def be ordering again</li>
            <li> The packaging is different in the picture than what it arrives in, however, they are the real deal. I get a good 3 or 4 uses out of each pair before moving onto a new one. Buying in bulk is best.</li>
            <li> These really look good and I couldn&#x27;t beat the price. These are very dramatic, I would not recommend for everyday wear. I feel beautiful with these on!</li>
            <li> love them... really good lashes especially for the price! Real human hair so they look great! I just wish they came with glue</li>
            <li> Was too long than I expected. Kind of un-natural looking( for my eyes) I should have research about their sizes. I tried it coz it was cheaper than the Ardel wispies.. Might order again but in a different size( natural looking one)</li>
            <li> Natural looking lashes long but not too long. I only buy these.</li>
            <li> These are great if you want LONG lashes. I was looking more for a natural look and these are not that. But, they were fun to wear at home anyways! Next time I will get shorter ones.</li>
            <li> Best lashes look ever!</li>
            <li> Great quality at an even better price!!! Love them they look so natural.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a little longer than I expected, but overall great buy for the price. Very glamourous lashes, good quality, excellent price. Came in great condition and on time.</li>
            <li> The are great. Love the easy that they go on with and the they look like my own.  They shipped so fast. A great eyelash enhancement and they can take some mascara too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE LOVE LOVE THEM.  I found them first on &amp;#34;Pinterest&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Worked very well an stayed on. Gave them to my girlfriend for a cheerleading competition and they worked like a charm for her. Easy to put on and take off</li>
            <li> Horrible. Eyelashes were so fake looking and don&#x27;t blend well w natural lashes. Heard good reviews but the ardell lashes from the store are so much better.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately these were not what I had hoped for. They were bigger than I liked but I will use them eventually for a costume.</li>
            <li> First off,  SUPER  fast shipping!!! These are exactly what I wanted for a dirt cheap price! They are similar to Ardell Wispies. Thank you! Will Purchase again!!! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these and some really expensive MAC lashes,and I like these so much better!!! I will definitely be ordering more in the future!</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and arrived in a timely fashion. The product picture just doesn&#x27;t do the actual product justice. Far prettier in person than in the photo.</li>
            <li> Too long for me. I had to cut then and they still don&#x27;t look nice.</li>
            <li> They were the best. Elegant looking, not trashy and they stayed on.  I recommend them for teenagers and adults.  Great product and you get 4 sets for a great price!</li>
            <li> These are great lashes!</li>
            <li> These are great. They are very lightweight and look stunning.</li>
            <li> Perfect for night wear!! Just a little long in length but it&#x27;s not overly too dramatic.</li>
            <li> These are great lashes to wear on a daily basis or just for a night out.  It was an easy buy and I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> These are very pretty however they are longer than you may think. I liked my overall look but wish they were a little shorter.</li>
            <li> I watch JaclynHill1 on youtube for makeup tutorials.  She always uses these lashes, and they look great on her.  So I decided to give them a try.  I have pretty long lashes without false lashes, but always like a little &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34;.  These are too long for me, and look really fake.  I had to cut them to make them wearable.  Like the product, will be looking for a more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; false lash.</li>
            <li> REd Cherry Eyelashes you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> These are very full lashes that are soft and not to heavy.  I would definitely try them again.  love them</li>
            <li> These #43 and the #523 are my go to lashes! I get I much compliments everytime I wear them, they look natural and not too over powering!</li>
            <li> These eyelashes give me life!!!! I am going to order several more in different styles. They look natural and wonderful on.</li>
            <li> Last me a while and hold shape!</li>
            <li> Love the length and the fit. I thought the lashes would be thicker and don&#x27;t really recommend wearing dark eye shadow or thick eyeliner if you&#x27;re looking for a dramatic look. These look fabulous if you&#x27;re going for the natural look!!!</li>
            <li> Love love love these eyelashes they are perfect for everyday wear very easy to apply, can be re used many many times and I get compliments on how beautiful they are daily!</li>
            <li> These lashes were quite too long for my liking, they made my eyes look like they had fans on them. They are pretty and good quality, just far too long for me.</li>
            <li> These are good lashes. Very light weight and you won&#x27;t notice you have them on. They are extremely long for me. This is more for like going out but there are ladies out there that like them for everyday use and that&#x27;s okay. My eyes are small so I need something shorter for my eyes. I really like that the outer edges are longer, it gives your eyes a very nice cat eye look. Awesome quality but they need to be treated carefully if you want to reuse as they can easily mess up.</li>
            <li> I heard youtube makeup guru&#x27;s raving about the #43&#x27;s, so I couldn&#x27;t help myself but try them out. They are amazing! Although they have a dramatic look to them, I always get compliments on how real they look! Will definitely continue to buy my lashes from red cherry.</li>
            <li> Best lashes ever! Going to go and buy everystyle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many styles of lashes from the Red Cherry line but the #43 lashes are my absolute fave!! I always get compliments when I wear these. They give my eyes that soft, glamorous look with the right amount of length and flare. Also, the shipping was fast! I recieved my lashes a day before the promised date &amp; they were packaged great! I will definitely keep ordering these #43&#x27;s! I&#x27;m one very satisfied customer! ;)</li>
            <li> These are perfect. Just perfect. They look so real yet add so much volume to your lashes. Will definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li> I wear lashes pretty much everyday to work, and I received these beauties yesterday and could&#x27;t wait to use them.  I am wearing them to work today and I have gotten so many compliments.  They are so lightweight and they can accommodate any eyes! These are a must buy, I will be buying another set soon!</li>
            <li> They were super cute&lt;br /&gt;i wore it with thick makeup so they weren&#x27;t too big&lt;br /&gt;They lasted well&lt;br /&gt;love them</li>
            <li> They are long and natural looking. I would be so sad if they stopped making these and you can use them over &amp; over again.</li>
            <li> They are exactly like I wanted them. They shipped fast and were packaged perfect. Not much more to say about fake eyelashes........</li>
            <li> Their just too much for my eyes.</li>
            <li> Love these lashes! If you are looking for natural looking lashes these are the ones to go with. They are comfortable and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Sooooo in Love with this eyelashes , they fit perfect and look gorgeous !</li>
