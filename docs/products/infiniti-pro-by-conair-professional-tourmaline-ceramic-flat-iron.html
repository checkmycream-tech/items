            <li>The best part is the stand that comes with it.</li>

            <li>This straighter does an excellent job of taking care of the frizz and making my hair smooth and manageable.</li>
            <li>BUT it does work good.</li>
            <li>Daughters loved it.</li>
            <li>I loved it</li>
            <li>so I bought this one, thinking it would be good to tie me over until I could afford a \\&quot;good&#x27;</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s had a good run</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t expect it to be this good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m honestly amazed at how great my hair looks.</li>

            <li>Good iron over all.</li>
            <li>But all and all, this was a good purchase.</li>
            <li>(looks like it&#x27;s up to $39.99 now, but still a good deal in my opinion).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as good as I thought it would be after some of the reviews I read.</li>

            <li>I love this straightener!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this straightener!</li>
            <li>and my hair is smooth also!!</li>
            <li>I know some people use hairspray before they straighten, that&#x27;s sure to gunk it up!</li>
            <li>but this one is so much better!</li>
            <li>I found one I liked more!</li>
            <li>Works great on my fine hair.</li>
            <li>Man this is amazing.  </li>
            <li>The plates are smooth and glassy (being ceramic and all) and they heat up evenly and do a great job.</li>
            <li>Its amazing.</li>
            <li>but it works amazing.</li>
            <li>Fast heat-up, does an amazing job, and looks great!</li>
            <li>If you can afford a better one then don&#x27;t skimp, but otherwise this is good value.</li>
            <li>I own a chi ordered this as a backup .</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t actually own one</li>
            <li>which also means its not going to be as shiny as it would be if I  used a nice straightener.</li>
            <li>the automatic shut off is nice for when I forget to shut it off</li>
            <li>so I decided to buy my own today</li>
            <li>This is a really nice straightener.</li>
            <li>The stand that&#x27;s included is a nice accessory.</li>
            <li>even if it&#x27;s still warm is nice.</li>
            <li>I got this straightener for Christmas and it&#x27;s awesome so far!!!</li>
            <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!</li>
            <li>Really good, hair looks nice, brilliant and soft.</li>
            <li>To get it to absolute perfection you might want to do it once or twice but otherwise amazing results!!</li>
            <li>The time taken to straighten is sooo much shorter now and it does at awesome job :)</li>
            <li>You will be super happy with it.</li>
            <li>Great price heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>The settings are very easy to see.</li>
            <li>makes it very easy to know what temperature you have it set on.</li>
            <li>, it makes it very  easy to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li>This iron is nice...gets very hot great price</li>
            <li>Also love the color .. which has no bearing on performance, but hey, us girls like things cute as well!</li>
            <li>I have been straightening my hair for almost 10 years, and this is by far the best straightener I have used.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m very happy with this iron.</li>
            <li>but I just have to seeing how cheap and good this straightener works</li>
            <li>No problems at all with snagging, which was a concern since my hair is very fine.</li>
            <li>Its digital settings are awesome the look is cool and it does a great job.</li>
            <li>Took a bit of experimenting to find the right temp (392 works best for me), but now the results are well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>It is slim in design, heats up quickly, and the plates don&#x27;t get stuck in my hair!!</li>
            <li>Very cheaply manufactured, hair keeps getting snagged in the ends of the plate.</li>
            <li>THis straightener is good at heating up quickly and straightens well</li>
            <li>awesome and thanks for the special edition surprise:)</li>
            <li>It gets VERY hot and that&#x27;s good for my hair.</li>
            <li>Heating well, price was good, in good working condition, was brand new and look just as in picture.</li>
            <li>I love how I can use it as a straightener and a curler.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>:) buy this one</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had more straighteners and chemicals on my hair than I can count and let me tell you...</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;ll do until I find something better.</li>
            <li>It can also curl my hair which I really love the most .</li>
            <li>After researching the CHI and others like it, I realized that it was too iffy to order one cheaply; most of them are fakes.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>The results were better than i had hoped for.</li>
            <li>but this straightener is even better than chi (in price and quality).</li>
            <li>I used the Infiniti Conair once and now my hair is more silky than ever.</li>
            <li>Okay?</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>My hair never gets frizzy with this iron I love it</li>
            <li>and I love the color</li>
            <li>I use this several times a week on my hair and it always does a wonderful job.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Interestingly I have the curling iron version of the Infinti Pro and love it.</li>
            <li>I literally go to her house before work and use her iron because it only takes 15 minutes and my hair is perfect.</li>
            <li>Just eb sure to use some heat protection as well.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my sophomore year in college and am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>and I love the temperature control  </li>
            <li>and I love the colors that it comes in.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>It looks better than ever-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought one.</li>

            <li>also love the heat settings ....</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this straightener.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even talk about how much I love this straightener.</li>
            <li>and did not look healthy.</li>
            <li>Could not recommend more.</li>
            <li>I have two more irons (one from walmart and one John Freeda)</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>this one is the one i like the most.</li>
            <li>Works, but I thought I would be better than my 10-year-old straightener.  </li>
            <li>This will get most of  </li>
            <li>Does wonders for frizz and static.</li>
            <li>Love the color, love the automatic turn off.</li>
            <li>I love this iron.</li>
            <li>just wish they had more options.</li>
            <li>but this latest time my toddler managed to break it</li>
            <li>I love the heat settings...</li>
            <li>I like the 1\\&quot; because it allows me to flip out the ends of my hair, but I&#x27;m sure the 2\\</li>
            <li>I love this iron.  </li>
            <li>So glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love that the cord has the swivel feature</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>If you turn off the lights you might be able to make it out.</li>
            <li>the one I used for many years.</li>
            <li>I love this straightner</li>
            <li>But now they are ok with 392 for bangs &amp; 419 for rest of hair.</li>
            <li>I can not be more pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>My original one is over 2 years old and still working perfectly.  </li>
            <li>and i love this flat iron the best i ever had.</li>
            <li>But after I tried it the chi is my backup this flat iron is superb</li>
            <li>It is the best flat iron..</li>
            <li>This is the best hair flat iron I have ever used.</li>
            <li>this flat iron is the best one I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>These flat irons are EXCELLENT!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited I can&#x27;t wait to have my own</li>
            <li>This is one of the best flat irons I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>This flat iron&#x27;s heat setting goes up to 455 degrees which is perfect.</li>
            <li>To my surprise, this was the best flat iron ever!  </li>
            <li>Still works decent &amp; is a great price.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take long to heat up and it does a real good job making my hair look shiny and bouncy when I straight it after it&#x27;s been curly !!!!</li>
            <li>first i loved that it reached up to 455 degree&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>It is an affordable option for those looking for a pretty good straightener.  </li>
            <li>I thought the Remington did a pretty good job</li>
            <li>Worth it!!</li>
            <li>I was surprised that she had this model and make because she is usually in to more high-end products, but it just goes to show that you don&#x27;t always have to spend a lot of money to get a great product.</li>
            <li>Not quite as good as the Chi, but for the price, it&#x27;s a good enough substitute.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll work just fine.</li>
            <li>Overall I would have to say this straighterner is a very good product.</li>
            <li>This is as good as a very high end straightener.</li>
            <li>It is probably ok for 1 st time buyers to try something for cheap.</li>
            <li>I thought it would make it more smooth, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter because it has the features that are most important too me (the ceramic plates, auto shut-off, rapid heat, no-tangle cord).</li>
            <li>It has been a great purchase so far for an affordable price.</li>
            <li>On top of all that, it is a beautiful deep teal color with a sleek design.</li>
            <li>:) fantastic</li>
            <li>and I loved it so much</li>
            <li>Just SO AWESOME.I&#x27;ve had the Infiniti pro for about two years now, still heats up super fast and works absolutely great.</li>
            <li>I saw this flat iron being used in a youtube video and decided to order it because the price was awesome so far so good.</li>
            <li>Very good flat iron.</li>
            <li>The multiple heat setting made it good for any hair!</li>
            <li>A nice goods that made my hair look like cool and good for styling, warm it just 1 min, control of this as A simple way, anyway, this is A nice goods, I &#x27;ll recommended for much people</li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li>weight and slim - easy to handle</li>
            <li>I have this iron and it heats up so easily and straighten so well and does not make your hair frizzy</li>
            <li>and/or guys with easy to straighten hair.  </li>
            <li>Its easy to handle</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lasted me 5 years (and still going strong)</li>
            <li>and it is going strong.</li>
            <li>It has four heat settings, which is nice and it heats up very fast and recovers quicly after each swipe.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly, the stand is a nice piece for when I’m done letting it cool off.</li>
            <li>The variety of heat settings is also a huge plus, and it heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li>This iron is the best, it doesnt get too hot because it has multiple heat settings, and it also doesnt fry your hair.</li>
            <li>The straightner is fine.  </li>
            <li>, It was fine.</li>
            <li>Works fine, but the plates don&#x27;t quite touch, so it does catch my hair sometimes</li>
            <li>I have super curly hair, and this thing works wonders!  </li>
            <li>My hair was shiny and bouncy and looked super healthy.</li>
            <li>Its very smooth and gets really hot!</li>
            <li>It works very well, better than any straightener I&#x27;ve used before...and the price is pretty good.</li>
            <li>for the seller, the items arrive pretty quick and the price is too good to be true.</li>
            <li>I had little hopes for this iron, but it was the best that was available at the drug store up the road from me.</li>
            <li>While I do love my corkscrew banana curls, I also happen to love straight, smooth hair.</li>
            <li>I am one of those people who does not wrap my hair at night and this morning my hair looked just as great as it did last night.</li>
            <li>It turns out that this Conair flatiron is just as fantastic</li>
            <li>Overall a great investment.</li>
            <li>Use it everyday and it works great!!</li>
            <li>My hair is silky smooth.</li>
            <li>The plates are smooth and have stayed that way.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned three genuine Chi hair straighteners.</li>
            <li>but once I straighten my hair with it, my hair straight EVEN THROUGH THE HUMID SUMMER, just so freaking amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth way more than it costs.</li>
            <li>The plates are smooth and it just glided thru my hair.</li>
            <li>On top of that I AM in India right now</li>
            <li>Great flat iron</li>
            <li>She has been very pleased with it, particularly with how rapidly it heats and how quickly it straightens her hair.</li>
            <li>Great quality at a super low price,</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair that untill now i wasn&#x27;t able to straighten easily.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d like to get what I ordered originally.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to use it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not necessarily disappointed.</li>
            <li>I saw so many great comments on the Infiniti Pro but was a little hesitant considering the cost -</li>
            <li>Ditch the trendy brand, save some cash, and be completely satisfied FINALLY with your straightener :) Highly recommended!! A+++</li>
            <li>Overall very happy with it so far.</li>
            <li>I have pretty average hair and this works quickly and perfectly.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nothing special for me.</li>
            <li>East to clean, heats up instantly, work really good.</li>
            <li>like I expected for smoothing frizzy fly aways.</li>
            <li>Love it so much</li>
            <li>You still need to put in heat protectant spray/straightening cream and straighten your hair in layers if it&#x27;s thick, but it does a great job!  </li>
            <li>Better than one&#x27;s I&#x27;ve paid twice as much for.</li>
            <li>I love that its very affordable.</li>
            <li>and I love it will recommend to others fast delivery</li>
            <li>I love this product so much I bought 2 one for me and one for my niece.   </li>
            <li>and its true it keeps ur hair</li>
            <li>but I love to wear it straight.</li>
            <li>I really like it :)</li>
            <li>(I do miss my daughters full head of curls).</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price</li>
            <li>Good quality, easy to use, doesn&#x27;t burn your hair, only has a funny smell but besides that I will purchase again</li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly, and the smooth plates really do just glide through my hair without snagging with even heat distribution throughout.  </li>
            <li>It heats quickly and I love the straight, anti-frizz look it give to hair.</li>
            <li>Very gentle on my fine hair.</li>
            <li>Just a few spritzes of heat protection, and you&#x27;re good to go!  </li>
            <li>I did not want to spend another $100 dollars on another Babyliss flat iron, although I really loved it.</li>
            <li>Before I bought this straightener, I had a $250 flat iron that I loved.</li>
            <li>I bought a flat iron for 120.00 once and wasn&#x27;t as good as this one.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and the first setting works well with my hair.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and it straightens hair quickly as well.  </li>
            <li>This product can heat quickly but it makes my hair even drier than before.</li>
            <li>I like the heat settings, and I like how quickly it gets</li>
            <li>up super fast&lt;br /&gt;temperature</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>hair has never felt softer or has straightened so quickly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product even more than some straighteners I have bought from beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li>The high heat was okay for my hair.</li>
            <li>Gets super hot, quick, and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>It heated up very fast!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also glad it has a swivel cord and a place to put your hand at the top of the flat iron.</li>
            <li>I even talked to Mindy, my hairdresser, who said that it is better to have an iron that gets hot and is good quality (ahem, Sedu or CHI) and go over your hair once than an iron that gets too hot and might possibly have hot spots (ahem, this one) and go over your hair 4-5 times like I do.</li>
            <li>The colour is very pretty, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The LED light still comes on but it doesn&#x27;t get hot.</li>
            <li>It heats up super fast with high heat settings and comes with a nice holder that keeps the heat off of the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>Hopefully the new one will be a better product?</li>
            <li>I love how fast this straightening iron heats up and how hot it can get.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and leaves my hair very nice slick and smooth.</li>
            <li>its quiet a remarkable product  heats up amazingly fast and the hair remains straight for hours!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s priced right, it heats up quickly, and it works well.  </li>
            <li>Do yourself a serious favor and spend the extra money on a Sedu (the best in my opinion) or if you don&#x27;t want to spend that much maybe the basic CHI  (not as good as the Sedu of course,  no offense to those of you who own them).</li>
            <li>bcuz I loved hers so much...gets hot as he&#x27;ll really fast and works good on course African American hair</li>
            <li>Gets the job done for little fly aways.</li>
            <li>I have had many flat irons, by many makers including Golden Hot, Ion, and CHI.</li>
            <li>Works awesome for my very thick and wavy hair.</li>
            <li>This flat iron also heats up very quickly and I am satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Bought this in pink before and it worked great to straighten my very frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is shiny, straight and light as if it was done by a pro.</li>
            <li>I just use it to smooth out my already straight hair.  </li>
            <li>It heats up fast and leave my hair looking nice and straight fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few others and thus far this has worked the best.</li>
            <li>worth the price.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work any faster or provide any better results than my old one.  </li>
            <li>Nice to only have to straighten my bangs once per wash instead of every day.</li>
            <li>and recently my sister has been seeing how straight and healthy my hair has been looking so she has been using it most of the time as well</li>
            <li>so worth it.</li>
            <li>I borrowed this from a friend and ended up buying my own after I have it back.</li>
            <li>I love the multiple settings and the way it glides so smoothly through my hair.</li>
            <li>This straightener heats up super fast and is super hot!</li>
            <li>It does straighten the hair quickly but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do a good job of smoothing down the frizz.</li>
            <li>loved this flat iron so much, that when my niece asked for one for this Christmas, I immediatly looked on Amazon for the Infinity Pro, found it, ordered it and can&#x27;t wait to give it to her.  </li>
            <li>What is so special is that after they shower &amp; wash out there hair, it still stays soft, manageable &amp; super tamed!</li>
            <li>This is one  amazing flat iron.  </li>
            <li>The CHI line came highly recommended but I really didn&#x27;t want to shell out over $100 for something I wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li>Also because they are so smooth and do not get hot spots and scorched or burnt, any residue from styling product is so easily cleanable (I used to have major problems cleaning the gunk off my metal plated straighteners).</li>
            <li>Sometimes when I&#x27;m traveling I need to shove the straightening iron in a bag right after it has been on,</li>
            <li>The plug on this doesn&#x27;t seem to be the right size.</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life, I have truly straight hair without the ends looking like I stuck my finger in a light socket.  </li>
            <li>it was super light, it heated up so fast, much faster then</li>
            <li>Even with my hair a little damp, it still does an amazing job, AND dries my hair!</li>
            <li>The only negative is that the plates don&#x27;t fit together perfectly</li>
            <li>By far the best flatiron I&#x27;ve used and at such a low price.  </li>
            <li>This flat iron is by far one of the best out there especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>the only thing i love about this flat iron is the floating plates you can really do a nice curl at the end of your hair and it stays.</li>
            <li>I like my Flat iron, heats well, and very fast too, am sure i will enjoy using it, really like it.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how quickly it was ready to go on a time-crunched</li>
            <li>Not to mention my moms got a $300 straightener that doesn&#x27;t work half as good.</li>
            <li>it straightens super fast and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair with a burnt smell.</li>
            <li>Heats super fast and does the job without ruining my hair.</li>
            <li>, I get done super fast</li>
            <li>Anyways I would recommend this flat iron to people who are looking for a cheap but good to use flat iron.</li>
            <li>Did not like this iron very much...</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable too so no Cons to report.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li>It gets super hot (up to 455 degrees) which gets my hair really straight, really fast!</li>
            <li>I am glad I did not spend very much on these, but still would like my money back.</li>
            <li>Gets really hot and doesnt fry your hair.</li>
            <li>Love the different settings.</li>
            <li>It straightened it the first time around.</li>
            <li>so you better believe that it&#x27;s as humid as it possibly can be.</li>
            <li>Mine first one was given to me</li>
            <li>but only when i grab more than an inch of my hair.</li>
            <li>Temperature settings are more than enough.</li>
            <li>It can get as hot as you need it to be.</li>
            <li>I was expecting higher quality than I received.</li>
            <li>and it is perfectly hot.</li>
            <li>(first time I&#x27;ve ever had one</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not at all pleased with this product but don&#x27;t care enough to return it.</li>
            <li>this way I don&#x27;t worry about it being too hot in there.</li>
            <li>Please note that I do not use it daily as I love my curls.</li>
            <li>so I originally picked up a cheap pair of Revlon flat irons...</li>
            <li>these guys heat up insanely fast, don&#x27;t lose heat and work as well as my GHD&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>It gets my hair do straight which allows me to go even longer without getting a relaxer!</li>
            <li>and i first tryed hers</li>
            <li>Gets hot as soon as u turn it on.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to yell at my kiddo to watch out for it when she comes in and out of the bathroom 20 times while I&#x27;m getting ready!</li>
            <li>The chi works better, but costs double the price of this item.  </li>
            <li>I think what did the trick for me was a higher heat setting.</li>
            <li>which pretty much holds the heat in the blades!</li>
            <li>Heats up really fast!</li>
            <li>I also recommend using it with \\&quot;Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Hot off the Press\\&quot; or \\&quot;Frizz Ease Heat</li>
            <li>I had owned a really large Conair straightener that was given to me about 5 years ago that is silver and very large and bulky</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and definitely gets very hot, very fast.</li>
            <li>Makes hair straight super fast</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve never bought any other kind.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I bought this flat iron for $45 .</li>
            <li>However, I must say, I do love this flat iron and tend to either grab this one or the other Conair infiniti one I own, which has longer plates.</li>
            <li>It works way better than any flat iron I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>It was quite quick to get here for here before the new year.</li>
            <li>It also stays super straight until you wash your hair, and I live in Miami!</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve paid $100 dollars more for flat irons and this one beats them!  </li>
            <li>My hair has NEVER been so smooth and soft, not to mention straight.</li>
            <li>I have used the Chi straightener also, and think that this one is just as good as the more expensive ones.  </li>
            <li>My first appliance was bought at a salon for over $100 dollars where I first had my hair done straight.</li>
            <li>Inifinit Pro works best if you make sure your hair is completely dry and flat iron in small sections.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this flat iron!!!</li>
            <li>I use a straightener pretty much every day</li>
            <li>and it got my hair pretty straight.  </li>
            <li>I stopped using this straightener a long time ago and purchased a better one.</li>
            <li>but it still gets just as hot just as fast.</li>
            <li>I borrowed my friends Flat iron and didn&#x27;t want to give it back because it is so damn good...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just as good as the Chi if not better.</li>
            <li>The holder is really handy too because it keeps the blades together when I put it down</li>
            <li>The adjustable heat settings is a blessing because in days where my hair is a little more frizzier than some the heat helps!</li>
            <li>but the reviews were right, this is a fantastic flat iron!</li>
            <li>When I use it on my dry hair I always make sure to use some type of heat protectant like tresseme or whatever.</li>
            <li>I have very short hair, and its size allows me to straighten my fringe quite easily.</li>
            <li>Hair also feels super soft.</li>
            <li>As a single mom the price and quality of these irons couldn&#x27;t get any better</li>
            <li>If you follow the rules and don&#x27;t try to straighten too large of a section at a time you will get the results you desire.</li>
            <li>if your hair isn&#x27;t exactly on those plates it gets caught on the sides of the iron, I tried another section thinking I just didn&#x27;t brush my hair good enough and it ripped that one even harder out of my head..</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first about buying this brand, because it was not the fancy one used in salons (the more popular brand)anyway to my surprise</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron!!!!!</li>
            <li>I do have very fine strands of hair,but can be very wavy and sometimes very curly if I go to sleep with wet hair.</li>
            <li>I think the smaller one inch actually works better!  </li>
            <li>It certainly heats up fast and</li>
            <li>I am happy to say I have had the same results from the green Infiniti.  </li>
            <li>so I bought the Conair Infiniti that is much cheaper.</li>
            <li>It also heats up fast.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t care for it much.</li>
            <li>Since I bought it in June, I&#x27;ve gotten to use it all summer through the humidity, heat and sweat and my hair was still straight at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>really works.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair really shiny and straight and it won&#x27;t frizz.  </li>
            <li>It stays straight for days ...</li>
            <li>After very apologetically explaining what I had done to her, I did some research and found this one.</li>
            <li>I have naturally straight hair, so I bought this to curl my hair with.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever find one that I&#x27;d like as much as that one.</li>
            <li>It really does heat up in seconds.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>so I leave it on the lowest setting and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>It still makes my hair TOO straight, like it&#x27;s trying to escape my face.</li>
            <li>I use this guy so much</li>
            <li>and she thanks me</li>
            <li>It comes highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>n doesnt do too much damage on ur hair.</li>
            <li>my hair gets from curly to straight so fast.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to spend close to $100 on a straightener that I wasn&#x27;t going to use that much, so I bought this straightener for 1/3rd of the price I would spend on a $100 straightener.  </li>
            <li>It is naturally very wavy and curly</li>
            <li>hair feels shiny and healhtier, it heats up fast like it when im on a hurry</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper on Amazon than the drug store.</li>
            <li>It heat up really in 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>and it still works very well.</li>
            <li>I can straighten it stick straight in about 20 minutes and it stays and without using any product!!!!I can&#x27;t preach</li>
            <li>I would much rather spend $100</li>
            <li>My hair type is semi-straight and this product works really well.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and hold hair well.</li>
            <li>I was ready to make a trip to the salon, until I received this straightener for Christmas.</li>
            <li>I recommend unplugging this when not in use as it feels slightly warm to the touch in some areas if it&#x27;s left plugged in, even days after it was last used.</li>
            <li>You have to make sure to hold the top of the flat iron tight.</li>
            <li>I should also say that I live in very *very* humid south Florida</li>
            <li>I love my new flat iron!!!</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly, with multiple digitally-displayed heat settings that go all the way up to 455 degrees – this gets REALLY hot.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried much more expensive flat irons before, this could be a great alternative.</li>
            <li>one is more curlier than the other.</li>
            <li>One good thing is that it kept my bands straight longer than my other flat iron.</li>
            <li>This one actually makes my hair look like I have super silky glassy smooth &amp;#34;asian&amp;#34; hair (got wavy latina hair) :P I did burn the top of my ear though, and kind of annoying, when you close iron, it only touches at the first half.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic flat iron!</li>
            <li>Plus they&#x27;re SO cheap for a decent flat iron!</li>
            <li>its so fast to heat and leaves my hair very soft and shiny, also protects hair against humidity and frizz better than other...</li>
            <li>My boyfriend talked me out of buying a very expensive hair straightener at the mall, and I am very pleased that he showed me this one on Amazon!!!!</li>
            <li>highly recommend this flat iron and suggest using thermal gloves (I do) if you require high heat because you WILL burn your free hand after a couple of passes.</li>
            <li>&gt; The only thing not so nice, is the black case that comes with this straightener to store while hot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this straightener for over 4 years now and it works like its brand new!</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron because it can straight my hair for only 10-15 mins  </li>
            <li>[I&#x27;m talkin&#x27; an hour and a half or more] and</li>
            <li>After researching many expensive models, I am glad that I chose this one.</li>
            <li>I replaced an older Infiniti that started shorting after 6+ years.</li>
            <li>It has multiple heat settings and gets very hot without burning your hair.</li>
            <li>My old hai brand would leave the hair thick, full of static &amp; would rise up in humidity by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>But you don&#x27;t have to put it that high if you don&#x27;t want it that high.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have high expectations</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Bought this my 11 grade year in high school at a CVS.</li>
            <li>Wish I had it in high school</li>
            <li>(No need for high settings)</li>
            <li>i totally recommend this product after going through many flat irons</li>
            <li>To reduce hair damage, make sure you use a heat protectant before flat ironing your hair, such as CHI Silk Infusion or CHI 44 Iron Guard Thermal Protection.</li>
            <li>that make&#x27;s your hair shine and hold moisture in before i use this super hair frying flat iron.</li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t wow me</li>
            <li>I could never get my naturally curly hair straight enough to make it worth it</li>
            <li>A very very hot flat iron.</li>
            <li>At first use, this product was a LOT better than other drug store flat irons I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>For the price even if it burns out in a short while it will be worth replacing.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair straight and smooth in less than 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li>It heats up really quickly and is makes my hair very shiny and straight in less than 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking for a new brand...</li>
            <li>It still feels brand new.</li>
            <li>I bought the 1 1/2\\&quot; Conair Infiniti Pro straightener (the hot pink one) first and was AMAZED at the difference.</li>
            <li>I used this straightener for the first time last night</li>
            <li>It completely transformed my hair!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I stopped straightening for a while because I was trying to be natural, but for some reason I decided to look into getting a new straightener.</li>
            <li>I have damaged my hair before from using a flat iron that was too hot and didn&#x27;t have any lower settings.</li>
            <li>Works really well on my super frizzy hard to straighten hair, even when i don&#x27;t blow dry it straight first.</li>
            <li>With this one, it only takes about 15 minutes and it is so much straighter than with my old one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been attempting to straighten my hair since I was 16 years old and am now 27.</li>
            <li>busy morning.</li>
            <li>and so far it hasn&#x27;t broke yet.</li>
            <li>and I have to say I am surprised by the results.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how well it worked for the price.</li>
            <li>This is the same width, but much lighter and easier to work with.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve had it close to a month</li>
            <li>My hair is very curly but his iron on only the second setting leaves my hair shiny and straight for days.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s really said to me that i have to double up.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>I always thought that you get what you pay for as far as straighteners as concerned but this completely changed my outlook...</li>
            <li>and I finally decided I cannot be bothered to spend so much money over and over again on a straightener.</li>
            <li>I also ordered the Infiniti Professional Nano Tourmaline Ceramic Curling Iron</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s baby soft after.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, shiny and feels so weightless, I can&#x27;t wait for my husband to come home and see it:)&lt;br</li>
            <li>3 DAYS LATER STILL STRAIGHT AFTER SLEEPING ON IT, RUNNING, DANCING &amp; SHAKING IT ALL ABOUT.</li>
            <li>Though curling is not a problem except now they have soft waves of curls.</li>
            <li>then 3 females battling over a straightener early in the morning, when you want to leave the hotel room.o experiences with burning</li>
            <li>Leaves my thick hair strait for days I love it.</li>
            <li>and my hair is so thick, but I was so pleased once I used it.</li>
            <li>I have owned numerous other straighteners in many different brands and models.</li>
            <li>Second setting gets my hair straight really fast, within 5 minutes I&#x27;d say, however it does tend to work a lil too well (A little hot for my hair).</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t waste your money on a expensive straightenerthis one works wonders and has a great price ;-)  </li>
            <li>This flat iron kept them straight</li>
            <li>i find that i have to use another flat iron with real ceramic plates.</li>
            <li>and i don&#x27;t have to flat iron a section 3 times to get it straight.</li>
            <li>This flat iron heats up fast and straightens with a curl at the end which is how I style it.  </li>
            <li>I never had much luck with the cheap-o flat iron I&#x27;ve had for years</li>
            <li>Even after the time I&#x27;ve had this one, I still only need to put it on the first or second heat setting.</li>
            <li>I even use it on my 6 yr old sons long curly hair when he wants boy band hair.</li>
            <li>However, within the first month of daily use, mine stopped letting me choose my setting and would only go on the highest setting every time I turned it on.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to get a hair straightener that really worked and would not fry my hair or just do half the job.</li>
            <li>I only need to put mine on the second setting (338 degrees) for it to do a good job, and I have very thick wavy/curly hair.  </li>
            <li>It pulls on my hair (OW!) takes a while to heat up, damages it to the nth degree, takes a really, really really long time to straighten my whole head</li>
            <li>My hair will stay straight for as long as I don&#x27;t wash it.</li>
            <li>I bought another flat iron for like 20 dollars but only got as hot as 375 and did nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li>(you don&#x27;t need to pass through parts of your hair more than 1-3 times, depends how fast &amp; how much hair you pull through, go slow with small sections &amp; get done quicker).</li>
            <li>So I just now tried my brand new Ifiniti Pro that came to me last week....</li>
            <li>I have fairly uncooperative hair and my last straightening iron was all but useless.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this flat iron!</li>
            <li>Infiniti Instant Heat Pure Ceramic 1 Inch Tourmaline Ceramic Flat Iron</li>
            <li>Works like no other</li>
            <li>First, I have extremely frizzy, curly hair.</li>
            <li>High temperature settings are necessary if you do keratin treatments at home but not all flat irons provide high enough heat.</li>
            <li>For a little added fun, it works for curling the ends up, too.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s hard to get your fist around it securely.</li>
            <li>My only regret is that when I bought this I did not realize that it came in a 2 inch size, which I most certainly would have purchased instead since the 1 inch size is so small and takes longer to use (the reason for the missing star).</li>
            <li>We have had a very rainy summer in Florida this year but no freeze with the pink Infiniti Pro by Conair.  </li>
            <li>This one, though, I can have my hair straight in roughly 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>I had an old conair straightener that lasted me almost 10 years before it finally went out on me.</li>
            <li>This product worked so well and left my hair feeling soft and conditioned</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned and tired so many</li>
            <li>My hair as well is thick and it lives it silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I have long, dark Indian hair that is SUPER frizzy.</li>
            <li>After two less than stellar experiences with chi straighteners</li>
            <li>(note: my hair is naturally blonde, not black).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for the cheapest flat iron online and so far I found the conair one .</li>
            <li>The old flat iron i had was a con air as well , but it wouldn&#x27;t straighten my hair like this one does.</li>
            <li>I have natural African-American hair and this flat iron does wonders.</li>
            <li>With my old flat iron it took about 30 minutes to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly but the curls are loose and large, so kinkier hair might not last as long.</li>
            <li>I have thick wavy hair and it straightens really well and fast.</li>
            <li>and I never really used it because it was difficult to handle and did not seem to ever do a good job on my hair</li>
            <li>First of all, this straightener is a beautiful shade of peacock blue, however I am a little disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li>I had been using a $15 cheap flat iron for the past ten years.  </li>
            <li>Normally it used to take me near an hour to straighten, but with this straightener it took half that time.</li>
            <li>This less expensive flat iron had great reviews</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s my only complaint, but a huge pain if you&#x27;re in the middle of straightening a client&#x27;s hair that is thick/coarse.</li>
            <li>I have used numerous other straighteners that snagged (in spaces between the plates), broke and damaged my hair, and since using this my hair looks so much healthier</li>
            <li>The only problem is that after some moderate use, the blue paint near the plates starts to melt/peel away.</li>
            <li>It never fails that after a few months it just dies, but that didn&#x27;t matter to me bc</li>
            <li>First one I had to return because it would not clamp down flat on my hair.  </li>
            <li>After a few months I&#x27;ve notice that from reinserting the top &amp; bottom part of the barrel has some of the paint chipped away from use, and is not very nice looking.</li>
            <li>It heats up and cools down fast.</li>
            <li>is that even when i put it on the lowest setting it made my hair super dull looking it did not shine.</li>
            <li>My hair is super thick</li>
            <li>So I took a chance based on other reviews and WOW!!</li>
            <li>tried it on my daughter’s hair, freeze, and thick, long, short and it lives it silky smooth.</li>
            <li>It takes my hair from big and puffy to straight as a pin in less than 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>hair is naturally thick and frizzy in the front-but NOT Any more, also it took half the time to straighten it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have super thick, coarse, wavy hair.</li>
            <li>The product has a long warranty, but I have to pay to ship it back, pay $7.50 for the opportunity, and be without a straightener for however long it takes to receive a new one.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, thin, and wavy/curly.</li>
            <li>Now their hair are super soft, sleek thin &amp; tamed, they left their hair unwashed for 3 days test (</li>
            <li>My hair is thick and frizzy, with my old revlon iron, I can iron my hair in 1hr and still not satisfied with the result, with Infiniti Pro by Conair, I can get it straight in 15 mins, like really straight, and shiny and soft if I may</li>
            <li>I spent a large sum of money on a \\&quot;professional\\&quot; straightener from a salon about a year ago, and that was a complete waste of money now that I have tried this one.</li>
            <li>After decades of trying unsuccessfully to tame it (curling irons, blow dryers, hot rollers, perms and relaxers), I finally decided to buy a flat iron.  </li>

            <li> (looks like it&#x27;s up to $39.99 now, but still a good deal in my opinion).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as good as I thought it would be after some of the reviews I read.</li>

            <li> I know some people use hairspray before they straighten, that&#x27;s sure to gunk it up!</li>
            <li> but this one is so much better!</li>
            <li> I found one I liked more!</li>
            <li> Works great on my fine hair.</li>
            <li> Man this is amazing.  </li>
            <li> The plates are smooth and glassy (being ceramic and all) and they heat up evenly and do a great job.</li>
            <li> Its amazing.</li>
            <li> but it works amazing.</li>
            <li> Fast heat-up, does an amazing job, and looks great!</li>
            <li> If you can afford a better one then don&#x27;t skimp, but otherwise this is good value.</li>
            <li> I own a chi ordered this as a backup .</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t actually own one</li>
            <li> which also means its not going to be as shiny as it would be if I  used a nice straightener.</li>
            <li> the automatic shut off is nice for when I forget to shut it off</li>
            <li> so I decided to buy my own today</li>
            <li> This is a really nice straightener.</li>
            <li> The stand that&#x27;s included is a nice accessory.</li>
            <li> even if it&#x27;s still warm is nice.</li>
            <li> I got this straightener for Christmas and it&#x27;s awesome so far!!!</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!</li>
            <li> Really good, hair looks nice, brilliant and soft.</li>
            <li> To get it to absolute perfection you might want to do it once or twice but otherwise amazing results!!</li>
            <li> The time taken to straighten is sooo much shorter now and it does at awesome job :)</li>
            <li> You will be super happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great price heats up quickly.</li>
            <li> The settings are very easy to see.</li>
            <li> makes it very easy to know what temperature you have it set on.</li>
            <li> , it makes it very  easy to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> This iron is nice...gets very hot great price</li>
            <li> Also love the color .. which has no bearing on performance, but hey, us girls like things cute as well!</li>
            <li> I have been straightening my hair for almost 10 years, and this is by far the best straightener I have used.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m very happy with this iron.</li>
            <li> but I just have to seeing how cheap and good this straightener works</li>
            <li> No problems at all with snagging, which was a concern since my hair is very fine.</li>
            <li> Its digital settings are awesome the look is cool and it does a great job.</li>
            <li> Took a bit of experimenting to find the right temp (392 works best for me), but now the results are well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> It is slim in design, heats up quickly, and the plates don&#x27;t get stuck in my hair!!</li>
            <li> Very cheaply manufactured, hair keeps getting snagged in the ends of the plate.</li>
            <li> THis straightener is good at heating up quickly and straightens well</li>
            <li> awesome and thanks for the special edition surprise:)</li>
            <li> It gets VERY hot and that&#x27;s good for my hair.</li>
            <li> Heating well, price was good, in good working condition, was brand new and look just as in picture.</li>
            <li> I love how I can use it as a straightener and a curler.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> :) buy this one</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had more straighteners and chemicals on my hair than I can count and let me tell you...</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;ll do until I find something better.</li>
            <li> It can also curl my hair which I really love the most .</li>
            <li> After researching the CHI and others like it, I realized that it was too iffy to order one cheaply; most of them are fakes.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> The results were better than i had hoped for.</li>
            <li> but this straightener is even better than chi (in price and quality).</li>
            <li> I used the Infiniti Conair once and now my hair is more silky than ever.</li>
            <li> Okay?</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> My hair never gets frizzy with this iron I love it</li>
            <li> and I love the color</li>
            <li> I use this several times a week on my hair and it always does a wonderful job.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Interestingly I have the curling iron version of the Infinti Pro and love it.</li>
            <li> I literally go to her house before work and use her iron because it only takes 15 minutes and my hair is perfect.</li>
            <li> Just eb sure to use some heat protection as well.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my sophomore year in college and am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> and I love the temperature control  </li>
            <li> and I love the colors that it comes in.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> It looks better than ever-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought one.</li>
            <li> i love this straightner</li>
            <li> also love the heat settings ....</li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this straightener.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even talk about how much I love this straightener.</li>
            <li> and did not look healthy.</li>
            <li> Could not recommend more.</li>
            <li> I have two more irons (one from walmart and one John Freeda)</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> this one is the one i like the most.</li>
            <li> Works, but I thought I would be better than my 10-year-old straightener.  </li>
            <li> This will get most of  </li>
            <li> Does wonders for frizz and static.</li>
            <li> Love the color, love the automatic turn off.</li>
            <li> I love this iron.</li>
            <li> just wish they had more options.</li>
            <li> but this latest time my toddler managed to break it</li>
            <li> I love the heat settings...</li>
            <li> I like the 1\\&quot; because it allows me to flip out the ends of my hair, but I&#x27;m sure the 2\\</li>
            <li> I love this iron.  </li>
            <li> So glad I did.</li>
            <li> I love that the cord has the swivel feature</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> If you turn off the lights you might be able to make it out.</li>
            <li> the one I used for many years.</li>
            <li> I love this straightner</li>
            <li> But now they are ok with 392 for bangs &amp; 419 for rest of hair.</li>
            <li> I can not be more pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> My original one is over 2 years old and still working perfectly.  </li>
            <li> and i love this flat iron the best i ever had.</li>
            <li> But after I tried it the chi is my backup this flat iron is superb</li>
            <li> It is the best flat iron..</li>
            <li> This is the best hair flat iron I have ever used.</li>
            <li> this flat iron is the best one I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> These flat irons are EXCELLENT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited I can&#x27;t wait to have my own</li>
            <li> This is one of the best flat irons I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> This flat iron&#x27;s heat setting goes up to 455 degrees which is perfect.</li>
            <li> To my surprise, this was the best flat iron ever!  </li>
            <li> Still works decent &amp; is a great price.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take long to heat up and it does a real good job making my hair look shiny and bouncy when I straight it after it&#x27;s been curly !!!!</li>
            <li> first i loved that it reached up to 455 degree&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It is an affordable option for those looking for a pretty good straightener.  </li>
            <li> I thought the Remington did a pretty good job</li>
            <li> Worth it!!</li>
            <li> I was surprised that she had this model and make because she is usually in to more high-end products, but it just goes to show that you don&#x27;t always have to spend a lot of money to get a great product.</li>
            <li> Not quite as good as the Chi, but for the price, it&#x27;s a good enough substitute.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll work just fine.</li>
            <li> Overall I would have to say this straighterner is a very good product.</li>
            <li> This is as good as a very high end straightener.</li>
            <li> It is probably ok for 1 st time buyers to try something for cheap.</li>
            <li> I thought it would make it more smooth, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter because it has the features that are most important too me (the ceramic plates, auto shut-off, rapid heat, no-tangle cord).</li>
            <li> It has been a great purchase so far for an affordable price.</li>
            <li> On top of all that, it is a beautiful deep teal color with a sleek design.</li>
            <li> :) fantastic</li>
            <li> and I loved it so much</li>
            <li> Just SO AWESOME.I&#x27;ve had the Infiniti pro for about two years now, still heats up super fast and works absolutely great.</li>
            <li> I saw this flat iron being used in a youtube video and decided to order it because the price was awesome so far so good.</li>
            <li> Very good flat iron.</li>
            <li> The multiple heat setting made it good for any hair!</li>
            <li> A nice goods that made my hair look like cool and good for styling, warm it just 1 min, control of this as A simple way, anyway, this is A nice goods, I &#x27;ll recommended for much people</li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li> weight and slim - easy to handle</li>
            <li> I have this iron and it heats up so easily and straighten so well and does not make your hair frizzy</li>
            <li> and/or guys with easy to straighten hair.  </li>
            <li> Its easy to handle</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lasted me 5 years (and still going strong)</li>
            <li> and it is going strong.</li>
            <li> It has four heat settings, which is nice and it heats up very fast and recovers quicly after each swipe.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly, the stand is a nice piece for when I’m done letting it cool off.</li>
            <li> The variety of heat settings is also a huge plus, and it heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li> This iron is the best, it doesnt get too hot because it has multiple heat settings, and it also doesnt fry your hair.</li>
            <li> The straightner is fine.  </li>
            <li> , It was fine.</li>
            <li> Works fine, but the plates don&#x27;t quite touch, so it does catch my hair sometimes</li>
            <li> I have super curly hair, and this thing works wonders!  </li>
            <li> My hair was shiny and bouncy and looked super healthy.</li>
            <li> Its very smooth and gets really hot!</li>
            <li> It works very well, better than any straightener I&#x27;ve used before...and the price is pretty good.</li>
            <li> for the seller, the items arrive pretty quick and the price is too good to be true.</li>
            <li> I had little hopes for this iron, but it was the best that was available at the drug store up the road from me.</li>
            <li> While I do love my corkscrew banana curls, I also happen to love straight, smooth hair.</li>
            <li> I am one of those people who does not wrap my hair at night and this morning my hair looked just as great as it did last night.</li>
            <li> It turns out that this Conair flatiron is just as fantastic</li>
            <li> Overall a great investment.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday and it works great!!</li>
            <li> My hair is silky smooth.</li>
            <li> The plates are smooth and have stayed that way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned three genuine Chi hair straighteners.</li>
            <li> but once I straighten my hair with it, my hair straight EVEN THROUGH THE HUMID SUMMER, just so freaking amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth way more than it costs.</li>
            <li> The plates are smooth and it just glided thru my hair.</li>
            <li> On top of that I AM in India right now</li>
            <li> Great flat iron</li>
            <li> She has been very pleased with it, particularly with how rapidly it heats and how quickly it straightens her hair.</li>
            <li> Great quality at a super low price,</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair that untill now i wasn&#x27;t able to straighten easily.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d like to get what I ordered originally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not necessarily disappointed.</li>
            <li> I saw so many great comments on the Infiniti Pro but was a little hesitant considering the cost -</li>
            <li> Ditch the trendy brand, save some cash, and be completely satisfied FINALLY with your straightener :) Highly recommended!! A+++</li>
            <li> Overall very happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> I have pretty average hair and this works quickly and perfectly.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nothing special for me.</li>
            <li> East to clean, heats up instantly, work really good.</li>
            <li> like I expected for smoothing frizzy fly aways.</li>
            <li> Love it so much</li>
            <li> You still need to put in heat protectant spray/straightening cream and straighten your hair in layers if it&#x27;s thick, but it does a great job!  </li>
            <li> Better than one&#x27;s I&#x27;ve paid twice as much for.</li>
            <li> I love that its very affordable.</li>
            <li> and I love it will recommend to others fast delivery</li>
            <li> I love this product so much I bought 2 one for me and one for my niece.   </li>
            <li> and its true it keeps ur hair</li>
            <li> but I love to wear it straight.</li>
            <li> I really like it :)</li>
            <li> (I do miss my daughters full head of curls).</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price</li>
            <li> Good quality, easy to use, doesn&#x27;t burn your hair, only has a funny smell but besides that I will purchase again</li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly, and the smooth plates really do just glide through my hair without snagging with even heat distribution throughout.  </li>
            <li> It heats quickly and I love the straight, anti-frizz look it give to hair.</li>
            <li> Very gentle on my fine hair.</li>
            <li> Just a few spritzes of heat protection, and you&#x27;re good to go!  </li>
            <li> I did not want to spend another $100 dollars on another Babyliss flat iron, although I really loved it.</li>
            <li> Before I bought this straightener, I had a $250 flat iron that I loved.</li>
            <li> I bought a flat iron for 120.00 once and wasn&#x27;t as good as this one.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and the first setting works well with my hair.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and it straightens hair quickly as well.  </li>
            <li> This product can heat quickly but it makes my hair even drier than before.</li>
            <li> I like the heat settings, and I like how quickly it gets</li>
            <li> up super fast&lt;br /&gt;temperature</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly.</li>
            <li> hair has never felt softer or has straightened so quickly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product even more than some straighteners I have bought from beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li> The high heat was okay for my hair.</li>
            <li> Gets super hot, quick, and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> It heated up very fast!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also glad it has a swivel cord and a place to put your hand at the top of the flat iron.</li>
            <li> I even talked to Mindy, my hairdresser, who said that it is better to have an iron that gets hot and is good quality (ahem, Sedu or CHI) and go over your hair once than an iron that gets too hot and might possibly have hot spots (ahem, this one) and go over your hair 4-5 times like I do.</li>
            <li> The colour is very pretty, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The LED light still comes on but it doesn&#x27;t get hot.</li>
            <li> It heats up super fast with high heat settings and comes with a nice holder that keeps the heat off of the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> Hopefully the new one will be a better product?</li>
            <li> I love how fast this straightening iron heats up and how hot it can get.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and leaves my hair very nice slick and smooth.</li>
            <li> its quiet a remarkable product  heats up amazingly fast and the hair remains straight for hours!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s priced right, it heats up quickly, and it works well.  </li>
            <li> Do yourself a serious favor and spend the extra money on a Sedu (the best in my opinion) or if you don&#x27;t want to spend that much maybe the basic CHI  (not as good as the Sedu of course,  no offense to those of you who own them).</li>
            <li> bcuz I loved hers so much...gets hot as he&#x27;ll really fast and works good on course African American hair</li>
            <li> Gets the job done for little fly aways.</li>
            <li> I have had many flat irons, by many makers including Golden Hot, Ion, and CHI.</li>
            <li> Works awesome for my very thick and wavy hair.</li>
            <li> This flat iron also heats up very quickly and I am satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Bought this in pink before and it worked great to straighten my very frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is shiny, straight and light as if it was done by a pro.</li>
            <li> I just use it to smooth out my already straight hair.  </li>
            <li> It heats up fast and leave my hair looking nice and straight fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few others and thus far this has worked the best.</li>
            <li> worth the price.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work any faster or provide any better results than my old one.  </li>
            <li> Nice to only have to straighten my bangs once per wash instead of every day.</li>
            <li> and recently my sister has been seeing how straight and healthy my hair has been looking so she has been using it most of the time as well</li>
            <li> so worth it.</li>
            <li> I borrowed this from a friend and ended up buying my own after I have it back.</li>
            <li> I love the multiple settings and the way it glides so smoothly through my hair.</li>
            <li> This straightener heats up super fast and is super hot!</li>
            <li> It does straighten the hair quickly but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do a good job of smoothing down the frizz.</li>
            <li> loved this flat iron so much, that when my niece asked for one for this Christmas, I immediatly looked on Amazon for the Infinity Pro, found it, ordered it and can&#x27;t wait to give it to her.  </li>
            <li> What is so special is that after they shower &amp; wash out there hair, it still stays soft, manageable &amp; super tamed!</li>
            <li> This is one  amazing flat iron.  </li>
            <li> The CHI line came highly recommended but I really didn&#x27;t want to shell out over $100 for something I wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li> Also because they are so smooth and do not get hot spots and scorched or burnt, any residue from styling product is so easily cleanable (I used to have major problems cleaning the gunk off my metal plated straighteners).</li>
            <li> Sometimes when I&#x27;m traveling I need to shove the straightening iron in a bag right after it has been on,</li>
            <li> The plug on this doesn&#x27;t seem to be the right size.</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life, I have truly straight hair without the ends looking like I stuck my finger in a light socket.  </li>
            <li> it was super light, it heated up so fast, much faster then</li>
            <li> Even with my hair a little damp, it still does an amazing job, AND dries my hair!</li>
            <li> The only negative is that the plates don&#x27;t fit together perfectly</li>
            <li> By far the best flatiron I&#x27;ve used and at such a low price.  </li>
            <li> This flat iron is by far one of the best out there especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> the only thing i love about this flat iron is the floating plates you can really do a nice curl at the end of your hair and it stays.</li>
            <li> I like my Flat iron, heats well, and very fast too, am sure i will enjoy using it, really like it.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how quickly it was ready to go on a time-crunched</li>
            <li> Not to mention my moms got a $300 straightener that doesn&#x27;t work half as good.</li>
            <li> it straightens super fast and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair with a burnt smell.</li>
            <li> Heats super fast and does the job without ruining my hair.</li>
            <li> , I get done super fast</li>
            <li> Anyways I would recommend this flat iron to people who are looking for a cheap but good to use flat iron.</li>
            <li> Did not like this iron very much...</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable too so no Cons to report.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> It gets super hot (up to 455 degrees) which gets my hair really straight, really fast!</li>
            <li> I am glad I did not spend very much on these, but still would like my money back.</li>
            <li> Gets really hot and doesnt fry your hair.</li>
            <li> Love the different settings.</li>
            <li> It straightened it the first time around.</li>
            <li> so you better believe that it&#x27;s as humid as it possibly can be.</li>
            <li> Mine first one was given to me</li>
            <li> but only when i grab more than an inch of my hair.</li>
            <li> Temperature settings are more than enough.</li>
            <li> It can get as hot as you need it to be.</li>
            <li> I was expecting higher quality than I received.</li>
            <li> and it is perfectly hot.</li>
            <li> (first time I&#x27;ve ever had one</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not at all pleased with this product but don&#x27;t care enough to return it.</li>
            <li> this way I don&#x27;t worry about it being too hot in there.</li>
            <li> Please note that I do not use it daily as I love my curls.</li>
            <li> so I originally picked up a cheap pair of Revlon flat irons...</li>
            <li> these guys heat up insanely fast, don&#x27;t lose heat and work as well as my GHD&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> It gets my hair do straight which allows me to go even longer without getting a relaxer!</li>
            <li> and i first tryed hers</li>
            <li> Gets hot as soon as u turn it on.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to yell at my kiddo to watch out for it when she comes in and out of the bathroom 20 times while I&#x27;m getting ready!</li>
            <li> The chi works better, but costs double the price of this item.  </li>
            <li> I think what did the trick for me was a higher heat setting.</li>
            <li> which pretty much holds the heat in the blades!</li>
            <li> Heats up really fast!</li>
            <li> I also recommend using it with \\&quot;Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Hot off the Press\\&quot; or \\&quot;Frizz Ease Heat</li>
            <li> I had owned a really large Conair straightener that was given to me about 5 years ago that is silver and very large and bulky</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth and definitely gets very hot, very fast.</li>
            <li> Makes hair straight super fast</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never bought any other kind.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I bought this flat iron for $45 .</li>
            <li> However, I must say, I do love this flat iron and tend to either grab this one or the other Conair infiniti one I own, which has longer plates.</li>
            <li> It works way better than any flat iron I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> It was quite quick to get here for here before the new year.</li>
            <li> It also stays super straight until you wash your hair, and I live in Miami!</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid $100 dollars more for flat irons and this one beats them!  </li>
            <li> My hair has NEVER been so smooth and soft, not to mention straight.</li>
            <li> I have used the Chi straightener also, and think that this one is just as good as the more expensive ones.  </li>
            <li> My first appliance was bought at a salon for over $100 dollars where I first had my hair done straight.</li>
            <li> Inifinit Pro works best if you make sure your hair is completely dry and flat iron in small sections.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this flat iron!!!</li>
            <li> I use a straightener pretty much every day</li>
            <li> and it got my hair pretty straight.  </li>
            <li> I stopped using this straightener a long time ago and purchased a better one.</li>
            <li> but it still gets just as hot just as fast.</li>
            <li> I borrowed my friends Flat iron and didn&#x27;t want to give it back because it is so damn good...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just as good as the Chi if not better.</li>
            <li> The holder is really handy too because it keeps the blades together when I put it down</li>
            <li> The adjustable heat settings is a blessing because in days where my hair is a little more frizzier than some the heat helps!</li>
            <li> but the reviews were right, this is a fantastic flat iron!</li>
            <li> When I use it on my dry hair I always make sure to use some type of heat protectant like tresseme or whatever.</li>
            <li> I have very short hair, and its size allows me to straighten my fringe quite easily.</li>
            <li> Hair also feels super soft.</li>
            <li> As a single mom the price and quality of these irons couldn&#x27;t get any better</li>
            <li> If you follow the rules and don&#x27;t try to straighten too large of a section at a time you will get the results you desire.</li>
            <li> if your hair isn&#x27;t exactly on those plates it gets caught on the sides of the iron, I tried another section thinking I just didn&#x27;t brush my hair good enough and it ripped that one even harder out of my head..</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first about buying this brand, because it was not the fancy one used in salons (the more popular brand)anyway to my surprise</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron!!!!!</li>
            <li> I do have very fine strands of hair,but can be very wavy and sometimes very curly if I go to sleep with wet hair.</li>
            <li> I think the smaller one inch actually works better!  </li>
            <li> It certainly heats up fast and</li>
            <li> I am happy to say I have had the same results from the green Infiniti.  </li>
            <li> so I bought the Conair Infiniti that is much cheaper.</li>
            <li> It also heats up fast.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for it much.</li>
            <li> Since I bought it in June, I&#x27;ve gotten to use it all summer through the humidity, heat and sweat and my hair was still straight at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> really works.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair really shiny and straight and it won&#x27;t frizz.  </li>
            <li> It stays straight for days ...</li>
            <li> After very apologetically explaining what I had done to her, I did some research and found this one.</li>
            <li> I have naturally straight hair, so I bought this to curl my hair with.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever find one that I&#x27;d like as much as that one.</li>
            <li> It really does heat up in seconds.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> so I leave it on the lowest setting and it works very well.  </li>
            <li> It still makes my hair TOO straight, like it&#x27;s trying to escape my face.</li>
            <li> I use this guy so much</li>
            <li> and she thanks me</li>
            <li> It comes highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> n doesnt do too much damage on ur hair.</li>
            <li> my hair gets from curly to straight so fast.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to spend close to $100 on a straightener that I wasn&#x27;t going to use that much, so I bought this straightener for 1/3rd of the price I would spend on a $100 straightener.  </li>
            <li> It is naturally very wavy and curly</li>
            <li> hair feels shiny and healhtier, it heats up fast like it when im on a hurry</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper on Amazon than the drug store.</li>
            <li> It heat up really in 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> and it still works very well.</li>
            <li> I can straighten it stick straight in about 20 minutes and it stays and without using any product!!!!I can&#x27;t preach</li>
            <li> I would much rather spend $100</li>
            <li> My hair type is semi-straight and this product works really well.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and hold hair well.</li>
            <li> I was ready to make a trip to the salon, until I received this straightener for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I recommend unplugging this when not in use as it feels slightly warm to the touch in some areas if it&#x27;s left plugged in, even days after it was last used.</li>
            <li> You have to make sure to hold the top of the flat iron tight.</li>
            <li> I should also say that I live in very *very* humid south Florida</li>
            <li> I love my new flat iron!!!</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly, with multiple digitally-displayed heat settings that go all the way up to 455 degrees – this gets REALLY hot.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried much more expensive flat irons before, this could be a great alternative.</li>
            <li> one is more curlier than the other.</li>
            <li> One good thing is that it kept my bands straight longer than my other flat iron.</li>
            <li> This one actually makes my hair look like I have super silky glassy smooth &amp;#34;asian&amp;#34; hair (got wavy latina hair) :P I did burn the top of my ear though, and kind of annoying, when you close iron, it only touches at the first half.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic flat iron!</li>
            <li> Plus they&#x27;re SO cheap for a decent flat iron!</li>
            <li> its so fast to heat and leaves my hair very soft and shiny, also protects hair against humidity and frizz better than other...</li>
            <li> My boyfriend talked me out of buying a very expensive hair straightener at the mall, and I am very pleased that he showed me this one on Amazon!!!!</li>
            <li> highly recommend this flat iron and suggest using thermal gloves (I do) if you require high heat because you WILL burn your free hand after a couple of passes.</li>
            <li> &gt; The only thing not so nice, is the black case that comes with this straightener to store while hot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this straightener for over 4 years now and it works like its brand new!</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron because it can straight my hair for only 10-15 mins  </li>
            <li> [I&#x27;m talkin&#x27; an hour and a half or more] and</li>
            <li> After researching many expensive models, I am glad that I chose this one.</li>
            <li> I replaced an older Infiniti that started shorting after 6+ years.</li>
            <li> It has multiple heat settings and gets very hot without burning your hair.</li>
            <li> My old hai brand would leave the hair thick, full of static &amp; would rise up in humidity by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> But you don&#x27;t have to put it that high if you don&#x27;t want it that high.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have high expectations</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Bought this my 11 grade year in high school at a CVS.</li>
            <li> Wish I had it in high school</li>
            <li> (No need for high settings)</li>
            <li> i totally recommend this product after going through many flat irons</li>
            <li> To reduce hair damage, make sure you use a heat protectant before flat ironing your hair, such as CHI Silk Infusion or CHI 44 Iron Guard Thermal Protection.</li>
            <li> that make&#x27;s your hair shine and hold moisture in before i use this super hair frying flat iron.</li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t wow me</li>
            <li> I could never get my naturally curly hair straight enough to make it worth it</li>
            <li> A very very hot flat iron.</li>
            <li> At first use, this product was a LOT better than other drug store flat irons I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> For the price even if it burns out in a short while it will be worth replacing.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my hair straight and smooth in less than 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> It heats up really quickly and is makes my hair very shiny and straight in less than 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking for a new brand...</li>
            <li> It still feels brand new.</li>
            <li> I bought the 1 1/2\\&quot; Conair Infiniti Pro straightener (the hot pink one) first and was AMAZED at the difference.</li>
            <li> I used this straightener for the first time last night</li>
            <li> It completely transformed my hair!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I stopped straightening for a while because I was trying to be natural, but for some reason I decided to look into getting a new straightener.</li>
            <li> I have damaged my hair before from using a flat iron that was too hot and didn&#x27;t have any lower settings.</li>
            <li> Works really well on my super frizzy hard to straighten hair, even when i don&#x27;t blow dry it straight first.</li>
            <li> With this one, it only takes about 15 minutes and it is so much straighter than with my old one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been attempting to straighten my hair since I was 16 years old and am now 27.</li>
            <li> busy morning.</li>
            <li> and so far it hasn&#x27;t broke yet.</li>
            <li> and I have to say I am surprised by the results.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how well it worked for the price.</li>
            <li> This is the same width, but much lighter and easier to work with.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve had it close to a month</li>
            <li> My hair is very curly but his iron on only the second setting leaves my hair shiny and straight for days.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s really said to me that i have to double up.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> I always thought that you get what you pay for as far as straighteners as concerned but this completely changed my outlook...</li>
            <li> and I finally decided I cannot be bothered to spend so much money over and over again on a straightener.</li>
            <li> I also ordered the Infiniti Professional Nano Tourmaline Ceramic Curling Iron</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s baby soft after.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, shiny and feels so weightless, I can&#x27;t wait for my husband to come home and see it:)&lt;br</li>
            <li> 3 DAYS LATER STILL STRAIGHT AFTER SLEEPING ON IT, RUNNING, DANCING &amp; SHAKING IT ALL ABOUT.</li>
            <li> Though curling is not a problem except now they have soft waves of curls.</li>
            <li> then 3 females battling over a straightener early in the morning, when you want to leave the hotel room.o experiences with burning</li>
            <li> Leaves my thick hair strait for days I love it.</li>
            <li> and my hair is so thick, but I was so pleased once I used it.</li>
            <li> I have owned numerous other straighteners in many different brands and models.</li>
            <li> Second setting gets my hair straight really fast, within 5 minutes I&#x27;d say, however it does tend to work a lil too well (A little hot for my hair).</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money on a expensive straightenerthis one works wonders and has a great price ;-)  </li>
            <li> This flat iron kept them straight</li>
            <li> i find that i have to use another flat iron with real ceramic plates.</li>
            <li> and i don&#x27;t have to flat iron a section 3 times to get it straight.</li>
            <li> This flat iron heats up fast and straightens with a curl at the end which is how I style it.  </li>
            <li> I never had much luck with the cheap-o flat iron I&#x27;ve had for years</li>
            <li> Even after the time I&#x27;ve had this one, I still only need to put it on the first or second heat setting.</li>
            <li> I even use it on my 6 yr old sons long curly hair when he wants boy band hair.</li>
            <li> However, within the first month of daily use, mine stopped letting me choose my setting and would only go on the highest setting every time I turned it on.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to get a hair straightener that really worked and would not fry my hair or just do half the job.</li>
            <li> I only need to put mine on the second setting (338 degrees) for it to do a good job, and I have very thick wavy/curly hair.  </li>
            <li> It pulls on my hair (OW!) takes a while to heat up, damages it to the nth degree, takes a really, really really long time to straighten my whole head</li>
            <li> My hair will stay straight for as long as I don&#x27;t wash it.</li>
            <li> I bought another flat iron for like 20 dollars but only got as hot as 375 and did nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li> (you don&#x27;t need to pass through parts of your hair more than 1-3 times, depends how fast &amp; how much hair you pull through, go slow with small sections &amp; get done quicker).</li>
            <li> So I just now tried my brand new Ifiniti Pro that came to me last week....</li>
            <li> I have fairly uncooperative hair and my last straightening iron was all but useless.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this flat iron!</li>
            <li> Infiniti Instant Heat Pure Ceramic 1 Inch Tourmaline Ceramic Flat Iron</li>
            <li> Works like no other</li>
            <li> First, I have extremely frizzy, curly hair.</li>
            <li> High temperature settings are necessary if you do keratin treatments at home but not all flat irons provide high enough heat.</li>
            <li> For a little added fun, it works for curling the ends up, too.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to get your fist around it securely.</li>
            <li> My only regret is that when I bought this I did not realize that it came in a 2 inch size, which I most certainly would have purchased instead since the 1 inch size is so small and takes longer to use (the reason for the missing star).</li>
            <li> We have had a very rainy summer in Florida this year but no freeze with the pink Infiniti Pro by Conair.  </li>
            <li> This one, though, I can have my hair straight in roughly 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> I had an old conair straightener that lasted me almost 10 years before it finally went out on me.</li>
            <li> This product worked so well and left my hair feeling soft and conditioned</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned and tired so many</li>
            <li> My hair as well is thick and it lives it silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I have long, dark Indian hair that is SUPER frizzy.</li>
            <li> After two less than stellar experiences with chi straighteners</li>
            <li> (note: my hair is naturally blonde, not black).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for the cheapest flat iron online and so far I found the conair one .</li>
            <li> The old flat iron i had was a con air as well , but it wouldn&#x27;t straighten my hair like this one does.</li>
            <li> I have natural African-American hair and this flat iron does wonders.</li>
            <li> With my old flat iron it took about 30 minutes to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly but the curls are loose and large, so kinkier hair might not last as long.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair and it straightens really well and fast.</li>
            <li> and I never really used it because it was difficult to handle and did not seem to ever do a good job on my hair</li>
            <li> First of all, this straightener is a beautiful shade of peacock blue, however I am a little disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I had been using a $15 cheap flat iron for the past ten years.  </li>
            <li> Normally it used to take me near an hour to straighten, but with this straightener it took half that time.</li>
            <li> This less expensive flat iron had great reviews</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my only complaint, but a huge pain if you&#x27;re in the middle of straightening a client&#x27;s hair that is thick/coarse.</li>
            <li> I have used numerous other straighteners that snagged (in spaces between the plates), broke and damaged my hair, and since using this my hair looks so much healthier</li>
            <li> The only problem is that after some moderate use, the blue paint near the plates starts to melt/peel away.</li>
            <li> It never fails that after a few months it just dies, but that didn&#x27;t matter to me bc</li>
            <li> First one I had to return because it would not clamp down flat on my hair.  </li>
            <li> After a few months I&#x27;ve notice that from reinserting the top &amp; bottom part of the barrel has some of the paint chipped away from use, and is not very nice looking.</li>
            <li> It heats up and cools down fast.</li>
            <li> is that even when i put it on the lowest setting it made my hair super dull looking it did not shine.</li>
            <li> My hair is super thick</li>
            <li> So I took a chance based on other reviews and WOW!!</li>
            <li> tried it on my daughter’s hair, freeze, and thick, long, short and it lives it silky smooth.</li>
            <li> It takes my hair from big and puffy to straight as a pin in less than 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> hair is naturally thick and frizzy in the front-but NOT Any more, also it took half the time to straighten it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have super thick, coarse, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> The product has a long warranty, but I have to pay to ship it back, pay $7.50 for the opportunity, and be without a straightener for however long it takes to receive a new one.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, thin, and wavy/curly.</li>
            <li> Now their hair are super soft, sleek thin &amp; tamed, they left their hair unwashed for 3 days test (</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and frizzy, with my old revlon iron, I can iron my hair in 1hr and still not satisfied with the result, with Infiniti Pro by Conair, I can get it straight in 15 mins, like really straight, and shiny and soft if I may</li>
            <li> I spent a large sum of money on a \\&quot;professional\\&quot; straightener from a salon about a year ago, and that was a complete waste of money now that I have tried this one.</li>
            <li> After decades of trying unsuccessfully to tame it (curling irons, blow dryers, hot rollers, perms and relaxers), I finally decided to buy a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> so it cools down to a normal temperature.</li>
            <li> I haver SUPER thick and long hair</li>
            <li> Really helped tame my morning hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got all the above and this flat iron actually works!!  </li>
            <li> I initially bought this flat iron for myself back in 2012</li>
            <li> So I purchased this because it is the only one I found that has the highest setting that really does the job for anyone with super hard to straightened thick hair.</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve only used Conair flat irons...</li>
            <li> I have very thick, very curly, very frizzy, very long hair.</li>
            <li> Straightens course very thick hair with ease and less static.</li>
            <li> I recommend this Flat Iron to anyone and everyone.</li>
            <li> I like this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I took it upon myself to cancel her order of yet another $140 flat iron.</li>
            <li> I had the Babyliss flat iron, which cost me $100 bucks.</li>
            <li> so I purchased the Conair Infiniti flat iron, for $22.  </li>
            <li> and I tell them I curl my hair with my flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I used the &#x27;Infinity pro&#x27; flat iron at my cousin&#x27;s house, and couldn&#x27;t believe the results.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even wanted to use my flat iron since using hers.</li>
            <li> This flat iron was on sale for $20.00 when I bought it and its def.</li>
            <li> Taking care of this iron, I expect it to last a long time.</li>
            <li> I had a conair flat iron before this</li>
            <li> I am not saying this flat iron works as well as one in the $150 range, but it is dern close and at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t flat iron my hair</li>
            <li> so I started researching quality flat irons on line.  </li>
            <li> AS LONG AS I WOULD ALLOW) to see if it would last</li>
            <li> I just purchased this flat iron after my Remington flat iron died (after a couple of years of use).</li>
            <li> After about 8 months of once a week use, it stopped working for no apparent reason.</li>
            <li> My girls prefer 455 for their thick hair at first.</li>
            <li> It causes so much less frizz than my old straightener</li>
            <li> After only a month of use, this straightener looks like it is a few years old.</li>
            <li> I have really thick asian hair which gets really wavy .</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t sizzle and fry your hair if it&#x27;s a little damp like my old one did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half Italian and half Native American and my hair is naturally frizzy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through every hair straightener imaginable (cheap and expensive) and this one beats them all.</li>
            <li> My sister refuses to use any other flat iron outside of this one.</li>
            <li> I have long, curly/wavy hair and this straightener</li>
            <li> I never really got the chance to test it because this iron constantly snagged my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been searching for a good-quality straightener that wouldn&#x27;t break the bank for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I wish I had got this thing a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I didn’t have to use the max temp for our thick hair, so far only the second temp takes care of the job.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat Iron when my other ceramic flat iron blew</li>
            <li> So I definitely recommend it especially if you have a tight budget.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that is very hard to completely straighten.</li>
            <li> Not only did it remove all the wave from my hair (which is medium to long length, very thick, very coarse, and extremely wavy and poofy) but it stayed straight all day.</li>
            <li> It took a very long time to do my hair.</li>
            <li> Has several protective grips to squeeze the iron closed and keep it from slipping or burning you.  </li>
            <li> Not even a little rain makes it curl back up, only getting it fully wet starts it over.</li>
            <li> The one problem I have with other flat irons is that they will snag my hair and the coating always starts to fleck away.  </li>
            <li> It is loose on every socket we have tried, including hotels.</li>
            <li> It damaged my hair, didn&#x27;t heat well, and got dirty very quickly.</li>
            <li> It does have a tip on the end that hangs out past the plates, so there&#x27;s a place to put your left fingers without getting them burned when using it to curl your hair--this is a big plus.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I like is the little cover you can place the iron in.</li>
            <li> We both have very thick, coarse hair with a natural wave</li>
            <li> I needed a flat iron that I could use in Europe, and I bought this because the product description says \\&quot;Auto off-dual voltage.\\&quot; Not true; I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li> To start off, I have thin naturally very frizzy/wavy hair.</li>
            <li> but unlike the picture or any descriptions say I received a pink straightener.</li>
            <li> The pink is for breast cancer awareness</li>
            <li> and I like the color pink</li>
            <li> Personally, I&#x27;m content with my blow dryer and round brush.</li>
            <li> Only had it a few months</li>
            <li> It keeps slipping out of the wall when the cord is wiggled.</li>
            <li> My daughters constantly turns off on her as she&#x27;s using it because the plug does not fit snugly in the socket.</li>
            <li> i hv natural thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have to the middle of my back unbelievably thick hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty thin, so I keep the temp turned down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been straightening my hair for about ten years now, and my natural hair is SO hard to tame.</li>
            <li> I have tried tons of flat irons snd have never found one that did half the job of this one!</li>
            <li> I used to blow dry it, take an in-styler and/or another straightener over it, half to put tons of product on it and it would be all wavy and sometimes frizzy.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely fuzzy and curly.</li>
            <li> hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this with my wet hair and it does well, just watch out for the steam!  </li>
            <li> Oh yeah, and the other day I noticed my straightener smelled like burnt hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through the gambit of flat irons from the cheap to the expensive, from wide to thin</li>
            <li> I usually turn it on, go turn on some music, come back to my bathroom</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t damaged it like other cheaper hair straighteners.</li>
            <li> Other than that I haven&#x27;t used it yet</li>
            <li> On other websites and Conair&#x27;s sight they were charging around $40.00.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> anything higher--be careful!  </li>
            <li> And you can make loose, tight or wavy curly</li>
            <li> The second one was still slightly uneven which forces you to squeeze extra hard for it to clamp down well.  </li>
            <li> I actually have several flat irons (weird I know) ..</li>
            <li> and I was reluctant to try it because what does a dude who has very little hair know about flat irons.  </li>
            <li> I have thin, naturally wavy hair</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s more annoying than flattering.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone with thick or coarse hair!</li>
            <li> &amp; I will be purchasing another because nothing is worse then 3 females battling over a straightener early in the morning, when you want to leave the hotel room.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry about where or how I put it down or if my cats are going to get to it.</li>
            <li> I have thick and extremely wavy hair and only takes a few minutes to straighten it.  </li>
            <li> I previously owned a chi straightener.</li>
            <li> and I have fewer split ends and less heat damage.</li>
            <li> and I can straighten it in under half an hour.</li>
            <li> so I looked at my straightener and pulled out a charred black piece of hair.</li>
            <li> Straightens my hair in less than 5 mins.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about a year and a half and use it about every day.</li>
            <li> It broke in less than a year.</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t particularly hard to straighten or curl, so when I straighten/curl my hair, it will stay that way until my next wash (I usually wash my hair every other day).  </li>
            <li> You see, my hair is thick, curly, and unruly (just for comparison, my hair in a ponytail is as thick as an adults wrist, and not   a skinny adult&#x27;s wrist either).</li>
            <li> My prefer setting is 419 for my long down to my butt thick &amp; wavy hair</li>
            <li> I spent less than half of what I usually do on a Chi</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the only way for me to yield my results, and get the super shiny stepped out the salon look with this horrible flat iron.</li>
            <li> Sadly I am gonna have to get a new one</li>
            <li> With this straightener I&#x27;ve gotten my routine down to 20 minutes or less!  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I waited too long and it is no longer possible to do so.</li>
            <li> Thin enough to get down to the roots.  </li>
            <li> soon cause the plates are a little worn out</li>
            <li> and it would literally take hours to get my hair even a little &amp;#34;straight.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> It served its purpose, but it was just a little slower at straightening my hair than I thought.</li>
            <li> The little thing that comes with so you can put it away</li>
            <li> I also like the little holder it comes with.</li>
            <li> For the reviewer who complained that the irons don&#x27;t squeeze completely closed - I can see a minuscule little gap, but holy heck - there ought to be room for your hair.  </li>
            <li> I used it for a short period of time and got tired of it always pulling my hair out.</li>
            <li> I had a few girls at the office ask me what size barrel curling iron I use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used very expensive straighteners for years (Chi, Corioliss) and this is the first \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; straightener I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> I got it a few days ago</li>
            <li> About a year ago my not o great straightener finally broke.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy or clunky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just coming to grab another because mine is temporarily misplaced.</li>
            <li> I had a chi for 4 years and even then it took a lot of effort to tame my maine.</li>
            <li> Just spray a little in while your hair is damp, brush your hair, and then straighten as usual.</li>
            <li> the iron parts didn&#x27;t clench together all the way and it singed my hair pretty bad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m terrible about losing things, so over the past 5 years I&#x27;ve gone through more than the average</li>
            <li> My hair is also very dry and it doesn&#x27;t make it worse like my Chi did.</li>
            <li> Even if it only lasts a year like all the expensive ones seem to, I&#x27;ll have no problem replacing it for her at this price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s insane to me, whose hair looks like it was rubbed by a static balloon the moment I step into any bit of moisture.</li>
            <li> No more 3 and 4 passes to get the job done.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews</li>
            <li> and it worked just as well (if not better, IMO).</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying this because it&#x27;s only an inch</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s UNBELIEVABLE....</li>
            <li> No more frizzes or curling up</li>
            <li> At the moment my hair is longer than it has ever been, because I usually chop it off to reduce straightening time.</li>
            <li> If you are having a hard time with straightening your thick, tight curls, untamed kinky hair (like my daughter)</li>
            <li> If you are having a hard time with straightening your thick, tight curls, untamed kinky hair (like my daughter)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing this problem comes from lack of negative ions(?)</li>
            <li> It heats up almost instantly (at least on the lowest setting, which is all I need.)</li>
            <li> I have unmanageable, thick, wiry, curly, shoulder length hair.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not too thick</li>
            <li> Thick hair?</li>
            <li> and i have thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> and I hate that I can&#x27;t have it as much as i want  </li>
            <li> Thankfully my mane is thick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lasted me all throughout high-school and 3 years past it now and it still works just as well as it did when I got it!</li>
            <li> It is a little awkward to hold compared to the Chi, I think because it&#x27;s a little slimmer</li>
            <li> It is NOT good for girls with outrageously thick and curly hair.  </li>
            <li> It feels and performs like a very expensive iron, but was only $26</li>
            <li> Ok, I know that once you have your heart set on an item, you hate to hear bad reviews about it.</li>
            <li> Seriously, you should get one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;No, seriously.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible to read the temperature settings as the numbers are very tiny.</li>
            <li> I had a CHI before that did a poor, slow, job</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had crazy heavy thick corse hair all my life and have been using straighteners since I was 12 (21 now).</li>
            <li> This one definitely hasn&#x27;t disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I had a Chi and then another expensive straightener in the past and both broke within a year.</li>
            <li> (I have very thick hair).</li>
            <li> #34;man, this is going to take forever.&amp;#34; as I have very thick, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> They both have very thick hair</li>
            <li> Either we got a defective product or it&#x27;s really poorly made.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair</li>
            <li> It makes my hair much sleeker and softer, and can stand up to the horrible Houston humidity.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not too thin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sturdy and hasn&#x27;t broken yet or had any issues</li>
            <li> &amp; I will be purchasing another because nothing is worse</li>
            <li> seriously 100% recommend!</li>
            <li> and sometimes I want a dramatic change</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE $200 CHI OR OTHER EXPENSIVE CRAP!!!</li>
            <li> This cuts my styling time by 60% at least!!</li>
            <li> I had an expensive straightener that broke.</li>
            <li> Conair has yet to fail me.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, when the 12&#x27; waves started hitting the ship, it hit the floor and cracked one of the plates.</li>
            <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I skeptically bought this one</li>
            <li> but this weird brown stuff builds up on the sides of the plates and the color is chipping off.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to buy the crazy expensive straighteners....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy.</li>
            <li> and I was desperate</li>
            <li> If at any point it stops working I won&#x27;t be so mad</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s had very expensive ones.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not so bad</li>
            <li> this you will not be disappointed</li>
            <li> If you need hotter temperatures for your hair type, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement  and am so disappointed in it.</li>
            <li> BUMMER :(</li>
            <li> I hated it.</li>
            <li> Grab this iron, you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> The design is horrible.</li>
            <li> and it was horrible.</li>
            <li> and I think it was the worst hair straightener that I have ever owned.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> A very very hot flat iron. Can&#x27;t use the last two settings because it cinged the ends of my bands it also keep leaving waves in my bands. One good thing is that it kept my bands straight longer than my other flat iron. Any hint of sweat or rain curls my band instantly. This flat iron kept them straight</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a year now and its still working perfectly! I love how I can use it as a straightener and a curler. I&#x27;ve tried much more expensive flat irons before, this could be a great alternative. Works as good!</li>
            <li> I previously owned a chi straightener. Loved it. When it broke I needed to replace it but didn&#x27;t have enough money so I bought the Conair Infiniti that is much cheaper. I love it!!! It straightens faster and hair stays straighter longer. The temperature on the straightener gets to I think 455 degrees. But you don&#x27;t have to put it that high if you don&#x27;t want it that high. It also heats up fast. Love it.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply manufactured, hair keeps getting snagged in the ends of the plate. Does not give the nice silky texture even with the best styling product on your hair. It is probably ok for 1 st time buyers to try something for cheap.</li>
            <li> Works well. Gets really hot and doesnt fry your hair. Love the different settings. I have thick wavy hair and it straightens really well and fast.</li>
            <li> This is my third straightener, and it will probably be my last.  It&#x27;s priced right, it heats up quickly, and it works well.  I have thick and extremely wavy hair and only takes a few minutes to straighten it.  Love it so much, I bought a second one for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Did not like this iron very much... the iron parts didn&#x27;t clench together all the way and it singed my hair pretty bad and I didn&#x27;t even have it on the highest setting. I didn&#x27;t care for it much.</li>
            <li> Heating well, price was good, in good working condition, was brand new and look just as in picture. Overall please with product. Will recommend.</li>
            <li> Bought this in pink before and it worked great to straighten my very frizzy hair.  We have had a very rainy summer in Florida this year but no freeze with the pink Infiniti Pro by Conair.  I am happy to say I have had the same results from the green Infiniti.  Remember to always purchase the one with the Tourmaline plates.  The price is very reasonable too so no Cons to report.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> Man this is amazing.  Great with my hair.  N i hv natural thick hair. Works like no other :) buy this one</li>
            <li> To start off, I have thin naturally very frizzy/wavy hair. I&#x27;ve been attempting to straighten my hair since I was 16 years old and am now 27. I&#x27;ve had more straighteners and chemicals on my hair than I can count and let me tell you... this thing works!! I bought it when my last one died, so I went to the store with the attitude of  &amp;#34;Oh what piece of junk will I end up with this time, since nothing works anyway?&#x27;  I&#x27;ve had it since June and it is now October and No complaints whats so ever. My hair has NEVER been so smooth and soft, not to mention straight. People that have known me for years starting asking me all the time if I got my hair done. Since I bought it in June, I&#x27;ve gotten to use it all summer through the humidity, heat and sweat and my hair was still straight at the end of the day. (Humidity used to kill my hair) It heats up super fast with high heat settings and comes with a nice holder that keeps the heat off of the bathroom counter. They better never stop making this!!!!!  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!</li>
            <li> I got this straightener for Christmas and it&#x27;s awesome so far!!! I use a straightener pretty much every day so I needed one that was durable and good. It was very good! It heated up very fast! It straightened really good too! The multiple heat setting made it good for any hair! My hair is fine, thin, and wavy/curly. It straightened it the first time around. To get it to absolute perfection you might want to do it once or twice but otherwise amazing results!! It causes so much less frizz than my old straightener and it is amazing! Fast heat-up, does an amazing job, and looks great! I loooove this straightener! I would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> Heats up almost instantly. I couldn&#x27;t believe how quickly it was ready to go on a time-crunched busy morning. Really helped tame my morning hair. Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have long, dark Indian hair that is SUPER frizzy. On top of that I AM in India right now and it&#x27;s monsoon season so you better believe that it&#x27;s as humid as it possibly can be. This straighter does an excellent job of taking care of the frizz and making my hair smooth and manageable. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have had many flat irons, by many makers including Golden Hot, Ion, and CHI. This iron is the best, it doesnt get too hot because it has multiple heat settings, and it also doesnt fry your hair. I dont think i&#x27;ll ever trade it in....</li>
            <li> Overall I would have to say this straighterner is a very good product. I have been straightening my hair for almost 10 years, and this is by far the best straightener I have used. The plates are smooth and glassy (being ceramic and all) and they heat up evenly and do a great job. Also because they are so smooth and do not get hot spots and scorched or burnt, any residue from styling product is so easily cleanable (I used to have major problems cleaning the gunk off my metal plated straighteners). I have used numerous other straighteners that snagged (in spaces between the plates), broke and damaged my hair, and since using this my hair looks so much healthier and I have fewer split ends and less heat damage. My only regret is that when I bought this I did not realize that it came in a 2 inch size, which I most certainly would have purchased instead since the 1 inch size is so small and takes longer to use (the reason for the missing star). I highly recommend this product even more than some straighteners I have bought from beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li> My mom had this iron, and I used it one day and was AMAZED! You still need to put in heat protectant spray/straightening cream and straighten your hair in layers if it&#x27;s thick, but it does a great job!  I went out and got myself one and the 1\\&quot; curling wand in the same brand.</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve only used Conair flat irons... It never fails that after a few months it just dies, but that didn&#x27;t matter to me bc these irons have always done a great job until today!! I bought this one at Wal-Mart, just tried it and it&#x27;s already back in its package to be returned... I did one section and it ripped my hair out, if your hair isn&#x27;t exactly on those plates it gets caught on the sides of the iron, I tried another section thinking I just didn&#x27;t brush my hair good enough and it ripped that one even harder out of my head.. I still have chills from the pain... As a single mom the price and quality of these irons couldn&#x27;t get any better but after this s*** I&#x27;m looking for a new brand...</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron! Great choice of heat settings and my hair stays straight throughout the day even in horrible humidity! Better than one&#x27;s I&#x27;ve paid twice as much for.</li>
            <li> First one I had to return because it would not clamp down flat on my hair.  The second one was still slightly uneven which forces you to squeeze extra hard for it to clamp down well.  Not the quality I was hoping for but it&#x27;ll do until I find something better.</li>
            <li> This is a great straightener.  I have long, curly/wavy hair and this straightener really works.  It heats up quickly and it straightens hair quickly as well.  It leaves my hair really shiny and straight and it won&#x27;t frizz.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The straightner is fine.  I have thin, naturally wavy hair and it got my hair pretty straight.  I thought it would make it more smooth, but it didn&#x27;t. I  had to brush my hair before and after I used the straightner to achieve the silky feel I wanted.  Other than that, It was fine. Oh, I had to use it on the second to highest heat or the highest for it to straighten my hair quicky.</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely fuzzy and curly. This product can heat quickly but it makes my hair even drier than before.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron. Mine first one was given to me and I&#x27;ve never bought any other kind. I&#x27;ve had mine for about 5 years and I&#x27;m just now buying my second one! I recommend this Flat Iron to anyone and everyone.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter because it has the features that are most important too me (the ceramic plates, auto shut-off, rapid heat, no-tangle cord). She has been very pleased with it, particularly with how rapidly it heats and how quickly it straightens her hair.</li>
            <li> Works fine, but the plates don&#x27;t quite touch, so it does catch my hair sometimes (I have very thick hair). If you can afford a better one then don&#x27;t skimp, but otherwise this is good value.</li>
            <li> This straightener is awesome and especially great for the price. I haver SUPER thick and long hair and I can straighten it in under half an hour. Everyone always says it looks great.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron!!!!! It doesn&#x27;t take long to heat up and it does a real good job making my hair look shiny and bouncy when I straight it after it&#x27;s been curly !!!!</li>
            <li> I had an expensive straightener that broke. I bought an inexpensive one at a local store. I hated it. It damaged my hair, didn&#x27;t heat well, and got dirty very quickly. It took a very long time to do my hair. After reading reviews for this one, I decided to take a chance on it. It is great! It heats up very quickly. Works great on my fine hair. This is as good as a very high end straightener. The stand is a great bonus.</li>
            <li> Works awesome for my very thick and wavy hair. My hair is also very dry and it doesn&#x27;t make it worse like my Chi did.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled like I was. I needed a flat iron that I could use in Europe, and I bought this because the product description says \\&quot;Auto off-dual voltage.\\&quot; Not true; I&#x27;m returning it. I hope Amazon corrects this error.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for the cheapest flat iron online and so far I found the conair one . I&#x27;m really glad I bought this flat iron for $45 . I have really thick asian hair which gets really wavy . I love this flat iron because it can straight my hair for only 10-15 mins  but sometimes my hair gets stuck between the plates but only when i grab more than an inch of my hair. I&#x27;m also glad it has a swivel cord and a place to put your hand at the top of the flat iron. Ive had this for 1 yr now and so far it hasn&#x27;t broke yet. It can also curl my hair which I really love the most . Anyways I would recommend this flat iron to people who are looking for a cheap but good to use flat iron.</li>
            <li> I never really got the chance to test it because this iron constantly snagged my hair. I ordered two of them when they were on sale one was for my sister, but I sent them back the next day.</li>
            <li> I own a chi ordered this as a backup . But after I tried it the chi is my backup this flat iron is superb I would give it 6 stars if I could .buy this you will not be disappointed</li>
            <li> I have super curly hair, and this thing works wonders!  I like the heat settings, and I like how quickly it gets hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this with my wet hair and it does well, just watch out for the steam!  When I use it on my dry hair I always make sure to use some type of heat protectant like tresseme or whatever.</li>
            <li> I had been using a $15 cheap flat iron for the past ten years.  It worked, but I kept eyeing those pricy ones.  After researching the CHI and others like it, I realized that it was too iffy to order one cheaply; most of them are fakes.  This less expensive flat iron had great reviews and so I got this instead.  I love it.  It certainly heats up fast and I like having the ability to increase the temperature.  For the reviewer who complained that the irons don&#x27;t squeeze completely closed - I can see a minuscule little gap, but holy heck - there ought to be room for your hair.  I have pretty average hair and this works quickly and perfectly.</li>
            <li> After two less than stellar experiences with chi straighteners i gave this one a try. The results were better than i had hoped for. Works really well on my super frizzy hard to straighten hair, even when i don&#x27;t blow dry it straight first.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my daughter, she loves it and the control of the temp is a selling point. She says she can achieve and maintain through out the day a straighter and smoother look.</li>
            <li> A nice goods that made my hair look like cool and good for styling, warm it just 1 min, control of this as A simple way, anyway, this is A nice goods, I &#x27;ll recommended for much people</li>
            <li> I have fairly uncooperative hair and my last straightening iron was all but useless. This one, though, I can have my hair straight in roughly 20 minutes. For a little added fun, it works for curling the ends up, too.</li>
            <li> I saw this flat iron being used in a youtube video and decided to order it because the price was awesome so far so good.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t actually own one but my friend let me use hers. Its amazing. Its digital settings are awesome the look is cool and it does a great job. I&#x27;ve had crazy heavy thick corse hair all my life and have been using straighteners since I was 12 (21 now). I&#x27;ve owned and tired so many but this straightener is even better than chi (in price and quality). I had a chi for 4 years and even then it took a lot of effort to tame my maine. I used the Infiniti Conair once and now my hair is more silky than ever. I&#x27;m definitely  buying one. Not to mention my moms got a $300 straightener that doesn&#x27;t work half as good. Trust me.</li>
            <li> Good quality, easy to use, doesn&#x27;t burn your hair, only has a funny smell but besides that I will purchase again</li>
            <li> I have unmanageable, thick, wiry, curly, shoulder length hair.  After decades of trying unsuccessfully to tame it (curling irons, blow dryers, hot rollers, perms and relaxers), I finally decided to buy a flat iron.  I didn&#x27;t have high expectations so I got a whopping surprise with this purchase.  For the first time in my life, I have truly straight hair without the ends looking like I stuck my finger in a light socket.  Best part? It stays straight for days ... even on rainy days.  It&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sturdy construction&lt;br /&gt;light weight and slim - easy to handle&lt;br /&gt;heats up super fast&lt;br /&gt;temperature control is spot on&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this flat iron and suggest using thermal gloves (I do) if you require high heat because you WILL burn your free hand after a couple of passes.</li>
            <li> Ok, I know that once you have your heart set on an item, you hate to hear bad reviews about it. But do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t buy this product. I even talked to Mindy, my hairdresser, who said that it is better to have an iron that gets hot and is good quality (ahem, Sedu or CHI) and go over your hair once than an iron that gets too hot and might possibly have hot spots (ahem, this one) and go over your hair 4-5 times like I do. Or did. You see, my hair is thick, curly, and unruly (just for comparison, my hair in a ponytail is as thick as an adults wrist, and not   a skinny adult&#x27;s wrist either). While I do love my corkscrew banana curls, I also happen to love straight, smooth hair. and this iron is sorta a piece of junk. It pulls on my hair (OW!) takes a while to heat up, damages it to the nth degree, takes a really, really really long time to straighten my whole head [I&#x27;m talkin&#x27; an hour and a half or more] and I&#x27;m guessing this problem comes from lack of negative ions(?) which also means its not going to be as shiny as it would be if I  used a nice straightener. (like Mindy&#x27;s, my hairdresser&#x27;s CHI) Oh yeah, and the other day I noticed my straightener smelled like burnt hair. Not my actual hair, but the straightener. so I looked at my straightener and pulled out a charred black piece of hair. (note: my hair is naturally blonde, not black). Do yourself a serious favor and spend the extra money on a Sedu (the best in my opinion) or if you don&#x27;t want to spend that much maybe the basic CHI  (not as good as the Sedu of course,  no offense to those of you who own them). Okay? OKAY!</li>
            <li> I used this straightener for the first time last night and I have to say I am surprised by the results. My hair is shiny, straight and light as if it was done by a pro. Since it was my first time using it, it took me about an hour to straighten my hair (mind your I was doing small sections and I have alot of hair). I am one of those people who does not wrap my hair at night and this morning my hair looked just as great as it did last night. Conair has yet to fail me.</li>
            <li> I like this flat iron.  It heats up almost immediately.  It works great on my hair and doesnt burn my hair.  What a bargain for the price.  There are choices of heat settings.  I just use it to smooth out my already straight hair.  Love it.</li>
            <li> My sister refuses to use any other flat iron outside of this one. This definitely works wonders on her hair.</li>
            <li> When my girlfriend accidentally left her Amazon order page up I took it upon myself to cancel her order of yet another $140 flat iron. After very apologetically explaining what I had done to her, I did some research and found this one. She LOVES everything about this thing. Heats quick, doesn&#x27;t burn her hair, and has an awesome price tag! Even if it only lasts a year like all the expensive ones seem to, I&#x27;ll have no problem replacing it for her at this price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, after I cancelled her order, look whose cart this one ended up in lol</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic flat iron! I have very short hair, and its size allows me to straighten my fringe quite easily. The variety of heat settings is also a huge plus, and it heats up very quickly. Very good quality!</li>
            <li> I had the Babyliss flat iron, which cost me $100 bucks. It kinda of flatlined so I purchased the Conair Infiniti flat iron, for $22.  I did not want to spend another $100 dollars on another Babyliss flat iron, although I really loved it. It turns out that this Conair flatiron is just as fantastic and I saved myself some money.</li>
            <li> The design is horrible. The device doesn&#x27;t hold hair in between plates. You have to make sure to hold the top of the flat iron tight. Skin on my fingers get cough in between where the handle with the temperature regulator starts. You will definitely regret it. Do not buy it....</li>
            <li> Straightens my hair in less than 5 mins. My hair never gets frizzy with this iron I love it I can also curl my hair with this iron which is great</li>
            <li> Smells a bit weired when it&#x27;s heat it&#x27;s heating up but it works amazing. Leaves my thick hair strait for days I love it. (:</li>
            <li> I stopped using this straightener a long time ago and purchased a better one. I used it for a short period of time and got tired of it always pulling my hair out. I don&#x27;t remember how it actually worked for straightening, i just remember the hair pulling. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have this iron and it heats up so easily and straighten so well and does not make your hair frizzy it looks so sleek I definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> I have naturally straight hair, so I bought this to curl my hair with. It works we&#x27;ll for that purpose and never catches or pulls my hair.</li>
            <li> It takes care of the job leaving hair beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on my daughter’s hair, freeze, and thick, long, short and it lives it silky smooth. My hair as well is thick and it lives it silky smooth. Temperature settings are more than enough. I didn’t have to use the max temp for our thick hair, so far only the second temp takes care of the job. Does not leave that burnt smell and does not pull hair. It heats up quickly, the stand is a nice piece for when I’m done letting it cool off. It has been a great purchase so far for an affordable price.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I can curl, straighten, or make waves with it. Not bad for the price and I love the color</li>
            <li> I love how fast this straightening iron heats up and how hot it can get. It works very well, better than any straightener I&#x27;ve used before...and the price is pretty good.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done for little fly aways. After researching many expensive models, I am glad that I chose this one.</li>
            <li> I use this several times a week on my hair and it always does a wonderful job. My hair is pretty thin, so I keep the temp turned down. If you need hotter temperatures for your hair type, you won&#x27;t be disappointed. It can get as hot as you need it to be.</li>
            <li> It is the best flat iron..I borrowed my friends Flat iron and didn&#x27;t want to give it back because it is so damn good...so I brought the identical one same size and color bcuz I loved hers so much...gets hot as he&#x27;ll really fast and works good on course African American hair</li>
            <li> If your in a hurry. This is the product to get. I was surprised at how well it worked for the price. It heats up fast and leave my hair looking nice and straight fast.</li>
            <li> I was expecting higher quality than I received. The product I received did not look like the one pictured and had a sticky residue around the area opposite the heated ceramic plates. Also, the area opposite the plates got really hot, making it difficult to use on my bangs which is why I purchased the produce in the first place. It heats up quickly and works fine, but I was slightly disappointed. According to the picture on the website now, it looks like the product has changed since I purchased it in Oct 2013.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through the gambit of flat irons from the cheap to the expensive, from wide to thin and this one is absoltely the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  My husband purchased one for me for Christmas and I was reluctant to try it because what does a dude who has very little hair know about flat irons.  To my surprise, this was the best flat iron ever!  It has four heat settings, which is nice and it heats up very fast and recovers quicly after each swipe. The one problem I have with other flat irons is that they will snag my hair and the coating always starts to fleck away.  I&#x27;ve been using this iron for over two year (moderate usage 2-4 times a week), and it never pulls and the coating is still in tact.  The 1 inch width is perfect for straightening and curling.  I can do spiral curls as well as body wave curls.  I had a few girls at the office ask me what size barrel curling iron I use and I tell them I curl my hair with my flat iron.  They are floored every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved this flat iron so much, that when my niece asked for one for this Christmas, I immediatly looked on Amazon for the Infinity Pro, found it, ordered it and can&#x27;t wait to give it to her.  We both have very thick, coarse hair with a natural wave that&#x27;s more annoying than flattering.  My hair isn&#x27;t particularly hard to straighten or curl, so when I straighten/curl my hair, it will stay that way until my next wash (I usually wash my hair every other day).  Inifinit Pro works best if you make sure your hair is completely dry and flat iron in small sections.</li>
            <li> First of all, this straightener is a beautiful shade of peacock blue, however I am a little disappointed with this product. It does straighten the hair quickly but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do a good job of smoothing down the frizz.</li>
            <li> Before I bought this straightener, I had a $250 flat iron that I loved. Unfortunately, when the 12&#x27; waves started hitting the ship, it hit the floor and cracked one of the plates. I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever find one that I&#x27;d like as much as that one. And I didn&#x27;t! I found one I liked more! This is the same width, but much lighter and easier to work with. I also like the bright color. The settings are very easy to see. The best part is the stand that comes with it. I don&#x27;t have to worry about where or how I put it down or if my cats are going to get to it. I&#x27;d give this hair straightener a 5+!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy. I got this straightener when I was in 8th or 9th grade and I am now about to graduate from college. It&#x27;s lasted me all throughout high-school and 3 years past it now and it still works just as well as it did when I got it! Sadly I am gonna have to get a new one soon cause the plates are a little worn out but it still gets just as hot just as fast. It really does heat up in seconds. I usually turn it on, go turn on some music, come back to my bathroom and it is perfectly hot. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this straightener. Heck now that I think about it I may just go buy this one again!</li>
            <li> Bought it for my teenage daughter. She uses it daily. It heats up quickly and does it&#x27;s job. It was a great price.</li>
            <li> Either we got a defective product or it&#x27;s really poorly made. Plates didn&#x27;t match up perfectly so it didn&#x27;t heat hair well. Had to return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interestingly I have the curling iron version of the Infinti Pro and love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this straightener for over 4 years now and it works like its brand new! I&#x27;ve dropped it quite a lot and the plates still align perfectly. Heats up quickly. Leaves my hair soft and silky. Hasn&#x27;t damaged it like other cheaper hair straighteners. I even had to buy one for my sister because she kept stealing it! Overall a great investment.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair flat iron I have ever used. My hair is thick and frizzy, with my old revlon iron, I can iron my hair in 1hr and still not satisfied with the result, with Infiniti Pro by Conair, I can get it straight in 15 mins, like really straight, and shiny and soft if I may add.&lt;br /&gt; I couldn&#x27;t be any happier!</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly, with multiple digitally-displayed heat settings that go all the way up to 455 degrees – this gets REALLY hot.  Leaves my hair straight and smooth in less than 10 minutes.  Has several protective grips to squeeze the iron closed and keep it from slipping or burning you.  Thin enough to get down to the roots.  The colour is very pretty, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional info:  I recommend unplugging this when not in use as it feels slightly warm to the touch in some areas if it&#x27;s left plugged in, even days after it was last used.</li>
            <li> Thanks. My daughter loves this. She can&#x27;t stop using it. It was quite quick to get here for here before the new year.</li>
            <li> The Infiniti Pro has 4 temperature settings.  I have thin hair so I leave it on the lowest setting and it works very well.  I have damaged my hair before from using a flat iron that was too hot and didn&#x27;t have any lower settings.</li>
            <li> I like the heat levels but it&#x27;s nothing special for me. I had a 14 dollar one from wal mart that worked just as well. BUT it does work good.</li>
            <li> I used the &#x27;Infinity pro&#x27; flat iron at my cousin&#x27;s house, and couldn&#x27;t believe the results. Not only did it remove all the wave from my hair (which is medium to long length, very thick, very coarse, and extremely wavy and poofy) but it stayed straight all day. It felt silky and had a great shine. I haven&#x27;t even wanted to use my flat iron since using hers. I literally go to her house before work and use her iron because it only takes 15 minutes and my hair is perfect. Believe it or not, I ditched my Chi for this product. I love my new flat iron!!!</li>
            <li> Very good flatiron! I used on my curly frizzy hair and the results are great! For a price around 22$ nothing can beat this, you get a really great result. Just eb sure to use some heat protection as well.</li>
            <li> I love this straightener! I used a beat-up Revlon straightener for years, and it got to the point that I did not even want to straighten my hair. I bought the 1 1/2\\&quot; Conair Infiniti Pro straightener (the hot pink one) first and was AMAZED at the difference. It makes my hair much sleeker and softer, and can stand up to the horrible Houston humidity. I bought this straightener for my bangs/detail work (I have a lot of hair) and use it daily.</li>
            <li> Daughters loved it. Said it was better than the expensive brands they have always bought. Worth it!!</li>
            <li> It heats up really quickly and is makes my hair very shiny and straight in less than 10-15 minutes. Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> At first use, this product was a LOT better than other drug store flat irons I&#x27;ve used. I was amazed at the difference! I don&#x27;t use it every day, maybe once or twice a week. I&#x27;ve had it for 5 months, and heard a BANG while using it. It tripped the GFCI outlet. It still heats up ok, but now it randomly turns off multiple times during use. The product has a long warranty, but I have to pay to ship it back, pay $7.50 for the opportunity, and be without a straightener for however long it takes to receive a new one. Hopefully the new one will be a better product?</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m very happy with this iron. It gets VERY hot and that&#x27;s good for my hair. It has 4 settings and I&#x27;m using the 2nd one. (first time I&#x27;ve ever had one I didn&#x27;t use on the hottest setting). The only negative is that the plates don&#x27;t fit together perfectly so it pulls my hair occasionally.</li>
            <li> Great product!!! I&#x27; m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Best iron I have ever had. Does not stick to hair.</li>
            <li> I have used the Chi straightener also, and think that this one is just as good as the more expensive ones.  This is the second one that I have purchased, and bought it so I would have one to travel with.  My original one is over 2 years old and still working perfectly.  If you are looking for a good straightener at a very reasonable price, this is a perfect choice.</li>
            <li> Holy hotness batman. This thing feels like it&#x27;s going to burn through my skin and my hair even on the lowest setting. I&#x27;m not at all pleased with this product but don&#x27;t care enough to return it. I had an old conair straightener that lasted me almost 10 years before it finally went out on me. I loved it but it was no longer being made. I bought this as a replacement  and am so disappointed in it. I will let this heat up and turn it off before using it so it cools down to a normal temperature. It still makes my hair TOO straight, like it&#x27;s trying to escape my face. The only thing I like is the little cover you can place the iron in. Sometimes when I&#x27;m traveling I need to shove the straightening iron in a bag right after it has been on, this way I don&#x27;t worry about it being too hot in there.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great straightener. I&#x27;ve been straightening my hair for about ten years now, and my natural hair is SO hard to tame. I&#x27;ve had hair stylists at salons look at my hair in confusion lol. But this straightener works great! I get compliments on my hair all the time now. I love that its very affordable. And in addition I have a couple of friends who love my straightener even though they had expensive chi&#x27;s. So I definitely recommend it especially if you have a tight budget.</li>
            <li> I was concerned about purchasing this straightener because it was so inexpensive. I bought it for my sophomore year in college and am so glad I did. I use this guy so much AND my roommate had the same one. She uses it everyday, I kid you not, and she absolutely loves it. I was surprised that she had this model and make because she is usually in to more high-end products, but it just goes to show that you don&#x27;t always have to spend a lot of money to get a great product.</li>
            <li> I like the size of it it works great it&#x27;s not too thick and it&#x27;s not too thin the automatic shut off is nice for when I forget to shut it off and I love the temperature control  makes it very easy to know what temperature you have it set on.</li>
            <li> This works great on my fine hair! You can adjust the heat setting so it won&#x27;t fry your strands which is great for me because I need all of them!!!</li>
            <li> I love this straightener! I&#x27;ve tried a few others and thus far this has worked the best. The time taken to straighten is sooo much shorter now and it does at awesome job :)</li>
            <li> I got this on time and what not but unlike the picture or any descriptions say I received a pink straightener. I had thought and hoped to get a blue like the picture. The pink is for breast cancer awareness so it&#x27;s not so bad and I like the color pink but I&#x27;d like to get what I ordered originally. Other than that I haven&#x27;t used it yet but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll work just fine. I&#x27;m excited to use it.</li>
            <li> This straightener heats up super fast and is super hot! Great quality at a super low price, and I love the colors that it comes in. You don&#x27;t need to buy the crazy expensive straighteners....this one is amazing!</li>
            <li> Not quite as good as the Chi, but for the price, it&#x27;s a good enough substitute.</li>
            <li> I purchased for a freind for xmas and she thanks me everytime she sees me! I would buy it, if I was you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about a year and a half and use it about every day. It&#x27;s definitely the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever had. Before this one I had a CHI and wasn&#x27;t a fan so I sold it and bought this one. Even after the time I&#x27;ve had this one, I still only need to put it on the first or second heat setting. Works great!</li>
            <li> This straightener constantly turns off by itself after about 5/10 minutes of use. That&#x27;s my only complaint, but a huge pain if you&#x27;re in the middle of straightening a client&#x27;s hair that is thick/coarse.</li>
            <li> This is one  amazing flat iron.  I hope I never have to be without it.  It works on all types of hair.</li>
            <li> this is a wonderful items works wonders and is simply awesome thank you it works perfect and I love it will recommend to others fast delivery</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been searching for a good-quality straightener that wouldn&#x27;t break the bank for a long time.  This one definitely hasn&#x27;t disappointed.  It heats up very quickly, and the smooth plates really do just glide through my hair without snagging with even heat distribution throughout.  I purchased the 1 inch plates, and it gives me excellent control over where I want the tool to go.  Just a few spritzes of heat protection, and you&#x27;re good to go!  Took a bit of experimenting to find the right temp (392 works best for me), but now the results are well worth the price.  It comes highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This is better than the expensive GHDs I had. I&#x27;m VERY happy with this AND WILL buy another. Great seller, great product.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday and it works great!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used very expensive straighteners for years (Chi, Corioliss) and this is the first \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; straightener I&#x27;ve purchased. My Corioliss just broke after one year and I was desperate so I bought this one, thinking it would be good to tie me over until I could afford a \\&quot;good&#x27; straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair has never felt softer or has straightened so quickly. It looks better than ever- like I just got a blow-out at the salon. I won&#x27;t be buying another overpriced straightener - this one is gold. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It works wonderfully, I personally think it&#x27;s a steal for the price. Heats up INSTANTLY. I&#x27;m glad I bought one. Would recommend</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t take my time to write a review unless the product is amazing! This straightener is simply that. It does what a straightener is&lt;br /&gt;suppose to! It takes my hair from big and puffy to straight as a pin in less than 30 minutes. But you know the most AMAZING thing is?!?! Bought this my 11 grade year in high school at a CVS. Its been 4 years since I&#x27;ve graduated! It&#x27;s lasted me 5 years (and still going strong) If at any point it stops working I won&#x27;t be so mad cause it&#x27;s had a good run and I&#x27;ll be buying another one!!</li>
            <li> Beautiful color, shipped quickly, and works great. I have fine hair and the first setting works well with my hair. Second setting gets my hair straight really fast, within 5 minutes I&#x27;d say, however it does tend to work a lil too well (A little hot for my hair). This flat iron was on sale for $20.00 when I bought it and its def. worth the price. The old flat iron i had was a con air as well , but it wouldn&#x27;t straighten my hair like this one does.</li>
            <li> Curly hair? Thick hair? Course hair? Frizzy hair?  I&#x27;ve got all the above and this flat iron actually works!!  I&#x27;ve paid $100 dollars more for flat irons and this one beats them!  I actually purchased mine from Wal-Mart for around 17 or 18 dollars.  I got it after reading the reviews.  So far I&#x27;ve had it close to a month and it is going strong. For the price even if it burns out in a short while it will be worth replacing.  It has temperature settings and the dials are in a place where you won&#x27;t constantly be hitting it and turning it off.  Nothing I don&#x27;t like about it.  Seriously, you should get one.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is by far one of the best out there especially for the price.  I bought one at the store for my oldest daughter then her sister&#x27;s iron broke and she opted to have one just like it since it worked great.  Plus is comes in different colors so no fighting over whose iron they have.  Straightens course very thick hair with ease and less static.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t expect it to be this good got it a month ago. Use it 3x a wk great for the price no complaints</li>
            <li> i love this straightner it doesnt take forever to heat up and it comes with a thing to put the straightner in ....also love the heat settings ....it arrived on time and in good conditon and with this straightner i can finish my hair within 10-15 minutes absolutely love it ..also really good price :D</li>
            <li> I love this product this is the second one that I purchased I have purchased others that only burned my hair and left my hair frizzy this flat iron is the best one I have ever purchased. My hair is very curly but his iron on only the second setting leaves my hair shiny and straight for days. I love this product so much I bought 2 one for me and one for my niece.   Conair CS31TX Infiniti Instant Heat Pure Ceramic 1 Inch Tourmaline Ceramic Flat Iron</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this straightener. I&#x27;ve been through every hair straightener imaginable (cheap and expensive) and this one beats them all. For 30 bucks you get the adjustable heat settings (up to 455 degrees) and smoothing effect of a $200 straightener. I didn&#x27;t even have this yet and I recommended it to 3 friends, 2 of them went out and bought it and thanked me 100 times. DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE $200 CHI OR OTHER EXPENSIVE CRAP!!! BUY THIS!!!!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even talk about how much I love this straightener. I got it a few days ago and I straightened my hair yesterday. MY HAIR LOOKS INCREDIBLE. First, I have extremely frizzy, curly hair. I stopped straightening for a while because I was trying to be natural, but for some reason I decided to look into getting a new straightener. I did some research and landed on this one. Second, the last straightener I had was a $130 CHI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHY ON EARTH DID I EVER SPEND $130 ON THAT STRAIGHTENER WHEN THIS ONE IS A QUARTER OF THE PRICE AND A MILLION TIMES BETTER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It straightened my hair without burning, frying, or damaging it. Normally it used to take me near an hour to straighten, but with this straightener it took half that time. My hair is silky smooth. Today I walked in the snow for 15 minutes and when I got back inside, my hair had not frizzed or curled a bit. That&#x27;s insane to me, whose hair looks like it was rubbed by a static balloon the moment I step into any bit of moisture. I&#x27;m honestly amazed at how great my hair looks. Buy this straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, seriously. Buy it.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat Iron when my other ceramic flat iron blew out.at first i loved that it reached up to 455 degree&#x27;s. but after two uses i noticed my hair broke off. obvouisly i had the heat setting to high.but the kicker for me is that even when i put it on the lowest setting it made my hair super dull looking it did not shine. and did not look healthy. the only thing i love about this flat iron is the floating plates you can really do a nice curl at the end of your hair and it stays. i find that i have to use another flat iron with real ceramic plates. that make&#x27;s your hair shine and hold moisture in before i use this super hair frying flat iron. it&#x27;s the only way for me to yield my results, and get the super shiny stepped out the salon look with this horrible flat iron. that&#x27;s really said to me that i have to double up.</li>
            <li> Have had this for over a year. I have naturally curly hair and sometimes I want a dramatic change and this meets the needs. I even use it on my 6 yr old sons long curly hair when he wants boy band hair. If you follow the rules and don&#x27;t try to straighten too large of a section at a time you will get the results you desire. It stays all day too. I fear damage but this does not hurt my hair even when I turn it up to the max. Please note that I do not use it daily as I love my curls.</li>
            <li> These flat irons are EXCELLENT! I was used to using GHD&#x27;s in the UK, but since I moved to canada the conversion didn&#x27;t work so I originally picked up a cheap pair of Revlon flat irons... Big mistake. They kept on losing heat, it would take up to an hour to do my hair!&lt;br /&gt;But these guys heat up insanely fast, don&#x27;t lose heat and work as well as my GHD&#x27;s! Plus they&#x27;re SO cheap for a decent flat iron! Could not recommend more.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this flat iron!!! It gets my hair do straight which allows me to go even longer without getting a relaxer! I would recommend this to anyone with thick or coarse hair!</li>
            <li> This iron is nice...gets very hot great price and it has a stand that holds the iron. I would buy again.&lt;br /&gt;SJ</li>
            <li> Personally, I&#x27;m content with my blow dryer and round brush. It really didn&#x27;t wow me like I expected for smoothing frizzy fly aways.</li>
            <li> This is the best iron ever. My daughther in law has it and i first tryed hers, it makes it very  easy to straighten my hair. I have very curly hair that untill now i wasn&#x27;t able to straighten easily. I have two more irons (one from walmart and one John Freeda) none of them do as great of job as these one. East to clean, heats up instantly, work really good. Fast shipping. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Great flat iron i love it. Gets hot as soon as u turn it on. Makes hair straight super fast and i have thick curly hair. i totally recommend this product after going through many flat irons this one is the one i like the most. Speedy delivery couldnt be happier&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its been about 2 months and i love this flat iron the best i ever had. and its true it keeps ur hair well maintained even in humid conditions! n doesnt do too much damage on ur hair. my hair gets from curly to straight so fast.</li>
            <li> About a year ago my not o great straightener finally broke. I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to spend close to $100 on a straightener that I wasn&#x27;t going to use that much, so I bought this straightener for 1/3rd of the price I would spend on a $100 straightener.  I LOVE this straightener! I went from straightening my hair every once in awhile, to daily.  I could never get my naturally curly hair straight enough to make it worth it and it would literally take hours to get my hair even a little &amp;#34;straight.&amp;#34;  With this straightener I&#x27;ve gotten my routine down to 20 minutes or less!  I bought the 1 inch and I thought &amp;#34;man, this is going to take forever.&amp;#34; as I have very thick, curly hair.  Not at all! I think the smaller one inch actually works better!  The key is to do smaller sections, and the one inch forces you to do that! The guard that comes with it is awesome too.  I can set the straightener in there and I don&#x27;t have to yell at my kiddo to watch out for it when she comes in and out of the bathroom 20 times while I&#x27;m getting ready!</li>
            <li> its so fast to heat and leaves my hair very soft and shiny, also protects hair against humidity and frizz better than other... seriously 100% recommend! from Venezuela</li>
            <li> Works, but I thought I would be better than my 10-year-old straightener.  It doesn&#x27;t work any faster or provide any better results than my old one.  However since it still does what was advertised I&#x27;m not necessarily disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great value and price!! I have to the middle of my back unbelievably thick hair. It is naturally very wavy and curly but I love to wear it straight. I had a CHI before that did a poor, slow, job and it snagged my hair leading to breakage. It broke in less than a year. So I took a chance based on other reviews and WOW!! This cuts my styling time by 60% at least!! It has multiple heat settings and gets very hot without burning your hair. No more 3 and 4 passes to get the job done. This will get most of  your hair done in 1 pass with an occasional second pass and my hair is smooth also!! Does wonders for frizz and static. On top of all that, it is a beautiful deep teal color with a sleek design. Not too heavy or clunky. Temperature and power display screen is very nice looking. I always thought that you get what you pay for as far as straighteners as concerned but this completely changed my outlook... Ditch the trendy brand, save some cash, and be completely satisfied FINALLY with your straightener :) Highly recommended!! A+++</li>
            <li> hair feels shiny and healhtier, it heats up fast like it when im on a hurry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 6 months and have no complaints. It heats up almost instantly (at least on the lowest setting, which is all I need.) Works very well. My hair will stay straight for as long as I don&#x27;t wash it. Not even a little rain makes it curl back up, only getting it fully wet starts it over. My hair is naturally curly but the curls are loose and large, so kinkier hair might not last as long. Nice to only have to straighten my bangs once per wash instead of every day. Love the color, love the automatic turn off. No problems at all with snagging, which was a concern since my hair is very fine. The plates are smooth and have stayed that way. I don&#x27;t use products though... I know some people use hairspray before they straighten, that&#x27;s sure to gunk it up! Taking care of this iron, I expect it to last a long time. It still feels brand new.</li>
            <li> I love this iron. Works great!! Heats up quickly and leaves my hair very nice slick and smooth. I like the color just wish they had more options.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but I just have to seeing how cheap and good this straightener works&lt;br /&gt;absolutely the best hair straightener I&#x27;ve ever used I&#x27;ve been using my moms for a month now and recently my sister has been seeing how straight and healthy my hair has been looking so she has been using it most of the time as well and I hate that I can&#x27;t have it as much as i want  so I decided to buy my own today I&#x27;m so excited I can&#x27;t wait to have my own I&#x27;ve tried the Maxiglide red pro and the croc and they suck compared to this straightener don&#x27;t waste your money on a expensive straightenerthis one works wonders and has a great price ;-)  autumn</li>
            <li> This is a really nice straightener. The only problem is that after some moderate use, the blue paint near the plates starts to melt/peel away. After only a month of use, this straightener looks like it is a few years old.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best flat irons I&#x27;ve ever owned. It heats quickly and I love the straight, anti-frizz look it give to hair. Hair also feels super soft. High temperature settings are necessary if you do keratin treatments at home but not all flat irons provide high enough heat. This flat iron&#x27;s heat setting goes up to 455 degrees which is perfect. The stand that&#x27;s included is a nice accessory. To reduce hair damage, make sure you use a heat protectant before flat ironing your hair, such as CHI Silk Infusion or CHI 44 Iron Guard Thermal Protection.</li>
            <li> I really like it :) it straightens super fast and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair with a burnt smell. :) fantastic</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned three genuine Chi hair straighteners. I&#x27;m terrible about losing things, so over the past 5 years I&#x27;ve gone through more than the average person- but this latest time my toddler managed to break it and I finally decided I cannot be bothered to spend so much money over and over again on a straightener. I should also say that I live in very *very* humid south Florida and I have curly unruly hair- I had little hopes for this iron, but it was the best that was available at the drug store up the road from me. When I brought it home and tried it out I was blown away. I spent less than half of what I usually do on a Chi and it worked just as well (if not better, IMO). It&#x27;s sturdy and hasn&#x27;t broken yet or had any issues (I&#x27;ve had it for over a year now). I&#x27;m just coming to grab another because mine is temporarily misplaced. Much cheaper on Amazon than the drug store. Grab this iron, you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Really good, hair looks nice, brilliant and soft. It heat up really in 30 seconds. Good size, feels good in your hand.</li>
            <li> I had a conair flat iron before this and it was horrible. This one actually makes my hair look like I have super silky glassy smooth &amp;#34;asian&amp;#34; hair (got wavy latina hair) :P I did burn the top of my ear though, and kind of annoying, when you close iron, it only touches at the first half. It also stays super straight until you wash your hair, and I live in Miami! Humidity is not match for the infiniti pro.</li>
            <li> I just ordered mine and cant wait to use it. My friend has one and I decided to try it. I love it!!! My hair was shiny and bouncy and looked super healthy. I also ordered the Infiniti Professional Nano Tourmaline Ceramic Curling Iron 1-Inch so Im looking forward to receiving and using both!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the straightener. It&#x27;s smooth and definitely gets very hot, very fast. I never even turn the heat up all the way. It is a little awkward to hold compared to the Chi, I think because it&#x27;s a little slimmer so it&#x27;s hard to get your fist around it securely. It does have a tip on the end that hangs out past the plates, so there&#x27;s a place to put your left fingers without getting them burned when using it to curl your hair--this is a big plus.  Overall very happy with it so far. Only had it a few months so can&#x27;t comment on durability.</li>
            <li> I am a self proclaimed product junkie. I actually have several flat irons (weird I know) .. anyhow, I have 1 big name expensive brand which I love, except it does not have temp control. I have others I like as well, from multiple price points.... However, I must say, I do love this flat iron and tend to either grab this one or the other Conair infiniti one I own, which has longer plates. For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong. I am amazed that it works as well as it does for under $30.00 .. so worth it. Also love the color .. which has no bearing on performance, but hey, us girls like things cute as well! I am not saying this flat iron works as well as one in the $150 range, but it is dern close and at a fraction of the cost. Plus, no fear if you drop it or break it, you don&#x27;t have to skip a mortgage payment to replace it. I like the thumb grips. I like the cover that comes with it. I like the temp control options. Good iron over all.</li>
            <li> I have had this straightener for a while, and I still have no complaints about it.  It is an affordable option for those looking for a pretty good straightener.  I love the heat settings... I only need to put mine on the second setting (338 degrees) for it to do a good job, and I have very thick wavy/curly hair.  I like the 1\\&quot; because it allows me to flip out the ends of my hair, but I&#x27;m sure the 2\\&quot; one is great too.</li>
            <li> The plug on this doesn&#x27;t seem to be the right size. It keeps slipping out of the wall when the cord is wiggled.</li>
            <li> This was not the best in the world. The chi works better, but costs double the price of this item.  I bought this to use temporarily till I got another chi.  It is NOT good for girls with outrageously thick and curly hair.  I would recommend this to girls and/or guys with easy to straighten hair.  But all and all, this was a good purchase. It served its purpose, but it was just a little slower at straightening my hair than I thought.</li>
            <li> its quiet a remarkable product  heats up amazingly fast and the hair remains straight for hours!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying this because it&#x27;s only an inch and my hair is so thick, but I was so pleased once I used it. It works way better than any flat iron I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this straightener. Says it&#x27;s one of the best she&#x27;s ever had and she&#x27;s had very expensive ones. She has now bought two of these.</li>
            <li> I have nappy, frizzy locks of hair (no way to sugar coat it.) Lol. Took only 10 minutes to straighten. I bought a flat iron for 120.00 once and wasn&#x27;t as good as this one. I bought another flat iron for like 20 dollars but only got as hot as 375 and did nothing for my hair. The high heat was okay for my hair. Thankfully my mane is thick. I think what did the trick for me was a higher heat setting.</li>
            <li> I love this iron.  Very gentle on my fine hair.</li>
            <li> I borrowed this from a friend and ended up buying my own after I have it back. So glad I did. Have had it for a year with use 3-5 times a week and it still works very well. I love that the cord has the swivel feature so you don&#x27;t get all tangled up as you move it around.</li>
            <li> I like my Flat iron, heats well, and very fast too, am sure i will enjoy using it, really like it.</li>
            <li> This IS the BEST straightener I&#x27;ve EVER used. Period. My hair is super thick bc I&#x27;m half Italian and half Native American and my hair is naturally frizzy but once I straighten my hair with it, my hair straight EVEN THROUGH THE HUMID SUMMER, just so freaking amazing. Before this straightener i had a chi and it didn&#x27;t even do that for me, PLUS it broke after about a year. Wish I had it in high school lol. Just SO AWESOME.I&#x27;ve had the Infiniti pro for about two years now, still heats up super fast and works absolutely great.</li>
            <li> Heats super fast and does the job without ruining my hair. The little thing that comes with so you can put it away even if it&#x27;s still warm is nice.</li>
            <li> I had a Chi and then another expensive straightener in the past and both broke within a year. Because I&#x27;m an obsessive pre-purchase Internet researcher, I read a bunch of &amp;#34;Best Straightener&amp;#34; articles. This one was listed on two of them. I decided to give it a try because it&#x27;s inexpensive. I&#x27;m so impressed. It&#x27;s just as good as the Chi if not better. It heats up almost immediately. I can straighten my hair in about 10 minutes and it&#x27;s baby soft after. I feel like the master of all bargain hunters. It&#x27;s definitely worth way more than it costs. There&#x27;s no reason not to buy it. I love it.</li>
            <li> I have tried tons of flat irons snd have never found one that did half the job of this one! I have naturally curly hair that is very hard to completely straighten. I used to blow dry it, take an in-styler and/or another straightener over it, half to put tons of product on it and it would be all wavy and sometimes frizzy. I skeptically bought this one and I&#x27;m glad I did. It completely transformed my hair! I can straighten it stick straight in about 20 minutes and it stays and without using any product!!!!I can&#x27;t preach it&#x27;s praises enough!!!</li>
            <li> Did not meet my expectations! I would much rather spend $100+ , you get what you pay for. Getting a chi.</li>
            <li> I have natural African-American hair and this flat iron does wonders. Its easy to handle and i don&#x27;t have to flat iron a section 3 times to get it straight. I like the fact that the adjustable temp setting display the actual degrees F instead of a scale from 1-10. It heats up and cools down fast. Just perfect.&lt;br /&gt;As for the seller, the items arrive pretty quick and the price is too good to be true. On other websites and Conair&#x27;s sight they were charging around $40.00.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this flat iron!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful straightner! Its very smooth and gets really hot! Wish I hadn&#x27;t of given it as a gift and had kept it for myself!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible to read the temperature settings as the numbers are very tiny. You need eyeglasses. If you turn off the lights you might be able to make it out. It is not a digital display. And there are NOT 5 heat settings (there are only 4- the manufacturer is counting the on/off as a setting). Guess I&#x27;ll be returning this and looking for a Remington.</li>
            <li> Wow! what can I say. I was skeptical at first about buying this brand, because it was not the fancy one used in salons (the more popular brand)anyway to my surprise it was super light, it heated up so fast, much faster then the one I used for many years. The plates are smooth and it just glided thru my hair. I cannot believe it was under $50 dollars. My hair is soft, shiny and feels so weightless, I can&#x27;t wait for my husband to come home and see it:)&lt;br /&gt;My hair is naturally thick and frizzy in the front-but NOT Any more, also it took half the time to straighten it.&lt;br /&gt;** This is a MUST buy. You will be super happy with it.</li>
            <li> It does the job, however the darn thing cuts off on me when I&#x27;m using it. Must be a shortage in the cables. I would recommend it, but there&#x27;s a chance you could end up with one like mine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 41, and my hair needs shine help, but even putting this on the middle temperature was enough to burn my strands.  I have to put it on the lowest heat...anything higher--be careful!  It will damage beyond repair.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these in January, one for me and one for my daughter. I was really excited because it received great reviews and the price was great. However, within the first month of daily use, mine stopped letting me choose my setting and would only go on the highest setting every time I turned it on. My daughters constantly turns off on her as she&#x27;s using it because the plug does not fit snugly in the socket. It is loose on every socket we have tried, including hotels. I am glad I did not spend very much on these, but still would like my money back. Unfortunately, I waited too long and it is no longer possible to do so. I do recommend the HSI. I bought that as a replacement and have been extremely happy with it. It also leaves my hair a lot smoother and I do not have any of the frizziness like I did with the Conair.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to get a hair straightener that really worked and would not fry my hair or just do half the job. I had owned a really large Conair straightener that was given to me about 5 years ago that is silver and very large and bulky and I never really used it because it was difficult to handle and did not seem to ever do a good job on my hair and I think it was the worst hair straightener that I have ever owned.Since it was given to me without the box, I have no idea what series it is. So I just now tried my brand new Ifiniti Pro that came to me last week....Boy, I am very happy and pleased with my results!!!! I do have very fine strands of hair,but can be very wavy and sometimes very curly if I go to sleep with wet hair. Also, my hair gets unruly with flyways...This product worked so well and left my hair feeling soft and conditioned and I did not even have to use product in my hair at all!!!! My boyfriend talked me out of buying a very expensive hair straightener at the mall, and I am very pleased that he showed me this one on Amazon!!!! I would recommend this product, I love it !!!</li>
            <li> By far the best flatiron I&#x27;ve used and at such a low price.  It feels and performs like a very expensive iron, but was only $26 (looks like it&#x27;s up to $39.99 now, but still a good deal in my opinion).</li>
            <li> Probably the best straightener I have ever owned.  It is slim in design, heats up quickly, and the plates don&#x27;t get stuck in my hair!!</li>
            <li> This flat iron heats up fast and straightens with a curl at the end which is how I style it.  It comes with a stand to keep the iron off the counter so heat doesn&#x27;t damage it.  I have used this for about a month now and have been very happy with it.</li>
            <li> THis straightener is good at heating up quickly and straightens well but this weird brown stuff builds up on the sides of the plates and the color is chipping off.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t flat iron my hair that often but when I do, this item does the job and my roots are flattened out perfectly.  This flat iron also heats up very quickly and I am satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as good as I thought it would be after some of the reviews I read. Still works decent &amp; is a great price.</li>
            <li> My hair type is semi-straight and this product works really well. It heats up fast and hold hair well.</li>
            <li> Very good flat iron. Great price heats up quickly. Good range in heat preferences.</li>
            <li> I never had much luck with the cheap-o flat iron I&#x27;ve had for years so I started researching quality flat irons on line.  The CHI line came highly recommended but I really didn&#x27;t want to shell out over $100 for something I wasn&#x27;t sure would work for me.  I saw so many great comments on the Infiniti Pro but was a little hesitant considering the cost - but the reviews were right, this is a fantastic flat iron! The fact that its so affordable is just another benefit.  I love the multiple settings and the way it glides so smoothly through my hair. I am very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> my 4 daughters loved it</li>
            <li> I initially bought this flat iron for myself back in 2012 and I loved it so much I bought this one for my sister. It&#x27;s been 3 years and I last used it 3 weeks ago! Still in great condition! No scratches!! Yes people believe it! The color does not or I should say &amp;#34;should not&amp;#34; peel or chip off! The adjustable heat settings is a blessing because in days where my hair is a little more frizzier than some the heat helps! The holder is really handy too because it keeps the blades together when I put it down which pretty much holds the heat in the blades! (No need for high settings) I love it too!!</li>
            <li> Best straightener I have ever had.  Bought this one for my Sister and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I love this straightner</li>
            <li> awesome and thanks for the special edition surprise:)</li>
            <li> This is \\&quot;THE BEST STRAIGHTENER EVER\\&quot;. I have been using a straightener for over 10 yrs. My first appliance was bought at a salon for over $100 dollars where I first had my hair done straight. And it lasted until my teens took over a couple years ago.They both have very thick hair one is more curlier than the other. My old hai brand would leave the hair thick, full of static &amp; would rise up in humidity by the end of the day. So I purchased this because it is the only one I found that has the highest setting that really does the job for anyone with super hard to straightened thick hair. Now their hair are super soft, sleek thin &amp; tamed, they left their hair unwashed for 3 days test (AS LONG AS I WOULD ALLOW) to see if it would last and it&#x27;s UNBELIEVABLE....3 DAYS LATER STILL STRAIGHT AFTER SLEEPING ON IT, RUNNING, DANCING &amp; SHAKING IT ALL ABOUT. What is so special is that after they shower &amp; wash out there hair, it still stays soft, manageable &amp; super tamed! No more frizzes or curling up (I do miss my daughters full head of curls). Though curling is not a problem except now they have soft waves of curls. And you can make loose, tight or wavy curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The only thing not so nice, is the black case that comes with this straightener to store while hot. After a few months I&#x27;ve notice that from reinserting the top &amp; bottom part of the barrel has some of the paint chipped away from use, and is not very nice looking. But the straightener itself is a WINNER!! The settings are as follow: from lowest to highest (365, 392, 419 &amp; 455) My prefer setting is 419 for my long down to my butt thick &amp; wavy hair, I get done super fast (you don&#x27;t need to pass through parts of your hair more than 1-3 times, depends how fast &amp; how much hair you pull through, go slow with small sections &amp; get done quicker). My girls prefer 455 for their thick hair at first. But now they are ok with 392 for bangs &amp; 419 for rest of hair. Heats up really fast! And has Auto Shut off if forgotten. No experiences with burning but maybe once I recently slipped while holding the barrel downward to twist &amp; curl my hair &amp; was distracted by my tot running into me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMEND!! If you are having a hard time with straightening your thick, tight curls, untamed kinky hair (like my daughter) you have to give: Infiniti Pro by Conair a try. We will be going on vacation soon &amp; I will be purchasing another because nothing is worse then 3 females battling over a straightener early in the morning, when you want to leave the hotel room.o experiences with burning but maybe once I recently slipped while holding the barrel downward to twist &amp; curl my hair &amp; was distracted by my tot running into me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!

            <li> Gets super hot, quick, and comfortable to use. I replaced an older Infiniti that started shorting after 6+ years.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this flat iron after my Remington flat iron died (after a couple of years of use). I thought the Remington did a pretty good job but this one is so much better! It gets super hot (up to 455 degrees) which gets my hair really straight, really fast! I have super thick, coarse, wavy hair. With my old flat iron it took about 30 minutes to straighten my hair. With this one, it only takes about 15 minutes and it is so much straighter than with my old one. Even with my hair a little damp, it still does an amazing job, AND dries my hair! And it doesn&#x27;t sizzle and fry your hair if it&#x27;s a little damp like my old one did. I love it!!! I also like the little holder it comes with. I wish I had got this thing a long time ago. I would definitely recommend it! I also recommend using it with \\&quot;Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Hot off the Press\\&quot; or \\&quot;Frizz Ease Heat Defeat\\&quot; heat protection/styling spray. Just spray a little in while your hair is damp, brush your hair, and then straighten as usual. They both work great and smell really good too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE- After about 8 months of once a week use, it stopped working for no apparent reason. It no longer heats up. The LED light still comes on but it doesn&#x27;t get hot. BUMMER :( Should have kept the box and receipt!</li>
            <li> I have very thick, very curly, very frizzy, very long hair. At the moment my hair is longer than it has ever been, because I usually chop it off to reduce straightening time. I was ready to make a trip to the salon, until I received this straightener for Christmas. I can not be more pleased with the product. I have owned numerous other straighteners in many different brands and models. NONE of them compare to this one. I spent a large sum of money on a \\&quot;professional\\&quot; straightener from a salon about a year ago, and that was a complete waste of money now that I have tried this one. Great price, great tool. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
