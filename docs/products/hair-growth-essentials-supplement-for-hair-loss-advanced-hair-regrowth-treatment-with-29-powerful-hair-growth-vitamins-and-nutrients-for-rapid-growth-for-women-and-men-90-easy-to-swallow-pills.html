            <li>So i went searching online for a good hair growth vitamin</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a good sign in my book.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good vitamin, just didn&#x27;t notice anything with hair growth, etc.</li>

            <li>Love this formula!</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s why I gave it 3 stars, but I will be sure to update it once I finish the bottle!</li>

            <li>Amazing~</li>
            <li>It was amazing.</li>
            <li>All opinions are my own and reflect my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>I waited for a month (when bottle ran out) to do an honest evaluation.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough about how great I feel and how great the product is!</li>
            <li>I received a discount on this product for an honest unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>i think 6 more months from now my hair will be gorgeous again.</li>
            <li>He liked it has lots of vitamins and nutrients.  </li>
            <li>but I have seen a nice difference since using these.</li>
            <li>but they were not as effective as this one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these off and on since they were first released and still find them the best supplement to promote hair growth and to obtain a healthy head of hair.</li>
            <li>Very cool!</li>
            <li>Great product, quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Outstanding !!!!! A+A+A+ Can&#x27;t say enough good about the seller</li>
            <li>Very easy on the stomach.  </li>
            <li>I got these for my best friend she has gone into early menopause and is having issues with her hair.  </li>
            <li>First I want to say this is a great company.  </li>
            <li>it mostly lists out the vitamins and their make up for each supplement.</li>
            <li>I think these work better than pre natal vitamins i was taking to help my hair grow.</li>
            <li>I started noticing a bit of thickening in about three weeks and have enjoyed taking these supplements.  </li>
            <li>This product is great and really helps hair grow faster.</li>
            <li>Satisfied with my purchace I see  hair growing.</li>
            <li>This product has made my hair softer, more manageable, and it has grown since I started.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never seen my hair looking better.</li>
            <li>RISK FREE FOR 90 DAYS!  </li>
            <li>This product is not only an awesome supplement for hair growth</li>
            <li>I have noticed greater hair growth and thickness since using this product.</li>
            <li>, however I can see now that it is getting longer and filling in more.</li>
            <li>I truthfully can&#x27;t tell yet if it is working.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I had a beautiful long gorgeous hair before and during my pregnancy</li>
            <li>This product has made my hair softer, more manageable, and it has grown 4 inches since I started.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never seen my hair looking better.</li>
            <li>It took some convincing to get him to try it</li>
            <li>Another con is that it makes hair grow ALL over... not just your head :) ...</li>
            <li>I did receive this product free to test, but I can vouch that it works!  </li>
            <li>His hair appears more shiny and smoother.  </li>
            <li>He will gladly continue using.</li>
            <li>I will keep taking and will order more if it continues to show improvement, which I think it will.</li>
            <li>Be sure to drink PLENTY of water to avoid breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it :)</li>
            <li>Love the product  </li>
            <li>My husband is glad he took it</li>
            <li>Glad I purchased</li>
            <li>I notice that my nails look better &amp; are stronger.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not paying more money to find out.</li>
            <li>I received the opportunity to order this product through a promotion and I am glad I ordered it for her to  try.</li>
            <li>I am looking forward to having better hair.</li>
            <li>but my nails seem to be growing more and are not as brittle.</li>
            <li>Another great benefit that comes with taking biotin supplements for hair growth other than increase in length and strength is great hair color since this vitamin replenishes your roots and follicles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>So far, so good!  </li>
            <li>I love the vitamins and notice how much more strong and healthy my hair is since I&#x27;ve started using it.</li>
            <li>I already had a pretty good growth and thickness rate</li>
            <li>And this company is amazing too, to stand by their product like that and offer such great customer service.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much for a great product!</li>
            <li>Great so far!</li>
            <li>I give it 4 stars would be higher if I didn&#x27;t have to take so many pills which doesn&#x27;t seem cost effective with a bottle of 60.  </li>
            <li>He also had a bald spot on the top and it is completely filled</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite products for growing hair out quickly and healthy.</li>
            <li>Biotin ingredient was wayyyy too strong.</li>
            <li>There is definite improvement on top of his head with more hair coming in!!  </li>
            <li>I love being able to give my husband a natural alternative to the chemicals a lot of people use without having to formulate my own blend.</li>
            <li>They have many of the same ingredients as popular brands but have many more in addition.</li>
            <li>The most hair growth products I have got mostly are Biotin itself, but this bottle contains more necessary nutrition for hair growth which makes more sense that will get more results.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product more so as a &amp;#34;boost&amp;#34; to my own natural hair growth.</li>
            <li>I, personally, think these pills are working great.</li>
            <li>important thing to know is this:  the listing states that you can try it for 90 days risk-free.  </li>
            <li>NO, I did NOT get any free product for this evaluation.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy for my friend as she is experiencing a similar situation</li>
            <li>So far, good.</li>
            <li>I like taking them and so far my hair is looking good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>They even have a special where you buy two and get one free.  </li>
            <li>One of the main ingredients is biotin which plays a huge role in healthy, strong hair and nails.</li>
            <li>but I do believe its worth it!</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>received this product for free for my true and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>However, if you&#x27;d like to see changes in the health of your hair its definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li>So he was excited to try it.  </li>
            <li>Finished 1st bottle did see significant results debating on if I should try for another month</li>
            <li>Just received this purchase and Hubby is excited to try this supplement...</li>
            <li>I used to clean my hair brush couple times a day.</li>
            <li>I have noticed, after taking these for about a month, twice a day, my hair has grown about 2 inches, is softer, more manageable and much fuller.</li>
            <li>The owner sent me a message saying he had read my review and without even me asking he issued me a full refund.  </li>
            <li>and I start taking them with full mouth of water</li>
            <li>It is too early to rate how effective is the product.  </li>
            <li>Would it have worked if I had been able to go the whole 30?</li>
            <li>here are my results my nails got strong and grew which was amazing to see because me as a chronic nail biter never had actual gorgeous nails in my entire life!</li>
            <li>I bought this with great expectations due to the 5 star reviews...</li>
            <li>I saw results quickly.</li>
            <li>If anyone has any idea of a hair regrowth not so strong, but does the job I would certainly appreciate the comments.</li>
            <li>Noticed more new growth while taking these.</li>
            <li>Will come back for more updates!</li>
            <li>I love having the opportunity to take a natural product to improve myself.</li>
            <li>and it never seems to get any longer than right below my shoulders</li>
            <li>Lets just say my shower drains do not like me right now.  </li>
            <li>With results that quickly you can only expect more.  </li>
            <li>My hair gets to a certain length....and just stops!</li>
            <li>I have researched various supplements that will help with hair growth and was pleased to find that this one has them all as well as some I had not known about.</li>
            <li>and I definitely see an improvement to my bald spot on top of my head.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost through my first bottle.</li>
            <li>b) because I&#x27;m sure to see a noticeable difference I will have to purchase a second bottle</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried so many different products, some of which costs a lot.</li>
            <li>I admit I did not take these pills every day the first time around nor did I even finish the bottle.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It would be better if you only had to take one a day instead of two pills.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice anything different, but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Personally these pills work very well for me and because of the increased in my hair, I have more length retention.</li>
            <li>I ordered a bottle and took it religiously exactly as directed (3x a day, with meals, etc.), but after 30 days I am still losing just as much hair as before.</li>
            <li>it is also a multivitamin and may be able to replace your normal once a day supplement (Consult with your doctor first, I do not provide medical advisement).</li>
            <li>She used it for the past month and has said she feels better taking the supplement and her fingernails are much nicer looking and stronger, and she feels there are signs of more new hair.  </li>
            <li>It looked very promising based on the hundreds of positive reviews, and I was excited to find something that could potentially help with my hair loss.</li>
            <li>Because 60 capsules over 20 days is just not long enough to be sure of the results, I contacted the seller to confirm their guarantee, and sure enough...</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say these are miracle hair growth pills but from my experience taking them they seem to have helped me.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping to regrow this embarrassing patch of baldness on the side of my hairline.</li>
            <li>This product really bothered me- not because of the ingredients, but because the packaging is incorrect.  </li>
            <li>It takes up to a month to really work and see a difference, so just be patient.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping this would work because of the guarantee and reviews I read</li>
            <li>I have noticed, since taking these pills, that when I brush my hair not as much is falling out.</li>
            <li>I really think this product works.</li>
            <li>but my nails are so much stronger.</li>
            <li>This is a very needed product by me.</li>
            <li>Made my whole body itch.</li>
            <li>I want to thanks to who did this things.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a problem taking these, but honestly it&#x27;s just like taking a regular daily vitamin.</li>
            <li>It contains 29 powerful natural ingredients that help grow new hair without any side effects.</li>
            <li>That means a new bottle would have to be purchased every 20 days!</li>
            <li>I am a healthy male in my mid 60&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Pregnant women and children should be well advised before starting any biotin regimen meant for hair growth.</li>
            <li>So far, he seems to like, but cannot really tell much yet.</li>
            <li>So glad to finally see my hair growing back in.</li>
            <li>My hair is growing in thick, and my scalp is even looking better!  </li>
            <li>it took time, but now, about 6 months after first discovering the two bald spots, they&#x27;re both completely grown over with hair, and my biggest problem is how to make my new hair blend in with the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>thicker.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>I would highly reccomend this and follow the instructions 3 pills 3 times a day.</li>
            <li>This requires taking three tablets daily and the pills are pretty large.</li>
            <li>Now, while I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge major difference in my hair yet, what I do know is that I have lesser hair falling out</li>
            <li>She is very pleased and she has only been using them a few days.  </li>
            <li>This product gives me hope that I can have normal hair, despite my condition.  </li>
            <li>I will edit my review after taking Hair Growth Essentials for a few more weeks.</li>
            <li>I had no adverse side effects and they were not hard to take.  </li>
            <li>supplements are about average pill size and are easy to swallow.</li>
            <li>I can see new growth at the roots and even some new hair growing right above my temples.</li>
            <li>and I swear I can feel my scalp tingling and have a lot of fuzzy new growth already.</li>
            <li>and I can see new hairs growing on my scalp.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried everything from continuing prenatal vitamins to new shampoo/conditioners, changes to my diet and nothing seem to help my hair.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that my scalp has new hair growth on it.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen any new hairs growing</li>
            <li>When I read the reviews on how well it worked for others in hair regrowth, the last thing I was expecting was huge flareups of acne and pimples all over my face after only taking ONE horse sized pill one day after receiving my order in the mail.</li>
            <li>but it is still very early</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t have a funny smell when you open the bottle.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m also taking biotin and niacin, so I&#x27;m not sure which one contributes to that the most.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not finished the bottle yet and still not sure how many pills to take per day as the label was covered up.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m withholding judgment until the full month is up, but I&#x27;ve noticed no real difference in hair growth since I started taking this.</li>
            <li>My hair is thick, and full!!</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t think 2 months is necessarily long enough to tell a huge difference</li>
            <li>Bought this for thinning hair to supplement with Biotin, it makes my hair feel softer, hair falls out less, and as an extra boost has made my skin look and feel much better and has cleared up my back/chest.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I&#x27;m not sure how it could be working so very quickly, but my hair does seem thicker, and I&#x27;m only on my first bottle.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m liking it so far...</li>
            <li>I plan to keep taking them for at least 2 more months in hopes to see results.</li>
            <li>All natural and made in the USA.  </li>
            <li>I also have to dye my hair because I&#x27;m too young for gray to show (or</li>
            <li>I have sensitive swallow tablets.</li>
            <li>My hair type- thin, straight, breaks easily.</li>
            <li>My \\&quot;shedding\\&quot; problem, while that still exists, is much less but the amazing part is how my hair is growing back where it previously was falling out.  </li>
            <li>Grows back healthy and thick.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product, sorry to doubt it before.  </li>
            <li>, I tried it steady all 20 days, no new hair.</li>
            <li>The pills are somewhat on the larger side, but went down pretty well with a glass of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My husband has suffered some hair loss due to having a high fever with viral meningitis for a couple weeks.  </li>
            <li>I have always had thin hair and it breaks easily</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now, and the change is amazing!  </li>
            <li> After trying so many vitamins This one is the best one.</li>
            <li> I understand that you have to take it that way to make sure you&#x27;re getting all the vitamins and you need the food to get the best benefit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the product is very good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be updating my review if I notice any changes (good or bad).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Good item at the price listed.</li>
            <li> and now I see  hair good product</li>
            <li> The seller has said to use it for 3 months to see good results.</li>
            <li> So i went searching online for a good hair growth vitamin</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a good sign in my book.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good vitamin, just didn&#x27;t notice anything with hair growth, etc.</li>
            <li> all reviews sound good so looking forward to some hair growth!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, exactly as described.</li>
            <li> They are healthy and shiny like never before!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Whatever blend of ingredients they use is the most effective product I&#x27;ve taken!</li>
            <li> Love this formula!</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s why I gave it 3 stars, but I will be sure to update it once I finish the bottle!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing product.</li>
            <li> Amazing~</li>
            <li> It was amazing.</li>
            <li> All opinions are my own and reflect my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I waited for a month (when bottle ran out) to do an honest evaluation.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about how great I feel and how great the product is!</li>
            <li> I received a discount on this product for an honest unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> i think 6 more months from now my hair will be gorgeous again.</li>
            <li> He liked it has lots of vitamins and nutrients.  </li>
            <li> but I have seen a nice difference since using these.</li>
            <li> but they were not as effective as this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these off and on since they were first released and still find them the best supplement to promote hair growth and to obtain a healthy head of hair.</li>
            <li> Very cool!</li>
            <li> Great product, quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Outstanding !!!!! A+A+A+ Can&#x27;t say enough good about the seller</li>
            <li> Very easy on the stomach.  </li>
            <li> I got these for my best friend she has gone into early menopause and is having issues with her hair.  </li>
            <li> First I want to say this is a great company.  </li>
            <li> it mostly lists out the vitamins and their make up for each supplement.</li>
            <li> I think these work better than pre natal vitamins i was taking to help my hair grow.</li>
            <li> I started noticing a bit of thickening in about three weeks and have enjoyed taking these supplements.  </li>
            <li> This product is great and really helps hair grow faster.</li>
            <li> Satisfied with my purchace I see  hair growing.</li>
            <li> This product has made my hair softer, more manageable, and it has grown since I started.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seen my hair looking better.</li>
            <li> RISK FREE FOR 90 DAYS!  </li>
            <li> This product is not only an awesome supplement for hair growth</li>
            <li> I have noticed greater hair growth and thickness since using this product.</li>
            <li> , however I can see now that it is getting longer and filling in more.</li>
            <li> I truthfully can&#x27;t tell yet if it is working.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I had a beautiful long gorgeous hair before and during my pregnancy</li>
            <li> This product has made my hair softer, more manageable, and it has grown 4 inches since I started.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seen my hair looking better.</li>
            <li> It took some convincing to get him to try it</li>
            <li> Another con is that it makes hair grow ALL over... not just your head :) ...</li>
            <li> I did receive this product free to test, but I can vouch that it works!  </li>
            <li> His hair appears more shiny and smoother.  </li>
            <li> He will gladly continue using.</li>
            <li> I will keep taking and will order more if it continues to show improvement, which I think it will.</li>
            <li> Be sure to drink PLENTY of water to avoid breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it :)</li>
            <li> Love the product  </li>
            <li> My husband is glad he took it</li>
            <li> Glad I purchased</li>
            <li> I notice that my nails look better &amp; are stronger.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not paying more money to find out.</li>
            <li> I received the opportunity to order this product through a promotion and I am glad I ordered it for her to  try.</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to having better hair.</li>
            <li> but my nails seem to be growing more and are not as brittle.</li>
            <li> Another great benefit that comes with taking biotin supplements for hair growth other than increase in length and strength is great hair color since this vitamin replenishes your roots and follicles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> So far, so good!  </li>
            <li> I love the vitamins and notice how much more strong and healthy my hair is since I&#x27;ve started using it.</li>
            <li> I already had a pretty good growth and thickness rate</li>
            <li> And this company is amazing too, to stand by their product like that and offer such great customer service.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much for a great product!</li>
            <li> Great so far!</li>
            <li> I give it 4 stars would be higher if I didn&#x27;t have to take so many pills which doesn&#x27;t seem cost effective with a bottle of 60.  </li>
            <li> He also had a bald spot on the top and it is completely filled</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite products for growing hair out quickly and healthy.</li>
            <li> Biotin ingredient was wayyyy too strong.</li>
            <li> There is definite improvement on top of his head with more hair coming in!!  </li>
            <li> I love being able to give my husband a natural alternative to the chemicals a lot of people use without having to formulate my own blend.</li>
            <li> They have many of the same ingredients as popular brands but have many more in addition.</li>
            <li> The most hair growth products I have got mostly are Biotin itself, but this bottle contains more necessary nutrition for hair growth which makes more sense that will get more results.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product more so as a &amp;#34;boost&amp;#34; to my own natural hair growth.</li>
            <li> I, personally, think these pills are working great.</li>
            <li> important thing to know is this:  the listing states that you can try it for 90 days risk-free.  </li>
            <li> NO, I did NOT get any free product for this evaluation.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy for my friend as she is experiencing a similar situation</li>
            <li> So far, good.</li>
            <li> I like taking them and so far my hair is looking good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> They even have a special where you buy two and get one free.  </li>
            <li> One of the main ingredients is biotin which plays a huge role in healthy, strong hair and nails.</li>
            <li> but I do believe its worth it!</li>
            <li> Worth the money!</li>
            <li> received this product for free for my true and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> However, if you&#x27;d like to see changes in the health of your hair its definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> So he was excited to try it.  </li>
            <li> Finished 1st bottle did see significant results debating on if I should try for another month</li>
            <li> Just received this purchase and Hubby is excited to try this supplement...</li>
            <li> I used to clean my hair brush couple times a day.</li>
            <li> I have noticed, after taking these for about a month, twice a day, my hair has grown about 2 inches, is softer, more manageable and much fuller.</li>
            <li> The owner sent me a message saying he had read my review and without even me asking he issued me a full refund.  </li>
            <li> and I start taking them with full mouth of water</li>
            <li> It is too early to rate how effective is the product.  </li>
            <li> Would it have worked if I had been able to go the whole 30?</li>
            <li> here are my results my nails got strong and grew which was amazing to see because me as a chronic nail biter never had actual gorgeous nails in my entire life!</li>
            <li> I bought this with great expectations due to the 5 star reviews...</li>
            <li> I saw results quickly.</li>
            <li> If anyone has any idea of a hair regrowth not so strong, but does the job I would certainly appreciate the comments.</li>
            <li> Noticed more new growth while taking these.</li>
            <li> Will come back for more updates!</li>
            <li> I love having the opportunity to take a natural product to improve myself.</li>
            <li> and it never seems to get any longer than right below my shoulders</li>
            <li> Lets just say my shower drains do not like me right now.  </li>
            <li> With results that quickly you can only expect more.  </li>
            <li> My hair gets to a certain length....and just stops!</li>
            <li> I have researched various supplements that will help with hair growth and was pleased to find that this one has them all as well as some I had not known about.</li>
            <li> and I definitely see an improvement to my bald spot on top of my head.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost through my first bottle.</li>
            <li> b) because I&#x27;m sure to see a noticeable difference I will have to purchase a second bottle</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried so many different products, some of which costs a lot.</li>
            <li> I admit I did not take these pills every day the first time around nor did I even finish the bottle.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It would be better if you only had to take one a day instead of two pills.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice anything different, but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Personally these pills work very well for me and because of the increased in my hair, I have more length retention.</li>
            <li> I ordered a bottle and took it religiously exactly as directed (3x a day, with meals, etc.), but after 30 days I am still losing just as much hair as before.</li>
            <li> it is also a multivitamin and may be able to replace your normal once a day supplement (Consult with your doctor first, I do not provide medical advisement).</li>
            <li> She used it for the past month and has said she feels better taking the supplement and her fingernails are much nicer looking and stronger, and she feels there are signs of more new hair.  </li>
            <li> It looked very promising based on the hundreds of positive reviews, and I was excited to find something that could potentially help with my hair loss.</li>
            <li> Because 60 capsules over 20 days is just not long enough to be sure of the results, I contacted the seller to confirm their guarantee, and sure enough...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say these are miracle hair growth pills but from my experience taking them they seem to have helped me.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping to regrow this embarrassing patch of baldness on the side of my hairline.</li>
            <li> This product really bothered me- not because of the ingredients, but because the packaging is incorrect.  </li>
            <li> It takes up to a month to really work and see a difference, so just be patient.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping this would work because of the guarantee and reviews I read</li>
            <li> I have noticed, since taking these pills, that when I brush my hair not as much is falling out.</li>
            <li> I really think this product works.</li>
            <li> but my nails are so much stronger.</li>
            <li> This is a very needed product by me.</li>
            <li> Made my whole body itch.</li>
            <li> I want to thanks to who did this things.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a problem taking these, but honestly it&#x27;s just like taking a regular daily vitamin.</li>
            <li> It contains 29 powerful natural ingredients that help grow new hair without any side effects.</li>
            <li> That means a new bottle would have to be purchased every 20 days!</li>
            <li> I am a healthy male in my mid 60&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Pregnant women and children should be well advised before starting any biotin regimen meant for hair growth.</li>
            <li> So far, he seems to like, but cannot really tell much yet.</li>
            <li> So glad to finally see my hair growing back in.</li>
            <li> My hair is growing in thick, and my scalp is even looking better!  </li>
            <li> it took time, but now, about 6 months after first discovering the two bald spots, they&#x27;re both completely grown over with hair, and my biggest problem is how to make my new hair blend in with the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> thicker.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I would highly reccomend this and follow the instructions 3 pills 3 times a day.</li>
            <li> This requires taking three tablets daily and the pills are pretty large.</li>
            <li> Now, while I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge major difference in my hair yet, what I do know is that I have lesser hair falling out</li>
            <li> She is very pleased and she has only been using them a few days.  </li>
            <li> This product gives me hope that I can have normal hair, despite my condition.  </li>
            <li> I will edit my review after taking Hair Growth Essentials for a few more weeks.</li>
            <li> I had no adverse side effects and they were not hard to take.  </li>
            <li> supplements are about average pill size and are easy to swallow.</li>
            <li> I can see new growth at the roots and even some new hair growing right above my temples.</li>
            <li> and I swear I can feel my scalp tingling and have a lot of fuzzy new growth already.</li>
            <li> and I can see new hairs growing on my scalp.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried everything from continuing prenatal vitamins to new shampoo/conditioners, changes to my diet and nothing seem to help my hair.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my scalp has new hair growth on it.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any new hairs growing</li>
            <li> When I read the reviews on how well it worked for others in hair regrowth, the last thing I was expecting was huge flareups of acne and pimples all over my face after only taking ONE horse sized pill one day after receiving my order in the mail.</li>
            <li> but it is still very early</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t have a funny smell when you open the bottle.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m also taking biotin and niacin, so I&#x27;m not sure which one contributes to that the most.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not finished the bottle yet and still not sure how many pills to take per day as the label was covered up.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m withholding judgment until the full month is up, but I&#x27;ve noticed no real difference in hair growth since I started taking this.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, and full!!</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t think 2 months is necessarily long enough to tell a huge difference</li>
            <li> Bought this for thinning hair to supplement with Biotin, it makes my hair feel softer, hair falls out less, and as an extra boost has made my skin look and feel much better and has cleared up my back/chest.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;m not sure how it could be working so very quickly, but my hair does seem thicker, and I&#x27;m only on my first bottle.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m liking it so far...</li>
            <li> I plan to keep taking them for at least 2 more months in hopes to see results.</li>
            <li> All natural and made in the USA.  </li>
            <li> I also have to dye my hair because I&#x27;m too young for gray to show (or</li>
            <li> I have sensitive swallow tablets.</li>
            <li> My hair type- thin, straight, breaks easily.</li>
            <li> My \\&quot;shedding\\&quot; problem, while that still exists, is much less but the amazing part is how my hair is growing back where it previously was falling out.  </li>
            <li> Grows back healthy and thick.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product, sorry to doubt it before.  </li>
            <li> , I tried it steady all 20 days, no new hair.</li>
            <li> The pills are somewhat on the larger side, but went down pretty well with a glass of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My husband has suffered some hair loss due to having a high fever with viral meningitis for a couple weeks.  </li>
            <li> I have always had thin hair and it breaks easily</li>
            <li> He started using right away and has noticed a little less shedding.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been taking the product long enough to know if it works or not yet.</li>
            <li> I have been taking it long enough to recognize the results in strengthening my hair, which reduced breakage and promoting growth.</li>
            <li> and well being I just don&#x27;t think I want to add 3 large horse sized pills to boot unless I am going to have really thick luxurious locks to show for it.</li>
            <li> My hair is long to my waist.</li>
            <li> started taking these pills not too long after I had my daughter since I was losing my hair.</li>
            <li> I started this product as directed religiously, and in conjunction with some other vitamins, and it worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> then it&#x27;s been in a long time!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been taking this product for very long but I am looking forward to longer, stronger, healthier hair.</li>
            <li> and I have definitely noticed a lot less since taking this.</li>
            <li> I have a little bit of a hard time swallowing the large pills and it requires them to be taken 3 times a day.</li>
            <li> At first I was a bit skeptical as I didn&#x27;t see any results, but now I&#x27;m starting to notice a few changes.</li>
            <li> Before taking this product I had two small stress-related bald spots I wanted to regrow as quickly as possible.</li>
            <li> I take two daily for the past couple weeks.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first</li>
            <li> I take two daily for the past 5 months.</li>
            <li> With the other supplements I take for all around health</li>
            <li> but I am almost through the bottle and it isn&#x27;t a a night and day difference from my normal thin hair.</li>
            <li> I have thinking due to pcos and within a month I had fuller thicker hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other uupplements out there</li>
            <li> Will buy another bottle but  not convinced to my satisfaction, although it costs less than other brand used.</li>
            <li> and I have been seeing less hair falling out in the shower.</li>
            <li> but since I started taking this supplement I have noticed less breaking and softer hair.</li>
            <li> There seems to be less hair on the floor</li>
            <li> I have noticed that I have less hair falling out</li>
            <li> This was purchased for a friend that previously had taken medication that causes some hair loss.  </li>
            <li> and my nails are so weak, they actually bend without breaking.</li>
            <li> I have been taking this for a little over a week.</li>
            <li> I feel as if the lost bounce and shine over the coloring &amp; bleaching that was missing for years, has now came back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I have naturally blonde, thin hair</li>
            <li> The reason for 4 stars is a) because it took a while to start working (I&#x27;m impatient) and</li>
            <li> /&gt;i took this for 2 months and a few weeks.</li>
            <li> But I have also stopped using harsh chemicals and sulfate shampoos.</li>
            <li> I have it for a few years.</li>
            <li> I see less hair in my comb and it slowly appears to be thicker.  </li>
            <li> My hair is terribly damaged because of all the bleaching that I have done over the years and now it just feels better; Neither brittle nor lifeless.</li>
            <li> No more hair loss for me.</li>
            <li> My hair grows faster than usual with this stuff.</li>
            <li> They did not taste bad and they were not hard to take.  </li>
            <li> The pills are hard vitamin pills (not gel caps).</li>
            <li> She is having a hard time with breakage and dryness.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s extremely hard for me to take pills 3 times a day with food.  </li>
            <li> i always at least took one pill even though it calls for two daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> at least that&#x27;s my opinion anyway).  </li>
            <li> My nails are growing like crazy too, but I have to keep them clipped short because of my job.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However It is too late now</li>
            <li> Not what I signed up for, and not very happy.        </li>
            <li> Took it only for a few days since it was really hard on my stomach and made me sick, I contacted the seller for a refund since they promised &amp;#34;money back guaranteed&amp;#34; and never got a refund nor the label to return their crap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little expensive</li>
            <li> I am in my mid 40&#x27;s and my hair is thinning to the point where it is driving me crazy!  </li>
            <li> Sorry</li>

            <li> My hair use to fall out like crazy while styling</li>
            <li> but unfortunately, I did not see a difference :(</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong here!</li>
            <li> that biotin does not work for everybody and one should consult the doctor to rule out health conditions that could put him or her at a risk of developing unpleasant side effects.</li>
            <li> Not too bad</li>
            <li> My hair was thinning really bad</li>
            <li> so was too bad.</li>

            <li> As soon as these pills arrived in the mail, I immediately started taking them. I took 3 pills a day; I took them with breakfast, lunch and dinner. The pills are somewhat on the larger side, but went down pretty well with a glass of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed a difference in my nails already. I am trying to grow them out and my nails are so weak, they actually bend without breaking. They are starting to become thicker and stronger and I could not be happier. Now, while I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge major difference in my hair yet, what I do know is that I have lesser hair falling out and it seems as if my hair is starting to become stronger. My hair is terribly damaged because of all the bleaching that I have done over the years and now it just feels better; Neither brittle nor lifeless. I feel as if the lost bounce and shine over the coloring &amp; bleaching that was missing for years, has now came back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the seller for evaluation purposes</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say these are miracle hair growth pills but from my experience taking them they seem to have helped me. I&#x27;ve been taking them every day for a week and my hair looks shinier, feels softer and I have been seeing less hair falling out in the shower. I haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable length added to my hair, but I think it&#x27;s too soon to tell.&lt;br /&gt;These supplements are about average pill size and are easy to swallow. I gave these supplements a 4 star rating only because I haven&#x27;t seen a noticeable change in length. I&#x27;ll be updating my review if I notice any changes (good or bad).&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product at a promotional price for product review purposes. All opinions are my own and reflect my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> you see results in a week</li>
            <li> Great information and tips on how to use it. I have researched various supplements that will help with hair growth and was pleased to find that this one has them all as well as some I had not known about. I love being able to give my husband a natural alternative to the chemicals a lot of people use without having to formulate my own blend.</li>
            <li> I just recently started taking Hair Growth Essentials. In the short time I have been taking it I&#x27;ve noticed a difference. I have always had thin hair and it breaks easily but since I started taking this supplement I have noticed less breaking and softer hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, exactly as described. Recommended!</li>
            <li> Per the instructions, you will need to take 3 a day.  I like that it mostly lists out the vitamins and their make up for each supplement.</li>
            <li> I, personally, think these pills are working great. My hair gets to a certain length....and just stops! I have noticed, after taking these for about a month, twice a day, my hair has grown about 2 inches, is softer, more manageable and much fuller. I will be buying these again. I have not had any side affects at all. I think these work better than pre natal vitamins i was taking to help my hair grow. Thanks so much for a great product!</li>
            <li> Good item at the price listed.</li>
            <li> If been taking it for 2 weeks now and I swear I can feel my scalp tingling and have a lot of fuzzy new growth already. I highly recommend this product. I will keep taking it.</li>
            <li> So far, so good!  I&#x27;m not as compliant as I should be...but I try to remember to take these two or three times a day as recommended by the seller.  Honestly, I&#x27;m not sure how it could be working so very quickly, but my hair does seem thicker, and I&#x27;m only on my first bottle.  I&#x27;ll see my niece / hairdresser tomorrow...so, we&#x27;ll see what she says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One important thing to know is this:  the listing states that you can try it for 90 days risk-free.  Because 60 capsules over 20 days is just not long enough to be sure of the results, I contacted the seller to confirm their guarantee, and sure enough...they stand by this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I&#x27;m liking it so far...I&#x27;m DEFINITELY ordering it again!</li>
            <li> This is a great product! Recommend!</li>
            <li> Dogs seem to being well with the product.</li>
            <li> I waited for a month (when bottle ran out) to do an honest evaluation.  My wife who cuts my hair and I definitely see an improvement to my bald spot on top of my head.  I will continue using and will re-order.  NO, I did NOT get any free product for this evaluation.  I am a healthy male in my mid 60&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> When I read the reviews on how well it worked for others in hair regrowth, the last thing I was expecting was huge flareups of acne and pimples all over my face after only taking ONE horse sized pill one day after receiving my order in the mail. Biotin ingredient was wayyyy too strong. When they labeled Maximum strength they weren&#x27;t kidding :(. Wish I could get my money back,but threw away box and receipt. I was really hoping to regrow this embarrassing patch of baldness on the side of my hairline. If anyone has any idea of a hair regrowth not so strong, but does the job I would certainly appreciate the comments. Thank you</li>
            <li> Great product, quick shipping.</li>
            <li> This product really bothered me- not because of the ingredients, but because the packaging is incorrect.  When you look at the &amp;#34;Amount Per Serving&amp;#34; on the label, the heading states that it is in &amp;#34;% Daily Value.&amp;#34;  But the values listed are not in percentages, they are in mg, mcg, or IU.  Could I look up the daily values and calculate the percentages?  Yes.  Should I have to?  No.  I cannot support a product with such a glaring error on the packaging.</li>
            <li> Saw this product online an decided to try. I used to clean my hair brush couple times a day. And today I am cleaning it once a week. Not too bad</li>
            <li> Noticeable difference in hair. It took a couple weeks, but I got the desired results.</li>
            <li> this is a gift that I gave to my father. He likes the taste. because of short period of time using, he have not grown any hair yet. he is looking forward to it.</li>
            <li> ** received for review and inspection purposes **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a bunch of ingredients in this product that help with hair regrowth. The label looks almost like a multivitamin. I don&#x27;t have any hair loss so I gave it to my brother. He hasn&#x27;t seen a change yet, but as with these type of products, it may take time. I&#x27;ll update this if he sees improvements.</li>
            <li> After using it for 3 weeks, I can feel the change on my hair. My hair is long to my waist. They are healthy and shiny like never before!</li>
            <li> Very easy on the stomach.  I started noticing a bit of thickening in about three weeks and have enjoyed taking these supplements.  I had no adverse side effects and they were not hard to take.  They did not taste bad and they were not hard to take.  I would recommend these to anyone who would like  a boost in their hair growth!!</li>
            <li> No working after finished six bottles</li>
            <li> This is my second review. Great great product!! Can&#x27;t say enough about how great I feel and how great the product is!</li>
            <li> My husband saw NO RESULTS with this product!!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite products for growing hair out quickly and healthy. I took this for four months, taking 3 a day. This product is great and really helps hair grow faster. It&#x27;s a little expensive but I do believe its worth it!</li>
            <li> At this point, I can really only comment on the shipping and customer service. Which were both as promised and excellent.  I haven&#x27;t been taking the product long enough to know if it works or not yet. The pills are hard vitamin pills (not gel caps). They don&#x27;t have a funny smell when you open the bottle.  I plan to keep taking them for at least 2 more months in hopes to see results.</li>
            <li> I love the vitamins and notice how much more strong and healthy my hair is since I&#x27;ve started using it. No more hair loss for me. Worth the money!</li>
            <li> Before taking this product I had two small stress-related bald spots I wanted to regrow as quickly as possible. I started this product as directed religiously, and in conjunction with some other vitamins, and it worked like a charm. It does not work overnight - it took time, but now, about 6 months after first discovering the two bald spots, they&#x27;re both completely grown over with hair, and my biggest problem is how to make my new hair blend in with the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product. It looked very promising based on the hundreds of positive reviews, and I was excited to find something that could potentially help with my hair loss. I ordered a bottle and took it religiously exactly as directed (3x a day, with meals, etc.), but after 30 days I am still losing just as much hair as before. I guess it&#x27;s back to the drawing board...</li>
            <li> Satisfied with my purchace I see  hair growing. My hair eas thining on the front and now I see  hair good product</li>
            <li> Bought this for thinning hair to supplement with Biotin, it makes my hair feel softer, hair falls out less, and as an extra boost has made my skin look and feel much better and has cleared up my back/chest.</li>
            <li> It definitely works! I have been taking it for about 3 months and has seen my hair get thicker.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing product. I have been using the product for last 2 months and I can see new hairs growing on my scalp. The seller has said to use it for 3 months to see good results. But I can say that it has worked for me.</li>
            <li> I take two daily for the past couple weeks.This product has made my hair softer, more manageable, and it has grown since I started. I&#x27;ve never seen my hair looking better. I don&#x27;t use heat on my hair anymore either so I think all of those things have helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started taking these pills not too long after I had my daughter since I was losing my hair. There seems to be less hair on the floor too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free for my true and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I got these for my best friend she has gone into early menopause and is having issues with her hair.  She is having a hard time with breakage and dryness. She is very pleased and she has only been using them a few days.  She has not had to moisturize daily.  the last two days.  With results that quickly you can only expect more.  RISK FREE FOR 90 DAYS!  All natural and made in the USA.  They even have a special where you buy two and get one free.  The pills are not huge or nasty  and vegan.  i don&#x27;t see any cons with this supplement neither does my friend. I received a discount on this product for an honest unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Excellent product at a great price that was delivered in about 3 days. Outstanding !!!!! A+A+A+ Can&#x27;t say enough good about the seller</li>
            <li> This product is not only an awesome supplement for hair growth it is also a multivitamin and may be able to replace your normal once a day supplement (Consult with your doctor first, I do not provide medical advisement). There are 90 pills in a bottle which is 30 servings. This requires taking three tablets daily and the pills are pretty large. I haven&#x27;t been taking this product for very long but I am looking forward to longer, stronger, healthier hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m withholding judgment until the full month is up, but I&#x27;ve noticed no real difference in hair growth since I started taking this. Your mileage may vary. I take it as the directions say, and I&#x27;ve been diligent in taking the recommended dose. I have a hair cut I absolutely hate and can&#x27;t wait for my hair to grow out. I&#x27;m hoping this speeds it along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also--although my hair doesn&#x27;t seem to be growing faster, it does seem stronger, and isn&#x27;t falling out at the same rate. But I&#x27;m also taking biotin and niacin, so I&#x27;m not sure which one contributes to that the most.</li>
            <li> Hair growing like crazy.After trying so many vitamins This one is the best one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not finished the bottle yet and still not sure how many pills to take per day as the label was covered up.  I take 2 pills at night so it stays in my system over night.  I see less hair in my comb and it slowly appears to be thicker.  Will buy another bottle but  not convinced to my satisfaction, although it costs less than other brand used.</li>
            <li> I have noticed greater hair growth and thickness since using this product. It takes up to a month to really work and see a difference, so just be patient. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I saw delivered, but I didn&#x27;t see it. Sorry</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any hair regrowth but have only been taking for a month.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost through my first bottle. At first I was a bit skeptical as I didn&#x27;t see any results, but now I&#x27;m starting to notice a few changes. I can see new growth at the roots and even some new hair growing right above my temples. I have naturally blonde, thin hair and it never seems to get any longer than right below my shoulders, however I can see now that it is getting longer and filling in more. The reason for 4 stars is a) because it took a while to start working (I&#x27;m impatient) and b) because I&#x27;m sure to see a noticeable difference I will have to purchase a second bottle and it is a bit on the expensive side. However, if you&#x27;d like to see changes in the health of your hair its definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> May not work for everyone but it is working well for me by restoring a bald spot . Excellent product</li>
            <li> My hair was thinning really bad and I&#x27;ve tried so many different products, some of which costs a lot. Since I&#x27;ve been using this product for several months I see a difference in the thickness of my hair and it&#x27;s also stopped shedding.</li>
            <li> I waited until I had one day left of supply to review. I was really hoping this would work because of the guarantee and reviews I read but unfortunately, I did not see a difference :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the product is very good but it&#x27;s extremely hard for me to take pills 3 times a day with food.  With my work sometimes I don&#x27;t even get to a meal.  I understand that you have to take it that way to make sure you&#x27;re getting all the vitamins and you need the food to get the best benefit.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product discounted for review this in no way makes my review biased. Great product! My energy level is up my hair it&#x27;s shiny and healthier then it&#x27;s been in a long time! Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I bought this with great expectations due to the 5 star reviews... Took it only for a few days since it was really hard on my stomach and made me sick, I contacted the seller for a refund since they promised &amp;#34;money back guaranteed&amp;#34; and never got a refund nor the label to return their crap. Bad product, worse customer service</li>
            <li> Hair Growth Essentials #1 Rated Hair Loss Supplement for Women and Men I truthfully can&#x27;t tell yet if it is working.  I have noticed that I have less hair falling out and that is a plus.  Only thing I did not like is having to take 3 pills instead of just 1 pill per day!  I will review again once I finish the bottle and see if there is a visible improvement and see if my hair improves in growth and no hair loss at all!  I give it 4 stars would be higher if I didn&#x27;t have to take so many pills which doesn&#x27;t seem cost effective with a bottle of 60.  That means a new bottle would have to be purchased every 20 days!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I was a bit skeptical at first but I&#x27;ve used it for 2 months now and I can feel the difference.  My hair is fuller and shinier. It has grown some as well. I will buy this stuff again. I&#x27;ve tried all on the market</li>
            <li> I had a beautiful long gorgeous hair before and during my pregnancy then i had my son and my hair thinned and wasn&#x27;t growing like it used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried everything from continuing prenatal vitamins to new shampoo/conditioners, changes to my diet and nothing seem to help my hair. So i went searching online for a good hair growth vitamin and this one had the best reviews so i figured hey what to i have to lose right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i took this for 2 months and a few weeks. i always at least took one pill even though it calls for two daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here are my results my nails got strong and grew which was amazing to see because me as a chronic nail biter never had actual gorgeous nails in my entire life! Now my hair did stop shedding which was also great and i found that the spots that had thinned are growing back finally. i don&#x27;t think 2 months is necessarily long enough to tell a huge difference but i can say it has helped and i noticed not only my nail improvement but my hair finally is making a comeback.  i think 6 more months from now my hair will be gorgeous again.</li>
            <li> Actually, it does not work to me</li>
            <li> I was recommended Hair Growth Essentials by a friend who swore by these pills.  I am in my mid 40&#x27;s and my hair is thinning to the point where it is driving me crazy!  Lets just say my shower drains do not like me right now.  I&#x27;m happy for my friend as she is experiencing a similar situation and it obviously worked for her but this product simply did not work for me.  No growth, no results, nada. Not what I signed up for, and not very happy.        UPDATE!!!!!!  10/10/14      First I want to say this is a great company.  The owner sent me a message saying he had read my review and without even me asking he issued me a full refund.  He also provided some helpful tips on how to use the product and if I wanted to give it another shot he&#x27;d be happy to send me a bottle at no charge.  His only stipulation is that I had to take the entire bottle and I couldn&#x27;t miss a day.  I admit I did not take these pills every day the first time around nor did I even finish the bottle.  So, I took him up on his generous offer and one month later...yes one month!!, my hair is filling in at an incredible rate now!  My \\&quot;shedding\\&quot; problem, while that still exists, is much less but the amazing part is how my hair is growing back where it previously was falling out.  This is an amazing product, sorry to doubt it before.  And this company is amazing too, to stand by their product like that and offer such great customer service.  You cannot go wrong here!</li>
            <li> I take two daily for the past 5 months. This product has made my hair softer, more manageable, and it has grown 4 inches since I started. I&#x27;ve never seen my hair looking better. But I have also stopped using harsh chemicals and sulfate shampoos. I don&#x27;t use heat on my hair anymore either so I think all of those things have helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hair Growth Essentials has also helped my husbands hair too. It took some convincing to get him to try it but he&#x27;s been taking it now for 3 months and his thinning has improved A LOT! He also had a bald spot on the top and it is completely filled in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be better if you only had to take one a day instead of two pills. Another con is that it makes hair grow ALL over... not just your head :) ... My husband and I both notice it. But it is manageable so the pros definitely outweigh that con.</li>
            <li> Noticed more new growth while taking these. Received at discount for review purposes.</li>
            <li> I have damaged hair because of the shampoo I have to use for seborrhic dermatitis.  I also have to dye my hair because I&#x27;m too young for gray to show (or at least that&#x27;s my opinion anyway).  I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now, and the change is amazing!  I did receive this product free to test, but I can vouch that it works!  My hair is growing in thick, and my scalp is even looking better!  This product gives me hope that I can have normal hair, despite my condition.  My nails are growing like crazy too, but I have to keep them clipped short because of my job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever blend of ingredients they use is the most effective product I&#x27;ve taken!</li>
            <li> My husband has suffered some hair loss due to having a high fever with viral meningitis for a couple weeks.  The doctor said hair loss can be a side effect for up to 9 months.  My husband loves his hair and doesn&#x27;t want to start losing it now.  So he was excited to try it.  He liked it has lots of vitamins and nutrients.  He started using right away and has noticed a little less shedding.  No side effects.  His hair appears more shiny and smoother.  He will gladly continue using.</li>
            <li> Everyone knows that changes in hair growth take time before you can see them. I have noticed, since taking these pills, that when I brush my hair not as much is falling out. That&#x27;s a good sign in my book.</li>
            <li> I really think this product works. I started taking it about 4 weeks ago and have noticed a lot of baby hairs growing on my hairline. My hair use to fall out like crazy while styling and I have definitely noticed a lot less since taking this. I will keep taking and will order more if it continues to show improvement, which I think it will.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product more so as a &amp;#34;boost&amp;#34; to my own natural hair growth. I already had a pretty good growth and thickness rate but I have seen a nice difference since using these. They have many of the same ingredients as popular brands but have many more in addition. One of the main ingredients is biotin which plays a huge role in healthy, strong hair and nails. You can find lots of info about it on the web. Personally these pills work very well for me and because of the increased in my hair, I have more length retention. Be sure to drink PLENTY of water to avoid breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Continued use of biotin for a period of about 6 months results in healthier hair follicles translating into stronger, longer and fuller hair. There is reduced hair breakage meaning that hair will grow longer in a shorter period. Another great benefit that comes with taking biotin supplements for hair growth other than increase in length and strength is great hair color since this vitamin replenishes your roots and follicles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that biotin does not work for everybody and one should consult the doctor to rule out health conditions that could put him or her at a risk of developing unpleasant side effects. Pregnant women and children should be well advised before starting any biotin regimen meant for hair growth.</li>
            <li> Finished 1st bottle did see significant results debating on if I should try for another month</li>
            <li> My hair type- thin, straight, breaks easily. I tried taking biotin, I tried viviscal and while both worked, they bothered my bladder. This stuff is great. I can take just one tablet or two (which is the recommended dose). My hair grows faster than usual with this stuff. I add in additional calcium and that also gives it a kick. If you&#x27;re going to use something, use this.</li>
            <li> I got this product for my husband.  He has been taking it for about 3 weeks now and he is doing a happy dance!  There is definite improvement on top of his head with more hair coming in!!  I have a feeling he is going to be taking this the rest of his life!</li>
            <li> Gave to a follicle challenged friend. So far, he seems to like, but cannot really tell much yet.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, and full!!</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my scalp has new hair growth on it. Very cool! Also it seems that my nails look healthier. I will continue to use it :)</li>
            <li> Just received this purchase and Hubby is excited to try this supplement...all reviews sound good so looking forward to some hair growth!</li>
            <li> Great deal!  Quality product!</li>
            <li> I waited a few days to post the review to see if I could tell a difference, I can&#x27;t really in my hair but my nails are so much stronger. I would highly reccomend this and follow the instructions 3 pills 3 times a day.</li>
            <li> Great so far! Starting to see a difference!</li>
            <li> Love this formula! It contains 29 powerful natural ingredients that help grow new hair without any side effects. Amazing~ The most hair growth products I have got mostly are Biotin itself, but this bottle contains more necessary nutrition for hair growth which makes more sense that will get more results. Can&#x27;t wait to see the result after a month supply! Will come back for more updates!</li>
            <li> I have a little bit of a hard time swallowing the large pills and it requires them to be taken 3 times a day. With the other supplements I take for all around health and well being I just don&#x27;t think I want to add 3 large horse sized pills to boot unless I am going to have really thick luxurious locks to show for it. Maybe it will work for someone else but I am almost through the bottle and it isn&#x27;t a a night and day difference from my normal thin hair.</li>
            <li> Love the product  I have thinking due to pcos and within a month I had fuller thicker hair</li>
            <li> Great product. My husband is glad he took it</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife. She just started using it yesterday. So we don&#x27;t know as yet if there is any benefit from the product. However the bottle says there are 30 servings and a serving is 3 capsules. There are only 60 capsules in the bottle not 90. Feel we were deceived.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking this supplement for two weeks now. So far, good. I will review again in 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> I like taking them and so far my hair is looking good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already seeing improvement thank you for creating it.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any new hairs growing but I noticed after about a month of using these vitamins my hair seems shinier and fuller. I like that this is a family owned company based in the USA and that the product is money back guaranteed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about four weeks now, and I must say I am seeing some results. My nails has been growing and my skin feels smoother, clearer, and healthier. I&#x27;m still waiting to see how it will work for my hair as it has only grown maybe an inch but it is still very early so that&#x27;s why I gave it 3 stars, but I will be sure to update it once I finish the bottle!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these off and on since they were first released and still find them the best supplement to promote hair growth and to obtain a healthy head of hair. I use them in conjunction with Biotin.</li>
            <li> So glad to finally see my hair growing back in. Glad I purchased</li>
            <li> This is a very needed product by me. It does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> I have been taking this vitamin supplement for several months now and can definitely see an improvement! I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other uupplements out there but they were not as effective as this one. I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a month. I notice that my nails look better &amp; are stronger. Haven&#x27;t notice any changes with my hair yet. It says it can take 2 to 3 months before noticing in your hair.</li>
            <li> It seems to be working. I will update my post in the future, after taking it for a longer time.</li>
            <li> When I place the order saw the label was capsule but when I received the order it is tablet.  I have sensitive swallow tablets. However It is too late now and I start taking them with full mouth of water so was too bad. It is too early to rate how effective is the product.  Delivered on time as always from Anazon.</li>
            <li> So I only got the 20-day, I tried it steady all 20 days, no new hair. Would it have worked if I had been able to go the whole 30? I don&#x27;t know, but I&#x27;m not paying more money to find out. I saw another review about getting a 20-day supply instead of 30, to the owners credit he did respond to that and said there was a mix-up, I was also one of those mix-ups.</li>
            <li> This product simply works! I have been taking it long enough to recognize the results in strengthening my hair, which reduced breakage and promoting growth. This one is a keeper!</li>
            <li> This was purchased for a friend that previously had taken medication that causes some hair loss.  She used it for the past month and has said she feels better taking the supplement and her fingernails are much nicer looking and stronger, and she feels there are signs of more new hair.  I received the opportunity to order this product through a promotion and I am glad I ordered it for her to  try.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I have been taking this for a little over a week. I already notice my nails getting stronger. I love having the opportunity to take a natural product to improve myself. My hair has gotten thinner after having my children. I am looking forward to having better hair. I will edit my review after taking Hair Growth Essentials for a few more weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month now and I see my hair is getting Thicker and stronger. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> It is a great vitamin, it helps with my hair and my nail. I have it for a few years. Great product. I saw results quickly.</li>
            <li> Made my whole body itch.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect like that.It was amazing.I want to thanks to who did this things.</li>
            <li> Grows back healthy and thick.</li>
            <li> Great quality product!</li>
            <li> Made quite a difference!!</li>
            <li> Been taking these pills for about a week. Haven&#x27;t seen any changes in my hair yet but my nails seem to be growing more and are not as brittle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice a difference</li>
            <li> No change after almost a month</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a problem taking these, but honestly it&#x27;s just like taking a regular daily vitamin. I don&#x27;t notice anything different, but that&#x27;s ok. It&#x27;s a good vitamin, just didn&#x27;t notice anything with hair growth, etc.</li>
