            <li>I love the Sebamed line of bath products.</li>

            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am able to comb through my hair without tangles for the most part after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(well, okay it&#x27;s a 99% botanic product or whatever).</li>
            <li>This product contains none of the objectionable chemicals of most conditioners on the market.</li>
            <li>This and the shampoo are great; my hair is softer and more manageable than with any other shampoo / conditioner I&#x27;ve used no matter what the brand.  </li>
            <li>Works great for my fine hair and dry scalp!  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair clean, without a greasy</li>
            <li>I use the whole line and am thoroughly satisfied with each product.</li>
            <li>My hair does not seem to get oily so quickly.</li>
            <li>This is the first review I have ever written</li>
            <li>I would be interested to hear if it does not thrill a customer because I have noticed family members now using my conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love this product and can only recommend it.</li>
            <li>This conditioner does exactly what it states - conditions, makes hair controlled and shiny.</li>
            <li>It really calms the scalp.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like these products.</li>
            <li>I lost a ton of hair just trying to comb it and am honestly surprised about all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice anything different while using this product and honestly its extremely overpriced for the size of the bottle.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li>Despite the shampoo really being awesome for the scalp (and for a long thime the only shampoo I could use), the conditioner failed completely.</li>
            <li>I have tried everything and this is the ONLY product that really works.</li>
            <li>The mint and rosemary are naturally fragrant.</li>
            <li>Does what it is supposed to and lets my 9 year old</li>
            <li>but I had to share my experience with this product because it is the only one that I have found that works with my now very very sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li>It def isn&#x27;t soapy but as far as the condition of my hair it definitely help with my scalp</li>

            <li> See my review for the shampoo as to the over whelming scent issue....it did not weigh the hair down but it did not by any means make soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> I have dry hair</li>
            <li> I have facial moisturizer co 10 and regular mousturizer, and they are good, however, this conditioner is one of the worst ones I have tried.</li>
            <li> They are ph balanced so they are never too harsh on hair and skin.</li>
            <li> Not only was it irritating on my scalp, but it didn&#x27;t condition at all.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair feeling and looking like dry shreeded beef, not a good look for you hair, I threw it in the thrash.</li>
            <li> no more rash itchy flakes</li>
            <li> My hair felt stiff and hard to work with.</li>
            <li> Well, it does not weigh my thin, oily hair down.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I did not like this conditioner for my hair.  My hair felt stiff and hard to work with.</li>
            <li> I like all of their products...the shampoo, the conditioner, the bar soap, the body soap and the baby lotion / cream. My skin responds so well to them. I have been using these products for over three months and find that they support the over all wellbeing of my skin, hair and scalp. I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Works Well, it does not weigh my thin, oily hair down.  So I am enjoying the product.  My hair does not seem to get oily so quickly.</li>
            <li> This is the first review I have ever written but I had to share my experience with this product because it is the only one that I have found that works with my now very very sensitive scalp. I have tried everything and this is the ONLY product that really works. It really calms the scalp. The mint and rosemary are naturally fragrant. I would be interested to hear if it does not thrill a customer because I have noticed family members now using my conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love the Sebamed line of bath products. They are ph balanced so they are never too harsh on hair and skin. Getting them delivered to the door relieves me of having to search the aisles of department stores for the products. I use the whole line and am thoroughly satisfied with each product.</li>
            <li> This product is great but a bit pricy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is almost without scent which I love.  It leaves my hair clean, without a greasy feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am able to comb through my hair without tangles for the most part after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pH of the product has reduced scalp itching as well...</li>
            <li> I shopped around for best value on the SebaMed conditioner, it&#x27;s not the best smelling product, but it works great!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and good product!</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Love SebaMed!</li>
            <li> Best shampoo on the market</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice anything different while using this product and honestly its extremely overpriced for the size of the bottle.</li>
            <li> This and the shampoo are great; my hair is softer and more manageable than with any other shampoo / conditioner I&#x27;ve used no matter what the brand.  I only wish it came in a larger bottle.  I have dry hair and my husband has dandruff.  We each like the shampoo / conditioner combo.  Since he&#x27;s started using it, he has not had any dandruff at all.</li>
            <li> See my review for the shampoo as to the over whelming scent issue....it did not weigh the hair down but it did not by any means make soft and silky.  I really wanted to like these products.</li>
            <li> Works great for my fine hair and dry scalp!  I love this product and can only recommend it.</li>
            <li> The SebaMed shampoo literally stinks (well, okay it&#x27;s a 99% botanic product or whatever). I am thankful that they made this conditioner smell good so I won&#x27;t be worrying all day about stinky hair! This conditioner does exactly what it states - conditions, makes hair controlled and shiny. 5 stars well deserved, given that it is supposed to be a harmless product.</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to and lets my 9 year old do her own hair without me trying to comb through tangles.  Anything else and she gets a skin breakout.</li>
            <li> The seba med shampoo I use does not stink it is very good and clean feeling. I haven&#x27;t tried the conditioner yet</li>
            <li> I have facial moisturizer co 10 and regular mousturizer, and they are good, however, this conditioner is one of the worst ones I have tried. It leaves your hair feeling and looking like dry shreeded beef, not a good look for you hair, I threw it in the thrash. Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> It def isn&#x27;t soapy but as far as the condition of my hair it definitely help with my scalp</li>
            <li> Feels like I&#x27;m applying lotion on my scalp.</li>
            <li> best conditioner i have ever used i  also use their shampoo it got my scalp in shape no more rash itchy flakes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the anti-dandruff shampoo by Sebamed for years and always regretted that they didn&#x27;t offer a conditioner as well. Despite the shampoo really being awesome for the scalp (and for a long thime the only shampoo I could use), the conditioner failed completely. Not only was it irritating on my scalp, but it didn&#x27;t condition at all. I lost a ton of hair just trying to comb it and am honestly surprised about all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> This product contains none of the objectionable chemicals of most conditioners on the market.</li>
            <li> Sebamed are wonderful products.  I am a user and I recommend them.</li>
            <li> I got allergies in my forehead the 2 times I used. My forehead became red and stingy.</li>
