            <li>I am a fan of all things burts bees, but these wipes might be my favorite!</li>
            <li>Love these face wipes and all Burt&#x27;s Bees products!</li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>the Neutrogena towelettes are much better!</li>
            <li>I love these face wipes!</li>
            <li>my skin was pretty much perfect until about a year ago.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s pretty much perfect.</li>
            <li>Strong fragrance I am not to fond of but these work great.  </li>
            <li>People say that it is great, but I think it is too strong.</li>
            <li>these are amazing..</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are great at removing eye and lip makeup, including waterproof mascara and lip stains, so that&#x27;s a huge plus.</li>
            <li>They are amazing.</li>
            <li>Nice smell too.</li>
            <li>This cloth cleans well and smells nice.</li>
            <li>The wipe itself is nice, but I did find them to be stingy and drying.  </li>
            <li>I like the Pond&#x27;s wipes best for at night when I take off my makeup and really wash my face.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice too.</li>
            <li>Also, they save water so if you have a water bill (I don&#x27;t), that&#x27;s a nice bonus.</li>
            <li>Used it to remove makeup- if you&#x27;re using to get off eyeliner, it is effective but it stings your eyes.</li>
            <li>It sort of depends on what kind of eye makeup you&#x27;re wearing</li>
            <li>These towelettes are really nice - they don&#x27;t have an overly perfumey smell (they do have a sent</li>
            <li>i think its kind of nice.</li>
            <li>The reclosable case is nice too.</li>
            <li>Great product as are most of Burt Bees products (love their replenishing lip balm w/pomegranate too)...</li>
            <li>use subscribe &amp; save through Amazon Mom which is really nice.</li>
            <li>After using them, my face felt very clean!</li>
            <li>They clean well and smell great.</li>
            <li>Great for if you are in a hurry to clean your face.</li>
            <li>I am much impressed with this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty happy with it, but it&#x27;s not one of those products that is sure to suit everyone.(Cool water rinsing is always a good idea after cleansing with warm water as it helps contract your pores and thus protects your skin from dirt, oils, and polution.)  </li>
            <li>Felt nice and refreshing on my skin and cleaned out irritants effectively.  </li>
            <li>They work great and came quick</li>
            <li>Fragrance is light and pleasant.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;) Love it!</li>
            <li>They are lovely and the smell is nicely balanced and not overpowering</li>
            <li>They are a good size and smell fantastic.</li>
            <li>They also smell pleasant and clean well without irritation.  </li>
            <li>(Cool water rinsing is always a good idea after cleansing with warm water as it helps contract your pores and thus protects your skin from dirt, oils, and polution.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It gets makeup off easily too!</li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, smell great, and do a good job removing makeup.</li>
            <li>However, these wipes do a good job of making my face feel clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>They leave your face very clean (no residue) and they smell really nice - much better than the Garnier wipes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty happy with it, but it&#x27;s not one of those products that is sure to suit everyone.</li>
            <li>sure is refreshing to wash you face with something that gets your face clean and smells good, and is refreshing.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful cleansing towelettes that easily remove the days makeup and do not irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The best thing about these wipes is the smell, theres this fresh citrus scent to them which is perfect after a hard days work.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s refreshing to use.</li>
            <li>and I think they removed my mascara more effectively, although they were much drier and did not smell as good as these.</li>

            <li>I love Burts Bees and these don&#x27;t disappoint.  </li>
            <li>I mostly use these when I am traveling so that I don&#x27;t leave eye makeup on washcloths at friends&#x27; and families&#x27; homes.</li>

            <li>Love these guys.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Burt&#x27;s Bees product for many years now.  </li>
            <li>I keep a pack in my camping stuff stuff and some with my off road vehicles for getting the dust off your face after enjoying the out doors.</li>
            <li>You could just use baby wipes but in my opinion these feel much better afterward.</li>
            <li>It cleans my face well, gets most of the makeup off.</li>
            <li>and you can visibly see more dirt come off onto the towel.  </li>

            <li>Love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li>My skin breaks out when using most &amp;#34;hand sanitizes&amp;#34;, but not these.  </li>
            <li>Love these face wipes.</li>

            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>I love them,</li>
            <li>gentle on my skin, great to remove make up, even mascara.</li>
            <li>I love having these in my car or for when I travel.</li>

            <li>(add some water and you&#x27;re OK again, though).  </li>
            <li>and I have purchased them more than once.</li>
            <li>If these had exfoliating nubbies they would definitely earn a 5, but still a really great value for the quality and quantity you get!</li>

            <li>Have used for several years, very good product, sooo convenient when traveling.</li>
            <li>these are a gift for someone in the military -- how handy!!!</li>
            <li>And I really WANT to like them, partly because they&#x27;re inexpensive, partly because they&#x27;re Burts Bees, and partly because they smell so dang good (</li>
            <li>I love Burts Bees, so I was excited when these wipes came out.</li>
            <li>great for hot summer days/on trips..or a quick clean up</li>
            <li>I love these - they remove makeup, smell good, all natural.  </li>
            <li>so I could wash my face easily  in the hospital.</li>

            <li>So easy to take off my make up.</li>
            <li>Make-up comes off easily and unlike this product, it does not burn your face nor have a strong scent.</li>
            <li>These particular towelettes are good...</li>
            <li>The scent is a bit strong, but I got over it.</li>
            <li>smelled waaaay too strong and medicine-y.  not for me.</li>
            <li>These are nice, good quality facial towelettes.  </li>
            <li>This works amazing and the scent is very soothing and not loaded with chemicals scents!</li>
            <li>so i tried these makeup remover wipes and at first my face felt so nice</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used two full packages, thinking I might like them better as I got used to them.  </li>

            <li>I loved them initially - great smell, leaves your skin clean feeling with no residue - but tried a few times searching for cheaper alternatives.  </li>
            <li>They are also great when I&#x27;m pressed for time or ready to drop in bed but need to wash my face first.  </li>
            <li>The are adequate, but there are much better ones to be had.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But when I saw that Burt&#x27;s Bees has a new facial wipe I had to try them, seeing as Burt&#x27;s Bees makes wonderful skin products that I LOVE.</li>
            <li>They smell fine to me - just a light \\&quot;cleaner\\</li>
            <li>It would be nice to have this product in a scentless version, or as scentless as these things can be, but it certainly isn&#x27;t a deal-breaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When it gets hot here in Houston it feels nice to clean my face on the go.</li>
            <li>This is a HUGE plus for these towelettes, the fact that they are \\&quot;99% natural\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>The facial wipes are handy, refreshing, and (most important for me) no toxic ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I am always have been such a great fan of burts bee.</li>
            <li>These burts bees wipes are not so harsh on the skin and they smell good too!!</li>
            <li>will note that these are smooth wipes.</li>
            <li>I liked them so much, I got my college student son a 2-pack</li>
            <li>use these before washing my face with cleanser and water, and this extra step has greatly improved my skin.</li>
            <li>I bought these to use in Afghanistan as running water isn&#x27;t always available.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and smells nice too.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t like these; they&#x27;re getting two stars because, yes, they effectively remove my eye makeup.</li>
            <li>Target recently increased the price of these to $7.20, so this is a great price for a two pack.</li>
            <li>I even use Burt&#x27;s Bees baby products and they are fantastic.</li>
            <li>These facial towelettes worked great for we while on deployment.  </li>
            <li>This is gentle yet effective.  </li>
            <li>This saves me a step, cleans better than the Noxzema and leaves my face feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t like the way they smelled, and the more I used them the more I broke out.  </li>
            <li>Towelette is made of a good material and solution does the job as far as cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Not the greatest for makeup removal unit I really like them overall and will continue to use them.</li>
            <li>I put some on and it starting to feel better already!!</li>
            <li>I very rarely wear makeup</li>
            <li>These wipes keep my face clean and free of grease.  </li>
            <li>but these are really quick and easy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m slowly but surely getting and loving more and more and more of their products.  </li>
            <li>Kept my face feeling fresh and clean!</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more very soon!</li>
            <li>seem to be more consistent with the rest of my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used Burt&#x27;s Bees products in the past and have alway been very happy with them.  </li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees towelettes are made of natural ingredients, are nice and soft on the skin, and smell really good.</li>
            <li>They smell great, leave you feeling clean but not greasy nor stripped dry either.  </li>
            <li>clean my face every day before bed.  </li>
            <li>I use these to clean my face after shaving or just whenever.  </li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t like the way my skin feels after using them, a bit sticky and not the clean feeling</li>
            <li>These wiped leave my face feeling clean, which is all I could ask for.</li>
            <li>Clean scent, doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling soapy after use.</li>
            <li>Prior to using this I really liked the No. 7 wipes, but these are much better.</li>
            <li>Both leave my skin feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>leaves my face feeling clean</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how cool and refreshing these are on a hot summer day.</li>
            <li>I started using the Garnier ones which were OK, but these are far better.</li>
            <li>These work well as they seem to clean well.</li>
            <li>The smell is great, a nice refreshing, clean smell; and the white tea helps soothe my skin when it gets dry or irritated.  </li>
            <li>They do not leave a filmy feeling on my skin, it just feels clean.</li>
            <li>The packaging is excellent - not only is there the sticky tab over the opening (which normally wears out halfway through the package), but there is also a plastic snap tab so that they will stay moist and fresh from beginning to end.  </li>
            <li>I love most of their products and this facial cleansing towelettes works pretty good and cleans my face really well when I have make-up on.</li>
            <li>And, I might add the price is right!</li>
            <li>And honestly, if your skin is even a little bit sensitive (I&#x27;ve got very fair, sunburn-prone skin)</li>
            <li>, they have a slight and pleasant smell to them... not overpowering, and they get most of my make-up off...</li>
            <li>, my skin was super dry and peeling, which is uncommon for me.</li>
            <li>Thanks Burt&#x27;s for coming out with new all natural products, sure appreciate your product integrity!!!</li>
            <li>However,  once I used these my face turned bright red and burnt.</li>
            <li>They make my face so nice and soft.</li>
            <li>The Burt&#x27;s Bees ones leave my skin feeling sticky and sweet (and sometimes even make my skin sting).  </li>
            <li>If find that these work very well for refreshing your face.</li>
            <li>I have always used and loved Neutrogena&#x27;s facial cleaning towelettes, but</li>
            <li>They work surprisingly well to get deeply ingrained gunk off of me.</li>
            <li>They wipe off the makeup with ease and they are always cool.</li>
            <li>the scent is a sort of sweet</li>
            <li>This facial wipes are superior to anything I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>These are good make-up removal towelettes, and they definitely get the job done.</li>
            <li>So I was delighted to find them on Amazon for much cheaper than normal stores.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The towelettes are VERY soft and very easy on the skin.  </li>
            <li>I like the Burt&#x27;s Bees wipes best for the morning as just a fresh wipe clean, or when I have a \\&quot;light duty\\&quot; job such as cleaning smeared makeup from under my eyes and such.</li>
            <li>Perfect for when I&#x27;m feeling lazy!</li>
            <li>First of all, these have a really, really strong smell, and leave a filmy feeling on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to try this, but when I started wiping my face, the first thing that came to my mind was it smelled like a linens and towels at a cheap motel room.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You feel clean and fresh after using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>quick cleanser for the face, neck and ear areas.  </li>
            <li>and they were quickly shipped.</li>
            <li>I had used these facial wipes for several months when I saw a magazine article that said they had been voted as one of the best products by the readership.  </li>
            <li>I went on a binge and bought about 7 different kinds of facial cleansing towelettes, determined to find my perfect one.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and is more blemish free as well.</li>
            <li>This is important to me, as I am most sensitive to smells.  </li>
            <li>I keep these, along with a jar of my favorite moisturizer right by my bed so that when I am so sleepy I don&#x27;t want to traipse the 10 steps to the bathroom I can sit in bed, thoroughly cleanse my face with these gentle cleansing towelettes and apply my moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I have used these and about 3 other brands&#x27; version of wipes and these are by far the best for my skin (which is normal/combination).  </li>
            <li>I have tried many different products and this one is soft and does a good job.</li>
            <li>Also, these left some kind of residue on my skin that didn&#x27;t feel clean.</li>
            <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees lip products, and I am always trying new face wipes to remove my make-up.</li>
            <li>These are some pretty good Facial Cleansing wipes.</li>
            <li>They clean awesome, and theyre very sturdy and thick as well.</li>
            <li>so I know good skin care when I see it, and Burt&#x27;s Bees has always produced fantastic products (I highly recommend their Orange Facial Cleanser and Radiance SPF 15 Day Lotion, by the way).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it every day, but it&#x27;s a very quick, refreshing addition to any facial care.</li>
            <li>These clean really well and don&#x27;t cause skin irritation!</li>
            <li>I was looking for something that will clean my face throughout the day since I work in a hot environment.&lt;br /&gt;While</li>
            <li>These face wipes are gentle on the skin with a light (not overpowering)</li>
            <li>However, these facial cleansing towelettes are amazing -</li>
            <li>They are a nice pick me up, and i would definitely recommend.  </li>
            <li>commend Burt&#x27;s Bees for working so many organic &amp; natural ingredients into their products.</li>
            <li>Although my husband smelled them and thought they smelled lemony and minty and fresh, to me the scent is just like that of Pine Sol.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and many towelettes have not worked for me.</li>
            <li>It smells so fresh and floral.</li>
            <li>even my teenage son thinks so &amp;#34;what&#x27;s this nice smell all about&amp;#34; and I quote.</li>
            <li>Burts bees is also more natural than the rest.</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees leaves my face feeling fresh without feeling like I have lost a layer of skin.  </li>
            <li>oil-Leaving your skin soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>These have a fresh and fragrant smell.</li>
            <li>The actual product was nice.</li>
            <li>Face feels scrubbed fresh.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have been searching for the perfect lazy way to wash/</li>
            <li>They do make your skin tingle a little, but in a good clean feeling way.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product, other than the smell</li>
            <li>This is a good product, other than the smell</li>
            <li>These are going right in the trash.</li>
            <li>While this might be too soft to work for people that need a stronger abrasive, it&#x27;s perfect for sensitive, dry skin.</li>
            <li>and they seem to clean my face really well.  </li>
            <li>Your skin will feel very refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re just your average facial cleansing clothes, which are good at removing make-up and make for a quick, easy way to clean your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like the light, fresh scent and the large size of these cloths.</li>
            <li>Love these facial wipes; the smell is amazingly soothing and fresh - my face feels clean and brighter after each use.&lt;br /&gt;They do not have any oily residue like some other brands -</li>
            <li>I used these for months just because of the beautiful, relaxing white tea fragrance right after a long day at work</li>
            <li>I used to use aveeno&#x27;s positively radiant cleansing cloths which, while they worked wonderfully, they were full of chemicals (a variety of parabens) and i was really wary about prolonged use.</li>
            <li>To those who need a more powerful facial wipe, I would say go with Pond&#x27;s or something else altogether.</li>
            <li>To those who need a more powerful facial wipe, I would say go with Pond&#x27;s or something else altogether.</li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t strong but if you&#x27;re looking for no fragrance try the sensitive skin version.</li>
            <li>For those that the natural ingredients matter to, these would likely be good for.</li>
            <li>I originally bought to take to the hospital to wash my face while staying there after spinal surgery, but after I got home and realized I cannot bend over the sink to wash my face normally (at night), so I am using these towelettes.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m guessing my skin type just didn&#x27;t like them very much.</li>
            <li>Not only easy to carry on trips but does an extraordinary job in cleaning your face of makeup.</li>
            <li>price is a bit higher than Pond&#x27;s</li>
            <li>If I use two, which is how many I like to use when wearing a lot of makeup, my skin turns red, and starts to sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can scrub all you&#x27;d like, but I think you will just end up peeling off your first layer of dermis.  </li>
            <li>I thought they smelled a bit like mop soap or kitchen cleaner at first.</li>
            <li>The smell is refreshing and does the trick of both cleaning and moisturizing without having to tote along multiple product.</li>
            <li>I do like them more than the white tea ones - both the scent and the way they work.  </li>
            <li>Going somewhere where I didn&#x27;t have access to a hot shower ever day made these a life saver.</li>
            <li>This has definitely become a favorite for me.</li>
            <li>I usually love all things Burt&#x27;s Bees, but I&#x27;m not a  fan of these facial wipes.</li>
            <li>Now my face is completely acne free.</li>
            <li>First off, I could not stand the smell.</li>
            <li>course, in a pinch they can be used for any other \\&quot;wiping\\&quot; need, which makes them quite handy when traveling.</li>
            <li>These clean off make up better than any other cleansing cloth I have used!  </li>
            <li>And, they clean well and leave my face soft.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t stand the residue left by Neutrogena&#x27;s and once the package was used I tried Pond&#x27;s, which has a lovely scent (I much preferred</li>
            <li>Now mind you, I don&#x27;t wear makeup very often, but on the rare occasion when I do, these don&#x27;t really do the trick taking it off...</li>
            <li>My one complaint is that I wish there were more than 30 per package; a two month supply would be more sustainable.</li>
            <li>Though they are a great size, moistened well, and I like other Burt&#x27;s Bees products, these wipes stung and burned on my skin, especially my eyes.</li>
            <li>The smell is a bit overpowering; it seems fine at first, then you realize that you don&#x27;t want to open them because you know what the smell inside is.  </li>
            <li>Gentle wipes with a great subtle fragrance.</li>
            <li>Package is overstuffed, so it&#x27;s easy to pull out two when you only wanted one.  </li>
            <li>With this arrangement, the towelettes stay wet long after opening -- which is great, since this package has a lot of towelettes in it.</li>
            <li>The wipes are easy to use, don&#x27;t have a funky odor, and actually cleans without leaving any residue.  </li>
            <li>Using these makes my facial care routine easy</li>
            <li>/&gt;They definitely have a strong scent</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably one of my favorite parts of getting ready for bed, which sounds really strange.</li>
            <li>They do a fine job of removing facial makeup, but when I try to remove my eye makeup, they suck.  </li>
            <li>Pretty decent cloth size, and</li>
            <li>nice large size, not too much or too little liquid/moisture in each towelette</li>
            <li>So, naturally, I was excited to try this new</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Gentle cleaning, removes make up and mascara.  </li>
            <li>, i really feel the need to wipe my face.  </li>
            <li>They remove make-up really well and are gentle on the skin.  </li>
            <li>It was very objectionable to me.  </li>
            <li>All I needed was a gentle, cleansing wipe to get the job done.</li>
            <li>so really it&#x27;s like a 3.5.</li>
            <li>The cloth is much softer and thicker than the ones from Say Yes to Carrots (Cucumber version), or Pond&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>look it up on youtube REAL people made videos warning people from buying this product.</li>
            <li>is really soothing.</li>
            <li>I really despise washing my face with cleanser and water at the end of every day.  </li>
            <li>It is not irritating to my eyes like others wipes.</li>
            <li>and I really like them.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like the scent of them.  </li>
            <li>One sheet will get a whole face of make up removed.</li>
            <li>They really made my skin burn.</li>
            <li>These leave no residue and remove make up really really well.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t make much headway against my waterproof mascara</li>
            <li>but they take off foundation, blusher and lipstick really really well.</li>
            <li>but I really like this and will continue to use.</li>
            <li>bought a whole bunch and now we use them for everything.</li>
            <li>They remove makeup really well</li>
            <li>and how much of it you put on.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Also, the towels themselves are very soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re gentle on my skin and eyes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame because I really want to like Burt&#x27;s Bees products.</li>
            <li>really well.</li>
            <li>It takes off the makeup really well however, it stings a lot when removing makeup.</li>
            <li>and when I close to empty, I&#x27;m planning on ordering more.  </li>
            <li>Would much rather buy Ponds or Target brand.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I really like the way</li>
            <li>These are gentle, but still remove the dirt.</li>
            <li>This is as gentle as I think I&#x27;ll find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and the product takes off everything without much scrubbing.  </li>
            <li>Gets makeup off and is not irritating.</li>
            <li>Gentle on skin and eyes.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s environmentally sound as the Kleenex and BB tissue are equally &amp;#34;wasteful.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Really removes all the makeup, grime &amp; dirt.</li>
            <li>I suggest Yes to Carrots baby wipes for gentle cleansing wipes.</li>
            <li>I find them much easier on the eyes than the pricey liquid remover I have used for years.  </li>
            <li>The towelettes are very moist and just one does the job.  </li>
            <li>They are the size of a standard wash cloth, which is nice since some mornings I would find myself using two of Pond&#x27;s wipes since they are a bit smaller.</li>
            <li>They are larger than most, soft like fabric, soothing to the skin, and they take off every bit of makeup - even eye makeup, without rinsing.  </li>
            <li>I do have pretty sensitive skin that tends to be more on the dry side.</li>
            <li>The price is right too - compare it to any other facial wipes out there, and this is a great deal, especially if you do Subscribe and Save.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a long time fan of Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s chapstick, so I was pretty excited to try these wipes.</li>
            <li>Overall, mostly satisfied and certainly a nice natural option but not sure that I&#x27;ll stick with these forever.</li>
            <li>love the scent (sort of citrusy, stronger than other wipes I&#x27;ve used).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not usually picky about scents, especially natural ones, but these STINK!</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using, the skin is left feeling clean and refreshed without a soapy residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No only do they clean your face of dirt and make-up</li>
            <li>They make my face feel clean, remove my makeup and are easy to use on small children in motion.</li>
            <li>These cleansing cloths leave my face feeling clean and refreshed, clearing away the daily grease and grime.</li>
            <li>Nothing special about these facial cleansing clothes.</li>
            <li>These cloths do a pretty good job of getting all the make-up and grime off my face after a long day, but the scent takes a little while to get used to -</li>
            <li>I have found that if I&#x27;m not out rolling around in the dirt all day (which I don&#x27;t tend to do very often), half of a towelette is more than sufficient.</li>
            <li>They are soft, strong (don&#x27;t fall apart), the sheets are fairly large, and quite capable of wiping your face and your hands with a single one and feel like you just washed both.</li>
            <li>The skin around my eyes is usually pretty sensitive and these don&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all.</li>
            <li>The towelettes themselves are pretty soft.</li>
            <li>the black make-up comes off with just a light wipe!  </li>
            <li>Overall, I like them and will continue to buy them unless I find something better in the future.</li>
            <li>I recommend the item and seller highly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I actually have very oily skin, and I read in a Mary Kay book that white tea helps with the absorbtion of it, and its totally true!</li>
            <li>I do wish that perhaps the packaging was a touch better, but I feel this way about everything in these little resealable packets.</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, I will probably continue to use them since they are very gentle on my sensitive, far skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is gentle, effective and I have even noticed the areas that seem to stay a little on the red side</li>
            <li>I use the clean edges and remove dry skin from my lips.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t go wrong with Burt&#x27;s Bees and this is a great price.  </li>
            <li>Goes without saying these will not remove all of your eye makeup, but that wasn&#x27;t really a concern of mine, getting concealer/powder foundation off and keeping my skin clear was.</li>
            <li>I like these, especially for travel, because they won&#x27;t leak and they leave my face feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>Love these for both travel and everyday use.  </li>
            <li>Burt&#x60;s bees facial wipes smell, and they leave my face feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I get racoon eye when I try to wash my make-up off with normal soap or even facewash.  </li>
            <li>Normally I would smear Noxzema all over my face and wipe it off with a Kleenex.</li>
            <li>I could have just washed my face normally.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably buy something more heavy duty in a few more years when she needs it.  </li>
            <li>reviewers also got this at my local pharmacy thinking i needed more organic natural stuff on my face since im already dealing with a mild case of eczema on my face, so i didn&#x27;t want none of the harsh stuff</li>
            <li>I just tried Burt&#x27;s Bees new &amp;#34;pink grapefruit&amp;#34; towelettes for normal to oily skin</li>
            <li>I am busy constantly and these are quick, easy, handy, and I don&#x27;t have weird reactions to it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are large enough that you could use it over your whole face if desired, although I do still prefer to do a wash with a liquid cleanser after using these to remove my makeup.</li>
            <li>On par with other Burt&#x27;s Bees products, these are fantastic.</li>
            <li>the other hand, that only makes Burt&#x27;s wipes more soothing &amp; gentle on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>have found that, while these do get makeup off my skin and removes some of the oil, raw, unfiltered honey does a better job.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They dry quickly without leading to drying or cracking.</li>
            <li>A quick and gentle away to get my makeup off and a mini facial at the same time.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Very soft on my skin.</li>
            <li>but they work on my very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I started out with all natural, high end products.</li>
            <li>I am still experimenting with other cleansing towelettes, but these are definitely a contender for me to purchase again as my &amp;#34;chosen&amp;#34; nightly face towelette :)</li>
            <li>They barely take off eye makeup and they really sting.</li>
            <li>There is no feeling of anything left on my face after use and I have suffered no ill effects from their use.  </li>
            <li>They leave your face feeling clean and refreshed without leaving a filmy feeeling like other wipes I have purchased.</li>
            <li>I went for my first professional facial revently.</li>
            <li>Smell is subtle but fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>Really good if you want something less harsh to cleaner face.</li>
            <li>The moisture content of the package is about right - not too dry but not sloppy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The wipes are large, a definite plus, and have plenty of cleansing space.  </li>
            <li>They are actually quite large.  </li>
            <li>One is large enough to do my face, neck and hands.</li>
            <li>Just grab a wipe, clean you face in less than a minute and then throw it away.</li>
            <li>and I try to keep to all natural products.</li>
            <li>Also, I have sensitive skin, so I can&#x27;t use this color</li>
            <li>Despite it being \\&quot;99% natural\\&quot;, this isn&#x27;t a scent I like near my face.</li>
            <li>I also like the Sensitive Skin version, too.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and these do not irritate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On the plus side, the cloths are big and very sturdy, and they don&#x27;t make my face sting or burn.</li>
            <li>but I am probably going to be purchasing these until I&#x27;m old and gray..</li>
            <li>; and they work just as well for taking off my makeup with no harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>Cleans off my (waterproof) makeup, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin with frequent use.  </li>
            <li>The package is a soft plastic</li>
            <li>All natural wipes.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin at all</li>
            <li>but i dont feel like it really gets in there and cleans deeply (though it doesnt claim to).</li>
            <li>Not harsh or drying.</li>
            <li>I try to use natural products.</li>
            <li>and I dont have sensitive skin at all..</li>
            <li>but if I fell asleep without washing my face properly, more often than not I&#x27;d see a zit a few days later even if it was just that one night of not cleansing.</li>
            <li>Anyway, not &#x27;scrubby&#x27; enough cloths but with a little elbow grease they clean off makeup very well.</li>
            <li>Love all the water I save from not having to wash my face at the basin (and no more water all over the bathroom floor)!</li>
            <li>I take these with me when I travel since they are small and easy to shove into the corners of my suitcase or backpack.</li>
            <li>Towelettes are a great size, and don&#x27;t dry out as quickly as the other towelettes I&#x27;ve used; the only complaint I have is these don&#x27;t remove my heavy-duty mascara that I wear for swimming; but I&#x27;ve only found that Boscia Makeup Breakup takes that stuff off!  </li>
            <li>I am a heavy makeup wearer, however, and this factor might not be as significant to some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After trying a couple of other brands, I saw these and thought they would be well worth a</li>
            <li>but it is very mild and must be natural as it doesn&#x27;t give me the \\&quot;cheap avon artificial scent</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve enjoyed Burt&#x27;s Bees products in the past, and I like the convenience of facial wipes, even though I don&#x27;t use them all the time.  </li>
            <li>This IS only the first step in my nighttime facial cleansing routine</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fan of other Burt&#x27;s Bees products, so I was excited to finally get to this one</li>
            <li>Only con I have toward this product is that it leaves my face feeling pretty dry, however, it&#x27;s not something that a little facial cream can&#x27;t fix :]</li>
            <li>much prefer the ones I am using now, a store brand that is less expensive, seems to clean better, and smells nicer.  </li>
            <li>The texture is soft with a very light, almost-unnoticeable abrasiveness, and it&#x27;s thick enough to be used without tearing.</li>
            <li>I brought this along on a two month backpacking trip through Latin America, and found this very helpful during multiday treks with no showers, long days walking in the Caribbean sun, etc.</li>
            <li>I have normal to oily skin and often when I am commuting from work, especially if i need to head somewhere else before home</li>
            <li>I have been going through various \\&quot;natural\\&quot; facial wipes recently, looking for the right one for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to the world of facial wipes, so I have nothing to compare them to.</li>
            <li>My only issue is that they come pre-moistened, I live in desert country and they dry out fast</li>
            <li>They are gentle on my skin and do not leave my face feeling dry.</li>
            <li>and I feel like I am treating myself and the planet a little better when compared to the other products I could be buying.  </li>
            <li>I bought the white tea extract wipes in a two pack (my mistake for not trying them first) and after a day of use, my face was breaking out in tiny red splotches.</li>
            <li>Normally I use a cream cleanser at night but wanted something easy for nights when I was tired.</li>
            <li>It leaves me feeling clean but also a little red.</li>
            <li>I wouldnt say they smell bad, I just wouldnt say they smell that great.</li>
            <li>and they become red at the outer corners/lids and feel sensitive.</li>
            <li>like barely at all.</li>
            <li>It takes off my powder (bare mineral) makeup</li>
            <li>I really like the wipes I can wet myself</li>
            <li>a lot of facial products actually burn my face) and need to avoid as much soap and cleansers as possible but I need to wear makeup at work, so hopefully this review will help someone else.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My advice would be to try out just one pack from Wally world, possibly a smaller travel size if Burt&#x27;s Bees sells those, before you go hog wild.</li>
            <li>These were sensitive enough to not break out my skin.</li>
            <li>Not only are the travel sized towelettes MUCH smaller than the normal ones, but they also come in packaging that CANNOT be resealed.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; kind is unscented but smells weird.</li>
            <li>At home I&#x27;ll pull them out when I feel lazy and don&#x27;t want to my full skin care routine of cleansing, eye make up removal, and night moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I have used a few different facial cleansing towelettes in the past but none have been as good as this.  </li>
            <li>, they don&#x27;t sting my eyes, they don&#x27;t smell disgusting (in fact, they smell pretty good), and they&#x27;re SO convenient!</li>
            <li>I have continued to use them at home when the baby doesn&#x27;t allow me much hygiene time and unlike the other reviewer,  </li>
            <li>i do agree with other reviewers in that it doesn&#x27;t take off mascara very well...</li>
            <li>No other product can remove my makeup as well as the Burt&#x27;s Bees Facial Cleansing Towel.</li>
            <li>I think they are great-nice, large towelette size, not too thick or too thin, and nicely scented.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve only tried the Kirland facial wipes and the Burt&#x27;s Bees ones, and I definitely prefer the Kirkland towlettes.  </li>
            <li>This is a good deal especially when store prices are so expensive!</li>
            <li>I usually use them right before I go to bed or during the day when my face is feeling a bit oily.</li>
            <li>I have severely sensitive skin, and these have never made me break out or cause dry skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear a lot of make-up but the black can really do a number on the wash cloth.  </li>
            <li>I went to the sensitive skin option as these tend to dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>So, what cold be better than that!</li>
            <li>so just be careful, and avoid using this near your eyes!</li>
            <li>That said, I have very dry, sensitive skin (</li>
            <li>would recommend these facial cleansing towelettes by Burt&#x27;s Bees to the person who wears little or no makeup, absolutely.</li>

            <li> Nice smell too.</li>
            <li> This cloth cleans well and smells nice.</li>
            <li> The wipe itself is nice, but I did find them to be stingy and drying.  </li>
            <li> I like the Pond&#x27;s wipes best for at night when I take off my makeup and really wash my face.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice too.</li>
            <li> Also, they save water so if you have a water bill (I don&#x27;t), that&#x27;s a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> Used it to remove makeup- if you&#x27;re using to get off eyeliner, it is effective but it stings your eyes.</li>
            <li> It sort of depends on what kind of eye makeup you&#x27;re wearing</li>
            <li> These towelettes are really nice - they don&#x27;t have an overly perfumey smell (they do have a sent</li>
            <li> i think its kind of nice.</li>
            <li> The reclosable case is nice too.</li>
            <li> Great product as are most of Burt Bees products (love their replenishing lip balm w/pomegranate too)...</li>
            <li> use subscribe &amp; save through Amazon Mom which is really nice.</li>
            <li> After using them, my face felt very clean!</li>
            <li> They clean well and smell great.</li>
            <li> Great for if you are in a hurry to clean your face.</li>
            <li> I am much impressed with this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy with it, but it&#x27;s not one of those products that is sure to suit everyone.(Cool water rinsing is always a good idea after cleansing with warm water as it helps contract your pores and thus protects your skin from dirt, oils, and polution.)  </li>
            <li> Felt nice and refreshing on my skin and cleaned out irritants effectively.  </li>
            <li> They work great and came quick</li>
            <li> Fragrance is light and pleasant.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;) Love it!</li>
            <li> They are lovely and the smell is nicely balanced and not overpowering</li>
            <li> They are a good size and smell fantastic.</li>
            <li> They also smell pleasant and clean well without irritation.  </li>
            <li> (Cool water rinsing is always a good idea after cleansing with warm water as it helps contract your pores and thus protects your skin from dirt, oils, and polution.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It gets makeup off easily too!</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, smell great, and do a good job removing makeup.</li>
            <li> However, these wipes do a good job of making my face feel clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> They leave your face very clean (no residue) and they smell really nice - much better than the Garnier wipes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy with it, but it&#x27;s not one of those products that is sure to suit everyone.</li>
            <li> sure is refreshing to wash you face with something that gets your face clean and smells good, and is refreshing.  </li>
            <li> Wonderful cleansing towelettes that easily remove the days makeup and do not irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The best thing about these wipes is the smell, theres this fresh citrus scent to them which is perfect after a hard days work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s refreshing to use.</li>
            <li> and I think they removed my mascara more effectively, although they were much drier and did not smell as good as these.</li>

            <li> I love Burts Bees and these don&#x27;t disappoint.  </li>
            <li> I mostly use these when I am traveling so that I don&#x27;t leave eye makeup on washcloths at friends&#x27; and families&#x27; homes.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite products of all time.</li>
            <li> Love these guys.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Burt&#x27;s Bees product for many years now.  </li>
            <li> I keep a pack in my camping stuff stuff and some with my off road vehicles for getting the dust off your face after enjoying the out doors.</li>
            <li> You could just use baby wipes but in my opinion these feel much better afterward.</li>
            <li> It cleans my face well, gets most of the makeup off.</li>
            <li> and you can visibly see more dirt come off onto the towel.  </li>
            <li> Definitely glad I took a chance and tried them out.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li> My skin breaks out when using most &amp;#34;hand sanitizes&amp;#34;, but not these.  </li>
            <li> Love these face wipes.</li>
            <li> I love the scent</li>
            <li> I tried some makeup remover wipes I bought from Trader Joes and they are much better.</li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> I love them,</li>
            <li> gentle on my skin, great to remove make up, even mascara.</li>
            <li> I love having these in my car or for when I travel.</li>
            <li> I do like the grapefruit smelling one&#x27;s better though.</li>

            <li> These are the best makeup facial wipes, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and cleans throughly.</li>

            <li> but I love them so.  </li>
            <li> (add some water and you&#x27;re OK again, though).  </li>
            <li> and I have purchased them more than once.</li>
            <li> If these had exfoliating nubbies they would definitely earn a 5, but still a really great value for the quality and quantity you get!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly, better than any spot remover I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>

            <li> My favorite make up removing cloths.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I&#x27;m sure Burt&#x27;s Bees has a better ingredients in it than some of the others I use, I wouldn&#x27;t</li>

            <li> , this wipes are amazing and leave your face feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to start using these ones at night even when I get home because they make my face feel so nice and clean.</li>
            <li> No water needed, quick and effective.  </li>
            <li> Nice and quick to use.</li>
            <li> Gentle on my skin and with a pleasant herbal odor.</li>
            <li> but I find it fresh, clean, and pleasant.</li>
            <li> Sure, they take off my foundation just fine, and my eye shadow, too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;face feels refreshed and clean, i dont think i&#x27;ll ever buy another brand!</li>
            <li> Fragrance is not overpowering and your face feels really clean afterwards!</li>
            <li> I started notiing fine lines around my mouth, otherwise everything else was okay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since found Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean with kaolin clay and surprise!</li>
            <li> Have used for several years, very good product, sooo convenient when traveling.</li>
            <li> these are a gift for someone in the military -- how handy!!!</li>
            <li> And I really WANT to like them, partly because they&#x27;re inexpensive, partly because they&#x27;re Burts Bees, and partly because they smell so dang good (</li>
            <li> I love Burts Bees, so I was excited when these wipes came out.</li>
            <li> great for hot summer days/on trips..or a quick clean up</li>
            <li> I love these - they remove makeup, smell good, all natural.  </li>
            <li> so I could wash my face easily  in the hospital.</li>
            <li> and I think they are easy to pull out of the package.  </li>
            <li> Pond&#x27;s wipes easily removed my mascara, these wipes do not.</li>
            <li> Not oily and gets makeup and dirt off easily.  </li>
            <li> I can easily take my makeup off at night and not have to battle the washcloth and the rinsing, etc.</li>
            <li> Takes off make up easily, and leaves your face feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> So easy to take off my make up.</li>
            <li> Make-up comes off easily and unlike this product, it does not burn your face nor have a strong scent.</li>
            <li> These particular towelettes are good...</li>
            <li> The scent is a bit strong, but I got over it.</li>
            <li> smelled waaaay too strong and medicine-y.  not for me.</li>
            <li> These are nice, good quality facial towelettes.  </li>
            <li> This works amazing and the scent is very soothing and not loaded with chemicals scents!</li>
            <li> so i tried these makeup remover wipes and at first my face felt so nice</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used two full packages, thinking I might like them better as I got used to them.  </li>
            <li> I really love how well this product works, it takes off all of my make-up very easily without much effort.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These towelettes are great; they remove make-up easily, are gentle, and leave my face feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I even think these wipes make fantastic, easy skin care for men.</li>
            <li> I even think these wipes make fantastic, easy skin care for men.</li>
            <li> I loved them initially - great smell, leaves your skin clean feeling with no residue - but tried a few times searching for cheaper alternatives.  </li>
            <li> They are also great when I&#x27;m pressed for time or ready to drop in bed but need to wash my face first.  </li>
            <li> The are adequate, but there are much better ones to be had.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But when I saw that Burt&#x27;s Bees has a new facial wipe I had to try them, seeing as Burt&#x27;s Bees makes wonderful skin products that I LOVE.</li>
            <li> They smell fine to me - just a light \\&quot;cleaner\\</li>
            <li> It would be nice to have this product in a scentless version, or as scentless as these things can be, but it certainly isn&#x27;t a deal-breaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When it gets hot here in Houston it feels nice to clean my face on the go.</li>
            <li> This is a HUGE plus for these towelettes, the fact that they are \\&quot;99% natural\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> The facial wipes are handy, refreshing, and (most important for me) no toxic ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I am always have been such a great fan of burts bee.</li>
            <li> These burts bees wipes are not so harsh on the skin and they smell good too!!</li>
            <li> will note that these are smooth wipes.</li>
            <li> I liked them so much, I got my college student son a 2-pack</li>
            <li> use these before washing my face with cleanser and water, and this extra step has greatly improved my skin.</li>
            <li> I bought these to use in Afghanistan as running water isn&#x27;t always available.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle and smells nice too.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like these; they&#x27;re getting two stars because, yes, they effectively remove my eye makeup.</li>
            <li> Target recently increased the price of these to $7.20, so this is a great price for a two pack.</li>
            <li> I even use Burt&#x27;s Bees baby products and they are fantastic.</li>
            <li> These facial towelettes worked great for we while on deployment.  </li>
            <li> This is gentle yet effective.  </li>
            <li> This saves me a step, cleans better than the Noxzema and leaves my face feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like the way they smelled, and the more I used them the more I broke out.  </li>
            <li> Towelette is made of a good material and solution does the job as far as cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Not the greatest for makeup removal unit I really like them overall and will continue to use them.</li>
            <li> I put some on and it starting to feel better already!!</li>
            <li> I very rarely wear makeup</li>
            <li> These wipes keep my face clean and free of grease.  </li>
            <li> but these are really quick and easy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m slowly but surely getting and loving more and more and more of their products.  </li>
            <li> Kept my face feeling fresh and clean!</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more very soon!</li>
            <li> seem to be more consistent with the rest of my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used Burt&#x27;s Bees products in the past and have alway been very happy with them.  </li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees towelettes are made of natural ingredients, are nice and soft on the skin, and smell really good.</li>
            <li> They smell great, leave you feeling clean but not greasy nor stripped dry either.  </li>
            <li> clean my face every day before bed.  </li>
            <li> I use these to clean my face after shaving or just whenever.  </li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t like the way my skin feels after using them, a bit sticky and not the clean feeling</li>
            <li> These wiped leave my face feeling clean, which is all I could ask for.</li>
            <li> Clean scent, doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling soapy after use.</li>
            <li> Prior to using this I really liked the No. 7 wipes, but these are much better.</li>
            <li> Both leave my skin feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> leaves my face feeling clean</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how cool and refreshing these are on a hot summer day.</li>
            <li> I started using the Garnier ones which were OK, but these are far better.</li>
            <li> These work well as they seem to clean well.</li>
            <li> The smell is great, a nice refreshing, clean smell; and the white tea helps soothe my skin when it gets dry or irritated.  </li>
            <li> They do not leave a filmy feeling on my skin, it just feels clean.</li>
            <li> The packaging is excellent - not only is there the sticky tab over the opening (which normally wears out halfway through the package), but there is also a plastic snap tab so that they will stay moist and fresh from beginning to end.  </li>
            <li> I love most of their products and this facial cleansing towelettes works pretty good and cleans my face really well when I have make-up on.</li>
            <li> And, I might add the price is right!</li>
            <li> And honestly, if your skin is even a little bit sensitive (I&#x27;ve got very fair, sunburn-prone skin)</li>
            <li> , they have a slight and pleasant smell to them... not overpowering, and they get most of my make-up off...</li>
            <li> , my skin was super dry and peeling, which is uncommon for me.</li>
            <li> Thanks Burt&#x27;s for coming out with new all natural products, sure appreciate your product integrity!!!</li>
            <li> However,  once I used these my face turned bright red and burnt.</li>
            <li> They make my face so nice and soft.</li>
            <li> The Burt&#x27;s Bees ones leave my skin feeling sticky and sweet (and sometimes even make my skin sting).  </li>
            <li> If find that these work very well for refreshing your face.</li>
            <li> I have always used and loved Neutrogena&#x27;s facial cleaning towelettes, but</li>
            <li> They work surprisingly well to get deeply ingrained gunk off of me.</li>
            <li> They wipe off the makeup with ease and they are always cool.</li>
            <li> the scent is a sort of sweet</li>
            <li> This facial wipes are superior to anything I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> These are good make-up removal towelettes, and they definitely get the job done.</li>
            <li> So I was delighted to find them on Amazon for much cheaper than normal stores.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The towelettes are VERY soft and very easy on the skin.  </li>
            <li> I like the Burt&#x27;s Bees wipes best for the morning as just a fresh wipe clean, or when I have a \\&quot;light duty\\&quot; job such as cleaning smeared makeup from under my eyes and such.</li>
            <li> Perfect for when I&#x27;m feeling lazy!</li>
            <li> First of all, these have a really, really strong smell, and leave a filmy feeling on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to try this, but when I started wiping my face, the first thing that came to my mind was it smelled like a linens and towels at a cheap motel room.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You feel clean and fresh after using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> quick cleanser for the face, neck and ear areas.  </li>
            <li> and they were quickly shipped.</li>
            <li> I had used these facial wipes for several months when I saw a magazine article that said they had been voted as one of the best products by the readership.  </li>
            <li> I went on a binge and bought about 7 different kinds of facial cleansing towelettes, determined to find my perfect one.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and is more blemish free as well.</li>
            <li> This is important to me, as I am most sensitive to smells.  </li>
            <li> I keep these, along with a jar of my favorite moisturizer right by my bed so that when I am so sleepy I don&#x27;t want to traipse the 10 steps to the bathroom I can sit in bed, thoroughly cleanse my face with these gentle cleansing towelettes and apply my moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I have used these and about 3 other brands&#x27; version of wipes and these are by far the best for my skin (which is normal/combination).  </li>
            <li> I have tried many different products and this one is soft and does a good job.</li>
            <li> Also, these left some kind of residue on my skin that didn&#x27;t feel clean.</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees lip products, and I am always trying new face wipes to remove my make-up.</li>
            <li> These are some pretty good Facial Cleansing wipes.</li>
            <li> They clean awesome, and theyre very sturdy and thick as well.</li>
            <li> so I know good skin care when I see it, and Burt&#x27;s Bees has always produced fantastic products (I highly recommend their Orange Facial Cleanser and Radiance SPF 15 Day Lotion, by the way).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it every day, but it&#x27;s a very quick, refreshing addition to any facial care.</li>
            <li> These clean really well and don&#x27;t cause skin irritation!</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that will clean my face throughout the day since I work in a hot environment.&lt;br /&gt;While</li>
            <li> These face wipes are gentle on the skin with a light (not overpowering)</li>
            <li> However, these facial cleansing towelettes are amazing -</li>
            <li> They are a nice pick me up, and i would definitely recommend.  </li>
            <li> commend Burt&#x27;s Bees for working so many organic &amp; natural ingredients into their products.</li>
            <li> Although my husband smelled them and thought they smelled lemony and minty and fresh, to me the scent is just like that of Pine Sol.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and many towelettes have not worked for me.</li>
            <li> It smells so fresh and floral.</li>
            <li> even my teenage son thinks so &amp;#34;what&#x27;s this nice smell all about&amp;#34; and I quote.</li>
            <li> Burts bees is also more natural than the rest.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees leaves my face feeling fresh without feeling like I have lost a layer of skin.  </li>
            <li> oil-Leaving your skin soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> These have a fresh and fragrant smell.</li>
            <li> The actual product was nice.</li>
            <li> Face feels scrubbed fresh.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have been searching for the perfect lazy way to wash/</li>
            <li> They do make your skin tingle a little, but in a good clean feeling way.  </li>
            <li> This is a good product, other than the smell</li>
            <li> This is a good product, other than the smell</li>
            <li> These are going right in the trash.</li>
            <li> While this might be too soft to work for people that need a stronger abrasive, it&#x27;s perfect for sensitive, dry skin.</li>
            <li> and they seem to clean my face really well.  </li>
            <li> Your skin will feel very refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re just your average facial cleansing clothes, which are good at removing make-up and make for a quick, easy way to clean your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like the light, fresh scent and the large size of these cloths.</li>
            <li> Love these facial wipes; the smell is amazingly soothing and fresh - my face feels clean and brighter after each use.&lt;br /&gt;They do not have any oily residue like some other brands -</li>
            <li> I used these for months just because of the beautiful, relaxing white tea fragrance right after a long day at work</li>
            <li> I used to use aveeno&#x27;s positively radiant cleansing cloths which, while they worked wonderfully, they were full of chemicals (a variety of parabens) and i was really wary about prolonged use.</li>
            <li> To those who need a more powerful facial wipe, I would say go with Pond&#x27;s or something else altogether.</li>
            <li> To those who need a more powerful facial wipe, I would say go with Pond&#x27;s or something else altogether.</li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t strong but if you&#x27;re looking for no fragrance try the sensitive skin version.</li>
            <li> For those that the natural ingredients matter to, these would likely be good for.</li>
            <li> I originally bought to take to the hospital to wash my face while staying there after spinal surgery, but after I got home and realized I cannot bend over the sink to wash my face normally (at night), so I am using these towelettes.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m guessing my skin type just didn&#x27;t like them very much.</li>
            <li> Not only easy to carry on trips but does an extraordinary job in cleaning your face of makeup.</li>
            <li> price is a bit higher than Pond&#x27;s</li>
            <li> If I use two, which is how many I like to use when wearing a lot of makeup, my skin turns red, and starts to sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can scrub all you&#x27;d like, but I think you will just end up peeling off your first layer of dermis.  </li>
            <li> I thought they smelled a bit like mop soap or kitchen cleaner at first.</li>
            <li> The smell is refreshing and does the trick of both cleaning and moisturizing without having to tote along multiple product.</li>
            <li> I do like them more than the white tea ones - both the scent and the way they work.  </li>
            <li> Going somewhere where I didn&#x27;t have access to a hot shower ever day made these a life saver.</li>
            <li> This has definitely become a favorite for me.</li>
            <li> I usually love all things Burt&#x27;s Bees, but I&#x27;m not a  fan of these facial wipes.</li>
            <li> Now my face is completely acne free.</li>
            <li> First off, I could not stand the smell.</li>
            <li> course, in a pinch they can be used for any other \\&quot;wiping\\&quot; need, which makes them quite handy when traveling.</li>
            <li> These clean off make up better than any other cleansing cloth I have used!  </li>
            <li> And, they clean well and leave my face soft.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t stand the residue left by Neutrogena&#x27;s and once the package was used I tried Pond&#x27;s, which has a lovely scent (I much preferred</li>
            <li> Now mind you, I don&#x27;t wear makeup very often, but on the rare occasion when I do, these don&#x27;t really do the trick taking it off...</li>
            <li> My one complaint is that I wish there were more than 30 per package; a two month supply would be more sustainable.</li>
            <li> Though they are a great size, moistened well, and I like other Burt&#x27;s Bees products, these wipes stung and burned on my skin, especially my eyes.</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit overpowering; it seems fine at first, then you realize that you don&#x27;t want to open them because you know what the smell inside is.  </li>
            <li> Gentle wipes with a great subtle fragrance.</li>
            <li> Package is overstuffed, so it&#x27;s easy to pull out two when you only wanted one.  </li>
            <li> With this arrangement, the towelettes stay wet long after opening -- which is great, since this package has a lot of towelettes in it.</li>
            <li> The wipes are easy to use, don&#x27;t have a funky odor, and actually cleans without leaving any residue.  </li>
            <li> Using these makes my facial care routine easy</li>
            <li> /&gt;They definitely have a strong scent</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably one of my favorite parts of getting ready for bed, which sounds really strange.</li>
            <li> They do a fine job of removing facial makeup, but when I try to remove my eye makeup, they suck.  </li>
            <li> Pretty decent cloth size, and</li>
            <li> nice large size, not too much or too little liquid/moisture in each towelette</li>
            <li> So, naturally, I was excited to try this new</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Gentle cleaning, removes make up and mascara.  </li>
            <li> , i really feel the need to wipe my face.  </li>
            <li> They remove make-up really well and are gentle on the skin.  </li>
            <li> It was very objectionable to me.  </li>
            <li> All I needed was a gentle, cleansing wipe to get the job done.</li>
            <li> so really it&#x27;s like a 3.5.</li>
            <li> The cloth is much softer and thicker than the ones from Say Yes to Carrots (Cucumber version), or Pond&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> look it up on youtube REAL people made videos warning people from buying this product.</li>
            <li> is really soothing.</li>
            <li> I really despise washing my face with cleanser and water at the end of every day.  </li>
            <li> It is not irritating to my eyes like others wipes.</li>
            <li> and I really like them.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the scent of them.  </li>
            <li> One sheet will get a whole face of make up removed.</li>
            <li> They really made my skin burn.</li>
            <li> These leave no residue and remove make up really really well.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t make much headway against my waterproof mascara</li>
            <li> but they take off foundation, blusher and lipstick really really well.</li>
            <li> but I really like this and will continue to use.</li>
            <li> bought a whole bunch and now we use them for everything.</li>
            <li> They remove makeup really well</li>
            <li> and how much of it you put on.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Also, the towels themselves are very soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re gentle on my skin and eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame because I really want to like Burt&#x27;s Bees products.</li>
            <li> really well.</li>
            <li> It takes off the makeup really well however, it stings a lot when removing makeup.</li>
            <li> and when I close to empty, I&#x27;m planning on ordering more.  </li>
            <li> Would much rather buy Ponds or Target brand.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I really like the way</li>
            <li> These are gentle, but still remove the dirt.</li>
            <li> This is as gentle as I think I&#x27;ll find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and the product takes off everything without much scrubbing.  </li>
            <li> Gets makeup off and is not irritating.</li>
            <li> Gentle on skin and eyes.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s environmentally sound as the Kleenex and BB tissue are equally &amp;#34;wasteful.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Really removes all the makeup, grime &amp; dirt.</li>
            <li> I suggest Yes to Carrots baby wipes for gentle cleansing wipes.</li>
            <li> I find them much easier on the eyes than the pricey liquid remover I have used for years.  </li>
            <li> The towelettes are very moist and just one does the job.  </li>
            <li> They are the size of a standard wash cloth, which is nice since some mornings I would find myself using two of Pond&#x27;s wipes since they are a bit smaller.</li>
            <li> They are larger than most, soft like fabric, soothing to the skin, and they take off every bit of makeup - even eye makeup, without rinsing.  </li>
            <li> I do have pretty sensitive skin that tends to be more on the dry side.</li>
            <li> The price is right too - compare it to any other facial wipes out there, and this is a great deal, especially if you do Subscribe and Save.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time fan of Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s chapstick, so I was pretty excited to try these wipes.</li>
            <li> Overall, mostly satisfied and certainly a nice natural option but not sure that I&#x27;ll stick with these forever.</li>
            <li> love the scent (sort of citrusy, stronger than other wipes I&#x27;ve used).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not usually picky about scents, especially natural ones, but these STINK!</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using, the skin is left feeling clean and refreshed without a soapy residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No only do they clean your face of dirt and make-up</li>
            <li> They make my face feel clean, remove my makeup and are easy to use on small children in motion.</li>
            <li> These cleansing cloths leave my face feeling clean and refreshed, clearing away the daily grease and grime.</li>
            <li> Nothing special about these facial cleansing clothes.</li>
            <li> These cloths do a pretty good job of getting all the make-up and grime off my face after a long day, but the scent takes a little while to get used to -</li>
            <li> I have found that if I&#x27;m not out rolling around in the dirt all day (which I don&#x27;t tend to do very often), half of a towelette is more than sufficient.</li>
            <li> They are soft, strong (don&#x27;t fall apart), the sheets are fairly large, and quite capable of wiping your face and your hands with a single one and feel like you just washed both.</li>
            <li> The skin around my eyes is usually pretty sensitive and these don&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all.</li>
            <li> The towelettes themselves are pretty soft.</li>
            <li> the black make-up comes off with just a light wipe!  </li>
            <li> Overall, I like them and will continue to buy them unless I find something better in the future.</li>
            <li> I recommend the item and seller highly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I actually have very oily skin, and I read in a Mary Kay book that white tea helps with the absorbtion of it, and its totally true!</li>
            <li> I do wish that perhaps the packaging was a touch better, but I feel this way about everything in these little resealable packets.</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, I will probably continue to use them since they are very gentle on my sensitive, far skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is gentle, effective and I have even noticed the areas that seem to stay a little on the red side</li>
            <li> I use the clean edges and remove dry skin from my lips.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Burt&#x27;s Bees and this is a great price.  </li>
            <li> Goes without saying these will not remove all of your eye makeup, but that wasn&#x27;t really a concern of mine, getting concealer/powder foundation off and keeping my skin clear was.</li>
            <li> I like these, especially for travel, because they won&#x27;t leak and they leave my face feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> Love these for both travel and everyday use.  </li>
            <li> Burt&#x60;s bees facial wipes smell, and they leave my face feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I get racoon eye when I try to wash my make-up off with normal soap or even facewash.  </li>
            <li> Normally I would smear Noxzema all over my face and wipe it off with a Kleenex.</li>
            <li> I could have just washed my face normally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably buy something more heavy duty in a few more years when she needs it.  </li>
            <li> reviewers also got this at my local pharmacy thinking i needed more organic natural stuff on my face since im already dealing with a mild case of eczema on my face, so i didn&#x27;t want none of the harsh stuff</li>
            <li> I just tried Burt&#x27;s Bees new &amp;#34;pink grapefruit&amp;#34; towelettes for normal to oily skin</li>
            <li> I am busy constantly and these are quick, easy, handy, and I don&#x27;t have weird reactions to it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are large enough that you could use it over your whole face if desired, although I do still prefer to do a wash with a liquid cleanser after using these to remove my makeup.</li>
            <li> On par with other Burt&#x27;s Bees products, these are fantastic.</li>
            <li> the other hand, that only makes Burt&#x27;s wipes more soothing &amp; gentle on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> have found that, while these do get makeup off my skin and removes some of the oil, raw, unfiltered honey does a better job.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They dry quickly without leading to drying or cracking.</li>
            <li> A quick and gentle away to get my makeup off and a mini facial at the same time.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Very soft on my skin.</li>
            <li> but they work on my very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I started out with all natural, high end products.</li>
            <li> I am still experimenting with other cleansing towelettes, but these are definitely a contender for me to purchase again as my &amp;#34;chosen&amp;#34; nightly face towelette :)</li>
            <li> They barely take off eye makeup and they really sting.</li>
            <li> There is no feeling of anything left on my face after use and I have suffered no ill effects from their use.  </li>
            <li> They leave your face feeling clean and refreshed without leaving a filmy feeeling like other wipes I have purchased.</li>
            <li> I went for my first professional facial revently.</li>
            <li> Smell is subtle but fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> Really good if you want something less harsh to cleaner face.</li>
            <li> The moisture content of the package is about right - not too dry but not sloppy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The wipes are large, a definite plus, and have plenty of cleansing space.  </li>
            <li> They are actually quite large.  </li>
            <li> One is large enough to do my face, neck and hands.</li>
            <li> Just grab a wipe, clean you face in less than a minute and then throw it away.</li>
            <li> and I try to keep to all natural products.</li>
            <li> Also, I have sensitive skin, so I can&#x27;t use this color</li>
            <li> Despite it being \\&quot;99% natural\\&quot;, this isn&#x27;t a scent I like near my face.</li>
            <li> I also like the Sensitive Skin version, too.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and these do not irritate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On the plus side, the cloths are big and very sturdy, and they don&#x27;t make my face sting or burn.</li>
            <li> but I am probably going to be purchasing these until I&#x27;m old and gray..</li>
            <li> ; and they work just as well for taking off my makeup with no harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> Cleans off my (waterproof) makeup, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin with frequent use.  </li>
            <li> The package is a soft plastic</li>
            <li> All natural wipes.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin at all</li>
            <li> but i dont feel like it really gets in there and cleans deeply (though it doesnt claim to).</li>
            <li> Not harsh or drying.</li>
            <li> I try to use natural products.</li>
            <li> and I dont have sensitive skin at all..</li>
            <li> but if I fell asleep without washing my face properly, more often than not I&#x27;d see a zit a few days later even if it was just that one night of not cleansing.</li>
            <li> Anyway, not &#x27;scrubby&#x27; enough cloths but with a little elbow grease they clean off makeup very well.</li>
            <li> Love all the water I save from not having to wash my face at the basin (and no more water all over the bathroom floor)!</li>
            <li> I take these with me when I travel since they are small and easy to shove into the corners of my suitcase or backpack.</li>
            <li> Towelettes are a great size, and don&#x27;t dry out as quickly as the other towelettes I&#x27;ve used; the only complaint I have is these don&#x27;t remove my heavy-duty mascara that I wear for swimming; but I&#x27;ve only found that Boscia Makeup Breakup takes that stuff off!  </li>
            <li> I am a heavy makeup wearer, however, and this factor might not be as significant to some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After trying a couple of other brands, I saw these and thought they would be well worth a</li>
            <li> but it is very mild and must be natural as it doesn&#x27;t give me the \\&quot;cheap avon artificial scent</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve enjoyed Burt&#x27;s Bees products in the past, and I like the convenience of facial wipes, even though I don&#x27;t use them all the time.  </li>
            <li> This IS only the first step in my nighttime facial cleansing routine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of other Burt&#x27;s Bees products, so I was excited to finally get to this one</li>
            <li> Only con I have toward this product is that it leaves my face feeling pretty dry, however, it&#x27;s not something that a little facial cream can&#x27;t fix :]</li>
            <li> much prefer the ones I am using now, a store brand that is less expensive, seems to clean better, and smells nicer.  </li>
            <li> The texture is soft with a very light, almost-unnoticeable abrasiveness, and it&#x27;s thick enough to be used without tearing.</li>
            <li> I brought this along on a two month backpacking trip through Latin America, and found this very helpful during multiday treks with no showers, long days walking in the Caribbean sun, etc.</li>
            <li> I have normal to oily skin and often when I am commuting from work, especially if i need to head somewhere else before home</li>
            <li> I have been going through various \\&quot;natural\\&quot; facial wipes recently, looking for the right one for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the world of facial wipes, so I have nothing to compare them to.</li>
            <li> My only issue is that they come pre-moistened, I live in desert country and they dry out fast</li>
            <li> They are gentle on my skin and do not leave my face feeling dry.</li>
            <li> and I feel like I am treating myself and the planet a little better when compared to the other products I could be buying.  </li>
            <li> I bought the white tea extract wipes in a two pack (my mistake for not trying them first) and after a day of use, my face was breaking out in tiny red splotches.</li>
            <li> Normally I use a cream cleanser at night but wanted something easy for nights when I was tired.</li>
            <li> It leaves me feeling clean but also a little red.</li>
            <li> I wouldnt say they smell bad, I just wouldnt say they smell that great.</li>
            <li> and they become red at the outer corners/lids and feel sensitive.</li>
            <li> like barely at all.</li>
            <li> It takes off my powder (bare mineral) makeup</li>
            <li> I really like the wipes I can wet myself</li>
            <li> a lot of facial products actually burn my face) and need to avoid as much soap and cleansers as possible but I need to wear makeup at work, so hopefully this review will help someone else.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My advice would be to try out just one pack from Wally world, possibly a smaller travel size if Burt&#x27;s Bees sells those, before you go hog wild.</li>
            <li> These were sensitive enough to not break out my skin.</li>
            <li> Not only are the travel sized towelettes MUCH smaller than the normal ones, but they also come in packaging that CANNOT be resealed.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; kind is unscented but smells weird.</li>
            <li> At home I&#x27;ll pull them out when I feel lazy and don&#x27;t want to my full skin care routine of cleansing, eye make up removal, and night moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have used a few different facial cleansing towelettes in the past but none have been as good as this.  </li>
            <li> , they don&#x27;t sting my eyes, they don&#x27;t smell disgusting (in fact, they smell pretty good), and they&#x27;re SO convenient!</li>
            <li> I have continued to use them at home when the baby doesn&#x27;t allow me much hygiene time and unlike the other reviewer,  </li>
            <li> i do agree with other reviewers in that it doesn&#x27;t take off mascara very well...</li>
            <li> No other product can remove my makeup as well as the Burt&#x27;s Bees Facial Cleansing Towel.</li>
            <li> I think they are great-nice, large towelette size, not too thick or too thin, and nicely scented.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only tried the Kirland facial wipes and the Burt&#x27;s Bees ones, and I definitely prefer the Kirkland towlettes.  </li>
            <li> This is a good deal especially when store prices are so expensive!</li>
            <li> I usually use them right before I go to bed or during the day when my face is feeling a bit oily.</li>
            <li> I have severely sensitive skin, and these have never made me break out or cause dry skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear a lot of make-up but the black can really do a number on the wash cloth.  </li>
            <li> I went to the sensitive skin option as these tend to dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> So, what cold be better than that!</li>
            <li> so just be careful, and avoid using this near your eyes!</li>
            <li> That said, I have very dry, sensitive skin (</li>
            <li> would recommend these facial cleansing towelettes by Burt&#x27;s Bees to the person who wears little or no makeup, absolutely.</li>
            <li> I would recommend these facial cleansing towelettes by Burt&#x27;s Bees to the person who wears little or no makeup, absolutely.</li>
            <li> However, the smell is weird and they are kind of rough</li>
            <li> However, since the Burt&#x27;s wipes are so soft I&#x27;ve found that they don&#x27;t have the same \\&quot;scrubbing\\&quot; power that the other two brands that I have tried had.</li>
            <li> They are also cheaper than some of the other natural wipes.&lt;br /&gt;Update: Burt&#x27;s Bees was sold to a big company and their formulations changed....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even tried other natural wipes that make my face burn no matter how &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; they are.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel that it dries out my sensitive skin, nor does it leave a sticky residue like other makeup remover wipes.</li>
            <li> Call it laziness if you will, but I prefer to give my face the old scrub down with facial towelettes such as these.  </li>
            <li> which pretty much leaves them completely useless.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s, on the other hand, are much thinner and have little, if any, real texture to them (like a Wet Ones or other baby wipe).</li>
            <li> Adhesive seal does not remain sealed, which is no big deal unless it&#x27;s going to sit for a long time.  </li>
            <li> They barely remove makeup and certainly do not remove eye makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Burts Bees and they were even less expensive!</li>
            <li> Be careful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Apparently these wipes caused me to get eczema on my face that even after an expensive trip to the dermatologist and special face washes and lotions</li>
            <li> I buy it in the double packs and would recommend it to anyone, especially those of us who need a regular face washing routine at night due to make-up, dirt, etc., or to those of us who travel.</li>
            <li> It does not last very long even if you don&#x27;t like it.  </li>
            <li> Neutrogena&#x27;s had added texture bumps on one size that was helpful for scrubbing &amp; exfoliating, and Pond&#x27;s was still soft but textured slightly to help scrub your face a bit also.</li>
            <li> The plastic lid actually keeps the towelettes from drying out, unlike other towelette containers that only have stickers to keep the air out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When you use them they readily remove your make-up (or dirt/food - I sometimes use them on my little girl who loves to be messy) and they don&#x27;t leave a gross feeling residue on your skin.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; ingredients it doesn&#x27;t make me feel like I&#x27;m rubbing my lips or face with some random chemicals.</li>
            <li> I repurposed these wipes for off-label use - they really get the soap scum off my shower curtain.</li>
            <li> more artificial fragrances and ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I like how the package snaps open &amp; closed.</li>
            <li> After we opened them, BOTH boxes were dried out, which leads me to believe that they were either stored inappropriately or are just old.  </li>
            <li> Also, the towelettes are not individually wrapped, so they&#x27;re not convenient for slipping into a lunch bag for cleaning hands after a picnic.  </li>
            <li> I also rip them in half, so they last double the time!</li>
            <li> I do have sensitive skin, and dry cheeks, so with these two issues, I do have trouble finding towelettes that don&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> They have a faint, not unpleasant, odor that dissipates instantly.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that they smell a little funny...</li>
            <li> Because of this, I feel that they fall slightly short compared to the other two--they don&#x27;t exfoliate or remove dirt/makeup quite as efficiently as those which are textured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While I think I might be allergic to one of the ingredients, I&#x27;ve seen other reviews reporting a similar experience--</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t as &amp;#34;juicy&amp;#34; as other wipes but moist enough.</li>
            <li> of the other ones on Amazon have only 25 towelettes and they sell for about $10.</li>
            <li> I have definitely switched over from other brands to this one.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t leave my skin dry or oily, no residue</li>
            <li> (I have dry</li>
            <li> /&gt;These also seem to dry out my cheeks.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my face really dry like some others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> They also don&#x27;t dry you out - I can use one on my face</li>
            <li> I always had a problem with others not sealing and, of course, the cloth would dry up.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t dry my face and they pull out one at a time.  </li>
            <li> They do a decent job of cleansing, not spectacular but not horrid.  </li>
            <li> if there were a perforated line that you could use a half sheet and make it last twice as long, I would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I use to wash my face every night and it kept my skin fairly clear but from time to time I would get a small breakout on my forehead.</li>
            <li> but I kept using them, now my skin is broken out for the first time in years.</li>
            <li> The cloths are thick enough and saturated with enough of the cleanser to last through using both sides; this product does its job, with no problems removing the makeup I wear, without leaving streaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have trouble using any other face wipe brand!</li>
            <li> I started getting them through Amazon a while ago because they were hard to find where I live .</li>
            <li> Instead they just smear it around without actually breaking it down and removing it.</li>
            <li> product does sting my skin as it&#x27;s drying, but it isn&#x27;t nearly as bad as most other facial cleansers I&#x27;ve used and it doesn&#x27;t redden my skin at all.</li>
            <li> There is some slight and brief irritation if you happen to have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> however, sometimes they do make my face sting a little bit for a short time after using</li>
            <li> Just a little powder foundation and your basic eye liner and mascara.</li>
            <li> All of the other unused towelettes dry out within a day, (who uses 10 towelettes in one day?)</li>
            <li> But when it comes to mascara, these towelettes don&#x27;t really have the power behind them that Pond&#x27;s do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a wet wipe that has been so ineffective.  </li>
            <li> It feels too rough on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I just use a wet washcloth to wipe off any remaining moisture from towelettes so the tingling goes away.  </li>
            <li> I take them with me whenever I travel - especially on long work trips - and use one each day when I get home from work.  </li>
            <li> Furthermore aveeno&#x27;s cloths required to fully wet and wash/rinse your face</li>
            <li> scent is neither unpleasant nor too strong for me, but it does tend toward the clinical rather than pleasing or \\&quot;fresh.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> However, the actual packaging is not airtight and the wet towels dried out after only a few months!  </li>
            <li> My only minor negative is that I feel a residue on my skin and feel the need to rinse my face and hands afterwards.</li>
            <li> But she uses the other scents says she thinks it helps a bit with her acne too.</li>
            <li> but you get 30 towelettes as opposed to 25 that the other brands offer</li>
            <li> The other wipes I&#x27;ve tried leave a film on your skin which these don&#x27;t seem to do.  </li>
            <li> Well I ordered these for my girlfriend, with a bunch of other Burt&#x27;s Bees products.  </li>
            <li> On top of it burning, it STINKS!</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> but I know it doesn&#x27;t incite my ache like some other cleansers do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a formula thing or the texture, but they just seem to smear it around and not actually pick it up.  </li>
            <li> I prefer these to other brands.</li>
            <li> I have tried other towels, but they all feel like sandpaper by comparison.</li>
            <li> Not sure if thisis atypical</li>
            <li> It says it takes off makeup, but just a small application of pencil eyeliner it still cannot wipe off even after several attempts.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get burning eyes like some other wipes and they take off everything even waterproof mascara.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Burt&#x27;s Bees products before and decided to give these a try.  </li>
            <li> I have tried different brands in the past.</li>
            <li> Every other month, two packs show up on my doorstep.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a pack dry out yet and, aside from the little door not always being flush, I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> and I hope one day I can go back to the amazing skin I had before using this AWFUL product.</li>
            <li> It hardly takes any time at all, but makes such a difference!</li>
            <li> these towelettes is that they are not powerful when it comes to makeup removing.</li>
            <li> (I grab at random out of a drawer, use a whole package, then move on).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you have any ingredient sensitivities, please go to the product page and scroll down -- the ingredients are listed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Target and Walmart usually have a single 30 pack for $5.99.</li>
            <li> I previously used the Target brand of cleansing wipes until I switched to all paraben-free products.  </li>
            <li> I get less bumps on my face since I started using Burts Bee.</li>
            <li> but my face burns slightly after I use it.</li>
            <li> I wear smudge proof / so-called water proof eyebrow pencil and eyeliner - black.  </li>
            <li> I ended up cutting mine in half with sterilized scissors and only using half one day and the other half the next day.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to worry about drying out, or if I want them hot or cold.</li>
            <li> I usually pay at least $6 locally.</li>
            <li> I wish they were HALF the size because of how much waste there is...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the smell, and they leave a slightly odd residue that I don&#x27;t feel with all makeup removal towelettes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that they reconsider their scent choice for this product and perhaps manufacture something a little less harsh.</li>
            <li> They even burn my eyes a little when I&#x27;m removing my eye makeup.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to pull out just one at a time, so you end up either wasting some wipes or trying to stuff them back in the little opening.</li>
            <li> While both of these wipes left very little residue (and the same cannot be said for the Neutrogena, unfortunately, which left a horrible heavy film on my face)I still like to rinse with cool water after using the towelettes.</li>
            <li> I must say, I do not have trouble with acne</li>
            <li> I use them everyday to remove makeup, cleanse after the gym or freshen up before a night out.</li>
            <li> But keep that in mind if you are looking for a heavy duty removal wipe!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These towelettes remove food from hands, but then you need water to remove the perfumed solution left behind by the towelettes.  </li>
            <li> They are so heavily perfumed that I always regret using them.  </li>
            <li> have been using these for a few years now</li>
            <li> I use them everyday.</li>
            <li> In any case, the smell is gone from my skin after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t wear heavy makeup</li>
            <li> Sometimes it takes a few passes to get all the eye liner or mascara off.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> The first week or so these did slightly sting my skin, nothing too bad though, and it seems my skin did get used to the product.  </li>
            <li> Oh, and I also cut them in half!  </li>
            <li> It is almost impossible to get out of the wash cloth if I forget to wipe off the make-up with something else first.  </li>
            <li> Not strongly scented.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell at all, and it dried out my face pretty bad to where i started getting ba acne too.</li>
            <li> - they make my eyelids feel raw every time I use them.</li>
            <li> Usually I adore the Burt&#x27;s Bees scents (which are often citrus and honey and fruity), however, so</li>
            <li> I usually have to use another form of makeup remover.  </li>
            <li> Weird scent; will go back to peaches one and to the grapefruit one.</li>
            <li> I can get really lazy about washing my face at the end of the day</li>
            <li> I use these because, well, I&#x27;m just too friggin&#x27; lazy to wash my face every night.  </li>
            <li> Not sure I would buy these again.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s because of this..</li>
            <li> Stung my skin under my eyes super bad!</li>
            <li> They also don&#x27;t dry out my face, they don&#x27;t leave a weird residue, and they don&#x27;t leave my skin feeling</li>
            <li> one gripe is that it&#x27;s hard to pull out just one towelette from the package.  </li>
            <li> but there is a sticker over the opening and a hard plastic door over that.</li>
            <li> Hard to find item for &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34;, but, will keep looking.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, I have one definite disappointment to complain about with these towelettes.</li>
            <li> They are thick and even remove my waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> find myself scrubbing at my eyes to remove my makeup (which I have never had a problem with removing with other wipes), and then some of the solution gets in them (and is uncomfortable)</li>
            <li> Having paid for them, though, I mean to use them up.  </li>
            <li> seriously.</li>
            <li> They SERIOUSLY burned around my eyes</li>
            <li> I always end up getting soap in my eyes when I&#x27;m taking off make-up late at night, and this cleansing wipe does the job without causing any eye injuries to my tired self, which I apprecaite.  </li>
            <li> The scent is not pleasant, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> it even made my cheeks swollen and red! :(</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t believe you&#x27;ll be disappointed trying these facial wipes and bet like me, you&#x27;ll keep reordering them.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this purchase, and VERY dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> also am annoyed by the packaging...</li>
            <li> Perhaps that is meant to provide exfoliation, but it is just irritating.  </li>
            <li> Also, there&#x27;s this unappealing smell in the towelettes.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t leave them behind again.  </li>
            <li> I used to buy another brand but got tired of seeing all the chemicals.</li>
            <li> The scent was not pleasant (typical Burt&#x27;s bees product smell) that irritated my eyes and worthlessly did not remove my eye makeup.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with a Burt&#x27;s Bees product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll continue to buy these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sadly, they are SO ineffective and also sting and burn around my eyes.</li>
            <li> (I wear liquid foundation, though, and it is sometimes difficult to get all of that</li>
            <li> These are the worst facial wipes i&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> But it does sadly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After I cleanse my face with the towelette, I like to wash it out with cold water and then use it to rinse my skin from any residue.</li>
            <li> I use these when my face feels dirty or grimmy.</li>
            <li> I am beyond disappointed and needless to say I will NOT be ordering these again.</li>
            <li> Burn so bad and wont go away.</li>
            <li> It stung so bad just wiping my eye area</li>
            <li> I had a bad reaction including redness and swelling.</li>
            <li> Unbearable :(</li>
            <li> A disappointment!</li>
            <li> try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed.  </li>
            <li> , I broke out in patches and was terribly itchy.</li>
            <li> Removing all kinds of dirt and grim and oil.  </li>
            <li> I bought a pack of these and they&#x27;re horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really like this product. I use them twice a day on my face. They make my face so nice and soft. Nice smell too. My granddaughter had the cucumber one and she didn&#x27;t care for the smell. But she uses the other scents says she thinks it helps a bit with her acne too.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with a Burt&#x27;s Bees product. This cloth cleans well and smells nice. It&#x27;s refreshing to use.</li>
            <li> I have been going through various \\&quot;natural\\&quot; facial wipes recently, looking for the right one for me. Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll continue to buy these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good:&lt;br /&gt;I love the scent (sort of citrusy, stronger than other wipes I&#x27;ve used). It does not linger once you&#x27;ve tossed the wipe.&lt;br /&gt;They seem to remove foundation, blush, liquid eyeliner, all fine.&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t leave my skin dry or oily, no residue (I have dry skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad:&lt;br /&gt;I also am annoyed by the packaging... You&#x27;ll pull 2-3 out at a time. This was not well thought out. I&#x27;m constantly jamming the extras back in.&lt;br /&gt;They take a lot of work to remove mascara (I use Tarte mascara, not waterproof). This means I end up rubbing around my eyes quite a bit and they become red at the outer corners/lids and feel sensitive. After splashing with water, that seems to go away. Moistening the towels also does not help with mascara removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also tried yes to cucumbers and I think they removed my mascara more effectively, although they were much drier and did not smell as good as these. I&#x27;ll have to try another brand of back to the Yes brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t wear mascara, or want these just as a refresher, I would recommend them. If you&#x27;re looking for makeup removal, I would not recommend them.</li>
            <li> I love these - they remove makeup, smell good, all natural.  I love Burt&#x27;s Bees company.  The price is right too - compare it to any other facial wipes out there, and this is a great deal, especially if you do Subscribe and Save.  I also rip them in half, so they last double the time!</li>
            <li> Very good make up remover/ cleansing cloths.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and I try to keep to all natural products. I&#x27;ve even tried other natural wipes that make my face burn no matter how &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; they are. These clean really well and don&#x27;t cause skin irritation! Even took off all the grease face paint from Halloween!</li>
            <li> I love Burts Bees, so I was excited when these wipes came out. Sadly, they are SO ineffective and also sting and burn around my eyes. They barely remove makeup and certainly do not remove eye makeup. Instead they just smear it around without actually breaking it down and removing it. I&#x27;ll be returning this product.</li>
            <li> Gentle cleaning, removes make up and mascara.  Love to have this on subscription so I don&#x27;t run out</li>
            <li> Love these face towels. I&#x27;m a guy and I use one of these every night before I go to bed instead of washing my face and my skin hasn&#x27;t been clearer. I use to wash my face every night and it kept my skin fairly clear but from time to time I would get a small breakout on my forehead. I&#x27;ve had these on auto renewal from Amazon for about 5 months now and I haven&#x27;t had a breakout yet. Just grab a wipe, clean you face in less than a minute and then throw it away. Done and done.</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products.  The facial wipes are handy, refreshing, and (most important for me) no toxic ingredients.  My big problem with them is the packaging.  It is very hard to pull out just one at a time, so you end up either wasting some wipes or trying to stuff them back in the little opening.</li>
            <li> I bought these before I had my son so I could wash my face easily  in the hospital. I have continued to use them at home when the baby doesn&#x27;t allow me much hygiene time and unlike the other reviewer,  it does get off all of my makeup and I think they are easy to pull out of the package.  I like how the package snaps open &amp; closed. I think I will buy these for any friends about to have babies and recommend them to anyone who likes washing their face with a wipe!</li>
            <li> i actually keep these in my car.  I have normal to oily skin and often when I am commuting from work, especially if i need to head somewhere else before home, i really feel the need to wipe my face.  These are so easy to keep on hand and are very refreshing and smell great.  They are a nice pick me up, and i would definitely recommend.  however, sometimes they do make my face sting a little bit for a short time after using but i still like them.</li>
            <li> I love these!  They remove make-up really well and are gentle on the skin.  They even do a great job removing mascara!  I purchase these through the Subscribe and Save program in order to get the best possible price.</li>
            <li> These are ok, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy them again.  The smell is a bit overpowering; it seems fine at first, then you realize that you don&#x27;t want to open them because you know what the smell inside is.  Also, I have sensitive skin, so I can&#x27;t use this color every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that, while these do get makeup off my skin and removes some of the oil, raw, unfiltered honey does a better job.</li>
            <li> Stung my skin under my eyes super bad! Unbearable :(</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only tried the Kirland facial wipes and the Burt&#x27;s Bees ones, and I definitely prefer the Kirkland towlettes.  They smell much better and feel much more soothing.  The Burt&#x27;s Bees ones leave my skin feeling sticky and sweet (and sometimes even make my skin sting).  These do remove all my makeup but don&#x27;t leave my skin feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> I use these to refresh my face and neck after my gym workout. I think they are great-nice, large towelette size, not too thick or too thin, and nicely scented.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this, but when I started wiping my face, the first thing that came to my mind was it smelled like a linens and towels at a cheap motel room.  It was very objectionable to me.  The wipe itself is nice, but I did find them to be stingy and drying.  I will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> The Burt&#x27;s Bees cleansing towelettes are great.  Not only easy to carry on trips but does an extraordinary job in cleaning your face of makeup.</li>
            <li> In the last couple months I have purchased and used three brands of facial wipes/towelettes: Pond&#x27;s (the \\&quot;Evening Soothe\\&quot; variety in the purple packaging), Neutrogena, and now this Burt&#x27;s Bees. I couldn&#x27;t stand the residue left by Neutrogena&#x27;s and once the package was used I tried Pond&#x27;s, which has a lovely scent (I much preferred the Evening Soothe scent to their \\&quot;morning\\&quot; scent) and I&#x27;ve been very happy with Pond&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when I saw that Burt&#x27;s Bees has a new facial wipe I had to try them, seeing as Burt&#x27;s Bees makes wonderful skin products that I LOVE. I&#x27;m a licensed cosmetologist so I know good skin care when I see it, and Burt&#x27;s Bees has always produced fantastic products (I highly recommend their Orange Facial Cleanser and Radiance SPF 15 Day Lotion, by the way). So, naturally, I was excited to try this new product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is a bit higher than Pond&#x27;s but you get 30 towelettes as opposed to 25 that the other brands offer so I was okay with that difference. I was impressed by the softness and the size of Burt&#x27;s wipes. They are the size of a standard wash cloth, which is nice since some mornings I would find myself using two of Pond&#x27;s wipes since they are a bit smaller. However, since the Burt&#x27;s wipes are so soft I&#x27;ve found that they don&#x27;t have the same \\&quot;scrubbing\\&quot; power that the other two brands that I have tried had. Neutrogena&#x27;s had added texture bumps on one size that was helpful for scrubbing &amp; exfoliating, and Pond&#x27;s was still soft but textured slightly to help scrub your face a bit also. Burt&#x27;s, on the other hand, are much thinner and have little, if any, real texture to them (like a Wet Ones or other baby wipe). Because of this, I feel that they fall slightly short compared to the other two--they don&#x27;t exfoliate or remove dirt/makeup quite as efficiently as those which are textured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, that only makes Burt&#x27;s wipes more soothing &amp; gentle on sensitive skin. So I supposed you have to decide which effect you are going for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I commend Burt&#x27;s Bees for working so many organic &amp; natural ingredients into their products. This is a HUGE plus for these towelettes, the fact that they are \\&quot;99% natural\\&quot;. Also, no animal testing is also a big bonus with Burt&#x27;s Bees. I love this company and what they stand for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I have one definite disappointment to complain about with these towelettes. The scent is not pleasant, in my opinion. Although my husband smelled them and thought they smelled lemony and minty and fresh, to me the scent is just like that of Pine Sol. Usually I adore the Burt&#x27;s Bees scents (which are often citrus and honey and fruity), however, so I&#x27;m hoping that they reconsider their scent choice for this product and perhaps manufacture something a little less harsh. It didn&#x27;t smell at all like white tea or nature. To me they smell like concentrated cleaning solution. Despite it being \\&quot;99% natural\\&quot;, this isn&#x27;t a scent I like near my face. Nonetheless, I will probably continue to use them since they are very gentle on my sensitive, far skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another feature, or lack thereof, with these towelettes is that they are not powerful when it comes to makeup removing. Sure, they take off my foundation just fine, and my eye shadow, too. But when it comes to mascara, these towelettes don&#x27;t really have the power behind them that Pond&#x27;s do. Pond&#x27;s wipes easily removed my mascara, these wipes do not. I am a heavy makeup wearer, however, and this factor might not be as significant to some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve come to think: I like the Pond&#x27;s wipes best for at night when I take off my makeup and really wash my face. I like the Burt&#x27;s Bees wipes best for the morning as just a fresh wipe clean, or when I have a \\&quot;light duty\\&quot; job such as cleaning smeared makeup from under my eyes and such. While both of these wipes left very little residue (and the same cannot be said for the Neutrogena, unfortunately, which left a horrible heavy film on my face)I still like to rinse with cool water after using the towelettes. (Cool water rinsing is always a good idea after cleansing with warm water as it helps contract your pores and thus protects your skin from dirt, oils, and polution.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these facial cleansing towelettes by Burt&#x27;s Bees to the person who wears little or no makeup, absolutely. I even think these wipes make fantastic, easy skin care for men. To those who need a more powerful facial wipe, I would say go with Pond&#x27;s or something else altogether. This is a good product, other than the smell I&#x27;m pretty happy with it, but it&#x27;s not one of those products that is sure to suit everyone.(Cool water rinsing is always a good idea after cleansing with warm water as it helps contract your pores and thus protects your skin from dirt, oils, and polution.)

            <li> These face wipes are gentle on the skin with a light (not overpowering) fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using, the skin is left feeling clean and refreshed without a soapy residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They dry quickly without leading to drying or cracking.</li>
            <li> These towels are the best. A quick and gentle away to get my makeup off and a mini facial at the same time. I will be ordering more very soon!</li>
            <li> so i tried these makeup remover wipes and at first my face felt so nice and they smell so good but the next thing i see is that i brokeout also so after that im not buying them again... but that was just me it could totally work for someone else</li>
            <li> I really enjoy having these wipes!! I must say, I do not have trouble with acne and I don&#x27;t wear a ton of make up daily. Just a little powder foundation and your basic eye liner and mascara. I do have pretty sensitive skin that tends to be more on the dry side. All I needed was a gentle, cleansing wipe to get the job done. Another reviewer had mentioned that she wished it had more of an exfoliating texture, but also like she had mentioned, this cloth is perfect for skin like mine. It is gentle, effective and I have even noticed the areas that seem to stay a little on the red side seem to be more consistent with the rest of my skin. Happy customer!!! :)</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these. I use them all the time and keep some in my roller derby bag for wiping off the stink of roller derby pad funk after practices. They are lovely and the smell is nicely balanced and not overpowering</li>
            <li> These are the best wipes I have ever tried! They leave your face feeling clean and refreshed without leaving a filmy feeeling like other wipes I have purchased. Guys even like them! Love all the water I save from not having to wash my face at the basin (and no more water all over the bathroom floor)! Burt&#x27;s Bees best product yet!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time fan of Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s chapstick, so I was pretty excited to try these wipes. I really didn&#x27;t like the way they smelled, and the more I used them the more I broke out.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend these.</li>
            <li> I like using Burt&#x27;s Bees products... they are rated well on the Good Guide and I feel like I am treating myself and the planet a little better when compared to the other products I could be buying.  These particular towelettes are good... nice large size, not too much or too little liquid/moisture in each towelette, they have a slight and pleasant smell to them... not overpowering, and they get most of my make-up off... there is always a bit of eye make-up they don&#x27;t get.  Overall, I like them and will continue to buy them unless I find something better in the future.</li>
            <li> My favorite makeup remover wipes.</li>
            <li> Great make-up wipes. I also like the Sensitive Skin version, too.</li>
            <li> Best part about these - the packaging. The plastic lid actually keeps the towelettes from drying out, unlike other towelette containers that only have stickers to keep the air out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I go back and forth on these so really it&#x27;s like a 3.5. The cloth is much softer and thicker than the ones from Say Yes to Carrots (Cucumber version), or Pond&#x27;s. My facial skin likes the cloth when I only use one towelette. If I use two, which is how many I like to use when wearing a lot of makeup, my skin turns red, and starts to sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These also seem to dry out my cheeks. I do have sensitive skin, and dry cheeks, so with these two issues, I do have trouble finding towelettes that don&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Product itself is good.  Package is overstuffed, so it&#x27;s easy to pull out two when you only wanted one.  Adhesive seal does not remain sealed, which is no big deal unless it&#x27;s going to sit for a long time.  Towelette is made of a good material and solution does the job as far as cleaning.  Not strongly scented.  Good price.</li>
            <li> these are amazing.. i keep them in my car for when im about to go to the gym/after the gym&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;face feels refreshed and clean, i dont think i&#x27;ll ever buy another brand!</li>
            <li> I love these face wipes! No only do they clean your face of dirt and make-up but they also smell fantastic and are good for your skin!</li>
            <li> I have used these and about 3 other brands&#x27; version of wipes and these are by far the best for my skin (which is normal/combination).  LOVE THEM!  They smell great, leave you feeling clean but not greasy nor stripped dry either.  The other wipes I&#x27;ve tried leave a film on your skin which these don&#x27;t seem to do.  They are a good size and smell fantastic.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.  These made me break out.</li>
            <li> Well I ordered these for my girlfriend, with a bunch of other Burt&#x27;s Bees products.  They showed up, packaging was great, shipping was great.  After we opened them, BOTH boxes were dried out, which leads me to believe that they were either stored inappropriately or are just old.  I am beyond disappointed and needless to say I will NOT be ordering these again.</li>
            <li> Not moist enough and didn&#x27;t like smell.</li>
            <li> People must be getting paid to make these reviews because these wipes BURN!! Burn so bad and wont go away. On top of it burning, it STINKS! These are going right in the trash. look it up on youtube REAL people made videos warning people from buying this product. Stick to Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that will clean my face throughout the day since I work in a hot environment.&lt;br /&gt;While I like the smell, my skin does not tolerate it, I broke out in patches and was terribly itchy.</li>
            <li> I take these with me when I travel since they are small and easy to shove into the corners of my suitcase or backpack. Great for cleaning your face or body where every you are traveling or just on the go. I like the company and the White Tea is really soothing.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine gave me one of this cloths for my face and I loved it.  They don&#x27;t leave your face feeling sticky like baby wipes do.  The only issue I&#x27;ve had is using it around my eyes.  It says it removes makeup, which it does, it just burns using it around my eyes.  Other than that, this wipes are amazing and leave your face feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I really despise washing my face with cleanser and water at the end of every day.  Call it laziness if you will, but I prefer to give my face the old scrub down with facial towelettes such as these.  I previously used the Target brand of cleansing wipes until I switched to all paraben-free products.  I love these!  I personally like the smell (some reviewers complain about it) and they seem to clean my face really well.  Now mind you, I don&#x27;t wear makeup very often, but on the rare occasion when I do, these don&#x27;t really do the trick taking it off... especially when it comes to removing mascara.  You can scrub all you&#x27;d like, but I think you will just end up peeling off your first layer of dermis.  I usually have to use another form of makeup remover.  Anyway, because I don&#x27;t wear makeup very often, I find these great for nightly use.  Oh, and I also cut them in half!  I have found that if I&#x27;m not out rolling around in the dirt all day (which I don&#x27;t tend to do very often), half of a towelette is more than sufficient.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used just about every facial cleansing wipe on the market. These are my favorite! I keep some in my gym bag, some in my desk at work and of course a stash in my bathroom.  I use them everyday to remove makeup, cleanse after the gym or freshen up before a night out. The scent isn&#x27;t strong but if you&#x27;re looking for no fragrance try the sensitive skin version. No water needed, quick and effective.  Amazon has the best price I&#x27;ve found. Target and Walmart usually have a single 30 pack for $5.99.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and many towelettes have not worked for me. These don&#x27;t irritate my skin at all and have a great scent</li>
            <li> Item was not as described. Instead of receiving 2 packs of 30-count towelettes, I received 6 TRAVEL SIZED 10-count towelettes. Not only are the travel sized towelettes MUCH smaller than the normal ones, but they also come in packaging that CANNOT be resealed. All of the other unused towelettes dry out within a day, (who uses 10 towelettes in one day?) which pretty much leaves them completely useless. Very disappointed in this purchase, and VERY dissatisfied. Will not be purchasing from this seller ever again.</li>
            <li> After I use these towelettes, my face smells like a fairy just gave it a sponge bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But seriously. If find that these work very well for refreshing your face. I usually use them right before I go to bed or during the day when my face is feeling a bit oily. I don&#x27;t wear makeup, so I don&#x27;t know how it reacts with that, but I know it doesn&#x27;t incite my ache like some other cleansers do.</li>
            <li> I brought this along on a two month backpacking trip through Latin America, and found this very helpful during multiday treks with no showers, long days walking in the Caribbean sun, etc. The scent is a bit strong, but I got over it. Also, the resealable packaging never leaked so that was a BIG plus!</li>
            <li> These towellets do a great job for removing make up. I have sensitive skin and these do not irritate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is lovely but not too overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I cleanse my face with the towelette, I like to wash it out with cold water and then use it to rinse my skin from any residue. It&#x27;s very refreshing.</li>
            <li> I love these wipes. They are so convenient and they smell great. The &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; kind is unscented but smells weird. These wipes remove dirt, oil, and makeup from all over my face--no matter what brand I used.</li>
            <li> These cloths do a pretty good job of getting all the make-up and grime off my face after a long day, but the scent takes a little while to get used to - I thought they smelled a bit like mop soap or kitchen cleaner at first. On the plus side, the cloths are big and very sturdy, and they don&#x27;t make my face sting or burn.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different face wipes and have never experience the problem I had with these. Though they are a great size, moistened well, and I like other Burt&#x27;s Bees products, these wipes stung and burned on my skin, especially my eyes. I used one to remove some mascara and eyebrow makeup last night (about 12 hours ago), and the skin around my eyes is still blotchy, red, and irritated the next morning. While I think I might be allergic to one of the ingredients, I&#x27;ve seen other reviews reporting a similar experience--so just be careful, and avoid using this near your eyes!</li>
            <li> This works amazing and the scent is very soothing and not loaded with chemicals scents! I am always have been such a great fan of burts bee. It is not irritating to my eyes like others wipes.</li>
            <li> quick cleanser for the face, neck and ear areas.  I don&#x27;t use it every day, but it&#x27;s a very quick, refreshing addition to any facial care.</li>
            <li> I tried these to replace my liquid makeup remover and I really like them. They take off all my makeup and the citrus scent is wonderful.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my face really dry like some others I&#x27;ve tried. I will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> Really good if you want something less harsh to cleaner face. I sometimes use alcohol wipes, but they can be drying. These burts bees wipes are not so harsh on the skin and they smell good too!!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have been searching for the perfect lazy way to wash/clean my face every day before bed.  The first week or so these did slightly sting my skin, nothing too bad though, and it seems my skin did get used to the product.  I never broke out using them and I really enjoyed the smell.  I am still experimenting with other cleansing towelettes, but these are definitely a contender for me to purchase again as my &amp;#34;chosen&amp;#34; nightly face towelette :)</li>
            <li> Not a fan. These were basically baby wipes.</li>
            <li> I use these to clean my face after shaving or just whenever.  Some of my lady friends have used them to remove their makeup and said it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You feel clean and fresh after using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one gripe is that it&#x27;s hard to pull out just one towelette from the package.  Maybe my fingers are chubbier than the intended users.  Nonetheless, it would be easier if the hole to access the towelettes was bigger. Sometimes size matters.</li>
            <li> I love these! Great for day to day use or just when traveling! They make my face feel clean, remove my makeup and are easy to use on small children in motion.</li>
            <li> Nothing special about these facial cleansing clothes. They&#x27;re just your average facial cleansing clothes, which are good at removing make-up and make for a quick, easy way to clean your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do leave a residue on the skin that I find needs to be rinsed off, but this the case for all facial cleansing clothes I&#x27;ve tried over the years... So, no big surprise.</li>
            <li> I wish Burt&#x27;s Bees made more products in this smell. I use them every night to wash off my face. They take off all my makeup and mascara nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish they had a body wash, etc that smells like that.</li>
            <li> Smell great. Not the greatest for makeup removal unit I really like them overall and will continue to use them.</li>
            <li> These are a great price and simply I love this product. I have used these face wipes for years, and will purchase again through amazon.com</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s bees products. But these broke out my face and made the skin around my eyes tingle and get red. Could just be me though, but I had to stop using them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve go through these packs about once a month, and have been using them off-and-on for several years.  I loved them initially - great smell, leaves your skin clean feeling with no residue - but tried a few times searching for cheaper alternatives.  Everything else I&#x27;ve tried has a soapy texture or seems to leave a film. These are the perfect face wipe.</li>
            <li> these are the best! the scent is my favorite part. I am a fan of all things burts bees, but these wipes might be my favorite!</li>
            <li> I switched to these from the Pond&#x27;s wipes. No irritation on my hyper-sensitive skin, not even around my eyes. It smells so fresh and floral. I love them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will note that these are smooth wipes. They don&#x27;t have the micro-beads that &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; makeup off like some wipes. I actually prefer the smoothness because it&#x27;s gentler. But keep that in mind if you are looking for a heavy duty removal wipe!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An excellent value, especially through the Subscribe and Save program.</li>
            <li> This is a good deal especially when store prices are so expensive! I hope the seller doesn&#x27;t increase the price. I like how these feel on my skin no burning or stinging. Takes off my make up (not water-proof though that I need to use something else for that). They aren&#x27;t as &amp;#34;juicy&amp;#34; as other wipes but moist enough. I loveee exfoliating my lips with these wipes! After I remove my face make up I use the clean edges and remove dry skin from my lips. These will make my lips feel plumper and have that lip gloss plumping feeling (doesn&#x27;t hurt), and they look plumper afterwards. Applying lipstick/lipgloss looks better too. I enjoy the &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; ingredients it doesn&#x27;t make me feel like I&#x27;m rubbing my lips or face with some random chemicals. These CAN be pricey considering what you can buy in bulk at Costco... but I am probably going to be purchasing these until I&#x27;m old and gray..lol</li>
            <li> Very nice scent - even my teenage son thinks so &amp;#34;what&#x27;s this nice smell all about&amp;#34; and I quote. Anyway, not &#x27;scrubby&#x27; enough cloths but with a little elbow grease they clean off makeup very well.</li>
            <li> They do not have an overwhelming scent like some do..mild witch Hazel is what I smell..great for hot summer days/on trips..or a quick clean up</li>
            <li> These are sold as cleansing and makeup removal towelettes. They do a fine job of removing facial makeup, but when I try to remove my eye makeup, they suck.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a formula thing or the texture, but they just seem to smear it around and not actually pick it up.  I&#x27;ve never used a wet wipe that has been so ineffective.  And I really WANT to like them, partly because they&#x27;re inexpensive, partly because they&#x27;re Burts Bees, and partly because they smell so dang good (which is why they got 2 stars).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find myself scrubbing at my eyes to remove my makeup (which I have never had a problem with removing with other wipes), and then some of the solution gets in them (and is uncomfortable) each night. The next morning, I still somehow wake up with smudges under my eyes, and after my shower, I have to remove additional makeup that has once again smudged from around my lashline.  I will finish using the (2 packs!) that I bought, and never buy again.</li>
            <li> Because i travel from and to the U.S., I use a lot of Burt&#x27;s Bees products. I am very pleased with these and they were quickly shipped. I recommend the item and seller highly.</li>
            <li> I used a generic off brand face/makeup cleansing wipe prior to finding these and I will not go back. They really do well with makeup removal and smell great.</li>
            <li> I love these wipes. I have severely sensitive skin, and these have never made me break out or cause dry skin. They are also an incredible deal on Amazon subscribe &amp; save. I usually pay at least $6 locally. I paid under $8 for 2 on Amazon. It&#x27;s all about the deals!</li>
            <li> I prefer these to other brands. It is not too smelly and feels light, but does the job perfectly. Very happy that I found them here.</li>
            <li> I have always used and loved Neutrogena&#x27;s facial cleaning towelettes, but since I like Burt&#x27;s Bees&#x27; products, I thought I would try a different brand of facial cleaning towelettes.  First of all, these have a really, really strong smell, and leave a filmy feeling on my skin.  Secondly, they made me break out!  I stopped using them and went back to Neutrogena, which has never made me break out.  A disappointment!</li>
            <li> I have bought several brands over the years, Neutrogena, elf, etc. And 60 wipes for under ten bucks. Can&#x27;t beat that. Burts bees is also more natural than the rest. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I love these wipes. They feel great on my face. They clean well and smell great. The price seems very fair.</li>
            <li> I had used these facial wipes for several months when I saw a magazine article that said they had been voted as one of the best products by the readership.  It didn&#x27;t surprise me, because they are the best I have ever used...and I have tried four or five different brands.  They are larger than most, soft like fabric, soothing to the skin, and they take off every bit of makeup - even eye makeup, without rinsing.  I just tried Burt&#x27;s Bees new &amp;#34;pink grapefruit&amp;#34; towelettes for normal to oily skin and they are also wonderful and have a light grapefruit scent.</li>
            <li> I love Burts Bees and these don&#x27;t disappoint.  The are the best and I think I&#x27;ve used every brand out there.  Very soft on my skin.</li>
            <li> These facial wipes have just the slightest scent to them but they work on my very sensitive skin.  Removing all kinds of dirt and grim and oil.  Great for if you are in a hurry to clean your face.</li>
            <li> I mostly use these when I am traveling so that I don&#x27;t leave eye makeup on washcloths at friends&#x27; and families&#x27; homes. The smell is refreshing and does the trick of both cleaning and moisturizing without having to tote along multiple product. At home I&#x27;ll pull them out when I feel lazy and don&#x27;t want to my full skin care routine of cleansing, eye make up removal, and night moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Love these face wipes and all Burt&#x27;s Bees products!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fireman and I use these at work to get all sorts of nastiness off of my face. They work surprisingly well to get deeply ingrained gunk off of me. I haven&#x27;t had a pack dry out yet and, aside from the little door not always being flush, I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I like the individually packaged wipes so these did not meet my needs.</li>
            <li> these are a gift for someone in the military -- how handy!!! Thanks Burt&#x27;s for coming out with new all natural products, sure appreciate your product integrity!!!</li>
            <li> These towelettes remove food from hands, but then you need water to remove the perfumed solution left behind by the towelettes.  They are so heavily perfumed that I always regret using them.  Even after rinsing my hands with water, the scent stays with me all day.  Also, the towelettes are not individually wrapped, so they&#x27;re not convenient for slipping into a lunch bag for cleaning hands after a picnic.  Having paid for them, though, I mean to use them up.  I keep a package of these towelettes in the car&#x27;s console.</li>
            <li> Update:  After buying the white tea towelettes, I later received peach/willow bark exfoliating towelettes in a set.  I do like them more than the white tea ones - both the scent and the way they work.  Because of that, I&#x27;m raising my rating from 3 stars to 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;~~&lt;br /&gt;This review is for the white tea extract wipes, not the exfoliating wipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve enjoyed Burt&#x27;s Bees products in the past, and I like the convenience of facial wipes, even though I don&#x27;t use them all the time.  After trying a couple of other brands, I saw these and thought they would be well worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed.  The wipes are large, a definite plus, and have plenty of cleansing space.  The moisture content of the package is about right - not too dry but not sloppy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used two full packages, thinking I might like them better as I got used to them.  Nope.  I really don&#x27;t like the scent of them.  I do like tea scent, but these don&#x27;t smell like that to me.  I don&#x27;t like the texture of the wipe.  It feels too rough on my skin.  Perhaps that is meant to provide exfoliation, but it is just irritating.  They do a decent job of cleansing, not spectacular but not horrid.  But I don&#x27;t like the way my skin feels after using them, a bit sticky and not the clean feeling I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I much prefer the ones I am using now, a store brand that is less expensive, seems to clean better, and smells nicer.  I won&#x27;t be getting Burt&#x27;s Bees facial wipes again.  The are adequate, but there are much better ones to be had.</li>
            <li> Made my face burn during and after using them.  I switched to &amp;#34;Yes To Baby Carrots Face and Nose Wipes&amp;#34; and they work just as well for taking off my makeup with no harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> These wiped leave my face feeling clean, which is all I could ask for. Clean scent, doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling soapy after use.</li>
            <li> This works great removing make-up, but it does make my face tingle afterwards.  I just use a wet washcloth to wipe off any remaining moisture from towelettes so the tingling goes away.  You do not have to &amp;#34;rinse&amp;#34; after using these, but since I don&#x27;t like the tingling, I do.  Until I can bend over a sink again to use my Cerave face wash, this is what I&#x27;m using.  I originally bought to take to the hospital to wash my face while staying there after spinal surgery, but after I got home and realized I cannot bend over the sink to wash my face normally (at night), so I am using these towelettes.</li>
            <li> Love these! I use them to take off my make-up every evening. Works even on waterproof eye liner!</li>
            <li> The scent was not pleasant (typical Burt&#x27;s bees product smell) that irritated my eyes and worthlessly did not remove my eye makeup.</li>
            <li> 60 towelettes?!&lt;br /&gt;Most of the other ones on Amazon have only 25 towelettes and they sell for about $10. With this, you get 60 towelettes for the same price. I say, good deal!&lt;br /&gt;These towelettes are great; they remove make-up easily, are gentle, and leave my face feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product.</li>
            <li> Use them every day. I am busy constantly and these are quick, easy, handy, and I don&#x27;t have weird reactions to it!</li>
            <li> I have tried many different products and this one is soft and does a good job. One sheet will get a whole face of make up removed. The smell is nice too.</li>
            <li> Wonderful cleansing towelettes that easily remove the days makeup and do not irritate my sensitive skin.  One of my favorite products of all time.</li>
            <li> This might just be my skin type but I broke out after using these towels. After using them, my face felt very clean! But I&#x27;m guessing my skin type just didn&#x27;t like them very much.</li>
            <li> I have tried probably 10 different face cloths and these are my favorites.  They are thick and even remove my waterproof mascara. They do make your skin tingle a little, but in a good clean feeling way.  I really didn&#x27;t like the green packaged ones. They really made my skin burn.</li>
            <li> The smell&#x27;s abrasive.</li>
            <li> These are some pretty good Facial Cleansing wipes. Prior to using this I really liked the No. 7 wipes, but these are much better. These leave no residue and remove make up really really well. They don&#x27;t make much headway against my waterproof mascara but they take off foundation, blusher and lipstick really really well. I like the packaging of this as well because the plastic casing cover, prevents this from drying out unlike wipes that just use a sticky tab cover. My favourite thing about these is that they don&#x27;t break me out, something I&#x27;ve suffered with both the Boots and Ponds wipes, AND there is no residue like with the Neutrogena one. This IS only the first step in my nighttime facial cleansing routine but I really like this and will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these cleansing cloths for years now. My favorite is the cucumber one, but this one is great too. Both leave my skin feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> These are so convenient to use before bed. I don&#x27;t want to splash my face with water and wake myself up, so I use these. They don&#x27;t irritate my skin and they smell great. After I&#x27;m done, I use the Burt&#x27;s Bees night cream. Also, they save water so if you have a water bill (I don&#x27;t), that&#x27;s a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> Used it to remove makeup- if you&#x27;re using to get off eyeliner, it is effective but it stings your eyes. Also, there&#x27;s this unappealing smell in the towelettes.</li>
            <li> Love these guys.  I take them with me whenever I travel - especially on long work trips - and use one each day when I get home from work.  Cleans off my (waterproof) makeup, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin with frequent use.  I do wish that perhaps the packaging was a touch better, but I feel this way about everything in these little resealable packets.</li>
            <li> Love these facial wipes; the smell is amazingly soothing and fresh - my face feels clean and brighter after each use.&lt;br /&gt;They do not have any oily residue like some other brands - leaves my face feeling clean</li>
            <li> I have been using Burt&#x27;s Bees product for many years now.  I love most of their products and this facial cleansing towelettes works pretty good and cleans my face really well when I have make-up on.</li>
            <li> On par with other Burt&#x27;s Bees products, these are fantastic. I bought some of these for my wife as a make up remover or morning face cleaner and she loved them! So I was delighted to find them on Amazon for much cheaper than normal stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a whole bunch and now we use them for everything. I keep a pack in my camping stuff stuff and some with my off road vehicles for getting the dust off your face after enjoying the out doors. You could just use baby wipes but in my opinion these feel much better afterward.</li>
            <li> I like these, especially for travel, because they won&#x27;t leak and they leave my face feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man - and I use these! I can&#x27;t tell you how cool and refreshing these are on a hot summer day. I liked them so much, I got my college student son a 2-pack as he&#x27;s working outdoors in the heat at a summer camp.</li>
            <li> It cleans my face well, gets most of the makeup off. It leaves me feeling clean but also a little red.</li>
            <li> my face is clearing up, my pores are getting reduced, it smells great too. They wipe off the makeup with ease and they are always cool.</li>
            <li> These faces wipes are- dare I say it?- the bee&#x27;s knees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, though, they&#x27;re awesome. They remove makeup really well, they don&#x27;t sting my eyes, they don&#x27;t smell disgusting (in fact, they smell pretty good), and they&#x27;re SO convenient! They take off eye makeup fairly alright. It sort of depends on what kind of eye makeup you&#x27;re wearing (is it waterproof?) and how much of it you put on. They also don&#x27;t dry out my face, they don&#x27;t leave a weird residue, and they don&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use these before washing my face with cleanser and water, and this extra step has greatly improved my skin. It hardly takes any time at all, but makes such a difference! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought these to use in Afghanistan as running water isn&#x27;t always available. I use them every morning as I can&#x27;t wash my face. I started using the Garnier ones which were OK, but these are far better. I feel like my face is cleaner and you can visibly see more dirt come off onto the towel.  They leave your face very clean (no residue) and they smell really nice - much better than the Garnier wipes. I&#x27;m going to start using these ones at night even when I get home because they make my face feel so nice and clean. Also, the towels themselves are very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100% recommend them.</li>
            <li> I went on a binge and bought about 7 different kinds of facial cleansing towelettes, determined to find my perfect one. I&#x27;m a fan of other Burt&#x27;s Bees products, so I was excited to finally get to this one (I grab at random out of a drawer, use a whole package, then move on).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are great at removing eye and lip makeup, including waterproof mascara and lip stains, so that&#x27;s a huge plus. They&#x27;re gentle on my skin and eyes. They don&#x27;t leave any residue on my skin, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They definitely have a strong scent but I find it fresh, clean, and pleasant. The package is a soft plastic but there is a sticker over the opening and a hard plastic door over that. The sticker remains sticky even after repeatedly pulling it away and re-sealing it. With this arrangement, the towelettes stay wet long after opening -- which is great, since this package has a lot of towelettes in it. (And yet, because they&#x27;re towelettes instead of a liquid cleanser, they should be convenient for travel.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any ingredient sensitivities, please go to the product page and scroll down -- the ingredients are listed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are large enough that you could use it over your whole face if desired, although I do still prefer to do a wash with a liquid cleanser after using these to remove my makeup. (I wear liquid foundation, though, and it is sometimes difficult to get all of that off.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like these enough that they&#x27;re in the running to be my go-to makeup-removing product in the future. Definitely glad I took a chance and tried them out.</li>
            <li> These clean off make up better than any other cleansing cloth I have used!  Fragrance is not overpowering and your face feels really clean afterwards!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Burt&#x27;s Bees and this is a great price.  have been using these for a few years now and they are my favorits (I have tried LOTS of brands)</li>
            <li> Awesome cloths that smell really nice and make your face feel clean and refreshed. I wish they were HALF the size because of how much waste there is...if there were a perforated line that you could use a half sheet and make it last twice as long, I would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Love these for both travel and everyday use.  One wipe is ample enough to cleanse face/neck area fully.  Smell is subtle but fresh and clean.  Not oily and gets makeup and dirt off easily.  Love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li> These work great for me. I can easily take my makeup off at night and not have to battle the washcloth and the rinsing, etc. It is a total time saver.</li>
            <li> My skin breaks out when using most &amp;#34;hand sanitizes&amp;#34;, but not these.  They are soft, strong (don&#x27;t fall apart), the sheets are fairly large, and quite capable of wiping your face and your hands with a single one and feel like you just washed both.</li>
            <li> Love these face wipes. Takes off make up easily, and leaves your face feeling refreshed. The skin around my eyes is usually pretty sensitive and these don&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all.</li>
            <li> This product does every good for my face. I get less bumps on my face since I started using Burts Bee. It gets makeup off easily too!</li>
            <li> So convenient.  I travel a lot.  These wipes keep my face clean and free of grease.  I made the mistake of not carrying with me one day when traveling and broke out from the dirt on my face.  I won&#x27;t leave them behind again.  The wipes are easy to use, don&#x27;t have a funky odor, and actually cleans without leaving any residue.  All natural wipes.  Nice and quick to use.</li>
            <li> I have been using neutrogena for years, went to reorder and saw these. I&#x27;ve always loved Burts Bees and they were even less expensive! They SERIOUSLY burned around my eyes but I kept using them, now my skin is broken out for the first time in years. They barely take off eye makeup and they really sting. These are the worst facial wipes i&#x27;ve ever used. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin at all and they have ruined my skin. Be careful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Apparently these wipes caused me to get eczema on my face that even after an expensive trip to the dermatologist and special face washes and lotions I can&#x27;t get rid of. These wipes have literally ruined my skin and I hope one day I can go back to the amazing skin I had before using this AWFUL product.</li>
            <li> Did not remove my makeup well. the Neutrogena towelettes are much better!</li>
            <li> I bought these for traveling. I love the scent but my face burns slightly after I use it. I tried some makeup remover wipes I bought from Trader Joes and they are much better. It&#x27;s a shame because I really want to like Burt&#x27;s Bees products.</li>
            <li> They work great and came quick</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, smell great, and do a good job removing makeup. They&#x27;re very refreshing. I have tried other towels, but they all feel like sandpaper by comparison.</li>
            <li> Weird scent; will go back to peaches one and to the grapefruit one. But they&#x27;re still fine and work well!!</li>
            <li> I love these. It cleanses without drying my skin out..</li>
            <li> These towelettes are really nice - they don&#x27;t have an overly perfumey smell (they do have a sent but it is very mild and must be natural as it doesn&#x27;t give me the \\&quot;cheap avon artificial scent headaches\\&quot; that I often get from scented products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also are not greasy feeling at all. When you use them they readily remove your make-up (or dirt/food - I sometimes use them on my little girl who loves to be messy) and they don&#x27;t leave a gross feeling residue on your skin. They also don&#x27;t dry you out - I can use one on my face and I do not have to reapply moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, in a pinch they can be used for any other \\&quot;wiping\\&quot; need, which makes them quite handy when traveling.</li>
            <li> I very rarely wear makeup so I cannot gauge these wipes on their ability to remove makeup. However, these wipes do a good job of making my face feel clean and refreshed. Maybe it&#x27;s because there isn&#x27;t anything extra on my face?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the smell, I think it&#x27;s pleasant but I can understand how some people may not like it.</li>
            <li> smelled waaaay too strong and medicine-y.  not for me.</li>
            <li> I can get really lazy about washing my face at the end of the day but these are really quick and easy. I used to use aveeno&#x27;s positively radiant cleansing cloths which, while they worked wonderfully, they were full of chemicals (a variety of parabens) and i was really wary about prolonged use. Furthermore aveeno&#x27;s cloths required to fully wet and wash/rinse your face and they were always more expensive at my local drug store. with burts bees, its so simple to just wipe my makeup off at the end of the day, no washing/rinsing required. the scent is a sort of sweet citrus- i think its kind of nice. i do agree with other reviewers in that it doesn&#x27;t take off mascara very well... like barely at all. It takes off my powder (bare mineral) makeup but i dont feel like it really gets in there and cleans deeply (though it doesnt claim to). Overall, mostly satisfied and certainly a nice natural option but not sure that I&#x27;ll stick with these forever.</li>
            <li> There face cloths are the BEST! I love them, gentle on my skin, great to remove make up, even mascara. If you are an \\&quot;outdoor\\&quot; girl, keep a pack in your back pack. Great for a freshen up after a hike or bike ride!</li>
            <li> I keep these with me at work and they are great.  I can use one in the middle of the day and it&#x27;s so refreshing!!</li>
            <li> The best thing about these wipes is the smell, theres this fresh citrus scent to them which is perfect after a hard days work. They clean awesome, and theyre very sturdy and thick as well. I actually have very oily skin, and I read in a Mary Kay book that white tea helps with the absorbtion of it, and its totally true! Would reccomend for gals who dont have time to wash their face at night and those with oily skin. Btw tried some from &amp;#34;say yes to tomato&amp;#34;, they sucked!!!</li>
            <li> I love having these in my car or for when I travel. When it gets hot here in Houston it feels nice to clean my face on the go. I do like the grapefruit smelling one&#x27;s better though. I went back and forth trying to decide which one to order, as soon as I ordered these I regretted not ordering the grapefruit ones. Now I have both and love them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle and smells nice too. I use it to take off eye makeup mostly.&lt;br /&gt;Works really well. Recommended it.</li>
            <li> I use these because, well, I&#x27;m just too friggin&#x27; lazy to wash my face every night.  I always end up getting soap in my eyes when I&#x27;m taking off make-up late at night, and this cleansing wipe does the job without causing any eye injuries to my tired self, which I apprecaite.  I buy it in the double packs and would recommend it to anyone, especially those of us who need a regular face washing routine at night due to make-up, dirt, etc., or to those of us who travel.</li>
            <li> I thought I would try this product since Burt&#x27;s Bees products are really good but this one I would never buy again. It takes off the makeup really well however, it stings a lot when removing makeup. The only time it did not sting was when I had no makeup on.</li>
            <li> These work well as they seem to clean well. The reclosable case is nice too. My only complaint is that they smell a little funny... I wouldnt say they smell bad, I just wouldnt say they smell that great. Not sure I would buy these again.</li>
            <li> These are the best cleansing towelettes. They don&#x27;t have all the chemicals you find in the corporate brands. And, they clean well and leave my face soft.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for about two weeks. I am very happy with the product. I don&#x27;t feel that it dries out my sensitive skin, nor does it leave a sticky residue like other makeup remover wipes.</li>
            <li> These are the best makeup facial wipes, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and cleans throughly. It leaves a pleasant moisturizing feel to my face after each use. I love it</li>
            <li> I have used a few different facial cleansing towelettes in the past but none have been as good as this.  I&#x27;ve also used Burt&#x27;s Bees products in the past and have alway been very happy with them.  I wear smudge proof / so-called water proof eyebrow pencil and eyeliner - black.  I don&#x27;t wear a lot of make-up but the black can really do a number on the wash cloth.  It is almost impossible to get out of the wash cloth if I forget to wipe off the make-up with something else first.  However, these facial cleansing towelettes are amazing - the black make-up comes off with just a light wipe!  I couldn&#x27;t believe it!  The towelettes are VERY soft and very easy on the skin.  They are actually quite large.  I ended up cutting mine in half with sterilized scissors and only using half one day and the other half the next day.  They smell fine to me - just a light \\&quot;cleaner\\&quot; smell - not sure exactly how to describe it but I like the smell.  It does not last very long even if you don&#x27;t like it.  I have been using the product for a couple weeks now and when I close to empty, I&#x27;m planning on ordering more.  The price was good and it was a lot easier to pick it out on Amazon, click, pay and wait a couple days for it to show up than it was to run around the stores trying to find something that works.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like these; they&#x27;re getting two stars because, yes, they effectively remove my eye makeup. However, the smell is weird and they are kind of rough - they make my eyelids feel raw every time I use them. Would much rather buy Ponds or Target brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not usually picky about scents, especially natural ones, but these STINK! They actually smell a bit skunky to me and you can smell it for a while after using the product. I also don&#x27;t find these cloths to be as good at removing makeup as some others I&#x27;ve used. They even burn my eyes a little when I&#x27;m removing my eye makeup.</li>
            <li> I love these face wipes! Would definitely buy product again!</li>
            <li> Got some grapefruit ones that sort of knocked these out of the box. These are good if you don&#x27;t like grapefruit scent.</li>
            <li> These are nice, good quality facial towelettes.  They are amply-sized and made of good quality material.  They also smell pleasant and clean well without irritation.  The packaging is excellent - not only is there the sticky tab over the opening (which normally wears out halfway through the package), but there is also a plastic snap tab so that they will stay moist and fresh from beginning to end.  Good quality, good value.</li>
            <li> I too like some others reviewers also got this at my local pharmacy thinking i needed more organic natural stuff on my face since im already dealing with a mild case of eczema on my face, so i didn&#x27;t want none of the harsh stuff but this product burned me tooo!!!!!! It stung so bad just wiping my eye area it even made my cheeks swollen and red! :( i will be throwing these away since i just got a mini packet for 1.99.. wont be buying anymore, I recommend smearing your face with aloe vera if the burning wont go away. I put some on and it starting to feel better already!!</li>
            <li> Bought these facial wipes at Target. I had a bad reaction including redness and swelling. Not sure if thisis atypical but if you decide to buy these wipes, please be cautious and try them on a small area of your face first. I repurposed these wipes for off-label use - they really get the soap scum off my shower curtain.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak highly enough of these!! I have very sensitive skin and have trouble using any other face wipe brand! They smell a bit like fruit loops cereal (to me) but feel and clean amazingly well!! Love all of Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s products!!</li>
            <li> Going somewhere where I didn&#x27;t have access to a hot shower ever day made these a life saver. Kept my face feeling fresh and clean!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.  It says it takes off makeup, but just a small application of pencil eyeliner it still cannot wipe off even after several attempts.  Also the ingredients sting my eyes which I would think should not occur.  But it does sadly.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees...sometimes pricey but I love them so.  Burt&#x27;s Bees leaves my face feeling fresh without feeling like I have lost a layer of skin.  My only issue is that they come pre-moistened, I live in desert country and they dry out fast (add some water and you&#x27;re OK again, though).  I really like the wipes I can wet myself so I don&#x27;t have to worry about drying out, or if I want them hot or cold.</li>
            <li> This facial wipes are superior to anything I&#x27;ve ever used.  They feel so very refreshing and do a great job cleansing my face.  Since I started using them along with one of Burt&#x27;s Bees hydrating night creams with pomegranate oil, my facial dryness has totally disappeared.  Great product as are most of Burt Bees products (love their replenishing lip balm w/pomegranate too)...I&#x27;m slowly but surely getting and loving more and more and more of their products.  I will say that Amazon does a quicker job of getting Burt Bees products to your door step, however, than Burt Bees itself. Don&#x27;t believe you&#x27;ll be disappointed trying these facial wipes and bet like me, you&#x27;ll keep reordering them.</li>
            <li> Gentle wipes with a great subtle fragrance. Target recently increased the price of these to $7.20, so this is a great price for a two pack.</li>
            <li> I use these when my face feels dirty or grimmy. I have found them to be very refreshing and I have purchased them more than once.</li>
            <li> Strong fragrance I am not to fond of but these work great.  I went to the sensitive skin option as these tend to dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several facial cleansing cloths. These are the best. They stay moist in the container. I always had a problem with others not sealing and, of course, the cloth would dry up.</li>
            <li> I have used several facial wipes-Pond&#x27;s, Neutrogena, you name it...these are some of the best wipes I&#x27;ve used!  The smell is great, a nice refreshing, clean smell; and the white tea helps soothe my skin when it gets dry or irritated.  Towelettes are a great size, and don&#x27;t dry out as quickly as the other towelettes I&#x27;ve used; the only complaint I have is these don&#x27;t remove my heavy-duty mascara that I wear for swimming; but I&#x27;ve only found that Boscia Makeup Breakup takes that stuff off!  If these had exfoliating nubbies they would definitely earn a 5, but still a really great value for the quality and quantity you get!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly, better than any spot remover I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t dry my face and they pull out one at a time.  Burt&#x27;s makes good stuff and this didn&#x27;t disappoint either.</li>
            <li> I really love how well this product works, it takes off all of my make-up very easily without much effort.  My only minor negative is that I feel a residue on my skin and feel the need to rinse my face and hands afterwards.</li>
            <li> MY wife says great for cleaning off make up and excess oil-Leaving your skin soft and smooth! So, what cold be better than that! And, I might add the price is right!</li>
            <li> Love this. It helps get all my make up off and it smells yummy.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees towelettes are made of natural ingredients, are nice and soft on the skin, and smell really good. They&#x27;re also reasonably priced. I have definitely switched over from other brands to this one.</li>
            <li> Love this product. So easy to take off my make up. I really like the way Burt&#x60;s bees facial wipes smell, and they leave my face feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of these cleansing towels.  I use on every night before I wash my face and it drastically diminishes the time I spend removing make up.</li>
            <li> I love these.  These are the only wipes that do not burn my eyes.  I started getting them through Amazon a while ago because they were hard to find where I live .</li>
            <li> These are excellent for daily removal of my makeup and fo r v leaning. Gentle on my skin and with a pleasant herbal odor. I use them everyday.</li>
            <li> I have never followed a skin care routine becuase my skin was pretty much perfect until about a year ago. I started notiing fine lines around my mouth, otherwise everything else was okay. I went for my first professional facial revently. They recommended I start a simple cleansing and moisturizing routine. I started out with all natural, high end products. Again, I could not stick to a five step process twice a day. I found these wipes locally and decided to try them. I really like the light, fresh scent and the large size of these cloths. Using these makes my facial care routine easy and I stick to it. These are gentle, but still remove the dirt. One is large enough to do my face, neck and hands. It has improved the texture of my skin. I buy these theough subscribe and save now. The price could be better though.</li>
            <li> I love here. I use them every night</li>
            <li> Seems to do what it&#x27;s supposed to. The towelettes themselves are pretty soft. Fragrance is light and pleasant. There is some slight and brief irritation if you happen to have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> Do you put off washing and moisturizing your face just before you go to bed?  I do.  If so, these are wonderful.  I keep these, along with a jar of my favorite moisturizer right by my bed so that when I am so sleepy I don&#x27;t want to traipse the 10 steps to the bathroom I can sit in bed, thoroughly cleanse my face with these gentle cleansing towelettes and apply my moisturizer.  All done in two minutes!</li>
            <li> These have a fresh and fragrant smell. They are gentle on my skin and do not leave my face feeling dry. From the weather, the last face wipe I was using (Simple), or both, my skin was super dry and peeling, which is uncommon for me. My skin is normaly oily. I was peeling all over my face! Once I started using these Burt&#x27;s Bees wipes, the problem was immediately solved. My skin feels soft and is more blemish free as well. This has definitely become a favorite for me.</li>
            <li> Pretty decent cloth size, and it does what it claims to do. One sheet removed all the makeup I used on my face (foundation, setting powder, mascara, bronzer &amp; blush). Only con I have toward this product is that it leaves my face feeling pretty dry, however, it&#x27;s not something that a little facial cream can&#x27;t fix :]</li>
            <li> I use these every night to take off my makeup. They are amazing. I don&#x27;t get burning eyes like some other wipes and they take off everything even waterproof mascara.  I keep these on subscribe and save so I never run out.</li>
            <li> Great towelettes. Not harsh or drying. I get a pack of them every 2 months using Subscribe and Save.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several kinds of facial wipes before these without any problems. However,  once I used these my face turned bright red and burnt. Will not be buying again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the world of facial wipes, so I have nothing to compare them to. That said, I have very dry, sensitive skin (a lot of facial products actually burn my face) and need to avoid as much soap and cleansers as possible but I need to wear makeup at work, so hopefully this review will help someone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is neither unpleasant nor too strong for me, but it does tend toward the clinical rather than pleasing or \\&quot;fresh.\\&quot; In any case, the smell is gone from my skin after a few minutes. It would be nice to have this product in a scentless version, or as scentless as these things can be, but it certainly isn&#x27;t a deal-breaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does sting my skin as it&#x27;s drying, but it isn&#x27;t nearly as bad as most other facial cleansers I&#x27;ve used and it doesn&#x27;t redden my skin at all. The texture is soft with a very light, almost-unnoticeable abrasiveness, and it&#x27;s thick enough to be used without tearing. While this might be too soft to work for people that need a stronger abrasive, it&#x27;s perfect for sensitive, dry skin. This is as gentle as I think I&#x27;ll find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t wear heavy makeup - I only use eye makeup, i.e., mascara, eyeliner, eye shadow - but I do work up a sweat while I&#x27;m working. The cloths are thick enough and saturated with enough of the cleanser to last through using both sides; this product does its job, with no problems removing the makeup I wear, without leaving streaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t seem to leave a residue once it dries, either, but leaves enough liquid on the skin to use a bit of moisturizer immediately afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a good product.</li>
            <li> I usually love all things Burt&#x27;s Bees, but I&#x27;m not a  fan of these facial wipes. I bought the white tea extract wipes in a two pack (my mistake for not trying them first) and after a day of use, my face was breaking out in tiny red splotches. I wanted to like this product, especially with this online 2-pack deal! My advice would be to try out just one pack from Wally world, possibly a smaller travel size if Burt&#x27;s Bees sells those, before you go hog wild. And honestly, if your skin is even a little bit sensitive (I&#x27;ve got very fair, sunburn-prone skin), I would just skip these--they pack a wallop!</li>
            <li> My favorite make up removing cloths. These work quite well and do not leave my skin feeling oily. Sometimes it takes a few passes to get all the eye liner or mascara off.</li>
            <li> I have yet to find a product from Burt&#x27;s Bees that i didn&#x27;t like. I even use Burt&#x27;s Bees baby products and they are fantastic.</li>
            <li> These facial towelettes worked great for we while on deployment.  They are also great when I&#x27;m pressed for time or ready to drop in bed but need to wash my face first.  They do not leave a filmy feeling on my skin, it just feels clean.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a makeup remover without parabens and unnatural ingredients.  I&#x27;ve used other Burt&#x27;s Bees products before and decided to give these a try.  The scent is great, the packaging is perfect (easy closure to keep them from drying out!) and the product takes off everything without much scrubbing.  My one complaint is that I wish there were more than 30 per package; a two month supply would be more sustainable.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell at all, and it dried out my face pretty bad to where i started getting ba acne too. It DID take off all my make up though, which is why I gave it two starts but I just can&#x27;t use it. Bummer.,</li>
            <li> The actual product was nice. Felt nice and refreshing on my skin and cleaned out irritants effectively.  However, the actual packaging is not airtight and the wet towels dried out after only a few months!  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I get racoon eye when I try to wash my make-up off with normal soap or even facewash.  This is gentle yet effective.  Great for camping as well when you don&#x27;t have access to running water.</li>
            <li> Gets makeup off and is not irritating.</li>
            <li> Excellent make up remover without break outs. Perfect for traveling - no leakage in suitcase. Gentle on skin and eyes.</li>
            <li> These are good make-up removal towelettes, and they definitely get the job done. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the smell, and they leave a slightly odd residue that I don&#x27;t feel with all makeup removal towelettes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;m sure Burt&#x27;s Bees has a better ingredients in it than some of the others I use, I wouldn&#x27;t but them again. For those that the natural ingredients matter to, these would likely be good for.</li>
            <li> I love these.  Normally I would smear Noxzema all over my face and wipe it off with a Kleenex. This saves me a step, cleans better than the Noxzema and leaves my face feeling fresh. I think it&#x27;s environmentally sound as the Kleenex and BB tissue are equally &amp;#34;wasteful.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> These were sensitive enough to not break out my skin. However they didn&#x27;t help with acne. They smell great though!</li>
            <li> Really removes all the makeup, grime &amp; dirt.</li>
            <li> These cleansing cloths leave my face feeling clean and refreshed, clearing away the daily grease and grime. These are not soapy and no rinsing required. Perfect for when I&#x27;m feeling lazy!</li>
            <li> I try to use natural products. Normally I use a cream cleanser at night but wanted something easy for nights when I was tired. I bought a pack of these and they&#x27;re horrible. It took two wipes to get my makeup off and I don&#x27;t know that my skin is fully cleansed. The time it took scrubbing with two wipes... I could have just washed my face normally. Also, these left some kind of residue on my skin that didn&#x27;t feel clean. I won&#x27;t be purchasing.</li>
            <li> I got these for my \\&quot;tween\\&quot; age daughter; she doesn&#x27;t wear make up or have acne.  I&#x27;ll probably buy something more heavy duty in a few more years when she needs it.  I think these smell great, they don&#x27;t have any unsafe chemicals to worry about, and they are part of her night-time cleaning routine.  They are also cheaper than some of the other natural wipes.&lt;br /&gt;Update: Burt&#x27;s Bees was sold to a big company and their formulations changed....more artificial fragrances and ingredients.  I won&#x27;t be buying any of their products anymore.  I suggest Yes to Carrots baby wipes for gentle cleansing wipes.</li>
            <li> Love love love love this. I have tried different brands in the past. No other product can remove my makeup as well as the Burt&#x27;s Bees Facial Cleansing Towel. I used to breakout a lot. Now my face is completely acne free. Not sure if it&#x27;s because of this.. but my skin improved a lot after I started using this. &#x3D;) Love it!</li>
            <li> Ouch!! they made my face burn and sting and I dont have sensitive skin at all..</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees lip products, and I am always trying new face wipes to remove my make-up. First off, I could not stand the smell. People say that it is great, but I think it is too strong. Second, it burns my face and eyes. I also have to go over my eye make-up several times before it starts to come off. I would stick with Neutrogena liquid make-up remover, it is the best make-up remover I&#x27;ve used. Make-up comes off easily and unlike this product, it does not burn your face nor have a strong scent.</li>
            <li> I use these towelettes to remove makeup.  I find them much easier on the eyes than the pricey liquid remover I have used for years.  They have a faint, not unpleasant, odor that dissipates instantly.  This is important to me, as I am most sensitive to smells.  The towelettes are very moist and just one does the job.  There is no feeling of anything left on my face after use and I have suffered no ill effects from their use.  I am much impressed with this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have bought several pack of these cleansing towelettes.  I use these for everything, even keep some in the car for hand washing.  My teen loves them too.  When going camping or river trips sure is refreshing to wash you face with something that gets your face clean and smells good, and is refreshing.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Lovely scent, incredibly convenient, and hasn&#x27;t made me break out. It&#x27;s probably one of my favorite parts of getting ready for bed, which sounds really strange. Try them! Your skin will feel very refreshed and clean. Just be sure to moisturize after.&lt;br /&gt;I use subscribe &amp; save through Amazon Mom which is really nice. Every other month, two packs show up on my doorstep. I use 1/day and there&#x27;s 30 wipes so it&#x27;s pretty much perfect.</li>
            <li> I love these. I used to buy another brand but got tired of seeing all the chemicals. These work just as well without all the unnatural ingredients. Perfect for taking off makeup at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Have used for several years, very good product, sooo convenient when traveling. Recommend to everyone. Hard to find item for &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34;, but, will keep looking.</li>
            <li> I used these for months just because of the beautiful, relaxing white tea fragrance right after a long day at work but if I fell asleep without washing my face properly, more often than not I&#x27;d see a zit a few days later even if it was just that one night of not cleansing. Goes without saying these will not remove all of your eye makeup, but that wasn&#x27;t really a concern of mine, getting concealer/powder foundation off and keeping my skin clear was. I&#x27;ve since found Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean with kaolin clay and surprise! No zits. Face feels scrubbed fresh. I think these (the Burt&#x27;s Bees) wipes used to come 3 to a pack too, now only 2. Pond&#x27;s are definitely better-priced comparatively speaking.</li>
