            <li>lol because it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li>This kit/product is amazing!  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really an amazing product and leaves the hair in beautiful condition.</li>
            <li>For example, I tried at home root retouch using olaplex and had just as good of a result as going to a salon.</li>
            <li>Way good bye to damage hair.  </li>
            <li>This is great, easy to use.</li>
            <li>So, now I can refresh my look without going to a salon, and I have guts to do it because of this amazing product, which ensures my hair will not break.</li>
            <li>the olaplex will dilute the product to a 30vol result amazing for bleach</li>
            <li>on YouTube he uses it a lot and just read and follow instructions AGAIN AMAZING PRODUCTS</li>
            <li>Very easy to use its an oil based product so if your looking for 30 vol results then use a 40 vol</li>
            <li>Lol it&#x27;s funny that &amp;#34;professionals&amp;#34; are trying to spam</li>
            <li>She more than tripled your cost...great friend ...</li>
            <li>Love olaplex and will be ordering this in a couple of days.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, if you buy from another site, make sure they are a hair dresser and offer email exchanges for guidance in using this product.&lt;br /&gt;I would also purchase from the salon owner sellers with the most information, ingredients, and directions for the product listed in the description</li>
            <li>Hair has never looked or felt better.</li>
            <li>I Test it by more then 4person.</li>
            <li>and I can say with full confidence that these products work!</li>
            <li>It is a cheap conditioner.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use;  the directions are simple and very clear.&lt;br /&gt;She understood that some people can&#x27;t afford to go the salon to get the pricey Olaplex process done &amp; that many people color their own hair at home.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Specially if you use any chemicals in your head.  </li>
            <li>My stylish charges $20 for the whole treatment at her salon</li>
            <li>it protects your hair so you get less damage works great for an all over bleach application or a balayage</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is worth the money.&lt;br</li>
            <li>use Olaplex No. 1 &amp; 2 as stand alone treatments right now to correct damage.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fantastic product highly recommend</li>
            <li>It Is very very goed product.</li>
            <li>Sometimes you need to leave it to the professionals ;)</li>
            <li>Stylists worldwide are up in arms about the thorough instructions offered on Youtube, etc, and you can&#x27;t really blame them.  </li>
            <li>When you get the Olaplex treatment the No. 3 take home is included in the price and is MUCH cheaper then what you will have to pay on Amazon/Ebay.</li>
            <li>This is not the real Oloplex</li>
            <li>Price is WAY to high!</li>
            <li>I love it, but #1 &amp; #2 are to be used during chemical treatments by a professional only.  </li>
            <li>As a professional I find it hard to believe that this is the authentic product, mostly because there is no markup on it and in order for it to be here, someone would have to buy it from a professional since olaplex will not sell to non pros.this</li>
            <li>Also the chances of this product being diverted is high.</li>
            <li>Lol at all these hair stylist getting angry over this</li>
            <li>I will purchase this product again without a doubt, especially considering how hard it is to maintain blonde color and having healthy looking hair is the added benefit that allows me to do more frequent applications.</li>
            <li>the way, Olaplex No. 2 &amp; No. 3 are the exact same product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These prices are jacked up and the products are more than likely watered down .</li>
            <li>If this is water down and you apply it your hair as per directions you will most likely melt your hair</li>
            <li>Your most likely buying an over priced watered down version with who knows what added in to cut it.</li>
            <li>stylist bought it for me from a professional store.  </li>
            <li>so you know it&#x27;s legit and see a professional who knows what they are doing.</li>
            <li>is what a professional can buy it for.wouldn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>This is a product for licensed professionas to add to professional hair color.</li>
            <li>it is worth every dollar spent on it.</li>
            <li>Hairdressers get annoyed when their kind sell out and sell a product that is supose to be used with an education.</li>
            <li>Now, with this product, I am able to retouch my roots every 2-3 weeks, so no more roots!</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s the same price to buy this kit if you&#x27;re using it as a strengthener and cheaper to buy this than going to a salon if you&#x27;re getting it as an included color service so these &amp;#34;professionals&amp;#34; leaving reviews on here are full of crap lol.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: I STOPPED USING THE PRODUCT WEEKLY AND MY HIGHLIGHTS BEGAN BREAKING OFF, SO I KNOW I HAVE TO USE THE OLAPLEX WEEKLY TO SAVE MY HAIR FROM MAJOR BREAKAGE.&lt;br /&gt;THANK</li>
            <li>In fact, if you treat your hair a lot, after using olaplex, you will see positive change other way around.</li>
            <li>This is for professional use only!</li>
            <li>For PROFESSIONAL USE ONLY!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a product for PROFESSIONAL USE ONLY!</li>
            <li>For professional use only!!!!! The makers of olaplex do not sell any products on Amazon or eBay.</li>

            <li> I have naturally dark brown hair and have heavy light blonde highlights, which is very hard to maintain and quite damaging to your hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I have long hair, so I do not comb the product through b/c when I did a lot of hair would come out on the comb due to the pulling.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more hair left in my brush...</li>
            <li> While other products seal pot and holes like spackle, this product rebuilds the hair by multiplying sulfide bonds.</li>
            <li> Someone keeps spamming these reviews, it&#x27;s funny and kinda sad that they are wasting their time.</li>
            <li> Also, I saw several negative reviews</li>
            <li> This product will make them less needed.</li>
            <li> Educate yourself before you waste your money on this !!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> You think you&#x27;re getting a deal from your buddy when she&#x27;s buying you the stylist kit lol ... She more than tripled your cost...great friend ... And it&#x27;s the same thing that&#x27;s going on here. These prices are jacked up and the products are more than likely watered down . If you want your hair to melt off well then have at it.&lt;br /&gt;  Sometimes you need to leave it to the professionals ;)</li>
            <li> This is for professional use only! Not only is it way more expensive through this seller, you run the risk of ruining your hair even attempting this at home. Don&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li> Incredible product. Grateful for ease of availability.</li>
            <li> No more hair left in my brush... I am buying numver 3</li>
            <li> This kit/product is amazing!  I&#x27;ve had the service at a Salon and ALSO used 1,2, and 3 at home.  If you can read, you CAN do this yourself.  Stylists worldwide are up in arms about the thorough instructions offered on Youtube, etc, and you can&#x27;t really blame them.  Guy Tang and Ellebangs are two of youtube&#x27;s finest for some advice or inspiration.  Try this - it is NOT rocket science -</li>
            <li> Lol it&#x27;s funny that &amp;#34;professionals&amp;#34; are trying to spam this saying that it&#x27;s more expensive to get it done this way, lol because it&#x27;s not. My stylish charges $20 for the whole treatment at her salon so it&#x27;s the same price to buy this kit if you&#x27;re using it as a strengthener and cheaper to buy this than going to a salon if you&#x27;re getting it as an included color service so these &amp;#34;professionals&amp;#34; leaving reviews on here are full of crap lol. Love olaplex and will be ordering this in a couple of days.</li>
            <li> This is the only product on the market that reseals split ends!&lt;br /&gt;My hair was damaged from highlighting &amp; using this product weekly has saved my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It can be used as a stand- alone treatment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I STOPPED USING THE PRODUCT WEEKLY AND MY HIGHLIGHTS BEGAN BREAKING OFF, SO I KNOW I HAVE TO USE THE OLAPLEX WEEKLY TO SAVE MY HAIR FROM MAJOR BREAKAGE.&lt;br /&gt;THANK GOODNESS THERE IS A PRODUCT OUT THERE LIKE THIS THAT HELPS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;A stylist bought it for me from a professional store.  It is very easy to use;  the directions are simple and very clear.&lt;br /&gt;She understood that some people can&#x27;t afford to go the salon to get the pricey Olaplex process done &amp; that many people color their own hair at home.&lt;br /&gt;So, if you buy from another site, make sure they are a hair dresser and offer email exchanges for guidance in using this product.&lt;br /&gt;I would also purchase from the salon owner sellers with the most information, ingredients, and directions for the product listed in the description area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Olaplex No. 1 &amp; 2 as stand alone treatments right now to correct damage.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, Olaplex No. 2 &amp; No. 3 are the exact same product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI- My friend would pick up the salon intro kit for me at $250.&lt;br /&gt;Also, she told me that OLAPLEX does not alter the known universe &amp; it shouldn&#x27;t be used with box dyes.&lt;br /&gt; Olaplex does not give directions for box dye products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS:&lt;br /&gt;-I have long hair, so I do not comb the product through b/c when I did a lot of hair would come out on the comb due to the pulling.&lt;br /&gt;  Now, I only use my hands to pull No.1 &amp; No. 2 through.&lt;br /&gt;- For stand-alone treatment I leave No. 1 in for 10 min and No. 2 in for up to an hour.&lt;br /&gt;- Use filtered water when doing the Stand-Alone treatment.</li>
            <li> Actually not an oil based product at all. Hairdressers get annoyed when their kind sell out and sell a product that is supose to be used with an education. If you don&#x27;t know what its made for or how to use don&#x27;t write a review.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product highly recommend</li>
            <li> For PROFESSIONAL USE ONLY!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Lol at all these hair stylist getting angry over this</li>
            <li> Just so everyone knows..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a product for PROFESSIONAL USE ONLY! Call salons in your area and see what salons provide this service. When you get the Olaplex treatment the No. 3 take home is included in the price and is MUCH cheaper then what you will have to pay on Amazon/Ebay. No one should be selling this. Also, because you are not buying it from a salon, you have no idea what you are getting...this could be diluted/watered down or really old. Go to a salon so you know it&#x27;s legit and see a professional who knows what they are doing.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  Hair has never looked or felt better. Use it in your color to protect the integrity of the hair. We have colored damaged hair that we would not have colored before and it has come out beautiful!  Bought step one in the back bar size. Wish they sold step two in a larger size and also wish they sold step two separately.</li>
            <li> I payed for 525ml each one an I received with 100ml. Don&#x27;t buy this item!</li>
            <li> This is not the real Oloplex It is a cheap conditioner.</li>
            <li> As a professional I find it hard to believe that this is the authentic product, mostly because there is no markup on it and in order for it to be here, someone would have to buy it from a professional since olaplex will not sell to non pros.this is what a professional can buy it for.wouldn&#x27;t someone want to make a profit. Just saying.if you want to spend your money on it go for it.I just thought someone should try to warn you.</li>
            <li> This product should not be privately purchased.  They are also price gauging</li>
            <li> I Test it by more then 4person. It Is very very goed product.</li>
            <li> If this is water down and you apply it your hair as per directions you will most likely melt your hair this is for professionals only</li>
            <li> This is the best hair product purchase I&#x27;ve made and it is worth every dollar spent on it. I will purchase this product again without a doubt, especially considering how hard it is to maintain blonde color and having healthy looking hair is the added benefit that allows me to do more frequent applications. I have naturally dark brown hair and have heavy light blonde highlights, which is very hard to maintain and quite damaging to your hair. Now, with this product, I am able to retouch my roots every 2-3 weeks, so no more roots! Also, I saw several negative reviews and I am assuming they all come from the hair professionals and it makes sense for several reasons. This product will make them less needed. For example, I tried at home root retouch using olaplex and had just as good of a result as going to a salon. For highlights obviously I will still go to the salon (and I have brought my olaplex to be mixed in with the bleach), but I can do several strip retouches and boliage at home, without spending a lot of money and safely, following all the instructions on the product. So, now I can refresh my look without going to a salon, and I have guts to do it because of this amazing product, which ensures my hair will not break. In fact, if you treat your hair a lot, after using olaplex, you will see positive change other way around. I would give this product nothing but 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I love it, but #1 &amp; #2 are to be used during chemical treatments by a professional only.  #3 is a take-home for continued use by the guest.  If used incorrectly, this could damage hair.</li>
            <li> Way good bye to damage hair.  Specially if you use any chemicals in your head.  While other products seal pot and holes like spackle, this product rebuilds the hair by multiplying sulfide bonds. Multiplies, rebuilds and bonds to eliminate breakage</li>
            <li> Do not purchase. This is a product for licensed professionas to add to professional hair color. If used with at home color it will not work properly. Also the chances of this product being diverted is high.</li>
            <li> Price is WAY to high! This is a product that should be done in salon ONLY!</li>
            <li> For professional use only!!!!! The makers of olaplex do not sell any products on Amazon or eBay. Your most likely buying an over priced watered down version with who knows what added in to cut it. Educate yourself before you waste your money on this !!!!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use its an oil based product so if your looking for 30 vol results then use a 40 vol the olaplex will dilute the product to a 30vol result amazing for bleach it protects your hair so you get less damage works great for an all over bleach application or a balayage ,highlights mix your bleach then add no.1  after application wash with no2 then use no3 I&#x27;ve never had a problem with irritation to my scalp follow the instructions and you be find do your Research  follow GuyTang on YouTube he uses it a lot and just read and follow instructions AGAIN AMAZING PRODUCTS</li>
            <li> Someone keeps spamming these reviews, it&#x27;s funny and kinda sad that they are wasting their time. Anyway I&#x27;ve purchased this product and as long as you use it correctly it&#x27;s really an amazing product and leaves the hair in beautiful condition. Look up videos on YouTube on how to use it, I know guy tang has featured this product in a lot of his videos and the end result is beautiful! I have years of experience in dying hair and I can say with full confidence that these products work!</li>
            <li> This is great, easy to use.</li>
