            <li>I love this leave in conditioner.!!</li>
            <li>This is a good value and very nice leave in conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Best for wavy/curly hair, and doesn&#x27;t weigh-down fine hair.</li>
            <li>It is a good conditioner, just not the correct one as titled and described on Amazon.</li>

            <li>Very good product, easy to use with good results.</li>

            <li>Love this product.</li>

            <li>I use this product on my hair every day, and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>I thought I had found a good source for the conditioner, but when I opened it it did not have the same pleasant fragrance as I was used to.  </li>
            <li>A thing I noticed is the extremely strong smell.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t so strong and the smell fades after you put it on, but still, it bothers me.</li>
            <li>A light, leave-in conditioner that allowed for easy de-tangling and did not leave any feeling of residue.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;d been checking Amazon for some time, hoping to see the product offered, and was thrilled when it finally became available!</li>
            <li>Its the best conditioner and genuine by Brocato for thick curly and color treated hair.</li>
            <li>not heavy, smells great, makes hair feel soft.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only leave in that works for my fine, curly hair.</li>
            <li>Another thing is it is more watery than I expected.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery service</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a light leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>It smells like foot powder or the scent of very old candles.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is just very old material or a knock-off</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really one of the only products out there that hold</li>
            <li>i use it with gel and it accents my naturally wavy hair.</li>

            <li> I have to rate this one star because the product I received is not the leave-in conditioner.  After receiving the product my wife noticed that no where on the container does it state this is a leave-in conditioner and the directions state leave in 4 to 5 minutes and rinse.  We have a smaller container of Brocato Saturation Leave-In Conditioner my wife previously purchased elsewhere and it is definitely a different product.  We decided to keep this product and not go through the hassle of returning it.  It is a good conditioner, just not the correct one as titled and described on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have been using it for years.  It&#x27;s really one of the only products out there that hold&lt;br /&gt;your curl and at the same time tame the frizz.  Amazon prices are the best around that I have found so far.</li>
            <li> I love this leave in conditioner.!!.. My hair feels so silky!!</li>
            <li> Brocato Saturation is a very good product for my hair.  It keeps it in very good condition!</li>
            <li> It was so celebrated and favored here on the reviews so I decided to try it. A thing I noticed is the extremely strong smell. It hurts my noise and gives me a headache. It smells like foot powder or the scent of very old candles. It isn&#x27;t so strong and the smell fades after you put it on, but still, it bothers me. Another thing is it is more watery than I expected. It came on a bit greasy but dried soft. I would only put a little bit after washing my hair. Overall it&#x27;s ok. It&#x27;s very good for the price, but I can do without the smell. I find it unbearable.</li>
            <li> Its the best conditioner and genuine by Brocato for thick curly and color treated hair. It Works To Tame It!  Fast delivery service and it was packed well so it would not leak!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy as a customer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Deb C</li>
            <li> Product is good to control frizzy hair</li>
            <li> Love this product. It&#x27;s such a light leave in conditioner. It&#x27;s the only leave in that works for my fine, curly hair.</li>
            <li> Absolutely great product &amp; a great deal! Best for wavy/curly hair, and doesn&#x27;t weigh-down fine hair. Great for humid climates.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this product when living in Colorado. A light, leave-in conditioner that allowed for easy de-tangling and did not leave any feeling of residue. I have very long, thick, wavy hair and a small squirt the size of a nickel, rubbed into the hair (not scalp) is all that&#x27;s needed. Moving East, I missed this conditioner. It was not sold anywhere locally, and nothing else performed as well. I&#x27;d been checking Amazon for some time, hoping to see the product offered, and was thrilled when it finally became available!</li>
            <li> I have used this conditioner before and was having trouble finding it in a retail outlet so I reverted to the internet.  I thought I had found a good source for the conditioner, but when I opened it it did not have the same pleasant fragrance as I was used to.  This had a chemical / medicinal odor to it.  Very unpleasant.  I don&#x27;t know if this is just very old material or a knock-off but it is not the same.</li>
            <li> Very good product, easy to use with good results. Use only a small amount and lasts a long time. hard to find Brocato products in my local salons.</li>
            <li> This is a good value and very nice leave in conditioner.  Use it every shampoo!</li>
            <li> not heavy, smells great, makes hair feel soft. i use it with gel and it accents my naturally wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I use this product on my hair every day, and I absolutely love it.  This is a huge bottle for the price.  A very good buy!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, but for some reason this bottle is not doing the same job. It does not seem to have the same detangling properties as in the past. I do not know if the product has changed, or if I received a fake.</li>
            <li> Best conditioner ever for curly hair...</li>
            <li> Not the same product that I have used in the past. same name different stuff</li>
            <li> Great product with a great price. Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Brocato Saturation leave-in conditioner for over 20 years...love it !!</li>
            <li> Excellent conditioner for curly hair. Good price. Would buy from this seller again.</li>
