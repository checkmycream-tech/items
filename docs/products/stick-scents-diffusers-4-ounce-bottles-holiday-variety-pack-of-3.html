            <li>Wonderful for gifts (and for yourself!).  </li>
            <li>Great scent, great gift and a great cause...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased them all separately, but this bundle is a great deal.  </li>
            <li>These are a great addition to my collection.  </li>
            <li>All 3 of the 4 oz scents smell great.  </li>
            <li>I especially enjoy the Peppermint.  </li>
            <li>I believe we made a mistake, however, by placing this in our kitchen which is \\&quot;open\\&quot; and part of our great room.  </li>
            <li>great option to candles....</li>
            <li>The diffusers were a great buy.</li>
            <li>It smells great.</li>
            <li>All in all, for the price I think they are a great value.</li>
            <li>I purchased them for gifts, but kept   one for myself, which works great.  </li>
            <li>they smell great.  </li>
            <li>The Holiday Spice is great in the kitchen.  </li>
            <li>The scents are great.</li>
            <li>This assortment smells great</li>
            <li>but it also a great gift.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s 3 great gifts.  </li>
            <li>All of them were very nice, but I preferred the Candy Cane and Holiday Spice over the Winter Forest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>very nice....</li>
            <li>These may have been nice since the box smelled incredible on my front porch.</li>
            <li>pleasant scents....</li>
            <li>All of the scents in this package smell so good.  </li>
            <li>I read what another astmatic said and thought I&#x27;d give it a try since the God box deal was so good.</li>
            <li>they were a good deal for the cost.  </li>
            <li>4-Count Variety Pack Reed Diffusers (Sea Petal, Morning Dew, Lavender Fields, Vanilla Bean), 4-Ounce Packages]] might be a good alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>4-Count Variety Pack Reed Diffusers (Sea Petal, Morning Dew, Lavender Fields, Vanilla Bean), 4-Ounce Packages]] might be a good alternative.      </li>
            <li>These are not any good.</li>
            <li>So I gave stick scents away at my wedding and everyone loved them.  </li>
            <li>I notified Amazon and they sent me another shipment; well out of that two of the containers leaked leaving one good one.  </li>
            <li>and I have been very pleased.</li>
            <li>I wish now that I had ordered more than one set as they do make great gifts as others have pointed out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She said to search for the feedback option and it will go directly to the company that is giving people a great opportunity to package what could be an awesome product.</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>You will love them!</li>
            <li>(love the 4-for-3 promo!)</li>
            <li>I love my reed diffusers, but &#x27;tis the season to give!</li>
            <li>The sticks aren&#x27;t nicely sanded at all, and are just waiting to give whoever handles them splinters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The fragrance is nice.  </li>
            <li>Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am especially happy that these are made in America and assembled by  Goodwill Industries.  </li>
            <li>the diffusers are really nice.  </li>
            <li>was nice.  </li>
            <li>Winter Forest scent is light and pleasant, and that winter friends thought that it smelled like a Christmas tree.</li>
            <li>I like it, and I suspect when it diffuses fully it will be better than nice.....  </li>
            <li>Whether you give it as a complete set or as three separate items, it&#x27;s the perfect substitute for scented</li>
            <li>My son said it best, though, when he said that it reminded him of the walks we frequently take through a pine forest, and I agree.</li>
            <li>In this full concentration of spillage it didn&#x27;t smell all that good.....</li>
            <li>They came packaged very securely</li>
            <li>I purchased these last year and they are wonderful.  </li>
            <li>and I gifted the others to my mom and MIL for hosting Thanksgiving Dinner.  </li>
            <li>and some of their favorite treats.</li>
            <li>and I have to admit I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>but I know the product could have been packaged in a better way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The three tubes looked cute.  </li>
            <li>top-</li>
            <li>but you won&#x27;t be able to do it with your fingers or fingernails.  </li>
            <li>I put the pepermint in the kitchen as I love Pepermint</li>
            <li>/&gt;After having these open for 2 days now I must say they are just the BEST.</li>
            <li>I have been enjoying the scents this week.  </li>
            <li>definitely okay with spending the $20, but</li>
            <li>what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>I like the variety and love the evergreen scent.  </li>
            <li>Most diffusers are also sealed with wax.</li>
            <li>After reviewing some of the comments, I thought she would love the \\&quot;winter forest\\&quot; scent for Christmas.</li>
            <li>I put the good ones out and they are not scented very much.</li>
            <li>It will difuse through-out  without becoming overpowering.</li>
            <li>This company really should put some mechanisms in place to ensure there product leaves the factory and can arrive at the consumer in good condition.</li>
            <li>They also are easy to use, all you do is put the sticks into the bottle with the oil and as the sticks soak up the oil they let off the scent into the room.  </li>
            <li>I would like us to send the company feedback because tightening the glass containers is an easy fix.</li>
            <li>I have asthma and have had yet to find a reed diffuser that was not so strong as to bring on an attack.</li>
            <li>Holiday Spice scent that my client had was moderately strong, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I was able to give them out a couple days ago and they really appreciated them - they did do some swapping of the scents, but that was fine because I wasn&#x27;t sure who would like which.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of Reed diffusers.  </li>
            <li>I have been a huge fan of the Stick Scents since I discovered them.</li>
            <li>Bottom line, though, is that we enjoy the scent when we CAN smell it.  </li>
            <li>and all I am happy with this American made product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an attractive package for gift giving, too, although you might need Charles Atlas to open the tube and extract the contents.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The scents are mild and pleasant and just the right size not to take up too much space</li>
            <li>it is just this nice faint pleasant scent that makes you feel good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great cause, but the fragrance never lasted more than a week and a half on any of the scents.  </li>
            <li>I also ordered these as a Gold Box special because of all of the reviews that said this brand had a noticeable, but not overpowering, scent.  </li>
            <li>I ordered three of these from the Gold Box special.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this set of Stick Scents when they were a gold box special a couple of weeks ago.</li>
            <li>: I found out that these are put together by Goodwill employees with special needs.</li>
            <li>Nice scents - not heavy and overbearing.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to all of you who let them know and don&#x27;t give up on these:)</li>
            <li>That left two good ones.  </li>
            <li>Yep, they do smell good but the company definitely needs to tighten the lids on the bottles so the oil doesn&#x27;t leak out!</li>
            <li>I flipped my reeds over after the first day to allow the oils to penetrate both ends, and then the scent began to gently permeate the air, lightly bit not too overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I flipped my reeds over after the first day to allow the oils to penetrate both ends, and then the scent began to gently permeate the air, lightly bit not too overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the winter forest scent - it smells just like we have a live Christmas tree in our living room!</li>
            <li>and luckily I didn&#x27;t have problems with leakage as some others have reported in their reviews.</li>
            <li>I have had no breathing problem with them and I am SUPER sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>maybe I am just lucky.  </li>
            <li>So I ended up with one full holiday set, which is what I wanted in the first place!    </li>
            <li>I have used stick diffusers for awhile now and am very pleased with the overall product.</li>
            <li>Yeah didn&#x27;t fit very well at all.  </li>
            <li>I got these on a gold box deal and they were worth it.  </li>
            <li>The Candy Cane scent is so fresh,</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a nice product, but they need to tighten the lids on the bottles before putting them in the canisters.</li>
            <li>I have tried 6 different scents so far and they are all great.</li>
            <li>These came right on time.</li>
            <li>I think these would be more effective in a small bathroom or an enclosed room.  </li>
            <li>The scents are good but not real strong.</li>
            <li>One jostle from a child or pet and the whole thing will spill quickly.       </li>
            <li>First, I love the concept behind this company and the good work they&#x27;re doing in the community.  </li>
            <li>I love the Holiday Spice, but enjoy some of the other seasonal varieties, too.</li>
            <li>The instructions say the wooden tops are \\&quot;specially designed to fit snuggly on the bottle\\&quot;...not at all.  </li>
            <li>followed the directions on the back, unscrewing the fragrance lid, and then putting on the wooden lid, which according to the tube had been specially made to snugly fit the top of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I also like the scent that we first opened.  </li>
            <li>Save your money and go with a higher quality product.</li>
            <li>In the first shipment one of the containers had leaked through the bottom of the box.  </li>
            <li>Even if the lid fit tightly, there is still that hole in the top the reeds extend through.  </li>
            <li>She has used other reed stick diffuser products before and really liked them.</li>
            <li>The caps are too large to fit securely on the bottle, and reeds a bit loose in the holder.  </li>
            <li>Of the three scents I received, only one of them had a wooden top that fit the 4oz bottle.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good cause, and the company is a certified woman-owned small business, if that matters to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good cause, and the company is a certified woman-owned small business, if that matters to you.    </li>
            <li>The top doesn&#x27;t fit tightly on the bottle like the instructions said it would, but that doesn&#x27;t particularly bother me - if it tips over it&#x27;s going to leak oil whether that part is snug or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have it in a fairly large room</li>
            <li>Inside is a bottle of oil and it appears that the screw top caps come loose in transit and leak oil inside the tube.  </li>
            <li>Mine are just loosely teetering on top of the bottles.  </li>
            <li>In this large area, you really need to be standing at the sink to get any aroma at all.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice little gift for the host/hostess.  </li>
            <li>I use an artificial tree and this scent really helps bring that wonderful holiday smell into the house.  </li>
            <li>Very fragrant, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>but it is not over powering and doesn&#x27;t fill the whole room up.  </li>
            <li>They were appreciated and used immediately.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It was very wobbly.  </li>
            <li>The one I was really looking forward to having, too:</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really notice it as much.  </li>
            <li>These scent sticks are very fragrant.  </li>
            <li>My client also had the Candy Cane scent in another room, and it had a gentle peppermint</li>
            <li>I have used 2 of these so far, and neither one has enough scent to be smelled if you are more than a couple of feet from the bottle.  </li>
            <li>The directions say they have a second screw-top lid with a hole through which to insert the bamboo sticks and onto which the larger top fits, but none was in any of the boxes.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend them even to those with allergies like me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a highly recommended 5-star purchase, without a doubt.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a highly recommended 5-star purchase, without a doubt.    </li>
            <li>As long as the good one lasts, I hope it can be resused with the other scents since I will only use one at a time.  </li>
            <li>You can send feedback directly to the company by going on the Amazon home page and clicking the help are in the upper right, per a CS Rep here.</li>
            <li>I was worried that the evergreen scent might be too intense and just smell like an artificial pine forest, but it is very nice and not overpowering at all.  </li>
            <li>scent was OK, lasted for a while, one of the scent bottles was open on arival and half of the liquid spilled.</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s natural, but if you can&#x27;t smell the scent then what&#x27;s the point?</li>
            <li>They look classy, don&#x27;t use electricity like plugins or smoke like incense, they are \\&quot;Earth friendly\\&quot; and 100% recyclable.  </li>
            <li>So far I am in agreement.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Should note that this is a 100% American-made product, produced in Texas, not overseas, and has all natural fragrance oils, and no chemicals or synthetics.</li>

            <li>and I am a busy Prime shopper.</li>
            <li>had 3 small gift bags that I filled with one of the [[ASIN:B001COGAJI Stick Scents Diffusers, Holiday Variety Pack, 4-Ounce Bottles]] canisters, a pair of inexpensive gloves, a copy of this book [[ASIN:0762408456 Girlfriends: A Celebration]]</li>
            <li>Left it outs on that shelf for almost six months, until open window fresh air season started, that there was still just under 1/4th of the oil left in the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Left it outs on that shelf for almost six months, until open window fresh air season started, that there was still just under 1/4th of the oil left in the bottle.     </li>
            <li>They fill up a room (even a large one) and will definitely get you ready for the holidays (and beyond--they last for a long time!)  </li>
            <li>The Winter Forest is a great scent, especially around artificial trees.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, but leaves a scent of gingerbread, as if you made cookies a few hours earlier.  </li>
            <li>It is harder to get the tube open than it should be, although with a little patience I was able to pry off the metal end.  </li>
            <li>And the packaging does clearly warn you to only pick them up by the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>only one I&#x27;ve opened so far is the pine scented one</li>
            <li>The winter forest bottle was not closed and it had leaked all over the canister and soaked one side of the box.</li>
            <li>Again, one bottle was not tightly closed and leaked during the shipment, except this time it was the candy cane one.</li>
            <li>However, it barely smelled.  </li>
            <li>You literally had to stand right next to the bottle to get a slight hint of fragrance.</li>
            <li>and my dogs ran into the other room from the intense smell.</li>

            <li> She said to search for the feedback option and it will go directly to the company that is giving people a great opportunity to package what could be an awesome product.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> You will love them!</li>
            <li> (love the 4-for-3 promo!)</li>
            <li> I love my reed diffusers, but &#x27;tis the season to give!</li>
            <li> The sticks aren&#x27;t nicely sanded at all, and are just waiting to give whoever handles them splinters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The fragrance is nice.  </li>
            <li> Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am especially happy that these are made in America and assembled by  Goodwill Industries.  </li>
            <li> the diffusers are really nice.  </li>
            <li> was nice.  </li>
            <li> Winter Forest scent is light and pleasant, and that winter friends thought that it smelled like a Christmas tree.</li>
            <li> I like it, and I suspect when it diffuses fully it will be better than nice.....  </li>
            <li> Whether you give it as a complete set or as three separate items, it&#x27;s the perfect substitute for scented</li>
            <li> My son said it best, though, when he said that it reminded him of the walks we frequently take through a pine forest, and I agree.</li>
            <li> In this full concentration of spillage it didn&#x27;t smell all that good.....</li>
            <li> They came packaged very securely</li>
            <li> I purchased these last year and they are wonderful.  </li>
            <li> and I gifted the others to my mom and MIL for hosting Thanksgiving Dinner.  </li>
            <li> and some of their favorite treats.</li>
            <li> and I have to admit I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> but I know the product could have been packaged in a better way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The three tubes looked cute.  </li>
            <li> top-</li>
            <li> but you won&#x27;t be able to do it with your fingers or fingernails.  </li>
            <li> I put the pepermint in the kitchen as I love Pepermint</li>
            <li> /&gt;After having these open for 2 days now I must say they are just the BEST.</li>
            <li> I have been enjoying the scents this week.  </li>
            <li> definitely okay with spending the $20, but</li>
            <li> what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> I like the variety and love the evergreen scent.  </li>
            <li> Most diffusers are also sealed with wax.</li>
            <li> After reviewing some of the comments, I thought she would love the \\&quot;winter forest\\&quot; scent for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I put the good ones out and they are not scented very much.</li>
            <li> It will difuse through-out  without becoming overpowering.</li>
            <li> This company really should put some mechanisms in place to ensure there product leaves the factory and can arrive at the consumer in good condition.</li>
            <li> They also are easy to use, all you do is put the sticks into the bottle with the oil and as the sticks soak up the oil they let off the scent into the room.  </li>
            <li> I would like us to send the company feedback because tightening the glass containers is an easy fix.</li>
            <li> I have asthma and have had yet to find a reed diffuser that was not so strong as to bring on an attack.</li>
            <li> Holiday Spice scent that my client had was moderately strong, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I was able to give them out a couple days ago and they really appreciated them - they did do some swapping of the scents, but that was fine because I wasn&#x27;t sure who would like which.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Reed diffusers.  </li>
            <li> I have been a huge fan of the Stick Scents since I discovered them.</li>
            <li> Bottom line, though, is that we enjoy the scent when we CAN smell it.  </li>
            <li> and all I am happy with this American made product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an attractive package for gift giving, too, although you might need Charles Atlas to open the tube and extract the contents.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The scents are mild and pleasant and just the right size not to take up too much space</li>
            <li> it is just this nice faint pleasant scent that makes you feel good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great cause, but the fragrance never lasted more than a week and a half on any of the scents.  </li>
            <li> I also ordered these as a Gold Box special because of all of the reviews that said this brand had a noticeable, but not overpowering, scent.  </li>
            <li> I ordered three of these from the Gold Box special.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this set of Stick Scents when they were a gold box special a couple of weeks ago.</li>
            <li> : I found out that these are put together by Goodwill employees with special needs.</li>
            <li> Nice scents - not heavy and overbearing.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to all of you who let them know and don&#x27;t give up on these:)</li>
            <li> That left two good ones.  </li>
            <li> Yep, they do smell good but the company definitely needs to tighten the lids on the bottles so the oil doesn&#x27;t leak out!</li>
            <li> I flipped my reeds over after the first day to allow the oils to penetrate both ends, and then the scent began to gently permeate the air, lightly bit not too overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I flipped my reeds over after the first day to allow the oils to penetrate both ends, and then the scent began to gently permeate the air, lightly bit not too overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the winter forest scent - it smells just like we have a live Christmas tree in our living room!</li>
            <li> and luckily I didn&#x27;t have problems with leakage as some others have reported in their reviews.</li>
            <li> I have had no breathing problem with them and I am SUPER sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> maybe I am just lucky.  </li>
            <li> So I ended up with one full holiday set, which is what I wanted in the first place!    </li>
            <li> I have used stick diffusers for awhile now and am very pleased with the overall product.</li>
            <li> Yeah didn&#x27;t fit very well at all.  </li>
            <li> I got these on a gold box deal and they were worth it.  </li>
            <li> The Candy Cane scent is so fresh,</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a nice product, but they need to tighten the lids on the bottles before putting them in the canisters.</li>
            <li> I have tried 6 different scents so far and they are all great.</li>
            <li> These came right on time.</li>
            <li> I think these would be more effective in a small bathroom or an enclosed room.  </li>
            <li> The scents are good but not real strong.</li>
            <li> One jostle from a child or pet and the whole thing will spill quickly.       </li>
            <li> First, I love the concept behind this company and the good work they&#x27;re doing in the community.  </li>
            <li> I love the Holiday Spice, but enjoy some of the other seasonal varieties, too.</li>
            <li> The instructions say the wooden tops are \\&quot;specially designed to fit snuggly on the bottle\\&quot;...not at all.  </li>
            <li> followed the directions on the back, unscrewing the fragrance lid, and then putting on the wooden lid, which according to the tube had been specially made to snugly fit the top of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I also like the scent that we first opened.  </li>
            <li> Save your money and go with a higher quality product.</li>
            <li> In the first shipment one of the containers had leaked through the bottom of the box.  </li>
            <li> Even if the lid fit tightly, there is still that hole in the top the reeds extend through.  </li>
            <li> She has used other reed stick diffuser products before and really liked them.</li>
            <li> The caps are too large to fit securely on the bottle, and reeds a bit loose in the holder.  </li>
            <li> Of the three scents I received, only one of them had a wooden top that fit the 4oz bottle.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good cause, and the company is a certified woman-owned small business, if that matters to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good cause, and the company is a certified woman-owned small business, if that matters to you.    </li>
            <li> The top doesn&#x27;t fit tightly on the bottle like the instructions said it would, but that doesn&#x27;t particularly bother me - if it tips over it&#x27;s going to leak oil whether that part is snug or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have it in a fairly large room</li>
            <li> Inside is a bottle of oil and it appears that the screw top caps come loose in transit and leak oil inside the tube.  </li>
            <li> Mine are just loosely teetering on top of the bottles.  </li>
            <li> In this large area, you really need to be standing at the sink to get any aroma at all.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice little gift for the host/hostess.  </li>
            <li> I use an artificial tree and this scent really helps bring that wonderful holiday smell into the house.  </li>
            <li> Very fragrant, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> but it is not over powering and doesn&#x27;t fill the whole room up.  </li>
            <li> They were appreciated and used immediately.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It was very wobbly.  </li>
            <li> The one I was really looking forward to having, too:</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really notice it as much.  </li>
            <li> These scent sticks are very fragrant.  </li>
            <li> My client also had the Candy Cane scent in another room, and it had a gentle peppermint</li>
            <li> I have used 2 of these so far, and neither one has enough scent to be smelled if you are more than a couple of feet from the bottle.  </li>
            <li> The directions say they have a second screw-top lid with a hole through which to insert the bamboo sticks and onto which the larger top fits, but none was in any of the boxes.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend them even to those with allergies like me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a highly recommended 5-star purchase, without a doubt.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a highly recommended 5-star purchase, without a doubt.    </li>
            <li> As long as the good one lasts, I hope it can be resused with the other scents since I will only use one at a time.  </li>
            <li> You can send feedback directly to the company by going on the Amazon home page and clicking the help are in the upper right, per a CS Rep here.</li>
            <li> I was worried that the evergreen scent might be too intense and just smell like an artificial pine forest, but it is very nice and not overpowering at all.  </li>
            <li> scent was OK, lasted for a while, one of the scent bottles was open on arival and half of the liquid spilled.</li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s natural, but if you can&#x27;t smell the scent then what&#x27;s the point?</li>
            <li> They look classy, don&#x27;t use electricity like plugins or smoke like incense, they are \\&quot;Earth friendly\\&quot; and 100% recyclable.  </li>
            <li> So far I am in agreement.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Should note that this is a 100% American-made product, produced in Texas, not overseas, and has all natural fragrance oils, and no chemicals or synthetics.</li>

            <li> and I am a busy Prime shopper.</li>
            <li> had 3 small gift bags that I filled with one of the [[ASIN:B001COGAJI Stick Scents Diffusers, Holiday Variety Pack, 4-Ounce Bottles]] canisters, a pair of inexpensive gloves, a copy of this book [[ASIN:0762408456 Girlfriends: A Celebration]]</li>
            <li> Left it outs on that shelf for almost six months, until open window fresh air season started, that there was still just under 1/4th of the oil left in the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Left it outs on that shelf for almost six months, until open window fresh air season started, that there was still just under 1/4th of the oil left in the bottle.     </li>
            <li> They fill up a room (even a large one) and will definitely get you ready for the holidays (and beyond--they last for a long time!)  </li>
            <li> The Winter Forest is a great scent, especially around artificial trees.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, but leaves a scent of gingerbread, as if you made cookies a few hours earlier.  </li>
            <li> It is harder to get the tube open than it should be, although with a little patience I was able to pry off the metal end.  </li>
            <li> And the packaging does clearly warn you to only pick them up by the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> only one I&#x27;ve opened so far is the pine scented one</li>
            <li> The winter forest bottle was not closed and it had leaked all over the canister and soaked one side of the box.</li>
            <li> Again, one bottle was not tightly closed and leaked during the shipment, except this time it was the candy cane one.</li>
            <li> However, it barely smelled.  </li>
            <li> You literally had to stand right next to the bottle to get a slight hint of fragrance.</li>
            <li> and my dogs ran into the other room from the intense smell.</li>
            <li> B0011TGKUI Stick Scents 4-Count Variety Pack Reed Diffusers (Orange Blossom, Fresh Air, English Garden and Green Apple), 4-Ounce Packages]] or the [[ASIN:B0011TM2RI</li>
            <li> B0011TGKUI Stick Scents 4-Count Variety Pack Reed Diffusers (Orange Blossom, Fresh Air, English Garden and Green Apple), 4-Ounce Packages]] or the [[ASIN:B0011TM2RI</li>
            <li> They last a long time and the smell is not too weak yet not too strong.</li>
            <li> B001DJ2UG4 Stick Scents Spice]]) being used in the background, and as I worked through the day, I noticed two things: (1) the smell was quite pleasant, and (2) I had no headache... not even a hint.</li>
            <li> Thanked her for the thoughtful gift, then put it away, as many of these scented oil products give both my son and me a nasty headache.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find the glass intact, but it has also leaked out over half of the oil.</li>
            <li> The wood caps are definetly loose but the packaging does warn about picking it up only by the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My other complaint about the packaging is that the wooden caps don&#x27;t fit tightly onto the bottles.  </li>
            <li> Not overpowering, but not completely understated either.</li>
            <li> I held the other one over the sink to pry, pry, and pry it open.</li>
            <li> I placed one on the windowsill behind my tree at work, and people would actually touch the tree to see if it was real because of the smell.  </li>
            <li> had received a single pack of these [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> After breaking my nails and expecting glass to be inside the 2 saturated containers, instead the oils spilled out into my hands as I tried to lean it down as the only way to get it out.</li>
            <li> As others have noted, these are easy on the nose and not overpowering and artificial like some other products.    </li>
            <li> Previously, I had other diffusers from the same company</li>
            <li> They were really jammed in there.  </li>
            <li> The wooden cap did not tightly fit the bottle I kept for myself</li>
            <li> When the bottle was placed in our small one-half bath- still barely a fragrance.</li>
            <li> others noted these tubes are not easy to open</li>
            <li> The other two will be given as gifts, but I do plan to get other scents from this brand for other times of year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I do recommend these, but maybe I wouldn&#x27;t if I had the leakage problem that other people did.</li>
            <li> I tried scissors, screwdrivers, other people...</li>
            <li> in the end, somebody got it open with a combination of a razorblade and a small screwdriver- switching between each until they could get the lid</li>
            <li> Plus I still have to get into the other two tubes...</li>
            <li> I am planning to use the other two as stocking stuffers.</li>
            <li> The other two looked like 8oz size caps.  </li>
            <li> When the package arrived, I opened it to find a wet box that smelled like pine trees!</li>
            <li> That makes these pretty expensive.  </li>
            <li> Like some other reviewers wrote, these leaked in shipment.  </li>
            <li> Second Amazon complaint after 5 years</li>
            <li> The sticks were stuck alongside the bottle of fragrance down the bottom.  </li>
            <li> The scent sticks last a long time and have a very subtle scent that will fill a room.  </li>
            <li> Only down side-for people with arthritic hands, a little difficult to open the package and remove the bottle and reeds.</li>
            <li> What a mess.</li>
            <li> As others have said here, these things were a mess when they arrived.  </li>
            <li> There is a little blurb about if the air is too try or humid then the wood will have changed sizes.  </li>
            <li> They seem to be evaporating a little quicker than others that I have purchased.  </li>
            <li> I have a little stockpile of them and take them to all of my dinner parties.  </li>
            <li> I picked up a few sets, planning on keeping one for myself and giving two away as gifts.  </li>
            <li> I had to pull the sticks out a few at a time, because they wouldn&#x27;t all come out.  </li>
            <li> But the trouble I went through with these has made me rethink giving them as gifts.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> After turning the sticks 2-3 times in a week there was still little if any scent released in our small family room.</li>
            <li> Even in a small bathroom I don&#x27;t notice any scent.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it is drier than usual at this time of year.  </li>
            <li> Took a week to arrive though and not sure why.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it is messy!  </li>
            <li> By the time I got it out of the canister (as others have mentioned, they are difficult to open), the bottle was over halfway gone.    </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know who packaged these things, but they made them near impossible to get into.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really hard to give them away.</li>
            <li> They offer a subtle, but distinctive aroma based on the type.</li>
            <li> These tubes are impossible to open!  </li>
            <li> They come packed in cardboard tubes with metal lids that are impossible to open.</li>
            <li> I was expecting at least one broken bottle -</li>
            <li> It was very hard to get hold of the sticks to pull them out</li>
            <li> The sticks and bottle are wedged so tightly into the tube that I was afraid I was going to break the bottle when trying to pull it out.       </li>
            <li> One was broken upon arrival and leaked all over everything including my floor.</li>
            <li> I found it difficult.  </li>
            <li> Emphasis on difficult.  </li>
            <li> I knew then that something was wrong.</li>
            <li> I have not tried the peppermint one yet, and I think it will smell because I can smell it while it&#x27;s still packaged up, but the other two are worthless!  </li>
            <li> Also, beware that the 4-oz product has lasted just under 2 months for us during a cold, Ohio winter.  </li>
            <li> and I was afraid they would break.  </li>
            <li> My dogs still are really crazy about me petting them after washing my hands and even arms all day.</li>
            <li> but maybe the way it was intended?&lt;br /&gt;Besides, the lids to the cardboard tube-containers they come in are very difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> where I was then disappointed with the sticks.  </li>
            <li> :(    </li>
            <li> I bought this item for my wife and she is very disappointed with the product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased these last year and they are wonderful.  Very fragrant, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  All of the scents in this package smell so good.  I&#x27;ve purchased them all separately, but this bundle is a great deal.  Each scent is distinctive and delightful.  They fill up a room (even a large one) and will definitely get you ready for the holidays (and beyond--they last for a long time!)  You will love them!</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Reed diffusers.  These are a great addition to my collection.  I got these on a gold box deal and they were worth it.  All 3 of the 4 oz scents smell great.  I especially enjoy the Peppermint.  I didn&#x27;t think that I would care for the Tree scent but it is not over powering and doesn&#x27;t fill the whole room up.  It does not smell like the tree scent you hang in you car either.&lt;br /&gt;I ended up getting 2 sets. I kept 1 set and I gifted the others to my mom and MIL for hosting Thanksgiving Dinner.  They were appreciated and used immediately.&lt;br /&gt;I also like the fact that these are made in USA and are made by Goodwill Industries.</li>
            <li> I have used 2 of these so far, and neither one has enough scent to be smelled if you are more than a couple of feet from the bottle.  Even in a small bathroom I don&#x27;t notice any scent.  I have not tried the peppermint one yet, and I think it will smell because I can smell it while it&#x27;s still packaged up, but the other two are worthless!  I like that it&#x27;s natural, but if you can&#x27;t smell the scent then what&#x27;s the point?</li>
            <li> First, I love the concept behind this company and the good work they&#x27;re doing in the community.  That helped me pull the trigger on this purchase.  I also like the scent that we first opened.  As others have noted, these are easy on the nose and not overpowering and artificial like some other products.    I believe we made a mistake, however, by placing this in our kitchen which is \\&quot;open\\&quot; and part of our great room.  In this large area, you really need to be standing at the sink to get any aroma at all.  I think these would be more effective in a small bathroom or an enclosed room.  Also, beware that the 4-oz product has lasted just under 2 months for us during a cold, Ohio winter.  Yes, it is drier than usual at this time of year.  We have only fipped the sticks a handful of times, too, so I don&#x27;t imagine the lifespan has been shortened as a result of that.    Bottom line, though, is that we enjoy the scent when we CAN smell it.  I think we&#x27;ll open another one in our master bath to see how it does.</li>
            <li> These were bought with the intention of splitting them up into 3 separate gifts off the recommendation of a friend here on Amazon.  They came packaged very securely and luckily I didn&#x27;t have problems with leakage as some others have reported in their reviews. Before wrapping I did open each canister up to smell them and see the quality. All of them were very nice, but I preferred the Candy Cane and Holiday Spice over the Winter Forest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had 3 small gift bags that I filled with one of the [[ASIN:B001COGAJI Stick Scents Diffusers, Holiday Variety Pack, 4-Ounce Bottles]] canisters, a pair of inexpensive gloves, a copy of this book [[ASIN:0762408456 Girlfriends: A Celebration]] (love the 4-for-3 promo!) and some of their favorite treats. I was able to give them out a couple days ago and they really appreciated them - they did do some swapping of the scents, but that was fine because I wasn&#x27;t sure who would like which.</li>
            <li> These came right on time.Made great Christmas Presents !!!. The scents are good but not real strong.</li>
            <li> very nice....i just received so time will tell if scents last....pleasant scents....great option to candles....</li>
            <li> I also ordered these as a Gold Box special because of all of the reviews that said this brand had a noticeable, but not overpowering, scent.  They did take a week or so to arrive, instead of the 2 days I&#x27;ve gotten used to, but since this was a GB item I figured there were lots of orders for it.  None of them seem to have leaked in shipping as others have mentioned.  The top doesn&#x27;t fit tightly on the bottle like the instructions said it would, but that doesn&#x27;t particularly bother me - if it tips over it&#x27;s going to leak oil whether that part is snug or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only one I&#x27;ve opened so far is the pine scented one and I have to admit I LOVE it.  I have it in a fairly large room and it&#x27;s definitely noticeable when you&#x27;re within 20 feet of it or so, but it doesn&#x27;t overwhelm the room.  I use an artificial tree and this scent really helps bring that wonderful holiday smell into the house.  The other two will be given as gifts, but I do plan to get other scents from this brand for other times of year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did knock off a star because of the packaging.  It is harder to get the tube open than it should be, although with a little patience I was able to pry off the metal end.  But then the sticks were wedged between the side of the tube and the bottle of oil, I assume to hold the bottle still.  It was very hard to get hold of the sticks to pull them out and I was afraid they would break.  They didn&#x27;t break, of course, and all was well, but I know the product could have been packaged in a better way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I do recommend these, but maybe I wouldn&#x27;t if I had the leakage problem that other people did.</li>
            <li> The diffusers were a great buy. They last a long time and the smell is not too weak yet not too strong.</li>
            <li> Stick diffusers are a wonderful way to scent your home, bathroom or workplace.  They look classy, don&#x27;t use electricity like plugins or smoke like incense, they are \\&quot;Earth friendly\\&quot; and 100% recyclable.  They also are easy to use, all you do is put the sticks into the bottle with the oil and as the sticks soak up the oil they let off the scent into the room.  When you notice that the scent is fading, you simply turn the sticks over and the scent will become stronger again.  I have used stick diffusers for awhile now and am very pleased with the overall product.</li>
            <li> I have been a huge fan of the Stick Scents since I discovered them. They offer a subtle, but distinctive aroma based on the type. I love the Holiday Spice, but enjoy some of the other seasonal varieties, too. Don&#x27;t forget to flip the sticks over to enhance the smell. I use these for gifts all the time and it&#x27;s really hard to give them away.</li>
            <li> I jumped on these when they were one of Amazon&#x27;s deal of the day products.  I picked up a few sets, planning on keeping one for myself and giving two away as gifts.  But I&#x27;ve encountered some problems with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The three tubes looked cute.  I decided I&#x27;d open the spice one.  I found it difficult.  Emphasis on difficult.  I don&#x27;t know who packaged these things, but they made them near impossible to get into.  You&#x27;re supposed to pry open the metal top- but you won&#x27;t be able to do it with your fingers or fingernails.  I tried scissors, screwdrivers, other people... in the end, somebody got it open with a combination of a razorblade and a small screwdriver- switching between each until they could get the lid off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was finally in!  I turned the tube over, waiting for the things inside to fall into my hand.... Nope, didn&#x27;t happen.  They were really jammed in there.  The sticks were stuck alongside the bottle of fragrance down the bottom.  I had to pull the sticks out a few at a time, because they wouldn&#x27;t all come out.  Finally I got them all out, where I was then disappointed with the sticks.  The sticks aren&#x27;t nicely sanded at all, and are just waiting to give whoever handles them splinters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions on the back, unscrewing the fragrance lid, and then putting on the wooden lid, which according to the tube had been specially made to snugly fit the top of the bottle.  Yeah didn&#x27;t fit very well at all.  It was very wobbly.  There is a little blurb about if the air is too try or humid then the wood will have changed sizes.  Still, I can&#x27;t be the only one this has happened to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for any stars at all?  The fragrance is nice.  I like it, and I suspect when it diffuses fully it will be better than nice.....  But the trouble I went through with these has made me rethink giving them as gifts.  Plus I still have to get into the other two tubes...</li>
            <li> One was broken upon arrival and leaked all over everything including my floor. Wouldn&#x27;t you know it? The one I was really looking forward to having, too: Holiday Spice. In this full concentration of spillage it didn&#x27;t smell all that good.....but maybe the way it was intended?&lt;br /&gt;Besides, the lids to the cardboard tube-containers they come in are very difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> I got the holiday variety pack when they were offered as a goldbox deal (for about $20). Previously, I had other diffusers from the same company and I have been very pleased. From this patch, I opened the holiday spice scent and put it in my kitchen. It smells great. Not overpowering, but not completely understated either. I am planning to use the other two as stocking stuffers. I love my reed diffusers, but &#x27;tis the season to give! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Nice scents - not heavy and overbearing.  They seem to be evaporating a little quicker than others that I have purchased.  All in all, for the price I think they are a great value.</li>
            <li> I ordererd two boxes of these diffusers. 3 of the cannisters in each box had leaked, staining the cannister. The directions say they have a second screw-top lid with a hole through which to insert the bamboo sticks and onto which the larger top fits, but none was in any of the boxes. Don&#x27;t order these!</li>
            <li> I have asthma and have had yet to find a reed diffuser that was not so strong as to bring on an attack. I read what another astmatic said and thought I&#x27;d give it a try since the God box deal was so good. So far I am in agreement. I put the pepermint in the kitchen as I love Pepermint scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having these open for 2 days now I must say they are just the BEST. When you go outside and come back in it is just this nice faint pleasant scent that makes you feel good. They don&#x27;t knock you over like some do. I have had no breathing problem with them and I am SUPER sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scents are mild and pleasant and just the right size not to take up too much space I would highly recommend them even to those with allergies like me.</li>
            <li> I ordered three of these from the Gold Box special.  One for myself and two for gifts.  I believe all three of them arrived intact unlike some others.  The one I opened was packed in a box that looked like it was designed for four tubes not three and that may be why others found theirs broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others noted these tubes are not easy to open but I did manage to get them open.  I have been enjoying the scents this week.  I find the holiday scent to be weaker than the candy cane and evergreen.  It may seem this way since it is in a bigger room but I don&#x27;t really notice it as much.  The wood caps are definetly loose but the packaging does warn about picking it up only by the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All and all I am happy with this American made product.  I would&#x27;ve given it four stars but because it is American made by a Goodwill industry I am giving it five stars.</li>
            <li> 1)  The caps leaked in transit.  I was expecting at least one broken bottle - but now my kitchen smells like peppermint.  :(    2) The caps are too large to fit securely on the bottle, and reeds a bit loose in the holder.  I have two cats - so placing these will be a bit of a challenge.  I spilled a drop or two the the peppermint - and getting rid of the smell is proving to be a challenge.  I can only imagine if one of these tipped over!    3) The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering, which I&#x27;m thankful for.      I got this product on Gold Deal - definitely okay with spending the $20, but the current $30 is a bit of a stretch.</li>
            <li> I bought the holiday assortment when it was a GB Deal of the Day.  I wish now that I had ordered more than one set as they do make great gifts as others have pointed out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of mine leaked or broke during shipment, so maybe I am just lucky.  The wooden cap did not tightly fit the bottle I kept for myself but I wouldn&#x27;t keep this somewhere I had any chance of tipping it over, anyway.  Even if the lid fit tightly, there is still that hole in the top the reeds extend through.  And the packaging does clearly warn you to only pick them up by the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave the spice as a hostess gift, which I think they are perfect for.  I gave the candy cane to a co-worker and kept the winter forest for myself.  I was worried that the evergreen scent might be too intense and just smell like an artificial pine forest, but it is very nice and not overpowering at all.  I dropped by my co-workers office recently and you can just detect the scent of candy canes.  Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am especially happy that these are made in America and assembled by  Goodwill Industries.  Great scent, great gift and a great cause...what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> These scent sticks are very fragrant.  I purchased them for gifts, but kept   one for myself, which works great.  would have given them 5 stars if the  packaging was a bit nicer</li>
            <li> the diffusers are really nice.  they smell great.  they were a good deal for the cost.  I would recommend these.</li>
            <li> I like the variety and love the evergreen scent.  It&#x27;s an attractive package for gift giving, too, although you might need Charles Atlas to open the tube and extract the contents.  The sticks and bottle are wedged so tightly into the tube that I was afraid I was going to break the bottle when trying to pull it out.       My other complaint about the packaging is that the wooden caps don&#x27;t fit tightly onto the bottles.  One jostle from a child or pet and the whole thing will spill quickly.       Note that these are 4-ounce bottles (4\\&quot; tall).  One bottle lasted only about four weeks for me.  The reviewers who claimed theirs lasted for months may have been commenting on the 8-ounce size.</li>
            <li> I smelled this before I opened the box. Oh No~I knew what happened. Two of the bottles had leaked inside their containers. They had screw type lids that weren&#x27;t tightened on. Now what do I do??? These were supposed to be gifts. Send them back for a refund or exchange? The containers were soaked in scents. I can&#x27;t send these back. Looks like I&#x27;m stuck with a house that smells like a Christmas tree farm. AMAZON PLEASE HELP ME!!!!</li>
            <li> Ordered this item from Gold Box for $20 on Amazon Prime.  Took a week to arrive though and not sure why.  The box had a sticker that said \\&quot;fulfilled by Amazon\\&quot;.  These tubes are impossible to open!  The metal caps in the ends are the only way into the tube.  I ended up sawing the cardboard and then snapping the tube.  Inside is a bottle of oil and it appears that the screw top caps come loose in transit and leak oil inside the tube.  Yes, it is messy!  Of the three scents I received, only one of them had a wooden top that fit the 4oz bottle.  The other two looked like 8oz size caps.  As long as the good one lasts, I hope it can be resused with the other scents since I will only use one at a time.  This company really should put some mechanisms in place to ensure there product leaves the factory and can arrive at the consumer in good condition.</li>
            <li> The Winter Forest is a great scent, especially around artificial trees.  I placed one on the windowsill behind my tree at work, and people would actually touch the tree to see if it was real because of the smell.  The Candy Cane scent is so fresh, any room I place it in is brightened up.  The Holiday Spice is great in the kitchen.  It&#x27;s light, but leaves a scent of gingerbread, as if you made cookies a few hours earlier.  Only down side-for people with arthritic hands, a little difficult to open the package and remove the bottle and reeds.</li>
            <li> scent was OK, lasted for a while, one of the scent bottles was open on arival and half of the liquid spilled.</li>
            <li> Must note up front that this [[ASIN:B001COGAJI Stick Scents Diffusers, Holiday Variety Pack]] has to be one of the best holiday gifts that one could pick. This is a 3-pack of 4-ounce diffusers and contains the Winter Forest, Candy Cane and Holiday Spice scents, along with the reeds (or \\&quot;sticks\\&quot;) necessary to make it all work. Whether you give it as a complete set or as three separate items, it&#x27;s the perfect substitute for scented candles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had received a single pack of these [[ASIN:B001DIZ152 Winter Forest Stick Scents]] from a friend a couple of years ago as a holiday gift. Thanked her for the thoughtful gift, then put it away, as many of these scented oil products give both my son and me a nasty headache. I just didn&#x27;t want to offend her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was visiting a client last fall who had another scent ([[ASIN:B001DJ2UG4 Stick Scents Spice]]) being used in the background, and as I worked through the day, I noticed two things: (1) the smell was quite pleasant, and (2) I had no headache... not even a hint. That evening when I got home, located the Winter Forest Stick Scent package, read the instructions, and put it on a shelf in my office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Winter Forest scent is light and pleasant, and that winter friends thought that it smelled like a Christmas tree. My son said it best, though, when he said that it reminded him of the walks we frequently take through a pine forest, and I agree. The ingredients note that the scents are of pine, cedar, fir, hemlock, musk and vanilla, though I found that there&#x27;s only a hint of vanilla, and can&#x27;t detect any musk at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Holiday Spice scent that my client had was moderately strong, but not overpowering. It reminded me of the smell of a country kitchen during the time of holiday baking, with the scents of gingerbread, maple and vanilla that we associate with the season. My client also had the Candy Cane scent in another room, and it had a gentle peppermint scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oils need to soak into the reeds, and that takes a couple of days. I flipped my reeds over after the first day to allow the oils to penetrate both ends, and then the scent began to gently permeate the air, lightly bit not too overwhelming. Ended up turning the reeds over every week or two to refresh the scent in the room. Left it outs on that shelf for almost six months, until open window fresh air season started, that there was still just under 1/4th of the oil left in the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re considering getting someone a scented candle as a gift, you may wish to reconsider and take a look at these Stick Scents, which require no flame or electricity. The ingredient are natural, don&#x27;t have that cloying essence found in many of the artificial or synthetic oils on the market... the ones that seem to cause headaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your prefer spring and summer scents, the [[ASIN:B0011TGKUI Stick Scents 4-Count Variety Pack Reed Diffusers (Orange Blossom, Fresh Air, English Garden and Green Apple), 4-Ounce Packages]] or the [[ASIN:B0011TM2RI Stick Scents 4-Count Variety Pack Reed Diffusers (Sea Petal, Morning Dew, Lavender Fields, Vanilla Bean), 4-Ounce Packages]] might be a good alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should note that this is a 100% American-made product, produced in Texas, not overseas, and has all natural fragrance oils, and no chemicals or synthetics. They also use a growing staff at Goodwill Industries in Dallas for their production, with a portion of each tube sold going directly to benefit mentally and physically challenged adults. It&#x27;s a good cause, and the company is a certified woman-owned small business, if that matters to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a highly recommended 5-star purchase, without a doubt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Johnuple of days.

            <li> I ordered this set of Stick Scents when they were a gold box special a couple of weeks ago. When the package arrived, I opened it to find a wet box that smelled like pine trees! The winter forest bottle was not closed and it had leaked all over the canister and soaked one side of the box. By the time I got it out of the canister (as others have mentioned, they are difficult to open), the bottle was over halfway gone.    I emailed Amazon to let them know what happened. Within 2 minutes, they sent an apology and had submitted an order for another set of the Holiday Stick Scents to be sent to me at no charge. Amazon customer support gets 5 stars!!    The second shipment arrived today. Again, one bottle was not tightly closed and leaked during the shipment, except this time it was the candy cane one. So I ended up with one full holiday set, which is what I wanted in the first place!    The scents are great. I absolutely love the winter forest scent - it smells just like we have a live Christmas tree in our living room! Overall, this is a nice product, but they need to tighten the lids on the bottles before putting them in the canisters.</li>
            <li> Set it up and leave it.  It will difuse through-out  without becoming overpowering. Very pleasant!</li>
            <li> These are not any good. Order came and 1 of the bottles had come open and poured out of container. Got the order replaced and another of the scents had leaked in the container. I put the good ones out and they are not scented very much. In my opinion, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> These may have been nice since the box smelled incredible on my front porch. I knew then that something was wrong. They come packed in cardboard tubes with metal lids that are impossible to open. After breaking my nails and expecting glass to be inside the 2 saturated containers, instead the oils spilled out into my hands as I tried to lean it down as the only way to get it out. It went everywhere and my dogs ran into the other room from the intense smell. I held the other one over the sink to pry, pry, and pry it open. I was surprised to find the glass intact, but it has also leaked out over half of the oil. My dogs still are really crazy about me petting them after washing my hands and even arms all day. What a mess. I am hopeful that I can get it out of my carpet. Second Amazon complaint after 5 years and I am a busy Prime shopper. Beware.&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I found out that these are put together by Goodwill employees with special needs. I don&#x27;t want to hurt the company now that I know this. I would like us to send the company feedback because tightening the glass containers is an easy fix. Most diffusers are also sealed with wax. You can send feedback directly to the company by going on the Amazon home page and clicking the help are in the upper right, per a CS Rep here. She said to search for the feedback option and it will go directly to the company that is giving people a great opportunity to package what could be an awesome product. Thanks to all of you who let them know and don&#x27;t give up on these:)</li>
            <li> As others have said here, these things were a mess when they arrived.  The oil had leaked from the bottles and was all over the packaging.  The instructions say the wooden tops are \\&quot;specially designed to fit snuggly on the bottle\\&quot;...not at all.  Mine are just loosely teetering on top of the bottles.  Save your money and go with a higher quality product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great cause, but the fragrance never lasted more than a week and a half on any of the scents.  That makes these pretty expensive.  I would have rather just made a donation.  I did like the wooden tops and the packaging was nice.  Maybe I can find a use for the tops?</li>
            <li> The scent sticks last a long time and have a very subtle scent that will fill a room.  Wonderful for gifts (and for yourself!).  I have tried 6 different scents so far and they are all great.</li>
            <li> So I gave stick scents away at my wedding and everyone loved them.  This assortment smells great but it also a great gift.  You get 3 bottles for under $20!  That&#x27;s 3 great gifts.  I have a little stockpile of them and take them to all of my dinner parties.  It&#x27;s a nice little gift for the host/hostess.  It last longer than a bottle of wine!</li>
            <li> Like some other reviewers wrote, these leaked in shipment.  In the first shipment one of the containers had leaked through the bottom of the box.  That left two good ones.  I notified Amazon and they sent me another shipment; well out of that two of the containers leaked leaving one good one.  So, out of the shipments of six bottles, I ended up getting three that hadn&#x27;t leaked.  Yep, they do smell good but the company definitely needs to tighten the lids on the bottles so the oil doesn&#x27;t leak out!</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my wife and she is very disappointed with the product. She has used other reed stick diffuser products before and really liked them. After reviewing some of the comments, I thought she would love the \\&quot;winter forest\\&quot; scent for Christmas. However, it barely smelled.  After turning the sticks 2-3 times in a week there was still little if any scent released in our small family room. When the bottle was placed in our small one-half bath- still barely a fragrance. You literally had to stand right next to the bottle to get a slight hint of fragrance. Very disappointed-total waste of money for me.</li>
