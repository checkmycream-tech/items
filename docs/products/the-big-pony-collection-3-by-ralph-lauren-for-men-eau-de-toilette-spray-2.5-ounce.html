            <li>Smells good.  </li>
            <li>i recommend this product to anyone looking for a good scent</li>
            <li>This here is some good stink.</li>
            <li>Smelled this in a magazine and ordered it off Amazon because the price was good.</li>
            <li>I brought this for my husband and it smells sooo good.</li>
            <li>but damn I smell good</li>
            <li>, he loved it.</li>
            <li>my sons loved it and it arrived in good shape and in time for christmas and it was a really good price</li>
            <li>But still the best best of all RL is polo blue...</li>
            <li>That night, as I was going to bed, I noticed an awesome smell, and determined that it was the right hand - the &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; cologne.  </li>
            <li>Pretty impressive :)</li>
            <li>Smell is a matter of opinion but as far as I am concerned this is the best smelling cologne out there.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s kind of a lighter, more &amp;#34;fun&amp;#34; scent.  </li>
            <li>This is a great cologne, not too sweet nor too potent.</li>
            <li>Great smell just not as strong as the original Polo cologne.</li>
            <li>The cologne smells great at first and when smelling it from the bottle.  </li>
            <li>off refreshing and gets deeper with time.</li>
            <li>and I bought this cologne for him for a Christmas gift as he&#x27;s been requesting more but wanting me to choose.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more of this.</li>
            <li>More of a sporty fragrance.</li>
            <li>There are much better sporty fragrances out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this cologne.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love how it smells</li>
            <li>Smells nice and clean</li>
            <li>great product tried the blue one i like this much better</li>
            <li>Of all the colognes that I own, this is certainly the most unique.</li>
            <li>Smells great nice and fresh with a little mint hint but still have to say #1 big pony still the best of the ponies.  </li>
            <li>Lasts all day and the smell is just fantastic.</li>
            <li>Very distinct notes.</li>
            <li>but well worth every penny!</li>
            <li>rapidez en la entrega, buen empaque, original sin inconvenientes, execelente vendedor estoy muy satisfecho con la compra del perfume polo</li>
            <li>but then it&#x27;s overwhelming at first</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh and not too strong.  </li>
            <li>This one was a perfect mix of serious and fun yet at the same time very sexy!</li>
            <li>Arrived fast, we are satisfied.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet smelling, but not overly and still keeps a &amp;#34;masculine&amp;#34; scent despite that.</li>
            <li>The upside is you really don&#x27;t need more than two pumps, so</li>
            <li>Seriously the best cologne I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>far as the Big Pony collection goes, this is certainly the best of the 3.</li>
            <li>Great projection, decent longevity, I do get compliments, but I personally do not like the scents.</li>
            <li>My 18 year old son is in love with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for both wearing during the day, and for going out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to other Ralph Lauren colognes, this one does seem to fade over time a little more.</li>
            <li>My husband love this brand, we couldn&#x27;t find the blue one, so he went for this one, and we are not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Out of all four, two of them were very nice - the orange and the green.  </li>
            <li>The last cologne I found that I really liked was Paul Smith Story, but evidently I was the only person who liked it</li>
            <li>I really wish it would last longer because I do truly love how it smells!</li>
            <li>I almost bought the Ralph Lauren Polo Black over this one because it was a deep woodsy scent that I liked, but it was a little too \\&quot;serious\\&quot; for my happy, sweet, goofy husband.</li>
            <li>To me this scent will work for just another day at the office, an important meeting, all the way to a romantic or fun evening out on the town!</li>
            <li>After falling in love with this scent at the department store, I decided to check trusty Amazon to see if I could find the same scent online for cheaper (I believe it was about $65 at the department store).  </li>
            <li>reasonable price and very fast shipping</li>
            <li>Rich and spicy...definitely doesn&#x27;t smell like cheap deodorant or every other cologne on the marker.</li>
            <li>It last long, smells good on him.</li>
            <li>shipping was fast and this is the one i wanted for me</li>
            <li>Girls want me so much now that I have to enact a 2 arms length distance rule at work.</li>
            <li>Got for hubby when he smelled sample in mag, but real thing didn&#x27;t thrill him.</li>
            <li>He really likes all of the Ralph Lauren colognes.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Maybe you will have better luck, but the scent just seems to fade or disappear completely after a short time.  </li>
            <li>hmmm its very similar to other fragrances i have, i could say there is nothing too special in the smell of it but overall its good</li>
            <li>Which I&#x27;m assuming is EXTREMELY manly, yet subtle and delicious.</li>
            <li>I NEVER fail to get compliments from friends, coworkers, and oddly enough, complete strangers!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unique in that I have yet to find a scent that doesn&#x27;t become tiresome to the wearer or others, and the aromatic notes within the blend subtlety evilve over the couse of wear into an even more pleasing scent.</li>
            <li>Gift for my 17 year old son, he loves it!</li>
            <li>Smells different when it&#x27;s first applied, but once it &amp;#34;settles&amp;#34; it smells like what I wanted it to.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find it on Amazon for such a great price and to give this to my boyfriend as a gift, but was sadly disappointed by the reality.  </li>
            <li>light enough for day-wear, and deep enough for evening-wear.&lt;br /&gt;starts</li>
            <li>wow</li>
    </ol>

            <li> wow</li>
            <li> and I prefer my scent to be a little more subtle than that.</li>
            <li> However, the scent doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> smell doesnt last long</li>
            <li> In fact, I have been unable to find anything being produced that even remotely appeals to me and which lasts more than a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> I put a small amount of orange on my left hand and small amount of green on the right.  </li>
            <li> The bottle came from a department store and the salesperson threw in some sample cards which each contained 4 little vials-one for each of the Big Pony Collection scents (numbered 1 thr 4)  </li>
            <li> I have to douse myself in it to get it to last a little longer</li>
            <li> Only complaint was wish it would last longer.</li>
            <li> Back off chick, just because I sprayed bottled Heaven on me doesn&#x27;t mean you can jump me.</li>
            <li> So I bought this one for a lot less</li>
            <li> I waste $ on mine anymore.</li>
            <li> I am not sure</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it smells awful, like Angel only more chocolatey and</li>
            <li> My husband and I are in our late 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li> is a delicate smell</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get tired of it.</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad bottle as some other reviewers have stated.</li>
            <li> I wanted to purchase this lotion for my dad, however In my country they are so expensive.</li>
            <li> I have been so disappointed with Men&#x27;s cologne for the past decade.  </li>

            <li> This is a great cologne, not too sweet nor too potent. Lasts all day and the smell is just fantastic. Nothing but compliments anywhere I go.</li>
            <li> Smell is a matter of opinion but as far as I am concerned this is the best smelling cologne out there.</li>
            <li> Smells good.  My girl loves it.</li>
            <li> shipping was fast and this is the one i wanted for me</li>
            <li> light enough for day-wear, and deep enough for evening-wear.&lt;br /&gt;starts off refreshing and gets deeper with time.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and clean</li>
            <li> Smells great nice and fresh with a little mint hint but still have to say #1 big pony still the best of the ponies.  But still the best best of all RL is polo blue... amazing.!</li>
            <li> Awesomeness in a bottle. Great smell just not as strong as the original Polo cologne. Not too shabby for the price</li>
            <li> My husband and I are in our late 20&#x27;s and I bought this cologne for him for a Christmas gift as he&#x27;s been requesting more but wanting me to choose. I almost bought the Ralph Lauren Polo Black over this one because it was a deep woodsy scent that I liked, but it was a little too \\&quot;serious\\&quot; for my happy, sweet, goofy husband. This one was a perfect mix of serious and fun yet at the same time very sexy! To me this scent will work for just another day at the office, an important meeting, all the way to a romantic or fun evening out on the town! Pretty impressive :)</li>
            <li> My husband love this brand, we couldn&#x27;t find the blue one, so he went for this one, and we are not disappointed. It last long, smells good on him. Arrived fast, we are satisfied.</li>
            <li> Seriously the best cologne I&#x27;ve ever owned. I&#x27;ve been a faithful wearer of #3 for a couple of years now since the big pony line was released. I NEVER fail to get compliments from friends, coworkers, and oddly enough, complete strangers! On the pricey side for me (especially larger bottles,) but well worth every penny! To me this is an essential product which I use daily without exception, despite the price tag. It&#x27;s unique in that I have yet to find a scent that doesn&#x27;t become tiresome to the wearer or others, and the aromatic notes within the blend subtlety evilve over the couse of wear into an even more pleasing scent. You will not regret this one!!</li>
            <li> great product tried the blue one i like this much better i recommend this product to anyone looking for a good scent</li>
            <li> I wanted to purchase this lotion for my dad, however In my country they are so expensive. So I bought this one for a lot less and when we took it out well.. it was a lot smaller than the box. - they put a pedestal on the bottom of the box. Anyway I am happy with it I did not want a huge lotion nor paying a lot of money and the perfume is perfect!!</li>
            <li> This here is some good stink. My 18 year old son is in love with it. Rich and spicy...definitely doesn&#x27;t smell like cheap deodorant or every other cologne on the marker. Very distinct notes. I will be buying more of this.</li>
            <li> rapidez en la entrega, buen empaque, original sin inconvenientes, execelente vendedor estoy muy satisfecho con la compra del perfume polo</li>
            <li> Which I&#x27;m assuming is EXTREMELY manly, yet subtle and delicious. Girls want me so much now that I have to enact a 2 arms length distance rule at work. Back off chick, just because I sprayed bottled Heaven on me doesn&#x27;t mean you can jump me.</li>
            <li> my sons loved it and it arrived in good shape and in time for christmas and it was a really good price</li>
            <li> Very happy with product and delivery.</li>
            <li> Of all the colognes that I own, this is certainly the most unique. It&#x27;s sweet smelling, but not overly and still keeps a &amp;#34;masculine&amp;#34; scent despite that. It&#x27;s perfect for both wearing during the day, and for going out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to other Ralph Lauren colognes, this one does seem to fade over time a little more. The upside is you really don&#x27;t need more than two pumps, so you&#x27;ll have a lot to replenish the smell should you have to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the Big Pony collection goes, this is certainly the best of the 3.</li>
            <li> More of a sporty fragrance. Not a fan. Great projection, decent longevity, I do get compliments, but I personally do not like the scents. I&#x27;d recommend you pass on this fragrance. There are much better sporty fragrances out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Projection: Moderate&lt;br /&gt;Longevity: Moderate&lt;br /&gt;Smell: 2/5&lt;br /&gt;Buy/Try/Pass: Pass</li>
            <li> I have been so disappointed with Men&#x27;s cologne for the past decade.  In fact, I have been unable to find anything being produced that even remotely appeals to me and which lasts more than a few minutes.  The last cologne I found that I really liked was Paul Smith Story, but evidently I was the only person who liked it and, regardless, it didn&#x27;t last.  Not at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Christmas I received a bottle of the Big Pony Collection cologne in the &amp;#34;Red&amp;#34; colored bottle.  I am not sure which &amp;#34;number&amp;#34; that is but it is the only one which is red.  Unfortunately it smells awful, like Angel only more chocolatey and.....well.....I just can&#x27;t stand it.  The bottle came from a department store and the salesperson threw in some sample cards which each contained 4 little vials-one for each of the Big Pony Collection scents (numbered 1 thr 4)  Out of all four, two of them were very nice - the orange and the green.  I put a small amount of orange on my left hand and small amount of green on the right.  That night, as I was going to bed, I noticed an awesome smell, and determined that it was the right hand - the &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; cologne.  I immediately logged on to amazon on my ipad and ordered a bottle.  I absolutely love this cologne.  I only wish that Ralph Lauren would make a matching after shave splash to go with it.</li>
            <li> Got for hubby when he smelled sample in mag, but real thing didn&#x27;t thrill him. No worry, Polo is the bomb if your guy likes colonge. I waste $ on mine anymore.</li>
            <li> reasonable price and very fast shipping</li>
            <li> Gift for my 17 year old son, he loves it!</li>
            <li> Smelled this in a magazine and ordered it off Amazon because the price was good. Smells different when it&#x27;s first applied, but once it &amp;#34;settles&amp;#34; it smells like what I wanted it to. However, the scent doesn&#x27;t last long at all. Maybe an hour or two. I have to douse myself in it to get it to last a little longer but then it&#x27;s overwhelming at first and I prefer my scent to be a little more subtle than that. Maybe I got a bad bottle as some other reviewers have stated.</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne for my boyfriend after smelling it at the department store.  I absolutely love how it smells, it&#x27;s kind of a lighter, more &amp;#34;fun&amp;#34; scent.  It&#x27;s fresh and not too strong.  After falling in love with this scent at the department store, I decided to check trusty Amazon to see if I could find the same scent online for cheaper (I believe it was about $65 at the department store).  I was so excited to find it on Amazon for such a great price and to give this to my boyfriend as a gift, but was sadly disappointed by the reality.  The cologne smells great at first and when smelling it from the bottle.  However, it doesn&#x27;t seem to &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34;.  After just a couple of short hours, I can&#x27;t find a trace of the scent on my boyfriend.  Maybe you will have better luck, but the scent just seems to fade or disappear completely after a short time.  I really wish it would last longer because I do truly love how it smells!</li>
            <li> hmmm its very similar to other fragrances i have, i could say there is nothing too special in the smell of it but overall its good</li>
            <li> Great product, good price</li>
            <li> I brought this for my husband and it smells sooo good. He really likes all of the Ralph Lauren colognes.</li>
            <li> Love it excellent fragrance I spray all over my body is a delicate smell this is wow I don&#x27;t get tired of it.</li>
            <li> smell doesnt last long but damn I smell good</li>
