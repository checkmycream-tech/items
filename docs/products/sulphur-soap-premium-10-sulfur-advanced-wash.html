            <li>Nice package as well!</li>
            <li>Great stuff, foams up beautifully, creamy with pleasant smell, leaves your skin NICE.</li>
            <li>but I received it VERY quickly and it smells great!</li>
            <li>The price was a really good deal too.</li>
            <li>However, you will need a good moisturizer when you are done washing your face/body.  </li>
            <li>If you need a sulfur based soap, this is as good as any I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Great soap, I think it has a nice smell, given it contains sulfur.  </li>
            <li>This product is probably good</li>
            <li>It has almost no sulfur smell at all ( this is a good thing )</li>
            <li>I like this soap, but it dries out my skin a good bit.</li>
            <li>Good scrub soap for poison ivy and poison oak.  </li>
            <li>The soap works good and met my expectations.  </li>
            <li>I read online that tea tree is good stuff, so I figured I would try it out.  </li>
            <li>I am giving this four stars because it seems like good quality soap.  </li>
            <li>I received this soap on time and in good condition.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, it helps heal skin problems fairly well.  </li>
            <li>It works, but you have to eliminate them from your environment in order the get rid of them for good.</li>
            <li>So Good</li>
            <li>However, there is no question the item is good and works.</li>
            <li>I have a really good sense of smell, like I always smell things people can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and buy it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to say that their customer service is so good if this company for some reason ever collapsed, they could start doing seminars on customer service.</li>
            <li>That lasted a good 4 to 5 months.</li>
            <li>Good luck ....</li>
            <li>I will probably use it for good measure.</li>
            <li>WOULD CONSIDER MY AMAZON COMPANION BUYERS TO BE JUST AS GOOD</li>
            <li>/&gt;SO READ UP, WRITE FOR US, AND BUY WISELY.</li>
            <li>This is good stuff, and creates a ton of lather.  </li>

            <li>Great soap love it feels good.</li>
            <li>great product :)</li>
            <li>Also sulphur (even better with tea tree oil) is great for combating body odor jfyi</li>
            <li>I let the bar soak in some warm water for about 30 seconds to get a good creamy lather, then lathered up in the shower and rinsed off.</li>
            <li>Great for surface acne and a good oil free soap.  </li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>My face defiantly got dryer and better!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I was amazed that it helped resolve that issue for me so now my legs look amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>This soap makes you feel amazing after leaving the shower.</li>
            <li>Do not think that leaving it on longer will do you more good....</li>
            <li>This is a nice soap - quite neutral in smell compared to others.</li>
            <li>I liked the product and would purchase again.</li>
            <li>soap smells nice</li>
            <li>I liked the way it lathered while I was bathing the dogs, so I bought a bar for myself and for my daughter.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I will have nothing but good things to say about this product when I use it.</li>
            <li>Would recommend this soap, and smells nice.</li>
            <li>She healed on her own.</li>
            <li>My skin is clearing up nicely.</li>
            <li>Was very happy to find a high quality sulfer soap like this.  </li>
            <li>The soaps makes a silky smooth lather and has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This doesn&#x27;t have a very strong sulfur scent, if you are worried about it.</li>
            <li>If your looking for a light sulfur soap that smells good then this one is for you.</li>
            <li>After the first use my itching was diminished greatly.</li>
            <li>Great item that worked like a dream, got rid of mites quickly with no unpleasant odor at all!  </li>

            <li>love it...</li>
            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>A bar of oatmeal would of been a better choice.</li>
            <li>wanted to be sure that I didn&#x27;t get it, seeing as how it is scabies that is transferable to humans!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I love this soap..</li>
            <li>And it of course improved more each time I used it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve thrown away so much more money on products that cost much more and did nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really love it.</li>
            <li>Since then I feel soooooo much better .....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d probably order more to have it in stock in case</li>
            <li>On second thought, this is probably for the best since hiding it is probably not a viable</li>
            <li>I should buy more soon.</li>
            <li>Great, fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>I bought the soap because I have eczema and get breakouts mostly on my face.</li>
            <li>I switched to a cleanser bar and my skin looks much better.</li>
            <li>They dont work, but this sure does.</li>

            <li>I plan on purchase more bar for continued use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I plan on getting more when I run out.      </li>
            <li>If you do plan on using this soap, please for the love of God, don&#x27;t also use lye soap, even if the sulfur soap is washed off.  </li>
            <li>( sulphur Is better) then apply sulphur butter from head to toe ( do every inch including hands,  feet, hesd and fingernails).  </li>
            <li>If you need permethrin and don&#x27;t have a prescription then google maximpulse he has measurement guide to make it yourself that is equivalent or better  to what you would get from a doctor.</li>
            <li>Having seen many dermatologists, trying an ungodly amount of creams, tinctures, cleansers, sprays, soaps, masks, lotions, compounds...</li>

            <li>so make sure you&#x27;re moisturizing after.</li>

            <li>My dermatologist recommended I wash with Sulphur soap which was easy to find on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It is somewhat drying but easily remedied with some castor oil or moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell to strong.</li>
            <li>but it DOES have a strong odor of sulfur which lingers.</li>
            <li>No other acne treatment(s) make my skin look so great</li>
            <li>otherwise it makes your laundry smell like rotten farts, even my cats wouldnt come near me :p</li>
            <li>It flaked off and was fine in about a week</li>
            <li>Tastes fine.</li>
            <li>The soap is fine how it is.</li>
            <li>seems good so far!</li>
            <li>This is a very mild soap that contains sulphur and is so good for the skin  Cleansing deodorizing and disinfecting without any harshness to sensitive skin</li>
            <li>And there were huge cracks in the creases in my hands.</li>
            <li>Smooth skin results</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I enjoy the scent</li>
            <li>I do recommend this product but it will take times to free you from your itch.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this soap and do not mind a bit of sulphur scent at all.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a great soap.</li>
            <li>Great in terms of basic soap</li>
            <li>I liked reading all the reviews and bought some straight from Braunsfels Labs.</li>
            <li>Nice smelling and gentle soap.  </li>
            <li>I use another sulfer product so this is a double win for my skin.</li>
            <li>This was good, I think with continued use it might clear up my problem.</li>
            <li>Ships in a plastic container with lid, which comes in handy with preparation before use (must be soaked in warm water prior to use to &amp;#34;Activate&amp;#34; sulfur per directions)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent is mild and not too strong which I like.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t even very strong to reek your whole bathroom like people are saying.</li>
            <li>Very Fast &amp; Secure Shipping!</li>
            <li>Not quite sure if this really helped, the sulfur is strong and the smell stays on you all day as well as on the towel and clothes.</li>
            <li>This product lasted awhile, had a clean and smell worked as described.</li>
            <li>Will probably purchase more in the future and nice that it is made here in the USA.</li>
            <li>This soap is great for itchy dry skin.</li>
            <li>It seems to clean well</li>
            <li>It gets the body clean.</li>
            <li>Use pinesol, bleach or lysol to clean and you should be cured of scabies or close .</li>
            <li>it actually smells really good considering</li>
            <li>It does a good job at cleansing and there isn&#x27;t any noticeable sulfur smell left on the skin after rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does of good job of deep cleaning your skin.  </li>
            <li>AT THE SAME PLACE AND WANT TO MAKE WISE PURCHASES, SO IMPUT FROM OTHERS IS CONSIDERATE AND</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really not bad.  </li>
            <li>I first noticed there was something about sulphur for the skin when I went up North to a cottage in Michigan and the running water had a strong sulphur smell.</li>
            <li>It works great and leaves me feeling cleaner than any other soap I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I was diagnosed with scabies that I picked up at a Super 8 in Mont Belvieu, TX.</li>
            <li>sure how this particular brand stacks up against others.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>In the AM, I use a mild cleanser.</li>
            <li>Thank you for being so quick.</li>
            <li>This soap, when used correctly, kills scabies and the tea tree oil sticks to your skin and penetrates burrows, making quick work of scabies eggs.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I bought this stuff to combat scabies, however the scabies were gone relatively quickly after using a tube of permethrin and washing all sheets, bedspreads and clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And all to no lasting avail!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across an article August of 2014 that cited sulfur as exceptionally helpful and calming when managing/healing rosacea ((which was news to me)).</li>
            <li>Super sulfury.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s suds with original dawn right after exposure to the oil on poison ivy,oak or sumac.</li>
            <li>The soap does smell great but its not worth the amount of money I paid for it....</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use this item long, thinking it would be good for my skin.</li>
            <li>but, the bar lasts a good long time.</li>
            <li>There is no unpleasant odor</li>
            <li>Used in conjunction with topical 10% sulfur ointment and mites were gone in 2-3 days - highly recommend and great value too.</li>
            <li>over night my deep acne healed and my skin is soft and beautiful..</li>
            <li>Smells a little medicinal, but it works great for any adjunct treatment for athlete&#x27;s foot, scabies, mild bacterial dermatitis.</li>
            <li>I also use it on the little bit of hair I have on my head lol.</li>
            <li>I got it for a skin condition, and so far it helps, I really like the way it lathers, and I soak it as per instructions, 20 seconds in warm water</li>
            <li>If this clears up my condition, well worth the buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I researched sulphur soap after the doctor recommended it and learned that it kills every kind of bacteria, fungus, and tiny critter that may get on your skin or in your skin.</li>
            <li>Since using this soap I rarely have those issues.</li>
            <li>I love how soft my skin feels after  </li>
            <li>I still have the occasional break out and that&#x27;s where this stuff comes in handy.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t cure a scabies outbreak but provides a distinct measure of relief.</li>
            <li>but, thats a success in my eyes :</li>
            <li>Pretty good, felt it made a difference, did not completely solve my problem though</li>
            <li>The only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I kind of smell like a campfire/fart after I wash with this.</li>
            <li>Took a star off because I used it on my own skin several days in a row</li>
            <li>Worth every</li>
            <li>Definitely worth buying</li>
            <li>I tried twice per day, but my skin was too sensitive and the sulphur soap caused more irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I rarely go to the doctor for anything.  </li>
            <li>This soap lathers pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>The Braunfels sulfur soap quickly relieved my skin of itching on the first time use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s gentle, &amp; it makes my skin look lovely and very soft!  </li>
            <li>Nothing works this good at clearing up my skin, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot, including other brands of sulphur soap.</li>
            <li>Amazing immediate results from the initial first week of usage.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased to report that I have been using this soap daily, along with the Brunsfield labs face cream; having tremendous success since September 2014.</li>
            <li>soon as I put it on after allowing 20secs of warm water to run on the soap, I put it all over my body head to toe, and let it dry on my body 10mins.</li>
            <li>Last a long time and its of great quality</li>
            <li>you just have to be consistent</li>
            <li>Does exactly what is says.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what I want it to do.</li>
            <li>first time i did this</li>
            <li>Since it actually worked, I ordered more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fart-Soap is actually quite refreshing..</li>
            <li>Bought the first one as a soap for the dogs.  </li>
            <li>I must say it works pretty fast!</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>Shipped so fast!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s better than having red blemishes from demodex mites.</li>
            <li>He was able to cure himself with this soap within 2-3 weeks of daily use.</li>
            <li>Sulphur soap used about once a week seems to keep my sensitive face free of irritants.</li>
            <li>Currently,I think I&#x27;m finally getting better.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more of this soap.</li>
            <li>For the first time in YEARSSSSS  I don&#x27;t have acne on my face.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>, SOME WORKED PRETTY WELL, SOME A BIT, AND SOME NOT AT ALL.</li>
            <li>Just use really hot water .</li>
            <li>I dislike the squeaky clean feeling but by the time I get out and use a serum, moisturizer and primer on my face, I&#x27;ve forgotten how clean it was when I left the shower.  </li>
            <li>I still use it ,, few times week, great on acne too, no side effects like the permethrin cream, all natural,</li>
            <li>So far so clean.</li>
            <li>first thing that occurred was an intense itching.</li>
            <li>Worked great for bumps and other medical issues!!</li>
            <li>And more than anything I am deeply grateful for something cost-effective and natural that has actually worked for more than a</li>
            <li>He uses a moisturizing sunscreen and moisturizer at night to make sure his skin doesn&#x27;t get too dry.  </li>
            <li>I just let my body air dry mostly.  </li>
            <li>I HAVE MORE DRY SKIN</li>
            <li>AS I HAVE NOTED WITH MANY, AND DRY SCALP, BUT NOT DANDRUFF.</li>
            <li>THE DRY SCALP IS MUCH BETTER.</li>
            <li>I will certainly buy another one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read how sulphur helps combat against acne and I will certainly be using sulphur soap from here on out.</li>
            <li>It smells mildly metallic more than anything else, not at all like you dried your face with your butt towel.</li>
            <li>It lathers well and seems gentle and pure.  </li>
            <li>Sulfur soaps are the only option available    </li>
            <li>Loads of suds and very helpful for my scalp psoriasis.</li>
            <li>This soap is gentle and drying.  </li>
            <li>Works really well for acne and folliculitis and where moisturizers can be obstructive to cure.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use it too much.</li>
            <li>I know that it is really sulphur as I can smell it on my towels when they come out of the dryer.  </li>
            <li>and I rinse really</li>
            <li>really well its just the soap I gave it 5 stars because it has changed my life</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s much smoother.</li>
            <li>it really cleans your skin for your skin is the largest organ.</li>
            <li>but I just want to to let everyone know that when this seller seys fast that&#x27;s what the seller means.</li>
            <li>Thanks agin for job well done in shipping.</li>
            <li>This really did not work at all.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t notice much of a sulfur odor either.  </li>
            <li>Really?  </li>
            <li>I was amazed at how gentle it is.</li>
            <li>I got scabies from work, I work with kids, and this soap plus sulfur ointment got rid of the problem fast.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t care too much about that</li>
            <li>It really helped with my family&#x27;s problem.</li>
            <li>Purchased for doggie skin condition, works very well.</li>
            <li>Amazing, started clearing up Acne that very night, dried them up fast too.</li>
            <li>Worked just like I needed it to thanks Amazon</li>
            <li>My sister managed to get cured by using undiluted Neem oil on the bites and burrows and used Theraneem lotion over her whole body twice a day for 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it hasn&#x27;t really helped with my acne</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it straight for couple months now</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really smell sulfur at all, which you really should at 10%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re MUCH HAPPIER when not itching, scratching, biting .</li>
            <li>works very well and doesn&#x27;t smell</li>
            <li>All I know is after I used this product my skin has been absolutely horrendous.</li>
            <li>I would have much rather have had scabies than the pain those soaps caused.</li>
            <li>Your whole bathroom will reek of sulphur, but it really does work - in curing some skin conditions.</li>
            <li>So, I came to Amazon in search something that would be safe to use on my skin, inexpensive ((I&#x27;ve spent thousands)) and also contained sulfur.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t really do much.  </li>
            <li>PROMISING TO CURE MY HEELS</li>
            <li>But it is very drying</li>
            <li>I really like this for me..</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say if it would make acne completely go away until we use it more regularly..</li>
            <li>Expensive soap,but smell is great super easy to latter if you activate the active ingredient by soaking it in warm water for 10 second</li>
            <li>Bought because of a false scabies alarm and find it to be a very nice soap.</li>
            <li>Smells better than other sulphur soaps too.</li>
            <li>instant relief, it just makes your body feels so clean, and it does well on my acne.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty clear.</li>
            <li>i recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a scabies solution, this product is a 4/5 only because i am still recovering and not yet seen the full effect of the product yet.</li>
            <li>Works fast at curing tinea versa and returning skin to normal shade.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to take off silver jewelry before using it or your jewelry will turn black.</li>
            <li>This is the ONLY sulfur soap that works adequately.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27; say enough about his soap, it did save me a $200 trip to a dermatologist, because the rash has disappeared , I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li>I sometimes use this with a mild liquid cleanser especially in the winter.  </li>
            <li>My skin is clear and smooth and exfoliated; it looks 15 years younger.</li>
            <li>My facial hair grows quickly</li>
            <li>Now I believe it, I have all the classic symptoms.  </li>
            <li>Highly, recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend</li>
            <li>The research within the article piqued my curiosity enough, I thought it worth a try.</li>
            <li>THAN IS NORMAL, PROBS WITH CRACKED HEELS,</li>
            <li>Anyways it cleared up most of the mysterious bumps on me, and half of the tinea-something on my son with the first bar of soap.</li>
            <li>Its a strong enough odor that even clothes after being washed several times still have a hint.</li>
            <li>I can live with that asit</li>
            <li>This product came as advertised, and on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have suffered with severe rosacea, since my very early 20s.</li>
            <li>WHO CLEARLY SAY SOMETHING IS NOT UP TO PAR, AND THEN I SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Best way to use it... get in the shower as hot as you can stand it to open up pores and folicles.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is tolerable, though definitely noticible for the first 20 minutes after using the soap.</li>
            <li>I HAVE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE NATURAL FLORA AND FAUNA THAT ARE A PART OF OUR NORMAL ENVIRONMENT, THAT SEEMS TO HAVE LITTLE EFFECT ON MOST OF US, DOES CAUSE DISTRESS TO OTHERS IN VARIOUS DEGREES.</li>
            <li>My teenage son has some acne in his t-zone and this really seems to work drying it up and preventing new breakouts.  </li>
            <li>I had a different kind of strange bumps that hadn&#x27;t gone away with me trying several different lotions and ointments.</li>
            <li>Thank you for providing this soap online as it is hard to find over the counter at most drug stores.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed this product it does not smell bad like most things that contain sulfur.</li>
            <li>Anytime I showered, bathed or washed my face in it, my skin was totally clear, so I attributed that to the sulphur in the water and started looking for soap with sulphur in it.</li>
            <li>I started to use the soap and within four days all was clear.</li>
            <li>had scabies on my chest and underarms; the sulphur soap helped clear up the acne on my shoulders (killing two birds with one stone?)</li>
            <li>getting ready to order for the third time.</li>
            <li>and I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have suffered from adult acne for years and after some aggressive treatments of accutane and antibiotics, my acne is nearly gone.</li>
            <li>I did not notice any smell, but if there was it would far outweigh the benefits.</li>
            <li>daughter,16 month old granddaughter, 74</li>
            <li>yr old mother, my sister and myself.</li>
            <li>Frequent hand-washing dries my skin.</li>
            <li>and it keeps the flakes away and redness completely gone .</li>
            <li>Assuming I had an issue with some sort of mite, I tried this sulfur soap given sulfur is said to be a natural deterrent of this type of infection.</li>
            <li>Lathers VERY well, especially in hair</li>
            <li>no odor, I was surprised...</li>
            <li>Wish I kept the old bar.</li>
            <li>I eventually used both the cream and ivermectin and neither one made a difference for my problems that eventually developed as a result of using those soaps.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t completely close my hands.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found it nearly as drying as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>I used this in conjunction with De La Cruz sulphur ointment and my skin has completely turned around.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;it doesn&#x27;t last more than a few hours...</li>
            <li>Yes sulfur smells and if you use a towel with it then the smell will stay in your towels and the smell faintly lingers the products works good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m slowly getting better.  </li>
            <li>Although it is not a full cure, unless you are a complete obsessive compulsive clean freak, It is a wonderful, NON-TOXIC remedy to help you fight off this annoying bug.</li>
            <li>but it left my skin super dry.</li>
            <li>Although there seems to be minimal to no odor while in use, it does leave my towel and shower with a strong rotten egg smell, so the extent where one can easily notice the smell when walking past the shower later the same day.</li>
            <li>EXACTLY like a wet cardboard box.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to live my life smelling like this unless it is absolutely necessary</li>
            <li>but it really works, i tried it for my legs since shaving can irritate my legs and make it dry and cracked .</li>
            <li>This Sulphur Soap - Premium 10% Sulfur Advanced Wash is making a difference on my son&#x27;s complexion after a few weeks of regular use.</li>
            <li>I did not have a major acne problem</li>
            <li>I did as other reviewers said and let it sit in hot water.</li>
            <li>It lathers up great and doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all.</li>
            <li>(I LIKE TO GO GET MY HAIR DONE, AND GENERALLY ARRIVE HAVING FORGOTTEN THE SOAP</li>
            <li>I have been using this twice daily as directed, for one week now, and my skin condition is almost entirely clear.  </li>
            <li>I did the same with the soap and also used it as a face wash, since permethrin can&#x27;t be used directly on your face.</li>
            <li>I just want to make everyone s aware this soap will turn your gold jewelry a dingy dark bronze color.</li>
            <li>Not offensive or overpowering, certainly not expected.</li>
            <li>my teen son, adult</li>
            <li>and I am impatient I want something to work right away</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive and doesn&#x27;t contain a bunch of chemicals like the other acne lines out there.</li>
            <li>For a soap this does not dry my skin either</li>
            <li>Does smell in bathroom a little after a hot or steamy shower.</li>
            <li>Not complaining as its expected of a product with such a high concentration of sulfur, just want to point out&lt;br</li>
            <li>Usually if I don&#x27;t moisturize right away my cheeks feel like they will crack, but when I use this I don&#x27;t have that problem.</li>
            <li>I read reviews on this, some good some bad, and decided to try it out.</li>

            <li> but I received it VERY quickly and it smells great!</li>
            <li> The price was a really good deal too.</li>
            <li> However, you will need a good moisturizer when you are done washing your face/body.  </li>
            <li> If you need a sulfur based soap, this is as good as any I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Great soap, I think it has a nice smell, given it contains sulfur.  </li>
            <li> This product is probably good</li>
            <li> It has almost no sulfur smell at all ( this is a good thing )</li>
            <li> I like this soap, but it dries out my skin a good bit.</li>
            <li> Good scrub soap for poison ivy and poison oak.  </li>
            <li> The soap works good and met my expectations.  </li>
            <li> I read online that tea tree is good stuff, so I figured I would try it out.  </li>
            <li> I am giving this four stars because it seems like good quality soap.  </li>
            <li> I received this soap on time and in good condition.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, it helps heal skin problems fairly well.  </li>
            <li> It works, but you have to eliminate them from your environment in order the get rid of them for good.</li>
            <li> So Good</li>
            <li> However, there is no question the item is good and works.</li>
            <li> I have a really good sense of smell, like I always smell things people can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and buy it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to say that their customer service is so good if this company for some reason ever collapsed, they could start doing seminars on customer service.</li>
            <li> That lasted a good 4 to 5 months.</li>
            <li> Good luck ....</li>
            <li> I will probably use it for good measure.</li>
            <li> WOULD CONSIDER MY AMAZON COMPANION BUYERS TO BE JUST AS GOOD</li>
            <li> /&gt;SO READ UP, WRITE FOR US, AND BUY WISELY.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff, and creates a ton of lather.  </li>
            <li> Very Pleased, Good Luck, and God Bless, Peter and Family, USA.</li>
            <li> Great soap love it feels good.</li>
            <li> great product :)</li>
            <li> Also sulphur (even better with tea tree oil) is great for combating body odor jfyi</li>
            <li> I let the bar soak in some warm water for about 30 seconds to get a good creamy lather, then lathered up in the shower and rinsed off.</li>
            <li> Great for surface acne and a good oil free soap.  </li>
            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> My face defiantly got dryer and better!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I was amazed that it helped resolve that issue for me so now my legs look amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> This soap makes you feel amazing after leaving the shower.</li>
            <li> Do not think that leaving it on longer will do you more good....</li>
            <li> This is a nice soap - quite neutral in smell compared to others.</li>
            <li> I liked the product and would purchase again.</li>
            <li> soap smells nice</li>
            <li> I liked the way it lathered while I was bathing the dogs, so I bought a bar for myself and for my daughter.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I will have nothing but good things to say about this product when I use it.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this soap, and smells nice.</li>
            <li> She healed on her own.</li>
            <li> My skin is clearing up nicely.</li>
            <li> Was very happy to find a high quality sulfer soap like this.  </li>
            <li> The soaps makes a silky smooth lather and has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t have a very strong sulfur scent, if you are worried about it.</li>
            <li> If your looking for a light sulfur soap that smells good then this one is for you.</li>
            <li> After the first use my itching was diminished greatly.</li>
            <li> Great item that worked like a dream, got rid of mites quickly with no unpleasant odor at all!  </li>
            <li> and I have very fair sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> love this soap.</li>
            <li> Love the soap, helps with all our medicinal needs.</li>
            <li> Glad that I bought 2 at once.</li>
            <li> I love it ...</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> i feel better within 15 seconds of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it..</li>
            <li> love it...</li>
            <li> I love this soap.</li>
            <li> A bar of oatmeal would of been a better choice.</li>
            <li> wanted to be sure that I didn&#x27;t get it, seeing as how it is scabies that is transferable to humans!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I love this soap..</li>
            <li> And it of course improved more each time I used it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve thrown away so much more money on products that cost much more and did nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really love it.</li>
            <li> Since then I feel soooooo much better .....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d probably order more to have it in stock in case</li>
            <li> On second thought, this is probably for the best since hiding it is probably not a viable</li>
            <li> I should buy more soon.</li>
            <li> Great, fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> I bought the soap because I have eczema and get breakouts mostly on my face.</li>
            <li> I switched to a cleanser bar and my skin looks much better.</li>
            <li> They dont work, but this sure does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to most soaps.</li>
            <li> love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Most of our family was infested-</li>
            <li> I love the creamy lather!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I plan on purchase more bar for continued use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I plan on getting more when I run out.      </li>
            <li> If you do plan on using this soap, please for the love of God, don&#x27;t also use lye soap, even if the sulfur soap is washed off.  </li>
            <li> ( sulphur Is better) then apply sulphur butter from head to toe ( do every inch including hands,  feet, hesd and fingernails).  </li>
            <li> If you need permethrin and don&#x27;t have a prescription then google maximpulse he has measurement guide to make it yourself that is equivalent or better  to what you would get from a doctor.</li>
            <li> Having seen many dermatologists, trying an ungodly amount of creams, tinctures, cleansers, sprays, soaps, masks, lotions, compounds...</li>
            <li> truly am grateful and wish more rosacea sufferers knew of this porduct.</li>
            <li> Wish I would have bought more</li>
            <li> OK for dermal problems.</li>
            <li> more problems</li>
            <li> ordered more already of this product</li>
            <li> AND GLAD THEY DID.</li>
            <li> So I did, some of my acne on my body started to fade away and saw that my skin was getting better, but I started to itch</li>
            <li> so make sure you&#x27;re moisturizing after.</li>
            <li> No moisturisers (That&#x27;s a good thing), great for the back and shoulders.  </li>
            <li> You have to soak it in warm water for 20 seconds first and it makes a nice, creamy lather.</li>
            <li> Good product fast delivery!</li>

            <li> Leave lotion on for 24 hrs each day if possible for greatest success.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended I wash with Sulphur soap which was easy to find on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> It is somewhat drying but easily remedied with some castor oil or moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell to strong.</li>
            <li> but it DOES have a strong odor of sulfur which lingers.</li>
            <li> No other acne treatment(s) make my skin look so great</li>
            <li> otherwise it makes your laundry smell like rotten farts, even my cats wouldnt come near me :p</li>
            <li> It flaked off and was fine in about a week</li>
            <li> Tastes fine.</li>
            <li> The soap is fine how it is.</li>
            <li> seems good so far!</li>
            <li> This is a very mild soap that contains sulphur and is so good for the skin  Cleansing deodorizing and disinfecting without any harshness to sensitive skin</li>
            <li> And there were huge cracks in the creases in my hands.</li>
            <li> Smooth skin results</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I enjoy the scent</li>
            <li> I do recommend this product but it will take times to free you from your itch.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this soap and do not mind a bit of sulphur scent at all.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a great soap.</li>
            <li> Great in terms of basic soap</li>
            <li> I liked reading all the reviews and bought some straight from Braunsfels Labs.</li>
            <li> Nice smelling and gentle soap.  </li>
            <li> I use another sulfer product so this is a double win for my skin.</li>
            <li> This was good, I think with continued use it might clear up my problem.</li>
            <li> Ships in a plastic container with lid, which comes in handy with preparation before use (must be soaked in warm water prior to use to &amp;#34;Activate&amp;#34; sulfur per directions)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent is mild and not too strong which I like.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t even very strong to reek your whole bathroom like people are saying.</li>
            <li> Very Fast &amp; Secure Shipping!</li>
            <li> Not quite sure if this really helped, the sulfur is strong and the smell stays on you all day as well as on the towel and clothes.</li>
            <li> This product lasted awhile, had a clean and smell worked as described.</li>
            <li> Will probably purchase more in the future and nice that it is made here in the USA.</li>
            <li> This soap is great for itchy dry skin.</li>
            <li> It seems to clean well</li>
            <li> It gets the body clean.</li>
            <li> Use pinesol, bleach or lysol to clean and you should be cured of scabies or close .</li>
            <li> it actually smells really good considering</li>
            <li> It does a good job at cleansing and there isn&#x27;t any noticeable sulfur smell left on the skin after rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does of good job of deep cleaning your skin.  </li>
            <li> AT THE SAME PLACE AND WANT TO MAKE WISE PURCHASES, SO IMPUT FROM OTHERS IS CONSIDERATE AND</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really not bad.  </li>
            <li> I first noticed there was something about sulphur for the skin when I went up North to a cottage in Michigan and the running water had a strong sulphur smell.</li>
            <li> It works great and leaves me feeling cleaner than any other soap I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I was diagnosed with scabies that I picked up at a Super 8 in Mont Belvieu, TX.</li>
            <li> sure how this particular brand stacks up against others.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> In the AM, I use a mild cleanser.</li>
            <li> Thank you for being so quick.</li>
            <li> This soap, when used correctly, kills scabies and the tea tree oil sticks to your skin and penetrates burrows, making quick work of scabies eggs.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff to combat scabies, however the scabies were gone relatively quickly after using a tube of permethrin and washing all sheets, bedspreads and clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And all to no lasting avail!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across an article August of 2014 that cited sulfur as exceptionally helpful and calming when managing/healing rosacea ((which was news to me)).</li>
            <li> Super sulfury.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s suds with original dawn right after exposure to the oil on poison ivy,oak or sumac.</li>
            <li> The soap does smell great but its not worth the amount of money I paid for it....</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use this item long, thinking it would be good for my skin.</li>
            <li> but, the bar lasts a good long time.</li>
            <li> There is no unpleasant odor</li>
            <li> Used in conjunction with topical 10% sulfur ointment and mites were gone in 2-3 days - highly recommend and great value too.</li>
            <li> over night my deep acne healed and my skin is soft and beautiful..</li>
            <li> Smells a little medicinal, but it works great for any adjunct treatment for athlete&#x27;s foot, scabies, mild bacterial dermatitis.</li>
            <li> I also use it on the little bit of hair I have on my head lol.</li>
            <li> I got it for a skin condition, and so far it helps, I really like the way it lathers, and I soak it as per instructions, 20 seconds in warm water</li>
            <li> If this clears up my condition, well worth the buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I researched sulphur soap after the doctor recommended it and learned that it kills every kind of bacteria, fungus, and tiny critter that may get on your skin or in your skin.</li>
            <li> Since using this soap I rarely have those issues.</li>
            <li> I love how soft my skin feels after  </li>
            <li> I still have the occasional break out and that&#x27;s where this stuff comes in handy.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t cure a scabies outbreak but provides a distinct measure of relief.</li>
            <li> but, thats a success in my eyes :</li>
            <li> Pretty good, felt it made a difference, did not completely solve my problem though</li>
            <li> The only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I kind of smell like a campfire/fart after I wash with this.</li>
            <li> Took a star off because I used it on my own skin several days in a row</li>
            <li> Worth every</li>
            <li> Definitely worth buying</li>
            <li> I tried twice per day, but my skin was too sensitive and the sulphur soap caused more irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I rarely go to the doctor for anything.  </li>
            <li> This soap lathers pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> The Braunfels sulfur soap quickly relieved my skin of itching on the first time use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s gentle, &amp; it makes my skin look lovely and very soft!  </li>
            <li> Nothing works this good at clearing up my skin, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot, including other brands of sulphur soap.</li>
            <li> Amazing immediate results from the initial first week of usage.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased to report that I have been using this soap daily, along with the Brunsfield labs face cream; having tremendous success since September 2014.</li>
            <li> soon as I put it on after allowing 20secs of warm water to run on the soap, I put it all over my body head to toe, and let it dry on my body 10mins.</li>
            <li> Last a long time and its of great quality</li>
            <li> you just have to be consistent</li>
            <li> Does exactly what is says.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what I want it to do.</li>
            <li> first time i did this</li>
            <li> Since it actually worked, I ordered more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fart-Soap is actually quite refreshing..</li>
            <li> Bought the first one as a soap for the dogs.  </li>
            <li> I must say it works pretty fast!</li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> Shipped so fast!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s better than having red blemishes from demodex mites.</li>
            <li> He was able to cure himself with this soap within 2-3 weeks of daily use.</li>
            <li> Sulphur soap used about once a week seems to keep my sensitive face free of irritants.</li>
            <li> Currently,I think I&#x27;m finally getting better.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more of this soap.</li>
            <li> For the first time in YEARSSSSS  I don&#x27;t have acne on my face.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> , SOME WORKED PRETTY WELL, SOME A BIT, AND SOME NOT AT ALL.</li>
            <li> Just use really hot water .</li>
            <li> I dislike the squeaky clean feeling but by the time I get out and use a serum, moisturizer and primer on my face, I&#x27;ve forgotten how clean it was when I left the shower.  </li>
            <li> I still use it ,, few times week, great on acne too, no side effects like the permethrin cream, all natural,</li>
            <li> So far so clean.</li>
            <li> first thing that occurred was an intense itching.</li>
            <li> Worked great for bumps and other medical issues!!</li>
            <li> And more than anything I am deeply grateful for something cost-effective and natural that has actually worked for more than a</li>
            <li> He uses a moisturizing sunscreen and moisturizer at night to make sure his skin doesn&#x27;t get too dry.  </li>
            <li> I just let my body air dry mostly.  </li>
            <li> I HAVE MORE DRY SKIN</li>
            <li> AS I HAVE NOTED WITH MANY, AND DRY SCALP, BUT NOT DANDRUFF.</li>
            <li> THE DRY SCALP IS MUCH BETTER.</li>
            <li> I will certainly buy another one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read how sulphur helps combat against acne and I will certainly be using sulphur soap from here on out.</li>
            <li> It smells mildly metallic more than anything else, not at all like you dried your face with your butt towel.</li>
            <li> It lathers well and seems gentle and pure.  </li>
            <li> Sulfur soaps are the only option available    </li>
            <li> Loads of suds and very helpful for my scalp psoriasis.</li>
            <li> This soap is gentle and drying.  </li>
            <li> Works really well for acne and folliculitis and where moisturizers can be obstructive to cure.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use it too much.</li>
            <li> I know that it is really sulphur as I can smell it on my towels when they come out of the dryer.  </li>
            <li> and I rinse really</li>
            <li> really well its just the soap I gave it 5 stars because it has changed my life</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s much smoother.</li>
            <li> it really cleans your skin for your skin is the largest organ.</li>
            <li> but I just want to to let everyone know that when this seller seys fast that&#x27;s what the seller means.</li>
            <li> Thanks agin for job well done in shipping.</li>
            <li> This really did not work at all.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t notice much of a sulfur odor either.  </li>
            <li> Really?  </li>
            <li> I was amazed at how gentle it is.</li>
            <li> I got scabies from work, I work with kids, and this soap plus sulfur ointment got rid of the problem fast.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care too much about that</li>
            <li> It really helped with my family&#x27;s problem.</li>
            <li> Purchased for doggie skin condition, works very well.</li>
            <li> Amazing, started clearing up Acne that very night, dried them up fast too.</li>
            <li> Worked just like I needed it to thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> My sister managed to get cured by using undiluted Neem oil on the bites and burrows and used Theraneem lotion over her whole body twice a day for 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it hasn&#x27;t really helped with my acne</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it straight for couple months now</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really smell sulfur at all, which you really should at 10%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re MUCH HAPPIER when not itching, scratching, biting .</li>
            <li> works very well and doesn&#x27;t smell</li>
            <li> All I know is after I used this product my skin has been absolutely horrendous.</li>
            <li> I would have much rather have had scabies than the pain those soaps caused.</li>
            <li> Your whole bathroom will reek of sulphur, but it really does work - in curing some skin conditions.</li>
            <li> So, I came to Amazon in search something that would be safe to use on my skin, inexpensive ((I&#x27;ve spent thousands)) and also contained sulfur.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t really do much.  </li>
            <li> PROMISING TO CURE MY HEELS</li>
            <li> But it is very drying</li>
            <li> I really like this for me..</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say if it would make acne completely go away until we use it more regularly..</li>
            <li> Expensive soap,but smell is great super easy to latter if you activate the active ingredient by soaking it in warm water for 10 second</li>
            <li> Bought because of a false scabies alarm and find it to be a very nice soap.</li>
            <li> Smells better than other sulphur soaps too.</li>
            <li> instant relief, it just makes your body feels so clean, and it does well on my acne.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty clear.</li>
            <li> i recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a scabies solution, this product is a 4/5 only because i am still recovering and not yet seen the full effect of the product yet.</li>
            <li> Works fast at curing tinea versa and returning skin to normal shade.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to take off silver jewelry before using it or your jewelry will turn black.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY sulfur soap that works adequately.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27; say enough about his soap, it did save me a $200 trip to a dermatologist, because the rash has disappeared , I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> I sometimes use this with a mild liquid cleanser especially in the winter.  </li>
            <li> My skin is clear and smooth and exfoliated; it looks 15 years younger.</li>
            <li> My facial hair grows quickly</li>
            <li> Now I believe it, I have all the classic symptoms.  </li>
            <li> Highly, recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend</li>
            <li> The research within the article piqued my curiosity enough, I thought it worth a try.</li>
            <li> THAN IS NORMAL, PROBS WITH CRACKED HEELS,</li>
            <li> Anyways it cleared up most of the mysterious bumps on me, and half of the tinea-something on my son with the first bar of soap.</li>
            <li> Its a strong enough odor that even clothes after being washed several times still have a hint.</li>
            <li> I can live with that asit</li>
            <li> This product came as advertised, and on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have suffered with severe rosacea, since my very early 20s.</li>
            <li> WHO CLEARLY SAY SOMETHING IS NOT UP TO PAR, AND THEN I SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Best way to use it... get in the shower as hot as you can stand it to open up pores and folicles.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is tolerable, though definitely noticible for the first 20 minutes after using the soap.</li>
            <li> I HAVE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE NATURAL FLORA AND FAUNA THAT ARE A PART OF OUR NORMAL ENVIRONMENT, THAT SEEMS TO HAVE LITTLE EFFECT ON MOST OF US, DOES CAUSE DISTRESS TO OTHERS IN VARIOUS DEGREES.</li>
            <li> My teenage son has some acne in his t-zone and this really seems to work drying it up and preventing new breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I had a different kind of strange bumps that hadn&#x27;t gone away with me trying several different lotions and ointments.</li>
            <li> Thank you for providing this soap online as it is hard to find over the counter at most drug stores.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this product it does not smell bad like most things that contain sulfur.</li>
            <li> Anytime I showered, bathed or washed my face in it, my skin was totally clear, so I attributed that to the sulphur in the water and started looking for soap with sulphur in it.</li>
            <li> I started to use the soap and within four days all was clear.</li>
            <li> had scabies on my chest and underarms; the sulphur soap helped clear up the acne on my shoulders (killing two birds with one stone?)</li>
            <li> getting ready to order for the third time.</li>
            <li> and I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have suffered from adult acne for years and after some aggressive treatments of accutane and antibiotics, my acne is nearly gone.</li>
            <li> I did not notice any smell, but if there was it would far outweigh the benefits.</li>
            <li> daughter,16 month old granddaughter, 74</li>
            <li> yr old mother, my sister and myself.</li>
            <li> Frequent hand-washing dries my skin.</li>
            <li> and it keeps the flakes away and redness completely gone .</li>
            <li> Assuming I had an issue with some sort of mite, I tried this sulfur soap given sulfur is said to be a natural deterrent of this type of infection.</li>
            <li> Lathers VERY well, especially in hair</li>
            <li> no odor, I was surprised...</li>
            <li> Wish I kept the old bar.</li>
            <li> I eventually used both the cream and ivermectin and neither one made a difference for my problems that eventually developed as a result of using those soaps.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t completely close my hands.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found it nearly as drying as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I used this in conjunction with De La Cruz sulphur ointment and my skin has completely turned around.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;it doesn&#x27;t last more than a few hours...</li>
            <li> Yes sulfur smells and if you use a towel with it then the smell will stay in your towels and the smell faintly lingers the products works good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m slowly getting better.  </li>
            <li> Although it is not a full cure, unless you are a complete obsessive compulsive clean freak, It is a wonderful, NON-TOXIC remedy to help you fight off this annoying bug.</li>
            <li> but it left my skin super dry.</li>
            <li> Although there seems to be minimal to no odor while in use, it does leave my towel and shower with a strong rotten egg smell, so the extent where one can easily notice the smell when walking past the shower later the same day.</li>
            <li> EXACTLY like a wet cardboard box.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to live my life smelling like this unless it is absolutely necessary</li>
            <li> but it really works, i tried it for my legs since shaving can irritate my legs and make it dry and cracked .</li>
            <li> This Sulphur Soap - Premium 10% Sulfur Advanced Wash is making a difference on my son&#x27;s complexion after a few weeks of regular use.</li>
            <li> I did not have a major acne problem</li>
            <li> I did as other reviewers said and let it sit in hot water.</li>
            <li> It lathers up great and doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all.</li>
            <li> (I LIKE TO GO GET MY HAIR DONE, AND GENERALLY ARRIVE HAVING FORGOTTEN THE SOAP</li>
            <li> I have been using this twice daily as directed, for one week now, and my skin condition is almost entirely clear.  </li>
            <li> I did the same with the soap and also used it as a face wash, since permethrin can&#x27;t be used directly on your face.</li>
            <li> I just want to make everyone s aware this soap will turn your gold jewelry a dingy dark bronze color.</li>
            <li> Not offensive or overpowering, certainly not expected.</li>
            <li> my teen son, adult</li>
            <li> and I am impatient I want something to work right away</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive and doesn&#x27;t contain a bunch of chemicals like the other acne lines out there.</li>
            <li> For a soap this does not dry my skin either</li>
            <li> Does smell in bathroom a little after a hot or steamy shower.</li>
            <li> Not complaining as its expected of a product with such a high concentration of sulfur, just want to point out&lt;br</li>
            <li> Usually if I don&#x27;t moisturize right away my cheeks feel like they will crack, but when I use this I don&#x27;t have that problem.</li>
            <li> I read reviews on this, some good some bad, and decided to try it out.</li>
            <li> It leaves skin feeling squeaky clean but a little over dried.</li>
            <li> The smell is not great either, nothing overpowering I just didn&#x27;t feel clean.</li>
            <li> Not sure of scabies eradication yet but certainly soothes the itching.</li>
            <li> These did absolutely nothing for my acne!&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely waste of money!</li>
            <li> However, drug companies have DISCONTINUED these washes for no apparent reason.  </li>
            <li> Well milled so long lasting.</li>
            <li> The soap doesn&#x27;t last very long at all....</li>
            <li> this 10% sulfur soap with tea tree oil has stopped my occasional pimple and dry itchy skin.</li>
            <li> Completely cleanses skin from black heads.</li>
            <li> Felt relief almost immediately after first use, although the itching still persists even after a few weeks (typical post-scabies itch).</li>
            <li> It was very perfumed and could hardly smell the sulfur.</li>
            <li> I think I will have killed most of these little suckers by then and may not need the cream.  </li>
            <li> it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> A lot of things will not complete at check out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I started using the scabies soap when it came out not too long ago.  </li>
            <li> Yet it did not completely cure my skin of the infection or the reproduction of eggs.</li>
            <li> It takes too long for this product to become activated.</li>
            <li> Also, Amazon.com&#x27;s delivery time frame is also long.</li>
            <li> Yeah, that&#x27;s a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m dealing with the end of a long long battle with skin mites.</li>
            <li> I fell asleep almost immediately due to the massive relief from itching and &amp;#34;the</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would definitely buy other soap products from this company</li>
            <li> I use regular soap the other days.</li>
            <li> Skin was just really dry, had some peeling.</li>
            <li> and I turn the water in the shower off and cover my legs and arms, let it dry, and do it again.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t dry out my skin either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Used to combat dry skin and irritations.  </li>
            <li> It also does not leave my skin dry.</li>
            <li> I lather it on the affected area and let it dry.</li>
            <li> Wash all bedding and clothing and bag shoes or dry in dryer.</li>
            <li> I dont use a towel to dry my skin....</li>
            <li> EVERY TWO TO THREE DAYS, I HAVE NORMALIZED, THE DRY SKIN, CORRECTED THE CRACKED HEELS, AND</li>
            <li> Leaves a faint smell and has made certain areas of my body that are more heat prone feel warmer and thus the smell of something kinda burnt is on my skin faintly ( my shoulder blade area close to the armpit)</li>
            <li> We haven&#x27;t used it consistently though, as our teenager gets annoyed with the smell.  </li>
            <li> I have to say I have really noticed less flare ups since I started using this, have not seen the little pimples on my forehead anymore and less redness across my nose and cheeks.  </li>
            <li> I can get over that since my skin has been much less oily, itchy, and red</li>
            <li> You will only smell a little like farts.</li>
            <li> Great product, but the smell is horrible</li>
            <li> Merle Norman anti redness cream has also worked wonders and is a mostly unknown  anti rosacea lifesaver.</li>
            <li> I was about to visit a dermatologist for something that appeared similar rosacea which had been torturing me intermittenly for a few years.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t melt away with only a few uses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering from sebborhea dermatitis for 8 years now and I&#x27;ve tries everything nothing worked</li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL.</li>
            <li> Now I seriously doubt it was poisoned, but I had such a horrendous reaction that I&#x27;m keeping all my options open.</li>
            <li> Use a moisturizer for your hands after washing it will dry out your skin,if it gets too dry taper it off a few days then resume</li>
            <li> son showered and left the soap on his skin, he patted himself dry and he did not have any problems except for getting a little dried out here and there.</li>
            <li> And again, I&#x27;m not positive</li>
            <li> I ordered it in hopes of clearing up a sudden and unusual case of what seems to be pimples, as well as hair loss accompanied by tiny white granules at the base of my hair follicles.</li>
            <li> I returned it because I read that Sulfur is not good for sensitive skin, and it can cause redness.</li>
            <li> Did not work for my body acne but may work for other uses other than acne .</li>
            <li> so I have to shave every day/every other day.</li>
            <li> the sulphur soap has helped immensely with small skin colored bumps that i have been battling for years.</li>
            <li> Unlike any other sulfur soap that takes a while before you get that foam.</li>
            <li> this soap daily , lather on leave on 3 minutes,, I can say it worked , no more itch , bumps, or mites</li>
            <li> Other than that I like the soap.</li>
            <li> and we were being extremely careful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it tends to smell like sulfur all day other them</li>
            <li> the sulphur soap made a difference with my son and he still is using the other bar.  </li>
            <li> It works on dogs too for fleas and other causes of itching.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m talking sweet mother of God crazy itching.</li>
            <li> It does not have the heavy sulphur smell as some of other sulphur soaps do and it stops itchiness and dry patches.</li>
            <li> The smell is strong and bad.</li>
            <li> Even after I&#x27;ve dried off,  there is only a faint smell of sulfur, and only if you put your nose against your skin and inhale deeply.</li>
            <li> Besides two insect species, I&#x27;ve been infected with at least two mite species and ticks for the last 8 months.  </li>
            <li> My bouts with poison have taken as long as two weeks to clear, even with the expensive and overrated OTC cures.</li>
            <li> this wash was purchased for a friend with no insurance he tried all the over the counter with no success we looked&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
            <li> He has used this soap and their cream for about three months and although it is slow going he has a smaller nose</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t really smell it on yourself after showering, so I&#x27;m not sure if other reviewers got a bad batch or are just overly sensitive.</li>
            <li> The soap worked extremely well for a rash that I have chronically!</li>
            <li> AS I GET A BIT PAST 21, THE DRY SKIN HAS WORSENED, ESP ON MY FACE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sulphur smell not too bad- rinses out cleanly.</li>
            <li> IN LESS THAN A WEEK</li>
            <li> There was sulfur in the soap because it tarnished my silver ring slightly.</li>
            <li> have, just this week, rotated out this soap for another that is slightly less drying in the winter time and can report no worsening changes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> scabies mites are very, very active at night time for some reason.</li>
            <li> My skin was a mess</li>
            <li> maybe a little</li>
            <li> my confidence has went up a little</li>
            <li> I got a little rash on my face.</li>
            <li> Over all I felt it was  a little too drying  to justify</li>
            <li> Smells a bit, but not significantly</li>
            <li> but our condition was worse and we weren&#x27;t vigorous enough.</li>
            <li> Helped control and eliminate scabies in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> It dried out my breakouts and healed them faster while also helping with the redness.</li>
            <li> I try to avoid the infections associated with everyday cuts and scrapes.</li>
            <li> Waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> Repeat a few times a day, and leave it on over night.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t notice a difference after using it a few weeks.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s way too harsh for that.</li>
            <li> soap lasts awhile, so I&#x27;ve continued using it every few days just trying to use it up.  </li>
            <li> I also felt it left a slime behind.</li>
            <li> purchased for help with acne prone skin and actually made it a bit worse.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smells heavily of perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin has only gotten worse since using for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have a little bit of pus welts that develop on my arms but not much more than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; thing about this soap is that is too expensive IMO.</li>
            <li> Does not smell and foams just like ordinary soap.  </li>
            <li> But definitely not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Not a sexy scent...use it when you wont be around those who might be offended by the odor.</li>
            <li> It killed fleas we didn&#x27;t know they had!</li>
            <li> If sadly u ever get scabies, my family did from a relative who stayed the summer</li>
            <li> I know that it is not advertized as helping with eczema but sulfur can help a small percentage of people with it</li>
            <li> This soap solved all of our problems no more itching</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even hardly drive a vehicle.</li>
            <li> At least I know what to do if it ever re-occurs.</li>
            <li> At least to me.</li>
            <li> I play on using at least once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> I lather up and let it sit on my skin for at least 5 minutes before I rinse off.  </li>
            <li> but this sulfer soap is slowly giving me relief..</li>
            <li> Lather up a thick layer from head to toe..</li>
            <li> but with repeated use it is slowly dying out.  </li>
            <li> Voila, no more itch!  </li>
            <li> I had a small skin issue which this cleared up in no time!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it was that was causing these itchy bumps all over my body but needless to say this soap seemed to do the trick, within a day this soap soothed my skin and for each passing day there has been less itchy bumps, one thing I might add is that I also washed all my bedding and clothes</li>
            <li> and I am seeing serious results.</li>
            <li> This product is also a little expensive in addition to shipping and handling fees.</li>
            <li> It will make your shower room smell bad for a short while but the smell dissipates over about 20-30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> The only bad thing about it is the smell</li>
            <li> This stuff helps a ton but smells like sulfur (duh!)</li>
            <li> I have no idea what the science is behind this working so well on the ingrown hairs on my face.</li>
            <li> In the end, I would rather use other products that don&#x27;t smell so bad to cure my ailment.  </li>
            <li> It arrived a day early and did not smell horribly sulfurous at all.</li>
            <li> so ill try it  nad we will see</li>
            <li> for the people that say it is expensive, I am not getting where that is coming from?  </li>
            <li> Expensive?  </li>
            <li> I believe it is quite expensive.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get whiffs of sulfur/gunpowder randomly throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Also how is 5 dollars expensive?</li>
            <li> so - if you want your soap to smell bad and I mean, really really bad</li>
            <li> (i sometimes go longer) then rinse off in water as cold as you can stand it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does not over-dry my skin, nor leaves any unpleasant scent.</li>
            <li> It is impossible to find in the stores.  </li>
            <li> the smell isn&#x27;t bad at all</li>
            <li> the smell is not that bad</li>
            <li> the smell isn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li> Too bad that the prohibitive price is not inviting for the customer.  </li>
            <li> Stink to bad to keep using</li>
            <li> I have alopecia really bad and my scalp was irritated.</li>
            <li> and we didn&#x27;t think it smells bad.</li>
            <li> It does not smell as bad as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> I wanted so badly for this to work.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help with my acne :(</li>
            <li> I hate giving subpar reviews, but this stuff just isn&#x27;t doing anything for me.  </li>
            <li> At my house we have bad chiggers in the grass, and the soap works wonders on it!  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t smell too bad and works like a charm!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this soap.</li>
            <li> I am 18 and have suffered with terrible acne since 6th grade and have literally tried every face wash and seen every dermatologist in Houston.</li>
            <li> It does, however, smell terribly sulfurous.  </li>
            <li> I have had the worst outbreaks of poison ivy/oak sumac all of my life and have tried everything under the sun to cure it.</li>
            <li> That was horrible.</li>
            <li> TO APPEAR AT THE END OF THE DAY AND LOOK AWFUL.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Did not work for my body acne but may work for other uses other than acne .</li>
            <li> No change with this soap. Even got my  girlfriend to try and no improvement in skin. Will not be purchasing again. It was only used to control my acne. Skin was just really dry, had some peeling.</li>
            <li> The  wash that works for seborric dermatitis and rosacea is a combination of sodium sulfacetamide and sulfur. However, drug companies have DISCONTINUED these washes for no apparent reason.  Sulfur soaps are the only option available    This is the ONLY sulfur soap that works adequately. It keeps my Rosacea &amp; seborric dermatitis at bay and under control!     Merle Norman anti redness cream has also worked wonders and is a mostly unknown  anti rosacea lifesaver.</li>
            <li> Loads of suds and very helpful for my scalp psoriasis.</li>
            <li> I was diagnosed with scabies that I picked up at a Super 8 in Mont Belvieu, TX. I read reviews on this, some good some bad, and decided to try it out. It arrived a day early and did not smell horribly sulfurous at all. The only time I could pick up a hint of sulfur was when I was washing my face.&lt;br /&gt; When given permethrin cream for scabies, you are advised to cover your body head to toe in ointment, including under the nails and in your bellybutton. I did the same with the soap and also used it as a face wash, since permethrin can&#x27;t be used directly on your face. IN LESS THAN A WEEK I HAD 0 ACNE! I am 18 and have suffered with terrible acne since 6th grade and have literally tried every face wash and seen every dermatologist in Houston. This soap also cleared up my scabies rash and the itching. Give this soap a chance. I will continue to purchase for my entire life, even without scabies.</li>
            <li> This soap works really well and is good for your skin. It is impossible to find in the stores.  The price was a really good deal too. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Works great for scabies!</li>
            <li> Great for acne prone skin!!!</li>
            <li> Last a long time and its of great quality</li>
            <li> love this soap. I will order again.</li>
            <li> Love the soap, helps with all our medicinal needs.</li>
            <li> the soap works best with the sulfer butter and I would buy again...</li>
            <li> Was very happy to find a high quality sulfer soap like this.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Great product, but the smell is horrible</li>
            <li> This soap is gentle and drying.  For those who respond well to sulfur based products, it does what it claims to do.  However, you will need a good moisturizer when you are done washing your face/body.  I dislike the squeaky clean feeling but by the time I get out and use a serum, moisturizer and primer on my face, I&#x27;ve forgotten how clean it was when I left the shower.  It will make your shower room smell bad for a short while but the smell dissipates over about 20-30 minutes.  There is no odor on you as a result of using the product. If you need a sulfur based soap, this is as good as any I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Seems to help with acne that is red and inflamed.  It calms the acne in a way.  We haven&#x27;t used it consistently though, as our teenager gets annoyed with the smell.  I can&#x27;t smell it, but for the person whose face it is being applied to, they can smell the sulfur.  Can&#x27;t say if it would make acne completely go away until we use it more regularly..</li>
            <li> WORKS  JUST FOLLOW THE INFO BABY!!</li>
            <li> My son had tried everything and nothing worked until we got the bar. It was almost instant relief!! mazing is all i can say!!</li>
            <li> Great &amp;#34;Sulfer&amp;#34; soap.</li>
            <li> Expensive soap,but smell is great super easy to latter if you activate the active ingredient by soaking it in warm water for 10 second or so you can see it &amp;#34;activating&amp;#34;. Glad that I bought 2 at once. The only &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; thing about this soap is that is too expensive IMO.</li>
            <li> I love it ...it is the best</li>
            <li> Yes sulfur smells and if you use a towel with it then the smell will stay in your towels and the smell faintly lingers the products works good you just have to be consistent and I am impatient I want something to work right away</li>
            <li> Great soap, I think it has a nice smell, given it contains sulfur.  I got it for a skin condition, and so far it helps, I really like the way it lathers, and I soak it as per instructions, 20 seconds in warm water, I don&#x27;t think my condition was scabies, have yet to get a Dr. opinion.  If this clears up my condition, well worth the buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Update:  I have been using this twice daily as directed, for one week now, and my skin condition is almost entirely clear.  Now believe this was a scabies infestation, and this soap is clearing it, may skip the dermatologist appointment coming up. Highly, recommend. I can&#x27; say enough about his soap, it did save me a $200 trip to a dermatologist, because the rash has disappeared , I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> this 10% sulfur soap with tea tree oil has stopped my occasional pimple and dry itchy skin. it actually smells really good considering it is sulfur soap. it lasts a long time. it is a great price. getting ready to order for the third time.</li>
            <li> Sulphur smell not too bad- rinses out cleanly. Helped with dog&#x27;s itching almost immediately</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use this item long, thinking it would be good for my skin. The smell is stronger than what others would lead you to believe. Its a strong enough odor that even clothes after being washed several times still have a hint.</li>
            <li> It leaves skin feeling squeaky clean but a little over dried. Great disinfectant soap!</li>
            <li> Works really well for acne and folliculitis and where moisturizers can be obstructive to cure.  Does not smell and foams just like ordinary soap.  Use the container that it comes in to store the bar of soap when not in use.</li>
            <li> I love this soap,  smells great,  makes my skin feel soft and I use it for acne and it doesn&#x27;t break my face out.</li>
            <li> Whatever we had was immune to sulfur it seems? This product is probably good but it didn&#x27;t work for me...maybe a little but our condition was worse and we weren&#x27;t vigorous enough. This is still great. At least I know what to do if it ever re-occurs.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what is says. Works great. Doesn&#x27;t smell to strong. Does smell in bathroom a little after a hot or steamy shower. But definitely not overwhelming. Great product!</li>
            <li> Made my towels and shirts smell like sulfur. Can&#x27;t say it actually did anything for my complexion.</li>
            <li> My teenage son has some acne in his t-zone and this really seems to work drying it up and preventing new breakouts.  Also, does not irritate or make skin red.  He uses a moisturizing sunscreen and moisturizer at night to make sure his skin doesn&#x27;t get too dry.  Very inexpensive and doesn&#x27;t contain a bunch of chemicals like the other acne lines out there.</li>
            <li> This soap seems very good. It lathers up well. It cleans my skin well. It has almost no sulfur smell at all ( this is a good thing )&lt;br /&gt;Delivery to australia was Quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when buying stuff from amazon. A lot of things will not complete at check out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like this soap for example. Can not buy the 6 packet of soap. But can buy 1 bar x 6 at extra cost.&lt;br /&gt;or&lt;br /&gt;Other things you cant buy at all.  I can only think its a band product to australia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you:  Mark de Vos.</li>
            <li> Helps with my skin problems and not stinky in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I like the soap but it does not &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; the problem. It helps with the itching and keeps the problem from spreading.</li>
            <li> I like this soap, but it dries out my skin a good bit. I can&#x27;t use it too much.</li>
            <li> Not sure of scabies eradication yet but certainly soothes the itching. Doesn&#x27;t last.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure how this particular brand stacks up against others.&lt;br /&gt;One thing i don&#x27;t like is the drying out of my skin on face and scalp. Flakes of skin everywhere but that&#x27;s suphur.</li>
            <li> No problems, good bar of sulfur soap!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this soap.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s gentle, &amp; it makes my skin look lovely and very soft!  I did not have a major acne problem so, I cannot comment on whether or not it works for that but, the bar lasts a good long time.</li>
            <li> Excellent Soap...Smooth skin results</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who has eczema.  I only just received it so I can speak to it&#x27;s effectiveness just yet but I received it VERY quickly and it smells great!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin looks flawless, fresh and clear. I first noticed there was something about sulphur for the skin when I went up North to a cottage in Michigan and the running water had a strong sulphur smell. Anytime I showered, bathed or washed my face in it, my skin was totally clear, so I attributed that to the sulphur in the water and started looking for soap with sulphur in it. This is it. It does exactly what I want it to do. You have to soak it in warm water for 20 seconds first and it makes a nice, creamy lather. I love it. No other acne treatment(s) make my skin look so great and I have tried everything.</li>
            <li> It seems to have eased my symptoms somewhat....but I am still suffering.</li>
            <li> An easy on the skin sulphur soap.  I sometimes use this with a mild liquid cleanser especially in the winter.  It does not have the heavy sulphur smell as some of other sulphur soaps do and it stops itchiness and dry patches. I know that it is really sulphur as I can smell it on my towels when they come out of the dryer.  I can live with that asit is effective and mild. Good scrub soap for poison ivy and poison oak.  I mix it&#x27;s suds with original dawn right after exposure to the oil on poison ivy,oak or sumac.</li>
            <li> this product is heaven-sent it has cleared up my Acne I don&#x27;t use it every day just twice a week the smell isn&#x27;t bad at all I would say that after I shower and wash my face with this soap my eyes are burning for about 2 mins and I rinse really really well its just the soap I gave it 5 stars because it has changed my life my confidence has went up a little and I don&#x27;t have to cake make-up on to hide my flaws</li>
            <li> My husband has been doing the dermatologist route for years and has only controlled his rosacea.  He has used this soap and their cream for about three months and although it is slow going he has a smaller nose and his skin is more comfortable on his face.  He used the soap daily to start with and is now using about three times per week.  Do not think that leaving it on longer will do you more good....one time he left it on for maybe 15 minutes and he ended up with what looked like a burn on his cheeks.  It flaked off and was fine in about a week but he burned himself.&lt;br /&gt;  He loves the way his skin feels after using the soap, moist and conditioned.</li>
            <li> OMG... I haven&#x27;t had luck with permithrin or ivermectin or borax+h202 but this sulfer soap is slowly giving me relief.. i feel better within 15 seconds of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best way to use it... get in the shower as hot as you can stand it to open up pores and folicles.  Lather up a thick layer from head to toe.. let it sit for 5 minutes (i sometimes go longer) then rinse off in water as cold as you can stand it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time i did this I fell asleep almost immediately due to the massive relief from itching and &amp;#34;the crazies&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it doesn&#x27;t last more than a few hours... but with repeated use it is slowly dying out.  I love it.. love it... love it!</li>
            <li> My teenage son had a lot of pimples. He also had some mysterious bumps on his arms which led me to take him to a doctor. The doctor called it tinea-something. I had a different kind of strange bumps that hadn&#x27;t gone away with me trying several different lotions and ointments. I researched sulphur soap after the doctor recommended it and learned that it kills every kind of bacteria, fungus, and tiny critter that may get on your skin or in your skin. I garden a lot; who knows what it was. Anyways it cleared up most of the mysterious bumps on me, and half of the tinea-something on my son with the first bar of soap. Since it actually worked, I ordered more. My skin is clear and smooth and exfoliated; it looks 15 years younger. My teenage son&#x27;s mysterious arm bumps are almost gone, and his pimples are almost gone also. That is a bonus we were not expecting. I&#x27;m going to keep this soap around so that I always have some. From now on I&#x27;ll try it before anything else.</li>
            <li> Good product fast delivery!</li>
            <li> This soap works well.</li>
            <li> These did absolutely nothing for my acne!&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely waste of money!</li>
            <li> I love this soap. I use it every morning. I ONLY use it on my face. My facial hair grows quickly so I have to shave every day/every other day. Normally I&#x27;m left with bumps and ingrown hairs. Since using this soap I rarely have those issues. I use to have 5, 6, 7 ingrown hairs on my face every DAY and was constantly having to dig and pop them out. Now I may get 1 or 2 ingrown hairs a MONTH. I have no idea what the science is behind this working so well on the ingrown hairs on my face. I&#x27;m just happy it working.</li>
            <li> Helped control and eliminate scabies in a few weeks. I love how soft my skin feels after  I use it in every shower</li>
            <li> Great soap love it feels good. On skin and I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The soap works good and met my expectations.  I have been very happy with this product.  I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I started using the scabies soap when it came out not too long ago.  I read online that tea tree is good stuff, so I figured I would try it out.  I like it!  I use it often now.  At my house we have bad chiggers in the grass, and the soap works wonders on it!  I rub until the bar suds up and I turn the water in the shower off and cover my legs and arms, let it dry, and do it again.  By this time I have two layers of soap on my skin, then I wash it off.  Voila, no more itch!  Very impressed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this soap. My skin was a mess so I tried it and threw it out! A bar of oatmeal would of been a better choice. Diane Zosche</li>
            <li> I have only used this product for 2 weeks now but I can already see and feel results. I have suffered from adult acne for years and after some aggressive treatments of accutane and antibiotics, my acne is nearly gone. I still have the occasional break out and that&#x27;s where this stuff comes in handy. It dried out my breakouts and healed them faster while also helping with the redness. I also have seborrhic dermatitis and it has definitely helped with that too. My skin is not nearly as red and itchy anymore. I can&#x27;t say I enjoy the scent but if you have common sense you realize that sulfur has a distinct smell. I can get over that since my skin has been much less oily, itchy, and red and it&#x27;s much smoother. I&#x27;ll continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> The soap doesn&#x27;t last very long at all....The soap does smell great but its not worth the amount of money I paid for it....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for oily skin!</li>
            <li> Worked great for me...</li>
            <li> Great stuff, foams up beautifully, creamy with pleasant smell, leaves your skin NICE. Won&#x27;t cure a scabies outbreak but provides a distinct measure of relief. Will continue to use just for the benefits to my skin.</li>
            <li> Not quite sure if this really helped, the sulfur is strong and the smell stays on you all day as well as on the towel and clothes.</li>
            <li> While trying to sleep, I felt &amp;#34;invisible bugs&amp;#34; crawling on me for a couple weeks. Did research, sulfur can kill mites - if you have them. I used this soap paired with tea tree oil shampoo and the &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34; bug feeling went away. It all could&#x27;ve been in my head...but, thats a success in my eyes :p&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t have a very strong sulfur scent, if you are worried about it. You will only smell a little like farts. I wouldn&#x27;t go on a date after using it... But you can hang out at the house. The scent does last all day! It didn&#x27;t dry out my skin either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fart-Soap is actually quite refreshing..</li>
            <li> Pretty good, felt it made a difference, did not completely solve my problem though</li>
            <li> This is a nice soap - quite neutral in smell compared to others. It is non-drying but kills germs and probably critters as well. Being diabetic I try to avoid the infections associated with everyday cuts and scrapes. This works well and has no triclosan. Very good for washing up after gardening too!</li>
            <li> It is what I wanted . Although it was not packaged well . No damage to the bar it self , some damage to it&#x27;s wrapper .</li>
            <li> There was sulfur in the soap because it tarnished my silver ring slightly. It was very perfumed and could hardly smell the sulfur. I might try buying a stronger one. If your looking for a light sulfur soap that smells good then this one is for you.</li>
            <li> the sulphur soap has helped immensely with small skin colored bumps that i have been battling for years.I did not notice any smell, but if there was it would far outweigh the benefits.</li>
            <li> Bought because of a false scabies alarm and find it to be a very nice soap. We use every now and then for a change of pace.</li>
            <li> This product lasted awhile, had a clean and smell worked as described. I liked the product and would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Just bought this soap as a precautionary measure.  My dog got mange from the dog park *yuk!&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to be sure that I didn&#x27;t get it, seeing as how it is scabies that is transferable to humans!&lt;br /&gt;This soap smells nice and I haven&#x27;t seemed to catch anything from the dog! Use it once a day.&lt;br /&gt;Gives me a piece of mind.</li>
            <li> should work ive heard people talk about this and they say it does the trick so ill try it  nad we will see</li>
            <li> Very effective product</li>
            <li> I love this soap.. it really cleans your skin for your skin is the largest organ. so when you have any skin irritations it helps to relieve or remove it. for it helped with my sons acne . the smell is not that bad but it really works, i tried it for my legs since shaving can irritate my legs and make it dry and cracked . I was amazed that it helped resolve that issue for me so now my legs look amazing.</li>
            <li> I was about to visit a dermatologist for something that appeared similar rosacea which had been torturing me intermittenly for a few years. I used this soap ONCE and my skin was dramatically improved. And it of course improved more each time I used it. Having said that, I only use it once a day, in the evening, since I don&#x27;t want to overdo it and cause drying, etc. In the AM, I use a mild cleanser. I&#x27;m so happy I bought this and would recommend anyone to give it a try for the price. I&#x27;ve thrown away so much more money on products that cost much more and did nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the smell isn&#x27;t bad at all. I&#x27;m hyper smell-sensitive and this is a generic smell that doesn&#x27;t linger. It smells mildly metallic more than anything else, not at all like you dried your face with your butt towel.</li>
            <li> This Sulphur Soap - Premium 10% Sulfur Advanced Wash is making a difference on my son&#x27;s complexion after a few weeks of regular use. We heard about this soap from a friend of ours and decided to give it a try. It does a good job at cleansing and there isn&#x27;t any noticeable sulfur smell left on the skin after rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CFH</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful soap and I am glad that I found it on Amazon.  Will probably purchase more in the future and nice that it is made here in the USA.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a client of the dermatologist for years. This soap actually stops the breakout. Really love it. Try it everyone.</li>
            <li> This is a very mild soap that contains sulphur and is so good for the skin  Cleansing deodorizing and disinfecting without any harshness to sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have not finished using it yet</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it was that was causing these itchy bumps all over my body but needless to say this soap seemed to do the trick, within a day this soap soothed my skin and for each passing day there has been less itchy bumps, one thing I might add is that I also washed all my bedding and clothes just incase it was something else that was causing the rash.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this product it does not smell bad like most things that contain sulfur. I will certainly buy another one.&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I put it on after allowing 20secs of warm water to run on the soap, I put it all over my body head to toe, and let it dry on my body 10mins. instant relief, it just makes your body feels so clean, and it does well on my acne.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t smell too bad and works like a charm!</li>
            <li> Bought this soap to help with getting us rid of scabies. Unexpectedly also helped my acne, and smells great. Will continue to purchase this product for my acne in the future.</li>
            <li> Used to combat dry skin and irritations.  Works for me.  Recommend for use by my son who was&lt;br /&gt;instructed by a doctor to use this type soap.</li>
            <li> This soap has calmed the red flaky skin on the t-zone area of my face. It&#x27;s amazing. My skin has never looked so good!</li>
            <li> Thank you for providing this soap online as it is hard to find over the counter at most drug stores.</li>
            <li> Great for break outs ...but it DOES have a strong odor of sulfur which lingers. Not a sexy scent...use it when you wont be around those who might be offended by the odor.</li>
            <li> Bought the first one as a soap for the dogs.  It killed fleas we didn&#x27;t know they had! I liked the way it lathered while I was bathing the dogs, so I bought a bar for myself and for my daughter.  I even use it as a shampoo now and then.</li>
            <li> Besides two insect species, I&#x27;ve been infected with at least two mite species and ticks for the last 8 months.  I continue to use this sulphur soap in hopes that it&#x27;s working.  I&#x27;m slowly getting better.  But I don&#x27;t know if the soap is having any effect.</li>
            <li> I work in a nursing home and there has been an outbreak of scabies! So I went to the doctor because I caught it and they gave me the cream but I felt it wouldn&#x27;t be enough since I&#x27;m around it all day. So I read online sulfur soap helps and I went every where to try to find it but I had no luck. So I came on amazon and saw they had it so I ordered it and I received it last Thursday.  Since then I feel soooooo much better ..... I must say it works pretty fast! I use it 4 times a day twice in the morning and twice at night. I leave it on 3 minutes at a time and wash it off. It lathers up great and doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all. I feel like ordering this soap for all of my patients at work to help them out. Best soap ever!</li>
            <li> The Scabies Soap Does not help your Scabies only Permethin Cream Will Work.  Got it Twice and the cream is all that works....</li>
            <li> so - if you want your soap to smell bad and I mean, really really bad, this is the soap you need to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as for getting rid of acne...eh, can&#x27;t say.</li>
            <li> This soap lathers pretty quickly. Unlike any other sulfur soap that takes a while before you get that foam. The scent is mild and not too strong which I like. I&#x27;d probably order more to have it in stock in case I needed it.</li>
            <li> I am giving this four stars because it seems like good quality soap.  It lathers well and seems gentle and pure.  It does, however, smell terribly sulfurous.  Yes, I know you are thinking \\&quot;well what do you expect, it is sulfur soap\\&quot;.  Still there is no extra fragrance or anything to hide the smell.  On second thought, this is probably for the best since hiding it is probably not a viable option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this for acne, not scabies.  In the end, I would rather use other products that don&#x27;t smell so bad to cure my ailment.  I don&#x27;t want to live my life smelling like this unless it is absolutely necessary ;)  I would say that scabies falls into the absolutely necessary category.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy other soap products from this company</li>
            <li> i recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a scabies solution, this product is a 4/5 only because i am still recovering and not yet seen the full effect of the product yet. seems good so far!</li>
            <li> I do recommend this product but it will take times to free you from your itch. I am on the 3rd soap and there is progress.</li>
            <li> Recieved this product today. Have&#x27;nt used it yet but I just want to to let everyone know that when this seller seys fast that&#x27;s what the seller means. Thank you for being so quick.I&#x27;m sure I will have nothing but good things to say about this product when I use it.Thanks agin for job well done in shipping.</li>
            <li> This really did not work at all. Waste of money and time. You just have to bite the bullet and go to a Dr for a script.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use for Rosacea as I&#x27;ve read about the role of the demodex mite and that scabies treatments have helped others.  I have to say I have really noticed less flare ups since I started using this, have not seen the little pimples on my forehead anymore and less redness across my nose and cheeks.  I started using it on my keratosis pilaris on my arms and have noticed an improvement in that as well.&lt;br /&gt;There is no fragrance as someone described, the only ingredients are Sulfur, Safflower oil, Coconut oil, Palm oil, Sodium Hydroxide and Tea Tree Oil.  Nothing that would give a perfume like odor.  I really don&#x27;t notice much of a sulfur odor either.  For a soap this does not dry my skin either and I have very fair sensitive skin.  So far I am really happy to have stumbled across this product.&lt;br /&gt;As for the people that say it is expensive, I am not getting where that is coming from?  $11?  Expensive?  Really?  I&#x27;ve tried $60 products that did not work.</li>
            <li> I received this soap on time and in good condition. I used it on my dog for his incessant scratching and fur loss. After just one use his scratching and chewing has subsided. I will continue to use it and order it again as it has provided relief and he is much more comfortable. There hasn&#x27;t been enough time yet to know if his fur will grow back but without the constant scratching and chewing I suspect it will.</li>
            <li> Completely cleanses skin from black heads. Sulfur is drying however so I use vaseline as lotion afterwards, and skin looks great.</li>
            <li> Good product. Timely service.</li>
            <li> This was good, I think with continued use it might clear up my problem. I should buy more soon. Definitely.</li>
            <li> This soap makes you feel amazing after leaving the shower. I also use it on the little bit of hair I have on my head lol. Great for dermatitis to</li>
            <li> This soap is great for itchy dry skin.</li>
            <li> Great, fast delivery.  Great soap, smells like sulfur.  I bought it to get rid of acne on my face.  My face defiantly got dryer and better!</li>
            <li> I bought the soap because I have eczema and get breakouts mostly on my face. I have used the sulfur butter which worked great at clearing the eczema but it left my skin super dry. I&#x27;ve been using cetaphil soap and cetaphil cream for almost 2 decades now so I figured why not give this soap a try. I was amazed at how gentle it is. It does not sting or cause any discomfort when I use it. It also does not leave my skin dry. Usually if I don&#x27;t moisturize right away my cheeks feel like they will crack, but when I use this I don&#x27;t have that problem. One great benefit that I noticed too is it keeps the oil in my T-zone at bay. The soaps makes a silky smooth lather and has a pleasant smell. I will def order it again.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;;t do anything for my acne. I switched to a cleanser bar and my skin looks much better. Plus, this stuff makes you stink like a gunpowder all day, especially your hair.</li>
            <li> Sulfur Soap.  Seems to work well as a face or body soap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, it helps heal skin problems fairly well.  Like!  Works in abou 4 uses.  Would recommend this soap, and smells nice.</li>
            <li> Left a lot of residue in the tub &amp; shower. Used it only a couple if times &amp; threw it out</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and my skin feels better after using it.  There is no unpleasant odor and it doesn&#x27;t melt away with only a few uses.</li>
            <li> Shipped so fast! I blinked and it was in my mailbox. This stuff is great! I noticed a big difference immediately. After the first use my itching was diminished greatly. I will definitely be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> Thank you.  This helps my skin.</li>
            <li> wonderful soap, smells good and makes me not itchy after walking in our tall grass that has chiggers etc</li>
            <li> This cures poision ivy / oak/sumac. I have had the worst outbreaks of poison ivy/oak sumac all of my life and have tried everything under the sun to cure it. Nothing works like this soap! I lather it on the affected area and let it dry. Dont rinse. Repeat a few times a day, and leave it on over night. Amazing results in just one day!! My bouts with poison have taken as long as two weeks to clear, even with the expensive and overrated OTC cures. They dont work, but this sure does. A definate keeper.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I got scabies from work, I work with kids, and this soap plus sulfur ointment got rid of the problem fast.</li>
            <li> It seems to be all it was listed to be. I enjoy using this soap and do not mind a bit of sulphur scent at all.</li>
            <li> This helped control the spread of scabies and relieve the itching when my family and I were suspected of having them (treated with permethrin).  The only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I kind of smell like a campfire/fart after I wash with this.</li>
            <li> The smell is strong and bad. I didn&#x27;t care too much about that but, it didn&#x27;t do anything for my acne. I patch tested it just on my shoulder area where I had some body acne and I didn&#x27;t notice a difference after using it a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a non-toxic alternative for scabies, Having contracted the things from one of my family members. I received this soap in the mail and could not be happier with the product. I have never felt so clean! This soap, when used correctly, kills scabies and the tea tree oil sticks to your skin and penetrates burrows, making quick work of scabies eggs. It works, but you have to eliminate them from your environment in order the get rid of them for good. I recommend using this soap before going to bed. scabies mites are very, very active at night time for some reason. Although it is not a full cure, unless you are a complete obsessive compulsive clean freak, It is a wonderful, NON-TOXIC remedy to help you fight off this annoying bug.</li>
            <li> Really great product. Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Amazing immediate results from the initial first week of usage.  Sulfur smell stays on you all day but it&#x27;s better than having red blemishes from demodex mites.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to most soaps. This works perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Great for acne, scabies mites, etc. great product :)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use the soap-  I returned it because I read that Sulfur is not good for sensitive skin, and it can cause redness.</li>
            <li> The Soap Is The Best ,It Dries Out The Skin But It Cleans So Good ,I Will Buy Again .</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help with my acne :(</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! It really helped with my family&#x27;s problem. I would definatly recommend this as well as the sulpher butter for anyone who has been plagued by scabies!</li>
            <li> Purchased for doggie skin condition, works very well.</li>
            <li> If sadly u ever get scabies, my family did from a relative who stayed the summer, u need the rx cream to kill the mite , but this was a must helped relieve the itch and it does work to kill the mite,2 treatments of rx cream I still had them,,use this soap daily , lather on leave on 3 minutes,, I can say it worked , no more itch , bumps, or mites I still use it ,, few times week, great on acne too, no side effects like the permethrin cream, all natural,</li>
            <li> It worked well on my however I believe it is quite expensive.  Too bad that the prohibitive price is not inviting for the customer.  However, there is no question the item is good and works.</li>
            <li> Stink to bad to keep using</li>
            <li> Amazing, started clearing up Acne that very night, dried them up fast too.</li>
            <li> love this stuff.  Smells a little medicinal, but it works great for any adjunct treatment for athlete&#x27;s foot, scabies, mild bacterial dermatitis.</li>
            <li> I just want to make everyone s aware this soap will turn your gold jewelry a dingy dark bronze color. Remove your gold jewelry before use! Other than that I like the soap. I have alopecia really bad and my scalp was irritated. This seems to have gotten rid of the burning and itch. It&#x27;s not a cure for what I have but thought I&#x27;d give it a whirl. Now I have to find a way to restore the luster in my 14k Gold chain?</li>
            <li> 5 stars because it works after using it daily for a month ... downside ... you walk around smelling like a big egg fart and warning do not wash your wash cloths in with your clothes otherwise it makes your laundry smell like rotten farts, even my cats wouldnt come near me :p lol</li>
            <li> I have a really good sense of smell, like I always smell things people can&#x27;t. I can put to rest any question in your mind about what the soap smells like. EXACTLY like a wet cardboard box. At least to me. Not offensive or overpowering, certainly not expected. There&#x27;s no residual odor on your skin after you use it. It seems to clean well and I used it on my stinky, greasy dog and it helped a lot with his odor. Took a star off because I used it on my own skin several days in a row and it&#x27;s way too harsh for that. I got a little rash on my face. Probably my fault, will cut back to twice a week.</li>
            <li> Worked just like I needed it to thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> A great product. ..will buy again asap..It feels great on the skin and a very nice lather.I play on using at least once or twice a week. It gets the body clean.</li>
            <li> Most of our family was infested- my teen son, adult daughter,16 month old granddaughter, 74 yr old mother, my sister and myself. My husband never got them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our Dr wrote prescriptions for Permethrin cream for all of us, with 3 refills on each one. We went thru ALL the tubes of cream, the Permethrin cream cured my mother and my granddaughter, but not my daughter, me or my son.  I even used it every 3 days but it did not work. We were doing all the cleaning and laundering necessary with each treatment with the cream as well and we were being extremely careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son and I tried various home remedies, Tea Tree oil, Clove oil, borax and hydrogen peroxide baths, etc. My sister managed to get cured by using undiluted Neem oil on the bites and burrows and used Theraneem lotion over her whole body twice a day for 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After some research I decided to try this sulfur soap. I let the bar soak in some warm water for about 30 seconds to get a good creamy lather, then lathered up in the shower and rinsed off. We actually like the smell and we didn&#x27;t think it smells bad. I love the creamy lather!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son showered and left the soap on his skin, he patted himself dry and he did not have any problems except for getting a little dried out here and there. He was able to cure himself with this soap within 2-3 weeks of daily use.</li>
            <li> The Braunfels sulfur soap quickly relieved my skin of itching on the first time use. Yet it did not completely cure my skin of the infection or the reproduction of eggs. In my opinion 75% of my skin is cured, yet the twenty five percent left itches severely from time to time. Frequent hand-washing dries my skin. It takes too long for this product to become activated.This product is also a little expensive in addition to shipping and handling fees. Also, Amazon.com&#x27;s delivery time frame is also long.</li>
            <li> Amazing!!! I&#x27;ve been suffering from sebborhea dermatitis for 8 years now and I&#x27;ve tries everything nothing worked I wash my face once a day with this and it keeps the flakes away and redness completely gone . The only bad thing about it is the smell I have beard  and it tends to smell like sulfur all day other them that&#x27;s it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> It does it&#x27;s job as a soap but it hasn&#x27;t really helped with my acne and it didn&#x27;t help with my eczema either.  I know that it is not advertized as helping with eczema but sulfur can help a small percentage of people with it and I was hoping it would help me with mine.  Over all I felt it was  a little too drying  to justify it&#x27;s continued use.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a great soap. I ordered it in hopes of clearing up a sudden and unusual case of what seems to be pimples, as well as hair loss accompanied by tiny white granules at the base of my hair follicles. Assuming I had an issue with some sort of mite, I tried this sulfur soap given sulfur is said to be a natural deterrent of this type of infection. After two weeks of use, lathering up head to toe and leaving on for ~10 minutes per day before rinsing, I still have all issues noted above, but at a lower severity, which is definitely a plus. I plan on purchase more bar for continued use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Great in terms of basic soap&lt;br /&gt;- Lathers VERY well, especially in hair&lt;br /&gt;- Ships in a plastic container with lid, which comes in handy with preparation before use (must be soaked in warm water prior to use to &amp;#34;Activate&amp;#34; sulfur per directions)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Although there seems to be minimal to no odor while in use, it does leave my towel and shower with a strong rotten egg smell, so the extent where one can easily notice the smell when walking past the shower later the same day. Not complaining as its expected of a product with such a high concentration of sulfur, just want to point out&lt;br /&gt;- Leaves your skin smelling like you run a firework stand for a living. You&#x27;ll get whiffs of sulfur/gunpowder randomly throughout the day. I don&#x27;t mind the smell of fireworks, but may bother some. Definitely does not leave the rotten egg smell on your person like it does in the bathroom</li>
            <li> Did the job i am freeeeeeee</li>
            <li> Excellent soap! It does not over-dry my skin, nor leaves any unpleasant scent. I am vested!</li>
            <li> This works great...no odor, I was surprised...definitately will keep buying.</li>
            <li> I think its working. I&#x27;ve used it straight for couple months now and I&#x27;m pretty clear. Thank you Sulfur Soap</li>
            <li> the sulphur soap made a difference with my son and he still is using the other bar.  his acne is decreasing.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff to combat scabies, however the scabies were gone relatively quickly after using a tube of permethrin and washing all sheets, bedspreads and clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap lasts awhile, so I&#x27;ve continued using it every few days just trying to use it up.  It works great and leaves me feeling cleaner than any other soap I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really smell sulfur at all, which you really should at 10%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells heavily of perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin has only gotten worse since using for 2 weeks. Avoid this.</li>
            <li> I started to use the soap and within four days all was clear. Worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom Davis&lt;br /&gt;North Carolina</li>
            <li> Excellent soap. Sulphur soap used about once a week seems to keep my sensitive face free of irritants. The odor seems negligible in that it&#x27;s hardly present. Well milled so long lasting.</li>
            <li> I use as a body cleanser once a week. I use regular soap the other days. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> I liked reading all the reviews and bought some straight from Braunsfels Labs. They do international orders. They sell in bulk.  It works on dogs too for fleas and other causes of itching.  They&#x27;re MUCH HAPPIER when not itching, scratching, biting . (misery)    I plan on getting more when I run out.      www.sulfursoap.com</li>
            <li> Works well. I have oily skin and this takes care of it perfectly!</li>
            <li> works very well and doesn&#x27;t smell</li>
            <li> Great! Very Happy, Very Pleased, Good Luck, and God Bless, Peter and Family, USA.</li>
            <li> This purchase was just as promised.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Excellent for fighting mites, thank you!!</li>
            <li> Great soap as always! I&#x27;ve been using this company&#x27;s soap for a while now. Nothing works this good at clearing up my skin, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot, including other brands of sulphur soap. Do yourself a favor and buy it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to say that their customer service is so good if this company for some reason ever collapsed, they could start doing seminars on customer service. That&#x27;s how wonderful this company is to deal with. My soap arrives on time, smells great, is affordable, and does what it claims. They won me over 100%.</li>
            <li> All I know is after I used this product my skin has been absolutely horrendous. I thought somebody might have poisoned the soap because I have an Arabic sounding last name so I bought another bar to eventually send to somebody who could test it. Wish I kept the old bar. Now I seriously doubt it was poisoned, but I had such a horrendous reaction that I&#x27;m keeping all my options open. I will explain below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this soap because I was looking up cures for scabies on the internet. We thought somebody in the family might have had scabies and I became paranoid about bugs crawling on me, and my girlfriend wouldn&#x27;t pay for scabies cream from the doctor, so I began using this as a &amp;#34;protectant&amp;#34;. I would leave it on my skin in the shower for about 5 minutes before I washed it off. I think I used it 2 or 3 times. However, here is the catch. I also used lye soap one time after using the sulphur soap. I left it on my skin for a couple minutes before washing off. So I don&#x27;t know if the lye soap or sulphur soap or a combination of both caused my problems. Maybe there was a chemical reaction that created mustard gas lol. Her daughter didn&#x27;t have scabies. I eventually used both the cream and ivermectin and neither one made a difference for my problems that eventually developed as a result of using those soaps. She healed on her own. Anyways, onto my problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing that occurred was an intense itching. I&#x27;m talking sweet mother of God crazy itching. And a stinging almost like I was being stung by bees. That lasted a good 4 to 5 months. Yeah, that&#x27;s a long time. After about 3 to 4 months pus started showing up. Not just pus welts, which were a plenty, but my hands became so swollen I couldn&#x27;t even hardly drive a vehicle. And there were huge cracks in the creases in my hands. I couldn&#x27;t completely close my hands. That was horrible. I had 2 skin biopsies which said spongiotic dermatitis, which basically means blisters under the skin. Currently,I think I&#x27;m finally getting better. I have a little bit of pus welts that develop on my arms but not much more than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I will have permanent scars from the stuff I put on my skin. And again, I&#x27;m not positive this caused my skin reaction. But it could only be this or the lye soap that severely damaged my skin. If you do plan on using this soap, please for the love of God, don&#x27;t also use lye soap, even if the sulfur soap is washed off.  So if you&#x27;re freaking out about scabies and want to use this soap. BE CAREFUL. I would have much rather have had scabies than the pain those soaps caused.</li>
            <li> this wash was purchased for a friend with no insurance he tried all the over the counter with no success we looked&lt;br /&gt;on Amazon and found this product it works great solved the problem we would recommend it</li>
            <li> Great for scabies or acne..feels great on the skin. Use in conjunction with sulphur butter for acne or scabies. These 2 products are inexpensive and will heal your skin. Protocol for scabies Is lotion and soap 3 days in a row. Leave lotion on for 24 hrs each day if possible for greatest success. Take shower use sulphur or neem soap ( sulphur Is better) then apply sulphur butter from head to toe ( do every inch including hands,  feet, hesd and fingernails).  Wash all bedding and clothing and bag shoes or dry in dryer. Use pinesol, bleach or lysol to clean and you should be cured of scabies or close . If you have a persistent case then you may need in imervectin. You can get from doctor or buy durvet horse paste and measure on the dispenser dosage based on your weight. Tastes fine. Use imervectin one time or up to every 7 days for 4 weeks.  This should solve your scabies problem. If you need permethrin and don&#x27;t have a prescription then google maximpulse he has measurement guide to make it yourself that is equivalent or better  to what you would get from a doctor. Good luck .... you&#x27;ll get your life back ....this can be managed.</li>
            <li> The soap worked extremely well for a rash that I have chronically!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing soap if you suffer from oily skin and acne get this soap! Use a moisturizer for your hands after washing it will dry out your skin,if it gets too dry taper it off a few days then resume</li>
            <li> Your whole bathroom will reek of sulphur, but it really does work - in curing some skin conditions. I&#x27;m dealing with the end of a long long battle with skin mites. This soap has been what turned the tide and I am seeing serious results.</li>
            <li> no complaints with delivery or packaging and product performance. Definitely worth buying</li>
            <li> This soap solved all of our problems no more itching</li>
            <li> I hate giving subpar reviews, but this stuff just isn&#x27;t doing anything for me.  It wasn&#x27;t the miracle miticide or antifungal that it should have been for the price.  I haven&#x27;t found it nearly as drying as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> Nice smelling and gentle soap.  Excellent for acne or itchy skin.  Excellent for me as I am allergic to sulfur pills.</li>
            <li> This stuff helps a ton but smells like sulfur (duh!)</li>
            <li> So far so clean. I am impressed, with this product. I use another sulfer product so this is a double win for my skin. I will definitely be ordering more of this soap.</li>
            <li> I have hormonal acne and this seems to help a lot with it. I&#x27;ve read how sulphur helps combat against acne and I will certainly be using sulphur soap from here on out.</li>
            <li> It does not smell as bad as I thought it would. Even after I&#x27;ve dried off,  there is only a faint smell of sulfur, and only if you put your nose against your skin and inhale deeply. My skin is clearing up nicely.</li>
            <li> This product came as advertised, and on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have suffered with severe rosacea, since my very early 20s. Having seen many dermatologists, trying an ungodly amount of creams, tinctures, cleansers, sprays, soaps, masks, lotions, compounds...you name it, from prescription, to over-the-counter, to homeopathic, I&#x27;ve tried it. And all to no lasting avail!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across an article August of 2014 that cited sulfur as exceptionally helpful and calming when managing/healing rosacea ((which was news to me)). The research within the article piqued my curiosity enough, I thought it worth a try. So, I came to Amazon in search something that would be safe to use on my skin, inexpensive ((I&#x27;ve spent thousands)) and also contained sulfur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased to report that I have been using this soap daily, along with the Brunsfield labs face cream; having tremendous success since September 2014. My rosacea has calmed to the point my coworkers wanted to know what had changed. My family and friends have been impressed as well. And more than anything I am deeply grateful for something cost-effective and natural that has actually worked for more than a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is tolerable, though definitely noticible for the first 20 minutes after using the soap. It does dissipate within 30 minutes and if it didn&#x27;t dissapate, I&#x27;d still use it because it&#x27;s been THAT effective!&lt;br /&gt;I have, just this week, rotated out this soap for another that is slightly less drying in the winter time and can report no worsening changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I truly am grateful and wish more rosacea sufferers knew of this porduct.</li>
            <li> Worked great for bumps and other medical issues!!</li>
            <li> I use this bar soap to help with my acne.  It does of good job of deep cleaning your skin.  I use it in conjunction with De La Cruz sulfur ointment and proactive sulfur mask.  Just ordered it again and bought a 3-pack!</li>
            <li> Great item that worked like a dream, got rid of mites quickly with no unpleasant odor at all!  Used in conjunction with topical 10% sulfur ointment and mites were gone in 2-3 days - highly recommend and great value too.</li>
            <li> Used it to treat scabies. Felt relief almost immediately after first use, although the itching still persists even after a few weeks (typical post-scabies itch). For me, using it once per day (at night) was sufficient to keep itching manageable. I tried twice per day, but my skin was too sensitive and the sulphur soap caused more irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had scabies on my chest and underarms; the sulphur soap helped clear up the acne on my shoulders (killing two birds with one stone?) and I began using it on my face. Works great for acne and gives my skin a nice glow!</li>
            <li> Wish I would have bought more</li>
            <li> For the first time in YEARSSSSS  I don&#x27;t have acne on my face.  I used this in conjunction with De La Cruz sulphur ointment and my skin has completely turned around.  I am 35 and have been suffering with acne throughout my entire 30s.  I&#x27;m so happy I found this product!</li>
            <li> This may be my holy grail finally!!  I&#x27;ve been dealing with demodex mites for 3 months ... but I was told I had perioral dermatitis by my derm.  I hadn&#x27;t found a perspriction that would work on these things, oral or topical.  This soap has improved my skin 50% in just 24 hours!!!  finally!  I was losing my mind trying to find something that would give me relief from itching and red, bumpy skin on my FACE and chest!  This is so wonderful and non-drying!  Hoping for 100% improvement after consistant use.  I highly recommend - Thank you Braunfels Labs!!</li>
            <li> Great Product! Very Fast &amp; Secure Shipping! Thanks!</li>
            <li> OK for dermal problems.</li>
            <li> Works fast at curing tinea versa and returning skin to normal shade.  After years of bathing with anti dandruff shampoos that only reduced the spread of discoloration on my skin, but never cured it... this soap worked in a couple weeks!  Smells better than other sulphur soaps too.</li>
            <li> Heard this helps with acne on the back and chest..Been using for 2 weeks now with nothing.</li>
            <li> Did not work&lt;br /&gt;Caused more problems</li>
            <li> Eh- I wanted so badly for this to work. I did as other reviewers said and let it sit in hot water. I just couldn&#x27;t get a great lather out of it. I also felt it left a slime behind. The smell is not great either, nothing overpowering I just didn&#x27;t feel clean. I also didn&#x27;t see any improvement of my dermatitis​, which is what I purchased it for.</li>
            <li> If you want to repel chiggers buy this soap.  I layed on the ground to fix my mower, and no chigger bites.  Also repels friends.  Kill two birds with one stone and buy this soap.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it was all from this soap, but I used this soap with Dr. CREAM and it worked !</li>
            <li> Great product, speedy delivery!!!! Nice package as well! A 5 star!</li>
            <li> This is not for dry skin but is excellent for those with oily problems.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended I wash with Sulphur soap which was easy to find on Amazon.  I will never stop using this!  It&#x27;s been 1 month and I haven&#x27;t have any breakouts.  Not even during my cycle!  It is somewhat drying but easily remedied with some castor oil or moisturizer.  I was worried about the smell but it&#x27;s really not bad.  Comes in a cup with a lid for storage.  I just fill the cup with water and let the soap soak per the directions then lather.  I will definitely be ordering again!</li>
            <li> ordered more already of this product</li>
            <li> I am a self diagnosed scabies suffer.  I rarely go to the doctor for anything.  I was told 2 years ago by a doc that my rash looked like scabies.  I didn&#x27;t believe it because steroid cream was helping.  Now I believe it, I have all the classic symptoms.  I have tried Allstop spray and gel for a week and it didn&#x27;t really do much.  I ordered this soap which came Friday (today is Sunday) and I feel soooo much better!!!!!  I showered once with it Friday, twice yesterday, and I haven&#x27;t showered with it yet today.  I lather up and let it sit on my skin for at least 5 minutes before I rinse off.  I dont use a towel to dry my skin....I just let my body air dry mostly.  I also ordered the Nix Dermal Cream which wont come for another week or so.  I think I will have killed most of these little suckers by then and may not need the cream.  I will probably use it for good measure.</li>
            <li> THIS IS GREAT SOAP. I HAVE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE NATURAL FLORA AND FAUNA THAT ARE A PART OF OUR NORMAL ENVIRONMENT, THAT SEEMS TO HAVE LITTLE EFFECT ON MOST OF US, DOES CAUSE DISTRESS TO OTHERS IN VARIOUS DEGREES. I HAVE MORE DRY SKIN THAN IS NORMAL, PROBS WITH CRACKED HEELS, AS I HAVE NOTED WITH MANY, AND DRY SCALP, BUT NOT DANDRUFF. AS I GET A BIT PAST 21, THE DRY SKIN HAS WORSENED, ESP ON MY FACE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BY USING THIS SULFER SOAP EVERY TWO TO THREE DAYS, I HAVE NORMALIZED, THE DRY SKIN, CORRECTED THE CRACKED HEELS, AND THE DRY SCALP IS MUCH BETTER. (I LIKE TO GO GET MY HAIR DONE, AND GENERALLY ARRIVE HAVING FORGOTTEN THE SOAP...I GUESS I NEED TO STORE A BAR IN THE CAR...AND THAT WOULD BE GONE ALSO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I USED TO SPEMD A MINT ON VARIOUS CREAMS PROMISING TO CURE MY HEELS, SOME WORKED PRETTY WELL, SOME A BIT, AND SOME NOT AT ALL. I STILL USED BURT&#x27;S BEES COCONUT FOOT RUB WHEN I WEAR SANDALS BECASUE I WANT NO FLAKES TO APPEAR AT THE END OF THE DAY AND LOOK AWFUL. THIS COMBINATION HAS WORKED 100% FOR ME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE RECOMMENDED THIS SOAP TO VARIOUS FRIENDS WITH SIMILAR PROBLEMS. THOSE THAT TOOK ME UP ARE RADIAT LOOKING AND GLAD THEY DID. THE OTHERS...WELL, YOU TELL THEM AND YOU SHOW THEM, AND IF THEY DO NOT CARE TO PUT FORTH THE EFFORT, THEN I ASSUME THE DRYNESS IS SOMETHINNG THEY LIKE TO COMPLAIN ABOUT, BUT NOT CONTROL OR CURE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD CONSIDER MY AMAZON COMPANION BUYERS TO BE JUST AS GOOD A GROUP OF FRIENDS AS THOSE I SEE ALL THE TIME...WE ARE SPENDING OUR MONEY AT THE SAME PLACE AND WANT TO MAKE WISE PURCHASES, SO IMPUT FROM OTHERS IS CONSIDERATE AND NELPFUL. BESIDES, I ALWAYS KICK MYSELF WHEN I DO NOT TAKE THE TIME TO READ REPORTS FROM OTHERS, WHO CLEARLY SAY SOMETHING IS NOT UP TO PAR, AND THEN I SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES! WHAT A DOLT I CAN FEEL LIKE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO READ UP, WRITE FOR US, AND BUY WISELY. THE BEST TO YOU. MERCY &amp; ME</li>
            <li> Been using this soap for about 4 days, and it is great. The smell isn&#x27;t even very strong to reek your whole bathroom like people are saying. Also how is 5 dollars expensive? The soap is fine how it is. Thank you</li>
            <li> I had scabies, it went away but I though why not use this? So I did, some of my acne on my body started to fade away and saw that my skin was getting better, but I started to itch and I noticed the scabies came back... the soap activated the scabies...</li>
            <li> Great soap.  Make sure to take off silver jewelry before using it or your jewelry will turn black.</li>
            <li> purchased for help with acne prone skin and actually made it a bit worse.</li>
            <li> I had a small skin issue which this cleared up in no time! But it is very drying so make sure you&#x27;re moisturizing after. Also sulphur (even better with tea tree oil) is great for combating body odor jfyi</li>
            <li> Super sulfury.  This is good stuff, and creates a ton of lather.  Smells a bit, but not significantly and you don&#x27;t really smell it on yourself after showering, so I&#x27;m not sure if other reviewers got a bad batch or are just overly sensitive.</li>
            <li> I really like this for me.. I got it for the dogs, but decided to try it on my acne.. over night my deep acne healed and my skin is soft and beautiful.. I am so happy I got this.. Looks like I need another bar for the dogs.</li>
            <li> Great for surface acne and a good oil free soap.  No moisturisers (That&#x27;s a good thing), great for the back and shoulders.  I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Helps in healing and treating acne and bites . Just use really hot water . Leaves a faint smell and has made certain areas of my body that are more heat prone feel warmer and thus the smell of something kinda burnt is on my skin faintly ( my shoulder blade area close to the armpit) this can be remedied but washing with regular soap or what not. Great price and product</li>
