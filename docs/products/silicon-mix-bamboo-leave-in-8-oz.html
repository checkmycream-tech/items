            <li>but it works better.</li>
            <li>Will def buy more</li>
            <li>fast delivery, great buy</li>
            <li>I use to use Kinky Girl Hair leave-in conditioner, but this is clearly better.  </li>
            <li>The Silicon Bamboo Leave-In smells better than the original Silicon Mix Leave-In.  </li>
            <li>smell was too strong for me</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s smooth and clean feeling, love this product.</li>
            <li>I have gone back to a relaxer and it works great on relaxed hair too.</li>
            <li>All the Silicon Mix leave-in are fantastic.</li>
            <li>Now, I rub the conditioner into my hair before I get in the water, and when I come out my hair is still silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>Smells really good, makes my hair really soft.</li>
            <li>The product leaves my hair soft and it smells good.</li>
            <li>I love the repairing conditioner from the same company and so I bought the leave in conditioner thinking that it would be just as good...</li>
            <li>This product consistently makes my hair smooth, shiny, and more manageable.  </li>
            <li>I originally got it where I get my hair cut.</li>
            <li>It is amazing how soft my hair feels when I use it.</li>
            <li>The scent is catching, but over all it made my hair soft when I used to LOC method.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried something new.</li>
            <li>So far I like the silicon products and planning to buy more.</li>
            <li>They worked well together, but i have not used this without the other to know if it will work just as good on its on.</li>
            <li>I have gray frizzy hair and between the kanechom  and silicon products I&#x27;m traveling in the right direction.</li>
            <li>I put this on first after my hair is washed.</li>
            <li>I originally got this when I was wearing my hair natural (biracial).</li>
            <li>If your have unmanageable hair, hair that is dry and hard to comb through, this is the perfect leave-in for you.</li>
            <li>She is of mixed descent and has very curly hair which tangles easily.  </li>
            <li>I don t really see why this product is getting so much attention.</li>
            <li>but i have used this on a processed curly pattern weave that became very unmanageable to deal with.  </li>
            <li>Do not use too much</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know hair type</li>
            <li>It softens and straightens  your hair well, but it does not provide much shine.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>But I may have used too much or something.</li>
            <li>Using a little of this product makes her hair very easy to manage and also protects it from the chlorine in the pool when swimming.  </li>
            <li>I also used the other Silicon Mix Leave-In conditioner and that one is even better for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I liked this product better than any other I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>My hair is so silky soft and NOT GREASY!!</li>
            <li>it seems to be very thick so a light coating of the hair will do just fine.</li>
            <li>I could buy this or any other cheap leave.</li>
            <li>It tends to leave my hair looking really greasy but at the same time it&#x27;s really sticky.  </li>
            <li>Does what&#x27;s it says and leaves hair very soft</li>
            <li>My hair was very soft after using this product</li>
            <li>like this product it made my hair very, very soft.</li>
            <li>This was my first bottle,  it works as well as the Deep Treatment Leave-in Pria De Silicon that I have been using.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s in this leave-in that seems to make it better than the ones in a drugstore</li>
            <li>Clean and taped down checked shipping.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and silky</li>
            <li>I have not used this on my natural hair</li>
            <li>I am natural with 3b/3 hair.  </li>
            <li>It made her hair feel so soft.</li>
            <li>It didnt make my hair soft or stronger, etc.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this as a second thought because my main purpose was to get the silicon mix hair treatment.  </li>
            <li>I live in Hawaii and am at the beach several times a week.</li>
            <li>Then I follow up with a natural oil, air dry and then flat iron.</li>

            <li> This is a must-have protection from harsh salt water.</li>
            <li> Before I bought this product, my hair would get dried out and stiff after swimming in the ocean.</li>
            <li> but I felt as though it kinda make my hair a bit stiff.</li>
            <li> The bottle is small but you don&#x27;t need a lot.</li>
            <li> A sales rep suggested that he try it and because my hair is very thick black hair he called me to come in to give it a test run.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not good...</li>
            <li> I would try it if you have weak hair.</li>

            <li> My hairdresser introduced me to this product. A sales rep suggested that he try it and because my hair is very thick black hair he called me to come in to give it a test run. It is amazing how soft my hair feels when I use it. I use it after a wash and use of a rinse out conditioner of the same brand. And to top it off, it smells so wonderful. I integrate it with jojoba oil and another leave in conditioner on wet hair and then twist. My hair is soft and silky</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  I have coarse, thick, dry hair. This leave-in conditioner makes it so soft and it smells wonderful.  I also used the other Silicon Mix Leave-In conditioner and that one is even better for my hair.  It gives my hair slip and softness.  The Silicon Bamboo Leave-In smells better than the original Silicon Mix Leave-In.  I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Does what&#x27;s it says and leaves hair very soft</li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended me this product. I am very happy with the conditioner and also with the service provided by Healthlink: very professional, great assistance and advantageous prices!</li>
            <li> The scent is catching, but over all it made my hair soft when I used to LOC method. The only time I used it was for the LOC method.</li>
            <li> This product is okay, but not as great as the reviews would lead one to believe. Not an excellent product.</li>
            <li> My hair was very soft after using this product</li>
            <li> i buy this product to use in my daughter&#x27;s hair.  She is of mixed descent and has very curly hair which tangles easily.  Using a little of this product makes her hair very easy to manage and also protects it from the chlorine in the pool when swimming.  It is quite inexpensive and does a brilliant job!!!</li>
            <li> I don t really see why this product is getting so much attention. I didn&#x27;t notice anything different with my hair. I am a 4c type hair. I could buy this or any other cheap leave. it&#x27;s not good...it&#x27;s nothing.</li>
            <li> have no idea if it works or not&lt;br /&gt;Actually only used it twice&lt;br /&gt;The smell was too strong for me&lt;br /&gt;It gave me a head ache</li>
            <li> I have not used this on my natural hair but i have used this on a processed curly pattern weave that became very unmanageable to deal with.  I used this as the leave in after conditioning with the silicon mix conditioner.  They worked well together, but i have not used this without the other to know if it will work just as good on its on.</li>
            <li> I use this product after shampooing  and while hair is still wet.  Do not use too much it seems to be very thick so a light coating of the hair will do just fine.</li>

            <li> I originally got this when I was wearing my hair natural (biracial). I have gone back to a relaxer and it works great on relaxed hair too. Good smell.

            <li> I use this on my kids hair, which is curly and unruly, and it&#x27;s amazing. The products smooths hair and leaves a great smell.</li>
            <li> great scent, very light</li>
            <li> I tried this on my mothers hair and she loved it. It made her hair feel so soft. I&#x27;m glad I tried something new. Great product!</li>
            <li> Ok! I tried this once and it left my hair heavy. It&#x27;s works good.  But I may have used too much or something. This product is good tho.</li>
            <li> my hair died of  thirst</li>
            <li> Silicon Mix Bamboo Leave-In is one of the best leave-in I tried in a long time. I have tried many!! All the Silicon Mix leave-in are fantastic. If your have unmanageable hair, hair that is dry and hard to comb through, this is the perfect leave-in for you. It makes the hair moisturized and adds strength to your hair. It helps when blow drying. I use the entire Silicon Mix Bamboo line. The shampoo,treatment,leave-in. Its one of the best from the Silicon Mix lines. I give the entire Silicon Mix Bamboo line out as xmas gifts. People luv it.</li>
            <li> I liked this product better than any other I have used in the past. Just a little goes a long way. Doesn&#x27;t leave hair oilly.</li>
            <li> Ok so I&#x27;ve been using the cantu shea butter leave-in conditioner for a while but I ran out recently. I was without a leave-in conditioner for a while and then I finally decided on this one. OMG I love this moisturizer!! My hair is so silky soft and NOT GREASY!! I can&#x27;t get enough of it. I like it much better than the cantu. The cantu leave it was alright it did it&#x27;s job but I felt as though it kinda make my hair a bit stiff. Anyway I so love this conditioner I just wish that I there was a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> So far I like the silicon products and planning to buy more. The bamboo added is a plus.  I have gray frizzy hair and between the kanechom  and silicon products I&#x27;m traveling in the right direction.</li>
            <li> I love the repairing conditioner from the same company and so I bought the leave in conditioner thinking that it would be just as good...all I can say is &amp;#34;eh&amp;#34;.  It tends to leave my hair looking really greasy but at the same time it&#x27;s really sticky.  I say don&#x27;t waste your money here, just buy the repairing conditioner.</li>
            <li> This leave-in conditioner did nothing for my hair.  So I stopped using it.  It didnt make my hair soft or stronger, etc.  There are better things on the market.</li>
            <li> I live in Hawaii and am at the beach several times a week. Before I bought this product, my hair would get dried out and stiff after swimming in the ocean. Now, I rub the conditioner into my hair before I get in the water, and when I come out my hair is still silky and smooth. This is a must-have protection from harsh salt water.</li>
            <li> Its not like a conditioner and smells great and makes my hair so SOFT and not so fly away!!  I will buy this product again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s in this leave-in that seems to make it better than the ones in a drugstore but it works better. We have 90+ degree days in the summer and it helps keep my hair manageable without the buildup.</li>
            <li> Great Product/Great Price!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a second thought because my main purpose was to get the silicon mix hair treatment.  Unlike the other, I am still using this.  This product consistently makes my hair smooth, shiny, and more manageable.  I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Best product for moisture and shine while still keeping hair lightweight. Will def buy more</li>
            <li> Smells great and it gives my hair a bit of texture.</li>
            <li> Need me a case of this hair crack just wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey</li>
            <li> fast delivery, great buy</li>
            <li> I use to use Kinky Girl Hair leave-in conditioner, but this is clearly better.  You will notice the differnce immediately.</li>
            <li> Great product, Ive been using it for 3 years and my hair loves it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product about three times now, and I have not seen any difference in the feel or moisture of my hair.</li>
