            <li>The plate works good</li>

            <li>Loved Loved Loved this product</li>
            <li>The Image plates work best with Konad special polish but can still be done with Insta-Dri from Sally Hansen.</li>

            <li>well it was nice in theory like someone said</li>
            <li>It came on time and was nicely packaged.</li>

            <li>I am glad I did because they had sold out of this one.  </li>
            <li>but this was one I would probably use most.</li>
            <li>I love this product, what a neat thing.  </li>
            <li>I love to keep a french manicure on my nails at all times, and this one is absolutely perfect for me.</li>
            <li>I love konad stamp art</li>
            <li>Makes perfect french manicures!</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve all tried it many times and it leaves blotchy results.  </li>
            <li>When I can get it figured out, I&#x27;ll be sure to update my rating. :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just starting out in the nail business and the price is great too!</li>
            <li>I love this nail art stamp image plate.</li>
            <li>Makes me believe this is not an authentic Konad plate.</li>
            <li>It will get better :)</li>
            <li>I do think they will work for some one else that has better placement skills then</li>
            <li>Need I say more?</li>
            <li>I love stamping and thought this would be an easy perfect way to achieve a french manicure.</li>
            <li>Love the image plate, I tried the plate when I received it in the mail and works fine on my nails.</li>
            <li>Waist of money I could do free hand and get better results.</li>
            <li>I thought these would work great, but so far no luck.</li>
            <li>The only good thing was that the vendor that I bought this from was really great in delivering the authentic product fast.</li>
            <li>Not as easy as it looks</li>
            <li>but once you get it it&#x27;s easy.</li>
            <li>I have seen the Youtube Konad video on using this stamp like 20 times before buying it, and I have to say that if you have X-ray eyes and can see where your stamp is depositing the nail polish then you should be fine.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to do french tips on my natural nails and very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Thanks!! :)</li>
            <li>I will enjoy doing my tips in all sorts of colors.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>None of the stencils seem to fit any of my fingers though.  </li>
            <li>and I just free hand</li>
            <li>This plate helps you achieve perfect half moon shape when stamping your nails With this you can do a quick and easy like-french manicure.</li>
            <li>Plate is easy to clean and handle.</li>
            <li>My skills at stamping french tips are not that great.</li>
            <li>Good product effort, I was excited in not having to go to a salon for French manicures, but I still can&#x27;t figure out on and Konad Nail Plate how to really make my nail look good and even when placing the stamp on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>just right and make sure they are applied evenly on the edge of the nail,</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t get discouraged if you can&#x27;t seem to get it perfect on the first tries of using it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll be faster for me to do it the long way lol.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy and it&#x27;s fun.</li>
            <li>it is fun and looks really super!  </li>
            <li>With this plate you can do the different color tips which is very popular right now.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a good price can&#x27;t pass it up.</li>
            <li>This plate works best with thick nail polishes.</li>
            <li>Finally even I can have a perfect french manicure!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always wanted a perfect french manicure and now I can totally DIY at home!!!</li>
            <li>I had to get this again, the first one I purchased was not konad and the edges were not clean and crisp or perfectly curved either.</li>
            <li>Konad original plates have more detail than the knock off brands, so when you stamp with them you get professional looking images on your nails.  </li>
            <li>it was so neat I had to get it it really works the way that it say I would recommended this product  very quick ship</li>
            <li>I am very glad that I purchased this item, because now I can look manicured in no time flat.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what i was looking for, to add to my collection!</li>
            <li>Always a clean and consistent stamping image</li>
            <li>With this plate and Konad polish, I can finally do my own French manicures at home!!  </li>
            <li>French manicures look nice using the plate once you have the managed your niche for applying.</li>
            <li>Use a tiny paint brush/brow brush in nail polish remover to clean up  over applications :)</li>
            <li>It took me some time to learn to position the image just right on the nail.  </li>
            <li>The plate is good and exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Different sizes to fit to nail, and easily appliable if you know how to work with Konad.     </li>
            <li>/&gt;The tips are a lot harder to apply then the other stamper designs, but practice makes perfect!</li>
            <li>The little icon ones I&#x27;m good at.</li>
            <li>I love the Konad plates, and I figured the french manicure plate would be a trusted staple in the collection.</li>
            <li>Love this plate for doing at home french tip manicures.</li>
            <li>One thing that bothered me: The plate did not have the blue protective film like most Konad plates.</li>
            <li>I plan to keep practicing because it really can work very well!</li>
            <li>This makes french manicures so easy and neat.</li>
            <li>It does make doing a french manicure easy with salon quality results.</li>
            <li>Design french tips are fairly easy for me</li>
            <li>and I have a huge Konad collection, but did not have this plate as I have seen mixed reviews.</li>
            <li>I paid $25 for the whole kit.  </li>
            <li>I got this really fast too.</li>
            <li>When I try to use the scraper, it pulls too much of the polish out.</li>
            <li>I love my other stampers,</li>
            <li>The colors and options with this one plate will expand your creativity to a whole new level.</li>
            <li>otherwise no complaints.. especially when the Shany 25pcs set with basically the same designs is much more..</li>
            <li>I mainly use the kit in between visits.  </li>
            <li>Frankly, if I do not have a whole lot of time, this plate gets professional results.</li>
            <li>The concept behind this is cool, I need to practice more.</li>
            <li>Im new at this nail stamping</li>
            <li>I ordered a second plate because I want a back-up in case the first one wears out.</li>
            <li>Because I do alot of french manicures on myself and Maybe this would be a little more quicker just stamping on there.</li>
            <li>They love coming over for girl&#x27;s night and looking like they stepped out of the salon with a fresh manicure for mere pennies and giggles.</li>
            <li>- I can&#x27;t actually imagine this working very well for someone with oval or pointier nails.</li>
            <li>and this plate made it so much easier to do a french mani!</li>
            <li>I thought that this plate would help so much by doing french tips anda lot faster than doing it yourself with a brush at home, but it takes a lot of patience and a lot of practice.</li>
            <li>my advice is to stick to professional salons or DIY with brushes.</li>
            <li>Thank you for such fast delivery.</li>
            <li>When I asked a beauty product sales person what she thought of my manicure, I learned that she though that it was professionally done.</li>
            <li>Works with any type of nail polish, and I suggest using an old hotel room key card, or old gift card/credit card as the scrapper-</li>
            <li>My problem with this image plate is that the polish dries quickly and it seems to me to waste the stamping polish.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I am doing something wrong, but all of my other Konad image plates work great.</li>
            <li>If you have the time to practise and get this right, you are going to save yourself a lot of frustration using the other French manicure kits.</li>
            <li>However, if you enjoy spending time on your nails, you will probably turn to this plate least of all.</li>
            <li>A lot of them want a &#x27;professional&#x27; looking french tip</li>
            <li>I have lost count of how many of these I have, I&#x27;m just addicted to all Nail Plates and polishes.</li>
            <li>It has more variety in sizes than a previous plate I was using, plus it seems like it&#x27;s etched a little deeper.  </li>
            <li>the scraper takes off too much polish from the middle and even with the special polish the strips are too thin to be opaque</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s approximately 2\\&quot; in diameter and the largest image on the plate has to be used twice for most big toes-it&#x27;s called practice.</li>
            <li>the full nail designs are a bit too small if you have long nails though...</li>

            <li> One thing that bothered me: The plate did not have the blue protective film like most Konad plates.</li>
            <li> I plan to keep practicing because it really can work very well!</li>
            <li> This makes french manicures so easy and neat.</li>
            <li> It does make doing a french manicure easy with salon quality results.</li>
            <li> Design french tips are fairly easy for me</li>
            <li> and I have a huge Konad collection, but did not have this plate as I have seen mixed reviews.</li>
            <li> I paid $25 for the whole kit.  </li>
            <li> I got this really fast too.</li>
            <li> When I try to use the scraper, it pulls too much of the polish out.</li>
            <li> I love my other stampers,</li>
            <li> The colors and options with this one plate will expand your creativity to a whole new level.</li>
            <li> otherwise no complaints.. especially when the Shany 25pcs set with basically the same designs is much more..</li>
            <li> I mainly use the kit in between visits.  </li>
            <li> Frankly, if I do not have a whole lot of time, this plate gets professional results.</li>
            <li> The concept behind this is cool, I need to practice more.</li>
            <li> Im new at this nail stamping</li>
            <li> I ordered a second plate because I want a back-up in case the first one wears out.</li>
            <li> Because I do alot of french manicures on myself and Maybe this would be a little more quicker just stamping on there.</li>
            <li> They love coming over for girl&#x27;s night and looking like they stepped out of the salon with a fresh manicure for mere pennies and giggles.</li>
            <li> - I can&#x27;t actually imagine this working very well for someone with oval or pointier nails.</li>
            <li> and this plate made it so much easier to do a french mani!</li>
            <li> I thought that this plate would help so much by doing french tips anda lot faster than doing it yourself with a brush at home, but it takes a lot of patience and a lot of practice.</li>
            <li> my advice is to stick to professional salons or DIY with brushes.</li>
            <li> Thank you for such fast delivery.</li>
            <li> When I asked a beauty product sales person what she thought of my manicure, I learned that she though that it was professionally done.</li>
            <li> Works with any type of nail polish, and I suggest using an old hotel room key card, or old gift card/credit card as the scrapper-</li>
            <li> My problem with this image plate is that the polish dries quickly and it seems to me to waste the stamping polish.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I am doing something wrong, but all of my other Konad image plates work great.</li>
            <li> If you have the time to practise and get this right, you are going to save yourself a lot of frustration using the other French manicure kits.</li>
            <li> However, if you enjoy spending time on your nails, you will probably turn to this plate least of all.</li>
            <li> A lot of them want a &#x27;professional&#x27; looking french tip</li>
            <li> I have lost count of how many of these I have, I&#x27;m just addicted to all Nail Plates and polishes.</li>
            <li> It has more variety in sizes than a previous plate I was using, plus it seems like it&#x27;s etched a little deeper.  </li>
            <li> the scraper takes off too much polish from the middle and even with the special polish the strips are too thin to be opaque</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s approximately 2\\&quot; in diameter and the largest image on the plate has to be used twice for most big toes-it&#x27;s called practice.</li>
            <li> the full nail designs are a bit too small if you have long nails though...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a hard time figuring out how to use this stamping plate, but I have hear by a lot of seasoned stampers that it takes a LOT of practice with this french tip image plate.</li>
            <li> they are either too long or too short and not doing the French manicure correctly.</li>
            <li> This plate is a must have for your basic french mani or if you feel a little wild and mix it up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess u could stamp twice to cover ur tip, but Konad has other french plates for longer nails</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve said in previous post for products similar I am not a professional nail tech.</li>
            <li> but I anticipated the image plate to be a little larger.</li>
            <li> i alsways end up missing or don&#x27;t get it alis&#x3D;gned properly.</li>
            <li> Its a bit harder to do this on my nails because my nail bed has a rainbow bend to it.</li>
            <li> but this tries my patients.</li>
            <li> It just makes small French nails</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to other people.</li>
            <li> and it is hard to align the strip in the proper place without tearing the strip.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this plate very often because it can be difficult to get things lined up correctly.</li>
            <li> and I like thick French nails,</li>
            <li> and so the images of the tip on the plate were thick enough for me, but I wonder if it works as well for someone with longer nails...</li>
            <li> I have never been let down by a konad plate</li>
            <li> It takes a little practice to get the tips lined up</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m a little underwhelmed.</li>
            <li> but once you get it down, it&#x27;s a breeze!</li>
            <li> TIPS: Remember to scrape away the excess polish firmly, and when picking up the image form the plate, do so in a rolling motion, as well as when you transfer the immage to your nail.</li>
            <li> I am still deciding if this item will do what it says or was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> also had some trouble with the image not transferring well to the stamper, but I was using an Essie polish, not the Konad polishes.</li>
            <li> doing the left hand wasn&#x27;t too bad but doing my right hand was a little difficult.  </li>
            <li> I have small nails.</li>
            <li> This template was hard to get all the color off in the correct shape.</li>
            <li> but this one is hard to use.  </li>
            <li> This is a poorly designed stamp that is a waste of time.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong though</li>
            <li> After experiencing all of the possibilities, a french manicure is almost boring... unless maybe you have a job interview coming up!</li>
            <li> I find it is a bit difficult to place the stamp on the nail with these design</li>
            <li> have the plate holder and the Konad Brand products and it makes me a bittt frustrated.</li>
            <li> Sorry!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m terrible at freehand</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I tried to used it in a french manicure, it didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Works great,.. the full nail designs are a bit too small if you have long nails though... otherwise no complaints.. especially when the Shany 25pcs set with basically the same designs is much more..</li>
            <li> Not as easy as it looks I&#x27;m using Konad polishes and it is hard to align the strip in the proper place without tearing the strip. Also one of the strips was not cut into the metal properly and it is crooked. Its the one for the thumb so I was kind of bummed.</li>
            <li> Cute nail stamp plate</li>
            <li> I recently bought a Konad Nail Stamping Kit at a mall.  I bought the basic kit that comes with 1 image plate, craper, stamper, and 1 nai polish.  I paid $25 for the whole kit.  Each additional plate was $7.  I decided to wait and check here.  I am glad I did because they had sold out of this one.  With this plate you can do the different color tips which is very popular right now.  If and that is a BIG if you know how to use the stamper properly, this will save you tons of visits to the nail salon.  It took me some time to learn to position the image just right on the nail.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong though, I still visit the nail salon for my manicures and pedicures.  I mainly use the kit in between visits.  It has saved me a lot of $.</li>
            <li> I must say that this plate is a must have for your Konad collection.  The colors and options with this one plate will expand your creativity to a whole new level.</li>
            <li> Easiest way to do a french manicure without the hassel of french manicure guides. Different sizes to fit to nail, and easily appliable if you know how to work with Konad.     TIPS: Remember to scrape away the excess polish firmly, and when picking up the image form the plate, do so in a rolling motion, as well as when you transfer the immage to your nail.</li>
            <li> A Pain to use and unless you have the time, forget it.</li>
            <li> I love my Konad stamper set! This plate is a must have for your basic french mani or if you feel a little wild and mix it up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tips are a lot harder to apply then the other stamper designs, but practice makes perfect!</li>
            <li> Im new at this nail stamping but this was one I would probably use most. Because I do alot of french manicures on myself and Maybe this would be a little more quicker just stamping on there. It&#x27;s such a good price can&#x27;t pass it up.</li>
            <li> My sister, whom this was for, loves it! We saw it and got to test it at a livestock show and instantly set out to price them.</li>
            <li> With this plate and Konad polish, I can finally do my own French manicures at home!!  It&#x27;s easy and it&#x27;s fun.</li>
            <li> I love the Konad plates, and I figured the french manicure plate would be a trusted staple in the collection. It is! Frankly, if I do not have a whole lot of time, this plate gets professional results. However, if you enjoy spending time on your nails, you will probably turn to this plate least of all. After experiencing all of the possibilities, a french manicure is almost boring... unless maybe you have a job interview coming up!</li>
            <li> I have seen the Youtube Konad video on using this stamp like 20 times before buying it, and I have to say that if you have X-ray eyes and can see where your stamp is depositing the nail polish then you should be fine.  I have practiced applying the stamp for my nails thinking it would be faster than disolving excess on a brush but it didn&#x27;t work.  The color has to be stamped twice even if you managed somehow to get the stripe on correctly.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t work to well when the polish has microbubbles.  Sorry!! The only good thing was that the vendor that I bought this from was really great in delivering the authentic product fast.</li>
            <li> I love this product, what a neat thing.  Beats the heck out of spending all that money getting your nails done, plus,  it is fun and looks really super!  I am so happy with the way my order was taken care of.  I will definitely shop here again! THANK YOU!!!</li>
            <li> I had to get this again, the first one I purchased was not konad and the edges were not clean and crisp or perfectly curved either. So I decided to get the real Konad and the edges and shape are perfect. I will enjoy doing my tips in all sorts of colors. I got this really fast too. Thanks!! :)</li>
            <li> Love the image plate, I tried the plate when I received it in the mail and works fine on my nails. Very easy to do french tips on my natural nails and very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product. I love to keep a french manicure on my nails at all times, and this one is absolutely perfect for me. I keep my nails fairly short, and they are rectangular in shape - I can&#x27;t actually imagine this working very well for someone with oval or pointier nails. I am very glad that I purchased this item, because now I can look manicured in no time flat.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve said in previous post for products similar I am not a professional nail tech. I do my nails and friends as a hobby. They love coming over for girl&#x27;s night and looking like they stepped out of the salon with a fresh manicure for mere pennies and giggles. A lot of them want a &#x27;professional&#x27; looking french tip and this gives them the look they love!</li>
            <li> My problem with this image plate is that the polish dries quickly and it seems to me to waste the stamping polish.  None of the stencils seem to fit any of my fingers though.  they are either too long or too short and not doing the French manicure correctly. I am still deciding if this item will do what it says or was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have been using these disks for about 4 years and but this one I can&#x27;t get it to go on right.&lt;br /&gt;it is tricky to work with so I don&#x27;t use them and I just free hand my French manicures.</li>
            <li> It just makes small French nails and I like thick French nails, but I like Italy ways. It works well</li>
            <li> well it was nice in theory like someone said but it didnt quite work out. the scraper takes off too much polish from the middle and even with the special polish the strips are too thin to be opaque</li>
            <li> I love konad stamp art and this plate made it so much easier to do a french mani! It came on time and was nicely packaged.</li>
            <li> LOVE!  Makes perfect french manicures!</li>
            <li> Finally even I can have a perfect french manicure! I&#x27;m terrible at freehand and I have a huge Konad collection, but did not have this plate as I have seen mixed reviews. I think this plate works for my nails as they are medium length, for longer nails I guess u could stamp twice to cover ur tip, but Konad has other french plates for longer nails so Id just go with that if u can for longer nails. Also worked great for my daughters nails, she did it herself and she is only 9..anyone can do this its so easy!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve all tried it many times and it leaves blotchy results.  This is a poorly designed stamp that is a waste of time.</li>
            <li> I seen this when I was in flor it was so neat I had to get it it really works the way that it say I would recommended this product  very quick ship</li>
            <li> best #1 stamping nail plates!! just used them and omg could get it to work always turned out crooked but after a while it turned out perfect. Remember dont give up practice makes perfect</li>
            <li> Konad original plates have more detail than the knock off brands, so when you stamp with them you get professional looking images on your nails.  I&#x27;m just working on my nails at home, but the results are so nice!</li>
            <li> Good product effort, I was excited in not having to go to a salon for French manicures, but I still can&#x27;t figure out on and Konad Nail Plate how to really make my nail look good and even when placing the stamp on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the plate holder and the Konad Brand products and it makes me a bittt frustrated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a hard time figuring out how to use this stamping plate, but I have hear by a lot of seasoned stampers that it takes a LOT of practice with this french tip image plate. I purchased the konad white polish, and I think that has made working with this stamper easier. When I can get it figured out, I&#x27;ll be sure to update my rating. :)</li>
            <li> Waist of money I could do free hand and get better results.</li>
            <li> I thought these would work great, but so far no luck. When I try to use the scraper, it pulls too much of the polish out. Seems like the images weren&#x27;t cut in deep enough.  Maybe I am doing something wrong, but all of my other Konad image plates work great. I will keep trying though and see if I can figure it out.</li>
            <li> I love this product and I am very pleased with my purchase! It is exactly what i was looking for, to add to my collection!</li>
            <li> Loved Loved Loved this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still learnig how to use it but I really liked it. It requires a lot of practice but once you get it it&#x27;s easy. I contact the seller becouse I didn&#x27;t received my package but they sent me another one. I recommend the seller and the product!!!</li>
            <li> I thought that this plate would help so much by doing french tips anda lot faster than doing it yourself with a brush at home, but it takes a lot of patience and a lot of practice. i alsways end up missing or don&#x27;t get it alis&#x3D;gned properly. my advice is to stick to professional salons or DIY with brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a newbie using the stamping plates. The little icon ones I&#x27;m good at. I could not get this to work correctly at all. The plate is good and exactly what I expected. Practice makes perfect I guess.</li>
            <li> Nice product but I anticipated the image plate to be a little larger. It&#x27;s approximately 2\\&quot; in diameter and the largest image on the plate has to be used twice for most big toes-it&#x27;s called practice. French manicures look nice using the plate once you have the managed your niche for applying. Use a tiny paint brush/brow brush in nail polish remover to clean up  over applications :)</li>
            <li> If you love to have a &amp;#34;French Manicure&amp;#34;  you&#x27;re love this product, its easy to use and you can use it with any nail polish, any color!</li>
            <li> I love this image plate! Konad makes a great plate- that is really easy to use! Works with any type of nail polish, and I suggest using an old hotel room key card, or old gift card/credit card as the scrapper- it won&#x27;t scratch the metal.</li>
            <li> I ordered this on wednesday night and I got it on saturday morning super.fast shipping. The plate is perfect no scratched or anything the design comes out beautifully. I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I just love this product!!!!!!! Colors are beautiful!!!!! I&#x27;m just starting out in the nail business and the price is great too!</li>
            <li> The plate works good but I needed a lot of practice getting these tips on my nails.  doing the left hand wasn&#x27;t too bad but doing my right hand was a little difficult.  I don&#x27;t use this plate very often because it can be difficult to get things lined up correctly.</li>
            <li> I like this plate for doing the french tips. It has more variety in sizes than a previous plate I was using, plus it seems like it&#x27;s etched a little deeper.  I get great results.</li>
            <li> The concept behind this is cool, I need to practice more. I find it is a bit difficult to place the stamp on the nail with these design but over all it is a good product. I love my other stampers, just when it comes to french tip, I feel it&#x27;s easier to draw the line yourself.</li>
            <li> This makes french manicures so easy and neat. I would recommend this to other people. If you buy one Konad Stamp this would be it!</li>
            <li> The Image plates work best with Konad special polish but can still be done with Insta-Dri from Sally Hansen. Its a bit harder to do this on my nails because my nail bed has a rainbow bend to it. But I tried it on others who have flatter nail beds and it works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted a perfect french manicure and now I can totally DIY at home!!! I have shorter nails and so the images of the tip on the plate were thick enough for me, but I wonder if it works as well for someone with longer nails... I might grow my nails a bit longer one day and I hope it still fits.</li>
            <li> I love this nail art stamp image plate. Of course Konad puts the best of nail art stamping image products out there on the market. Always a clean and consistent stamping image</li>
            <li> This template was hard to get all the color off in the correct shape. I couldn&#x60;t get this one to work the way I wanted it to.</li>
            <li> Love this plate for doing at home french tip manicures. It takes a little practice to get the tips lined up just right and make sure they are applied evenly on the edge of the nail, but once you get it down, it&#x27;s a breeze!</li>
            <li> Thank you for such fast delivery. I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I cant ever get my manicure to line up. It&#x27;s always crooked. I&#x27;ve tried it on myself and others and i just cant get it to work for me. The designs do come out though. I guess I just wont be using it. It&#x27;ll be faster for me to do it the long way lol.</li>
            <li> This plate is as advertised, but the thickness of the image (the length between the end of the cuticle and the end of the nail) is a problem for me. What if I want to have longer tips? You can stamp multiple times to make up for it, but that introduces variance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also had some trouble with the image not transferring well to the stamper, but I was using an Essie polish, not the Konad polishes. I used to think this didn&#x27;t make a difference, but I recently got some Konad polishes for stamping and it&#x27;s a night-and-day difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it serves its purpose but I&#x27;m a little underwhelmed.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and is as described. This plate works best with thick nail polishes. I used a thinner nail polish and ended up doing three layers of the french tip on each nail. One thing that bothered me: The plate did not have the blue protective film like most Konad plates. Makes me believe this is not an authentic Konad plate. It&#x27;s a knock off, Ladies. However, it is a good plate.</li>
            <li> I have never been let down by a konad plate</li>
            <li> This works wonderful when you can get it lined up well! It does take a lot of practice. I did notice that the more I practiced the better I got! It does make doing a french manicure easy with salon quality results. I plan to keep practicing because it really can work very well! Just don&#x27;t get discouraged if you can&#x27;t seem to get it perfect on the first tries of using it. I will say it does take time! Just keep at it. It will get better :)</li>
            <li> This plate helps you achieve perfect half moon shape when stamping your nails With this you can do a quick and easy like-french manicure. Plate is easy to clean and handle.</li>
            <li> I have lost count of how many of these I have, I&#x27;m just addicted to all Nail Plates and polishes. You will be too!!</li>
            <li> I like the konad plates but this one is hard to use.  I think the spaces are just to big.  Maybe it&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> I have small nails. I wish there were smaller ones but this will do.</li>
            <li> This shipped as promised. It was in perfect condition. My skills at stamping french tips are not that great. I love stamping and thought this would be an easy perfect way to achieve a french manicure. I have yet to master this. Design french tips are fairly easy for me but this tries my patients. I do think they will work for some one else that has better placement skills then I. And I found scraping to the side worked best for me.</li>
            <li> If you have the time to practise and get this right, you are going to save yourself a lot of frustration using the other French manicure kits. This works the best. The best compliment is that no one says anything. When I asked a beauty product sales person what she thought of my manicure, I learned that she though that it was professionally done. Need I say more? I ordered a second plate because I want a back-up in case the first one wears out.</li>
