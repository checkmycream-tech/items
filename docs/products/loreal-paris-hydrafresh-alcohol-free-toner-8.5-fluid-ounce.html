            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s good...</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Paris HydraFresh Alcohol -free toner is the best I&#x27;ve found for my sensitive,dry</li>
            <li>This is a great one and feels really nice on my face.  </li>
            <li>my skin can tell the difference and NOT in the good way.  </li>
            <li>too.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this is a good toner for the price</li>
            <li>Even so, it was a good toner</li>
            <li>It does a good job of removing makeup.</li>
            <li>I think I like it, it smells good and leaves skin feeling hydrated.</li>
            <li>She said she loved drugstore cleansers and toners but always used Lancome moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>Does a good job of cleaning off makeup</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m very satisfied with the toner.</li>
            <li>I have tried MANY toners like Lancome&#x27;s Tonique Comfort which works great but burns my skin to Dickinson&#x27;s Witch Hazel which also stings &amp; dries my skin.</li>
            <li>Great for refreshing your face when you do not have water to wash it or at the beach to get the salt feeling off you face.</li>
            <li>Like most reviewers, I agree that the toner itself is great.  </li>
            <li>nice toner and good price.</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful and really freshens my face!  </li>
            <li>It smells lovely, does not burn or irritate my skin as it does not contain alcohol!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>my favorite toner!  </li>
            <li>and I absolutely love this!</li>
            <li>love my skin after using this product!</li>
            <li>I love it &amp; recommend it, esp considering the price!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for years and love it!  </li>
            <li>Anyways... I love this!  </li>
            <li>Great alcohol free astringent.  </li>
            <li>But the product itself I would give 4.5, just because it isn&#x27;t a miracle product on its own.</li>
            <li>There is glycerin, rose water, vitamin B5, and a beta hydroxy in it as well.  </li>
            <li>but this toner makes my face feel really nice.</li>
            <li>The keeps my skin looking bright and feeling smooth.  </li>
            <li>Amazon shipped this product very quickly, which make me very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for, at a great price.</li>
            <li>good stuff and quick delivery</li>
            <li>As for this product, I think it is very suitable for summer, fresh and non-greasy.</li>
            <li>So if you are looking for a good alternative to department store toners, try this one first!:)</li>
            <li>Let me elaborate:    </li>
            <li>It feels refreshing and keeps the skin supple and moist.</li>
            <li>Many toners irritate or burn my skin.  </li>
            <li>I use it mostly after a home microdermabrasion.  </li>
            <li>My all-time favorite toner.</li>
            <li>It is indeed refreshing every time I use it.</li>
            <li>I use this every day LOVE IT</li>
            <li>Well It&#x27;s okay for me.</li>
            <li>Feels refreshing going on but leaves a sticky residue</li>
            <li>This is my favorite toner.  </li>
            <li>I also love that it has Beta Hydroxy.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>This products better than Lancomd</li>
            <li>Glad to find it on Amazon, love shipping to my door.</li>
            <li>I usually love L&#x27;Oreal Paris products and I use them often.  </li>
            <li>Refreshing and not greasy.</li>
            <li>However, all in all, it is OK.</li>
            <li>Great price, however, as I&#x27;ve noticed L&#x27;Oreal on Amazon is much cheaper than in store.  </li>
            <li>I plan on using this MORE during the summer when I&#x27;m using heavier sunscreen to get that out of my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Turns out that the product is better than ever with hydroxys and almost no alcohol.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell and</li>
            <li>Love this product - have used for years,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this toner for many years.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this toner.  </li>
            <li>Just bought it for the 1st time and totally love it.</li>
            <li>Will keep buying this for sure :)</li>
            <li>Most toners have a cover under the lid, so the contents don&#x27;t just pour out, but not this one.</li>
            <li>And what makes this product is that its amazing on skin and alcohol free product.  </li>
            <li>being said, I love this product.</li>
            <li>great toner with very monimal alcohol.</li>
            <li>I mostly just wanted to talk about the bottle design.</li>
            <li>I love this toner i have purchased it before from Amazon</li>
            <li>Most women don&#x27;t realize toner is a must, after cleansing.</li>
            <li>This is a great replacement for one of those department store/beauty store brands at a much more reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Finding it on Amazon makes it even more cost-effective.</li>
            <li>I love Lâ€™Oreal products for the quality and the fact you can use them on all skin types.  </li>
            <li>This product feels so refreshing when I use it in the morning.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an ok toner.</li>
            <li>My daughter uses it too and she is pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ve been breaking out even more since I started using it</li>
            <li>The price was right, so I guess 3 stars is a good review.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feel so fresh and soft and it has a very light scent that is very pleasant will defiantly be buying this again!!</li>
            <li>Smell is nice and light, doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent of alcohol.</li>
            <li>Because the smell is strong and my skin isn&#x27;t very comfortable when I use it.</li>
            <li>bought first one from Walgreens, it&#x27;s good, just not so fragrant as the Pond&#x27;s one.</li>
            <li>Does a great job and is much more cost effective than similar products at the department stores.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this L&#x27;Oreal toner for years and love it - gentle and feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal even has a better, cleaner fragrance then the alcohol free Neutrogena.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light and has a lovely scent that lasts on the skin.  </li>
            <li>I love that it is alcohol free since i do have</li>
            <li>Good toner without having to spend much either.</li>
            <li>Good product, reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Good reasonably priced product.  </li>
            <li>But I digress, if you require a refresh during the day this toner is perfect, alcohol free (so won&#x27;t dry out your skin).</li>
            <li>but I feel like I&#x27;m pampering myself and looks super cute on my vanity:)  </li>
            <li>This toner keeps my skin feeling pretty good after I clean my face.  </li>
            <li>I clean my face until there isn&#x27;t any more make-up showing on any of the cotton pads, then apply my hydrating cream.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it strongly.</li>
            <li>This toner is OK, nothing special about it.  </li>
            <li>We now live in a very warm climate and my face gets oily, so when I awake in the morning I also clean again with this toner before the make-up.</li>
            <li>Good for gentle, allergic skin to clean pores.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll be fine .</li>
            <li>Paired with an aloe gel moisturizer, my skin has never been more consistent &amp; blemish free!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super effective at refreshing my skin and gently exfoliating.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This toner is gentle, has no irritarion, gives you a nice glow &amp; is cheap.</li>
            <li>plus it is alcohol free.</li>
            <li>Alcohol-free is really important.</li>
            <li>I was searching for toners to try that would be alcohol free and wouldn&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
            <li>It says alcohol free yet alcohol is listed in the ingredients.</li>
            <li>There was no drying of my skin which definitely made me happy.</li>
            <li>I was looking for alcohol free toner</li>
            <li>I have used this for years because it is alcohol free.</li>
            <li>I waited a bit and decided to see what drugstore brands were available that would be comparable.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t mind it, and it&#x27;s rather light.  </li>
            <li>This product makes my skin feel fabulous</li>
            <li>It very fresh and without alcohol.</li>
            <li>My skin feels clean and smooth after I apply it and add moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel very fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>B001E6OC44 Proactiv Solution Original Repairing Lotion 2 oz]]</li>
            <li>Nowhere near as good as something like LANCÃ”ME Tonique Toner which is my absolute favorite</li>
            <li>I mostly use this during the spring-summer season when it&#x27;s kinda hot because this one give me a refresh/cool feeling.</li>
            <li>I clean my face religously twice a day, but had no idea</li>
            <li>Clean Feel&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>I used to use a grainy scrub to exfoliate but find this not toner not only gentler, but more effective.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling moisturized and clean.</li>
            <li>You may no know it, but no matter what you use to clean your face, there is always some residue.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li>At night, I first wash with a mild soap and then  finish up with this to be sure my pores are clean.  </li>
            <li>This was a pretty good product to use, and it leaves a soft feel to the skin.  </li>
            <li>Most toners - even gentle ones have a lot of alcohol in them.</li>
            <li>I really like this product, so refreshing to use in the morning.</li>
            <li>I LOVE that it is so gentle.</li>
            <li>In my teen years, I toned my skin because I loved the cooling sensation.  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent toner for my sensitive, dry skin.</li>
            <li>Item as described, light on the skin, gives u a fresh feeling and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>I like all of L&#x27;Oreals products, so I was not disappointed on this Hydra Fresh Toner...</li>
            <li>Makes it feel fresh and clean</li>
            <li>It leaves the skin fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>PLUS I SUPER HYDRATE WITH WATER, AND LOTS OF VEGGIES.</li>
            <li>this toner is too mild, cant kill the bacteria inside the pore.</li>
            <li>Cleans so well and dries really quick.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so clean and fresh after using and it dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Overall, this toner is great for evening out my complexion and adding more moisture, and I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li>Both my daughter and I like it very much!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad for the price I&#x27;m paying for, even though I&#x27;m new to this beauty prodcut</li>
            <li>It is good cleaner for problem skin, but skin not to dry.</li>
            <li>And the trend I noticed the most was that those who used toner had glowing skin (I always ask what they use or notice the ones who glow always buy toner!)  and looked so much younger than their years.  </li>
            <li>But do not fear - the tingling really is just tingling, and it&#x27;s actually quite pleasant.</li>
            <li>It is refreshing, gentle with a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>how fresh it makes my face feel</li>
            <li>HydrFresh toner is moisturizing and makes my skin feel so fresh.</li>
            <li>But if not, it&#x27;s worth a try with this toner.</li>
            <li>My skin felt hydrated and fed water all over, and after letting it sit to be absorbed, moisturizer and night cream felt smoother</li>
            <li>I have used Hydra Fresh Toner for years.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected from a good toner.</li>
            <li>It just instantly brightens my whole face after I use this... and the best part is that it doesn&#x27;t dry out my face AT ALL!</li>
            <li>It cleanses the skin of old dry bits, and makes you look great.  </li>
            <li>TAKE VERY GOOD CARE OF MY SKIN, CLEANSE GENTLY, USE MY L&#x27;OREAL HYDRATING TONER, MOISTURIZE, (RETINOL, AND ALPHA HYDROX DAILY) AND HAVE REGULAR TREATMENTS , PHOTO FACIALS, MICRODERMS, AND CHEMICAL PEELS.</li>
            <li>This product is really works and make my skin more younger and smooth.</li>
            <li>The toner is good enough for about five dollars.&lt;br /&gt;However, there is a big flaw of the bottle - the opening of the rim is HUGE (which is about the size of the rim of a soda bottle).</li>
            <li>Good toner for those with average skin type.</li>
            <li>No annoying fragrance which I am very sensitive to.</li>
            <li>My sister and I like it very much.</li>
            <li>Very gentle and thorough.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It makes my skin feel very clean, but does not dry it out.</li>
            <li>Wish I would have checked the ingredients first.</li>
            <li>That made me pour out 1/5 of the liquid the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s alcohol free for those with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work!</li>
            <li>My first toner was this product and it BURNS the first time I tried it.  </li>
            <li>so tried this first time</li>
            <li>However, this was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It just makes skin much nicer!</li>
            <li>makes my skin smooth, and soft</li>
            <li>Not an exact substitute, but the closest thing I&#x27;ve found to replace the $27 brand.</li>
            <li>I am about halfway through my first bottle of this stuff</li>
            <li>received exactly what I wanted and ordered</li>
            <li>Many said it was not necessary, and then there was the camp that said you needed it.  </li>
            <li>When I first started working there</li>
            <li>Have skin feeling soft and refreshed, but it don&#x27;t really deep clean like most toners.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s on par with other products of its kind.</li>
            <li>A cotton \\&quot;round\\&quot; or \\&quot;square\\&quot; uses less product and will clean your face better.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it, clears dirt and oil and keeps your skin fresh and tones pores.</li>
            <li>Did it not happen to all the positive reviewers??</li>
            <li>gently removes any traces of makeup or cream left from cleansing, leaving my face feeling very clean and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Its okay to use as long as you follow up with a moisturiser.</li>
            <li>When I can&#x27;t find this in store I usually use Neutrogena, but it isn&#x27;t 1/2 as good as this one.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very mild, actually rather soothing.</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend it to everyone..</li>
            <li>I just recently bought this toner and it is just fine for me.</li>
            <li>Has not hurt my skin, which is pretty particular.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find this particular one in store but found it on trusty ol&#x27; Amazon!</li>
            <li>Although it said having no alcohol, but I kind of smell a little alcohol scent, yet it doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Leaves your skin fresh and completely clear, ready for moisturizing.</li>
            <li>My face feels so much cleaner and clearer now.</li>
            <li>I gave this 4 stars because I don&#x27;t really like the bottle design.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon introducing this product.</li>
            <li>This really helps if you are going sans makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It cleans your face, it leaves it soft and fresh and it is affordable.</li>
            <li>Without it she&#x27;s grumpy: absolutely loves its gentle toning strength (been using about 14-16 months)</li>
            <li>have used it for years with real satisfaction.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really have any impression of it.</li>
            <li>The purpose of this toner is to gently exfoliate via Beta Hydroxy acid, AKA Salicylic acid.</li>
            <li>HydraFresh Alcohol-Free Toner,VERY MUCH.</li>
            <li>But it didn&#x27;t really transform my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this toner for many years and it&#x27;s been getting more and more difficult to find in local stores.  </li>
            <li>I dont use it on my face ,instead i use it on my body, made my skin very soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gently removes any residue from mascara and makeup that didn&#x27;t come off in shower.</li>
            <li>It is gentle and it works!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Cleans and refreshes at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>However, I stopped doing so because there was so much conflicting expert opinions on toner isage.  </li>
            <li>Working part-time at a high-end makeup counter to help support my graduate studies has taught me so much.  </li>
            <li>and he said his face was smooth throughout work the following day.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff because it&#x27;s not harsh on my skin, but refreshes and moisturizes just enough in between day time activities when I need a boost.</li>
            <li>So far so good, but the scent is heavily grapefruit that annoys my nose.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even gentle enough to clean under my eyes to get the night gunk out from the corners.</li>
            <li>It removes that last traces of my make-up, leaving skin clean, toned and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>Get ready for a brand new skin, with this toner.</li>
            <li>This toner feels great on the face, and it really helps take off the rest of the face makeup that my cleanser fails to remove.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent way more money on toners that didn&#x27;t work nearly as well.  </li>
            <li>This is a classic standby.  </li>
            <li>The pink color is just so cute and the bottle is kinda old school</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and the toner is gentle.</li>
            <li>I used this product for years until they raised the price too high.  </li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I put this in a little spray bottle and carry it with me just for some touch up : )</li>
            <li>It makes it so easy to just hold a cotton pad (I use cotton pads, not balls) at the opening and quickly flip down and back up once or twice.</li>
            <li>Works like it says and gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Also found it useful for both sons who sometimes end up with a razor burn following shaving - It must help because there is no hesitation when I ask if they want to use it....</li>
            <li>It is very gentle and does not burn like other toners, it is worth trying.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and actually keeps my face looking &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; and healthy.</li>
            <li>If you expect something more complex, there should many other choices.</li>
            <li>I like how it has minimal alcohol in it, but still has 1%... which means there will be that fresh, tingly feeling!  </li>
            <li>I have used &#x27;Neutrogena Alcohol-Free Toner, 8.5 Ounce&#x27;  for years, and just wanted to get something new for a try.</li>
            <li>This and my Lancome face soap are the two products I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li>so I can try new things</li>
            <li>I switch from time to time if I see a new product on the market or feel like a change, but this is one of my favorites.  </li>
            <li>it still makes my skin rash and red after applying the product because actually it&#x27;s not 100% alcohol free.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>you have VERY sensitive skin, I&#x27;ll advise you to stay away from this.  </li>
            <li>If your eyes are very sensitive, then don&#x27;t use it there.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>In any case, I only felt the tingle the first couple of nights I used it.</li>
            <li>Too strong for my skin(combo, a little sensitive )</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see or feel a dramatic difference if I ever forget to use it for one night or day, but after a week without using any toner at all, I noticed that my skin was more oily and had a more uneven complexion.</li>
            <li>Never leaves my face dry or tight, but fresh and clean feeling.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling fresh and hydrated, leaving a great base for my moisturizer.</li>
            <li>post if neck bumps clear off.</li>
            <li>It also helps to refine the look of my skin, leaving it hydrated and clear.</li>
            <li>But u need to avoid using it around the eye area if you have sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>It works very well especially for those with oily skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>but now I can use a regular gentle cleaner (I use Cetaphil) and follow with this toner to get my Salicylic acid fix.</li>
            <li>Not recommend it for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Works very well, I have used for several years</li>
            <li>It smells just like it and leaves my skin soft and moisturized after using it.</li>
            <li>Gentle enough to use around eyes FOR ME, although it says not to use around eyes.  </li>
            <li>I had also tried the one from Olay (in the blue bottle), but that one irritated my skin and the fragrance was much stronger.  </li>
            <li>So, I wonder if they can give something like a small tube or pipe or whatever it called so that it won&#x27;t spill easily.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no odd smell</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for normal to dry skin types.</li>
            <li>but, for the first time in 10 years, I have not had a SINGLE ZIT IN A MONTH!</li>
            <li>I have been buying this for a long time my skin is very sensitive and at 63 yrs old I still break out !.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry your skin at all, and really feels like it is exfoliating your skin with the alptha hydroxy vitamins.</li>
            <li>It cost almost double at my local Walgreens but was on sale when I got it, which is actually the only reason I tried it in the first place!</li>
            <li>Also since the opening area is very wide, it is hard to use an appropriate small amount each time and easy to spill a lot all the time.</li>
            <li>Also, it is marked \\&quot;99% Alcohol-Free\\&quot; on the back of the bottle.</li>
            <li>For this product, i can only say it did not harm my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Products work differently on different skin types, so here are my specifics:&lt;br /&gt;25 years old</li>
            <li>I used to use Pond&#x27;s Toner before when I was in Asia as it&#x27;s not so expensive there and really effective on my skin.</li>
            <li>Maybe other people were looking for more of a small opening that you have to shake/squeeze the bottle to get product onto the cotton.   </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s hardly any scent (and the little scent there is smells clean and fresh), which is a definite plus.</li>
            <li>And I decided to order another one on Amazon as Amazon&#x27;s price is about $1 less than Walgreen or other stores, and I got it for free shipping as my order is over $25.</li>
            <li>The smell  is lovely too, plus I am sucker for the pink color.</li>
            <li>I like that it also does not dry it out.  </li>
            <li>no alcohol and does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>I use cotton squares, half of each side first, where you can see the residue coming off your face, and then second side of the pad where it remains white, so you know you&#x27;ve gotten it all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, once you used that super saver shipping method, it also mean you accept super slow order confirmation and delivering</li>
            <li>Large flocculent precipitate appeared at the bottom of the bottle after a few month of using.</li>
            <li>, it still burn a little bit, but my skin really felt refresh afterward.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s good...</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Paris HydraFresh Alcohol -free toner is the best I&#x27;ve found for my sensitive,dry</li>
            <li> This is a great one and feels really nice on my face.  </li>
            <li> my skin can tell the difference and NOT in the good way.  </li>
            <li> too.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this is a good toner for the price</li>
            <li> Even so, it was a good toner</li>
            <li> It does a good job of removing makeup.</li>
            <li> I think I like it, it smells good and leaves skin feeling hydrated.</li>
            <li> She said she loved drugstore cleansers and toners but always used Lancome moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> Does a good job of cleaning off makeup</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m very satisfied with the toner.</li>
            <li> I have tried MANY toners like Lancome&#x27;s Tonique Comfort which works great but burns my skin to Dickinson&#x27;s Witch Hazel which also stings &amp; dries my skin.</li>
            <li> Great for refreshing your face when you do not have water to wash it or at the beach to get the salt feeling off you face.</li>
            <li> Like most reviewers, I agree that the toner itself is great.  </li>
            <li> nice toner and good price.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and really freshens my face!  </li>
            <li> It smells lovely, does not burn or irritate my skin as it does not contain alcohol!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and love it!  </li>
            <li> Anyways... I love this!  </li>
            <li> Great alcohol free astringent.  </li>
            <li> But the product itself I would give 4.5, just because it isn&#x27;t a miracle product on its own.</li>
            <li> There is glycerin, rose water, vitamin B5, and a beta hydroxy in it as well.  </li>
            <li> but this toner makes my face feel really nice.</li>
            <li> The keeps my skin looking bright and feeling smooth.  </li>
            <li> Amazon shipped this product very quickly, which make me very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for, at a great price.</li>
            <li> good stuff and quick delivery</li>
            <li> As for this product, I think it is very suitable for summer, fresh and non-greasy.</li>
            <li> So if you are looking for a good alternative to department store toners, try this one first!:)</li>
            <li> Let me elaborate:    </li>
            <li> It feels refreshing and keeps the skin supple and moist.</li>
            <li> Many toners irritate or burn my skin.  </li>
            <li> I use it mostly after a home microdermabrasion.  </li>
            <li> My all-time favorite toner.</li>
            <li> It is indeed refreshing every time I use it.</li>
            <li> I use this every day LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Well It&#x27;s okay for me.</li>
            <li> Feels refreshing going on but leaves a sticky residue</li>
            <li> This is my favorite toner.  </li>
            <li> I also love that it has Beta Hydroxy.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> This products better than Lancomd</li>
            <li> Glad to find it on Amazon, love shipping to my door.</li>
            <li> I usually love L&#x27;Oreal Paris products and I use them often.  </li>
            <li> Refreshing and not greasy.</li>
            <li> However, all in all, it is OK.</li>
            <li> Great price, however, as I&#x27;ve noticed L&#x27;Oreal on Amazon is much cheaper than in store.  </li>
            <li> I plan on using this MORE during the summer when I&#x27;m using heavier sunscreen to get that out of my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Turns out that the product is better than ever with hydroxys and almost no alcohol.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell and</li>
            <li> Love this product - have used for years,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toner for many years.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this toner.  </li>
            <li> Just bought it for the 1st time and totally love it.</li>
            <li> Will keep buying this for sure :)</li>
            <li> Most toners have a cover under the lid, so the contents don&#x27;t just pour out, but not this one.</li>
            <li> And what makes this product is that its amazing on skin and alcohol free product.  </li>
            <li> being said, I love this product.</li>
            <li> great toner with very monimal alcohol.</li>
            <li> I mostly just wanted to talk about the bottle design.</li>
            <li> I love this toner i have purchased it before from Amazon</li>
            <li> Most women don&#x27;t realize toner is a must, after cleansing.</li>
            <li> This is a great replacement for one of those department store/beauty store brands at a much more reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Finding it on Amazon makes it even more cost-effective.</li>
            <li> I love Lâ€™Oreal products for the quality and the fact you can use them on all skin types.  </li>
            <li> This product feels so refreshing when I use it in the morning.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok toner.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses it too and she is pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve been breaking out even more since I started using it</li>
            <li> The price was right, so I guess 3 stars is a good review.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feel so fresh and soft and it has a very light scent that is very pleasant will defiantly be buying this again!!</li>
            <li> Smell is nice and light, doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent of alcohol.</li>
            <li> Because the smell is strong and my skin isn&#x27;t very comfortable when I use it.</li>
            <li> bought first one from Walgreens, it&#x27;s good, just not so fragrant as the Pond&#x27;s one.</li>
            <li> Does a great job and is much more cost effective than similar products at the department stores.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this L&#x27;Oreal toner for years and love it - gentle and feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal even has a better, cleaner fragrance then the alcohol free Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s light and has a lovely scent that lasts on the skin.  </li>
            <li> I love that it is alcohol free since i do have</li>
            <li> Good toner without having to spend much either.</li>
            <li> Good product, reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Good reasonably priced product.  </li>
            <li> But I digress, if you require a refresh during the day this toner is perfect, alcohol free (so won&#x27;t dry out your skin).</li>
            <li> but I feel like I&#x27;m pampering myself and looks super cute on my vanity:)  </li>
            <li> This toner keeps my skin feeling pretty good after I clean my face.  </li>
            <li> I clean my face until there isn&#x27;t any more make-up showing on any of the cotton pads, then apply my hydrating cream.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it strongly.</li>
            <li> This toner is OK, nothing special about it.  </li>
            <li> We now live in a very warm climate and my face gets oily, so when I awake in the morning I also clean again with this toner before the make-up.</li>
            <li> Good for gentle, allergic skin to clean pores.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll be fine .</li>
            <li> Paired with an aloe gel moisturizer, my skin has never been more consistent &amp; blemish free!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super effective at refreshing my skin and gently exfoliating.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This toner is gentle, has no irritarion, gives you a nice glow &amp; is cheap.</li>
            <li> plus it is alcohol free.</li>
            <li> Alcohol-free is really important.</li>
            <li> I was searching for toners to try that would be alcohol free and wouldn&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
            <li> It says alcohol free yet alcohol is listed in the ingredients.</li>
            <li> There was no drying of my skin which definitely made me happy.</li>
            <li> I was looking for alcohol free toner</li>
            <li> I have used this for years because it is alcohol free.</li>
            <li> I waited a bit and decided to see what drugstore brands were available that would be comparable.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t mind it, and it&#x27;s rather light.  </li>
            <li> This product makes my skin feel fabulous</li>
            <li> It very fresh and without alcohol.</li>
            <li> My skin feels clean and smooth after I apply it and add moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel very fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> B001E6OC44 Proactiv Solution Original Repairing Lotion 2 oz]]</li>
            <li> Nowhere near as good as something like LANCÃ”ME Tonique Toner which is my absolute favorite</li>
            <li> I mostly use this during the spring-summer season when it&#x27;s kinda hot because this one give me a refresh/cool feeling.</li>
            <li> I clean my face religously twice a day, but had no idea</li>
            <li> Clean Feel&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> I used to use a grainy scrub to exfoliate but find this not toner not only gentler, but more effective.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling moisturized and clean.</li>
            <li> You may no know it, but no matter what you use to clean your face, there is always some residue.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li> At night, I first wash with a mild soap and then  finish up with this to be sure my pores are clean.  </li>
            <li> This was a pretty good product to use, and it leaves a soft feel to the skin.  </li>
            <li> Most toners - even gentle ones have a lot of alcohol in them.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, so refreshing to use in the morning.</li>
            <li> I LOVE that it is so gentle.</li>
            <li> In my teen years, I toned my skin because I loved the cooling sensation.  </li>
            <li> This is an excellent toner for my sensitive, dry skin.</li>
            <li> Item as described, light on the skin, gives u a fresh feeling and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I like all of L&#x27;Oreals products, so I was not disappointed on this Hydra Fresh Toner...</li>
            <li> Makes it feel fresh and clean</li>
            <li> It leaves the skin fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> PLUS I SUPER HYDRATE WITH WATER, AND LOTS OF VEGGIES.</li>
            <li> this toner is too mild, cant kill the bacteria inside the pore.</li>
            <li> Cleans so well and dries really quick.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so clean and fresh after using and it dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Overall, this toner is great for evening out my complexion and adding more moisture, and I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> Both my daughter and I like it very much!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad for the price I&#x27;m paying for, even though I&#x27;m new to this beauty prodcut</li>
            <li> It is good cleaner for problem skin, but skin not to dry.</li>
            <li> And the trend I noticed the most was that those who used toner had glowing skin (I always ask what they use or notice the ones who glow always buy toner!)  and looked so much younger than their years.  </li>
            <li> But do not fear - the tingling really is just tingling, and it&#x27;s actually quite pleasant.</li>
            <li> It is refreshing, gentle with a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> how fresh it makes my face feel</li>
            <li> HydrFresh toner is moisturizing and makes my skin feel so fresh.</li>
            <li> But if not, it&#x27;s worth a try with this toner.</li>
            <li> My skin felt hydrated and fed water all over, and after letting it sit to be absorbed, moisturizer and night cream felt smoother</li>
            <li> I have used Hydra Fresh Toner for years.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected from a good toner.</li>
            <li> It just instantly brightens my whole face after I use this... and the best part is that it doesn&#x27;t dry out my face AT ALL!</li>
            <li> It cleanses the skin of old dry bits, and makes you look great.  </li>
            <li> TAKE VERY GOOD CARE OF MY SKIN, CLEANSE GENTLY, USE MY L&#x27;OREAL HYDRATING TONER, MOISTURIZE, (RETINOL, AND ALPHA HYDROX DAILY) AND HAVE REGULAR TREATMENTS , PHOTO FACIALS, MICRODERMS, AND CHEMICAL PEELS.</li>
            <li> This product is really works and make my skin more younger and smooth.</li>
            <li> The toner is good enough for about five dollars.&lt;br /&gt;However, there is a big flaw of the bottle - the opening of the rim is HUGE (which is about the size of the rim of a soda bottle).</li>
            <li> Good toner for those with average skin type.</li>
            <li> No annoying fragrance which I am very sensitive to.</li>
            <li> My sister and I like it very much.</li>
            <li> Very gentle and thorough.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It makes my skin feel very clean, but does not dry it out.</li>
            <li> Wish I would have checked the ingredients first.</li>
            <li> That made me pour out 1/5 of the liquid the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s alcohol free for those with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work!</li>
            <li> My first toner was this product and it BURNS the first time I tried it.  </li>
            <li> so tried this first time</li>
            <li> However, this was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It just makes skin much nicer!</li>
            <li> makes my skin smooth, and soft</li>
            <li> Not an exact substitute, but the closest thing I&#x27;ve found to replace the $27 brand.</li>
            <li> I am about halfway through my first bottle of this stuff</li>
            <li> received exactly what I wanted and ordered</li>
            <li> Many said it was not necessary, and then there was the camp that said you needed it.  </li>
            <li> When I first started working there</li>
            <li> Have skin feeling soft and refreshed, but it don&#x27;t really deep clean like most toners.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s on par with other products of its kind.</li>
            <li> A cotton \\&quot;round\\&quot; or \\&quot;square\\&quot; uses less product and will clean your face better.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it, clears dirt and oil and keeps your skin fresh and tones pores.</li>
            <li> Did it not happen to all the positive reviewers??</li>
            <li> gently removes any traces of makeup or cream left from cleansing, leaving my face feeling very clean and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Its okay to use as long as you follow up with a moisturiser.</li>
            <li> When I can&#x27;t find this in store I usually use Neutrogena, but it isn&#x27;t 1/2 as good as this one.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very mild, actually rather soothing.</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend it to everyone..</li>
            <li> I just recently bought this toner and it is just fine for me.</li>
            <li> Has not hurt my skin, which is pretty particular.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this particular one in store but found it on trusty ol&#x27; Amazon!</li>
            <li> Although it said having no alcohol, but I kind of smell a little alcohol scent, yet it doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Leaves your skin fresh and completely clear, ready for moisturizing.</li>
            <li> My face feels so much cleaner and clearer now.</li>
            <li> I gave this 4 stars because I don&#x27;t really like the bottle design.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon introducing this product.</li>
            <li> This really helps if you are going sans makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It cleans your face, it leaves it soft and fresh and it is affordable.</li>
            <li> Without it she&#x27;s grumpy: absolutely loves its gentle toning strength (been using about 14-16 months)</li>
            <li> have used it for years with real satisfaction.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really have any impression of it.</li>
            <li> The purpose of this toner is to gently exfoliate via Beta Hydroxy acid, AKA Salicylic acid.</li>
            <li> HydraFresh Alcohol-Free Toner,VERY MUCH.</li>
            <li> But it didn&#x27;t really transform my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toner for many years and it&#x27;s been getting more and more difficult to find in local stores.  </li>
            <li> I dont use it on my face ,instead i use it on my body, made my skin very soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gently removes any residue from mascara and makeup that didn&#x27;t come off in shower.</li>
            <li> It is gentle and it works!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Cleans and refreshes at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> However, I stopped doing so because there was so much conflicting expert opinions on toner isage.  </li>
            <li> Working part-time at a high-end makeup counter to help support my graduate studies has taught me so much.  </li>
            <li> and he said his face was smooth throughout work the following day.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff because it&#x27;s not harsh on my skin, but refreshes and moisturizes just enough in between day time activities when I need a boost.</li>
            <li> So far so good, but the scent is heavily grapefruit that annoys my nose.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even gentle enough to clean under my eyes to get the night gunk out from the corners.</li>
            <li> It removes that last traces of my make-up, leaving skin clean, toned and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> Get ready for a brand new skin, with this toner.</li>
            <li> This toner feels great on the face, and it really helps take off the rest of the face makeup that my cleanser fails to remove.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent way more money on toners that didn&#x27;t work nearly as well.  </li>
            <li> This is a classic standby.  </li>
            <li> The pink color is just so cute and the bottle is kinda old school</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and the toner is gentle.</li>
            <li> I used this product for years until they raised the price too high.  </li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I put this in a little spray bottle and carry it with me just for some touch up : )</li>
            <li> It makes it so easy to just hold a cotton pad (I use cotton pads, not balls) at the opening and quickly flip down and back up once or twice.</li>
            <li> Works like it says and gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Also found it useful for both sons who sometimes end up with a razor burn following shaving - It must help because there is no hesitation when I ask if they want to use it....</li>
            <li> It is very gentle and does not burn like other toners, it is worth trying.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and actually keeps my face looking &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; and healthy.</li>
            <li> If you expect something more complex, there should many other choices.</li>
            <li> I like how it has minimal alcohol in it, but still has 1%... which means there will be that fresh, tingly feeling!  </li>
            <li> I have used &#x27;Neutrogena Alcohol-Free Toner, 8.5 Ounce&#x27;  for years, and just wanted to get something new for a try.</li>
            <li> This and my Lancome face soap are the two products I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li> so I can try new things</li>
            <li> I switch from time to time if I see a new product on the market or feel like a change, but this is one of my favorites.  </li>
            <li> it still makes my skin rash and red after applying the product because actually it&#x27;s not 100% alcohol free.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> you have VERY sensitive skin, I&#x27;ll advise you to stay away from this.  </li>
            <li> If your eyes are very sensitive, then don&#x27;t use it there.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> In any case, I only felt the tingle the first couple of nights I used it.</li>
            <li> Too strong for my skin(combo, a little sensitive )</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see or feel a dramatic difference if I ever forget to use it for one night or day, but after a week without using any toner at all, I noticed that my skin was more oily and had a more uneven complexion.</li>
            <li> Never leaves my face dry or tight, but fresh and clean feeling.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling fresh and hydrated, leaving a great base for my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> post if neck bumps clear off.</li>
            <li> It also helps to refine the look of my skin, leaving it hydrated and clear.</li>
            <li> But u need to avoid using it around the eye area if you have sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> It works very well especially for those with oily skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> but now I can use a regular gentle cleaner (I use Cetaphil) and follow with this toner to get my Salicylic acid fix.</li>
            <li> Not recommend it for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Works very well, I have used for several years</li>
            <li> It smells just like it and leaves my skin soft and moisturized after using it.</li>
            <li> Gentle enough to use around eyes FOR ME, although it says not to use around eyes.  </li>
            <li> I had also tried the one from Olay (in the blue bottle), but that one irritated my skin and the fragrance was much stronger.  </li>
            <li> So, I wonder if they can give something like a small tube or pipe or whatever it called so that it won&#x27;t spill easily.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no odd smell</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for normal to dry skin types.</li>
            <li> but, for the first time in 10 years, I have not had a SINGLE ZIT IN A MONTH!</li>
            <li> I have been buying this for a long time my skin is very sensitive and at 63 yrs old I still break out !.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry your skin at all, and really feels like it is exfoliating your skin with the alptha hydroxy vitamins.</li>
            <li> It cost almost double at my local Walgreens but was on sale when I got it, which is actually the only reason I tried it in the first place!</li>
            <li> Also since the opening area is very wide, it is hard to use an appropriate small amount each time and easy to spill a lot all the time.</li>
            <li> Also, it is marked \\&quot;99% Alcohol-Free\\&quot; on the back of the bottle.</li>
            <li> For this product, i can only say it did not harm my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Products work differently on different skin types, so here are my specifics:&lt;br /&gt;25 years old</li>
            <li> I used to use Pond&#x27;s Toner before when I was in Asia as it&#x27;s not so expensive there and really effective on my skin.</li>
            <li> Maybe other people were looking for more of a small opening that you have to shake/squeeze the bottle to get product onto the cotton.   </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s hardly any scent (and the little scent there is smells clean and fresh), which is a definite plus.</li>
            <li> And I decided to order another one on Amazon as Amazon&#x27;s price is about $1 less than Walgreen or other stores, and I got it for free shipping as my order is over $25.</li>
            <li> The smell  is lovely too, plus I am sucker for the pink color.</li>
            <li> I like that it also does not dry it out.  </li>
            <li> no alcohol and does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I use cotton squares, half of each side first, where you can see the residue coming off your face, and then second side of the pad where it remains white, so you know you&#x27;ve gotten it all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, once you used that super saver shipping method, it also mean you accept super slow order confirmation and delivering</li>
            <li> Large flocculent precipitate appeared at the bottom of the bottle after a few month of using.</li>
            <li> , it still burn a little bit, but my skin really felt refresh afterward.  </li>
            <li> Used this since late 80&#x27;s early 90&#x27;s classic simple toner.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used much more expensive toners (the Clinique one with witch hazel for example) in the past and they never did much for my skin - they either dried it out too much</li>
            <li> This toner is super mild, there is a fragrance (that can be annoying to some if you are sensitive)</li>
            <li> believe the directions say that some tingling is normal, which turned me off a little because tingling to me has always meant burning.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about as effective as the Pond&#x27;s one and less expensive here.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This stings my face a little, however my skin is sensitive so it may just be me.  </li>
            <li> I bought this toner to help clear my pores, but after using it for a few weeks, it&#x27;s helped with the ones on my chin but not my nose.</li>
            <li> According to wikipedia, \\&quot;It is often used as an antiseptic for minor wounds, although this practice is harmful and counterproductive, since it kills skin cells.\\</li>
            <li> , I like to use it after exfoliating my face and after a long day at work it just gives this freshness to my skin</li>
            <li> Was using a more expensive toner and got tired of paying the high price.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry as a desert like some products do.</li>
            <li> Like the fact that it has no alcohol and doesn&#x27;t dry out your face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried others, but they dry my skin.</li>
            <li> MY skin is always so dry.</li>
            <li> The toner quality is fine,softens the skin but leaves it a bit dry.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t break out or get dry skin.</li>
            <li> I used it on him once during the night when he had really dry skin</li>
            <li> I typically only use it at night after taking off my makeup, but I do sometimes use it to refresh my skin in the morning if I&#x27;m feeling a little greasy or blah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was really afraid to buy this because so many reviewers said the opening made the product hard to use but nobody wrote about how the opening actually looked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 19, have combination skin (oily T-zone), no severe acne problems, but I get the occasional breakout or a few blemishes.</li>
            <li> It turned the cotton ball pink.</li>
            <li> I use wet cleansing towels to take my make-up off and use 2 cotton pads with HydraFresh Toner to finish cleaning my face.  </li>
            <li> You have to be careful, or you&#x27;ll have a spill on your hands.</li>
            <li> This toner removes oils and impurities from the skin without being rough.  </li>
            <li> During that time, my face was raw, like you scrapped your knee against the concrete and wasn&#x27;t bleeding but the raw skin was feeling that burn.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin at all, although I feel a slight tingle after applying with a cotton pad.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I was so nervous it would be discontinued like every other product I grow to love.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Contains salicylic acid,glycerin,alcohol,citric acid, castor oil and other.</li>
            <li> I have tried a number of other brands as well as witch hazel.  </li>
            <li> And no tightness like after using other toners.</li>
            <li> He doesn&#x27;t like my other toners because they &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; according to him.</li>
            <li> Although the toner is described as alcohol free, my eyes got irritated badly.</li>
            <li> I only get acne about a week before my period (and it&#x27;s usually pretty bad),</li>
            <li> I use it at night after a L&#x27;Oreal cleanser to remove the last bit of makeup and by itself in the morning to remove dead cells and night cream left behind.  </li>
            <li> The scent is a little bit strong, but it&#x27;s not too bad.</li>
            <li> I am not completed until I wipe my face down with my L&#x27;Or&amp;eacute;al toner.</li>
            <li> It smells good, but when I use it on the face, it smells a little awful.</li>
            <li> Will be switching to this one from now on; I previously used the Olay Oil Minimizing Toner.</li>
            <li> and I notice my skin got less breakout than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since the main ingredient of all toners is water, the so-called \\&quot;alcohol-free\\&quot; is just meaningless.</li>
            <li> And it seems that it is a little bit pungent.</li>
            <li> I am going back to witch hazel which cleans but is less irritating.</li>
            <li> , Combination skin that leans towards dry, Break out with a small pimple or two weekly, Harsh products sting my face, Skin usually feels tight after cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> B001HTCYPC Proactiv Solution Green Tea Moisture 1 Oz]].</li>
            <li> The smell is too heavy</li>
            <li> It leave you feeling moisturized instead of dried out.  </li>
            <li> It does the job of taking off the residue left behind by the cleanser or makeup.</li>
            <li> For awhile, I believed it was a wasted step, and abandoned this ritual for years and years.  </li>
            <li> and it does take time to dry which I was not happy with I will probably not repurchase.</li>
            <li> Too expensive at my local drug stores.</li>
            <li> not really sure what I&#x27;m expecting it to do for my skin????  </li>
            <li> Not sure if will order again.</li>
            <li> and I usually wait until after I&#x27;ve finished a product to review it,</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s because of this product.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t expect anything complex for a toner, probably you can go with avene water.</li>
            <li> I mean under the lid, the hole is just that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seriously going to start buying bottles in bulk because when I run out and use any of my backup toners</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years, and it is almost impossible to find in local drug stores.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t believe this one is bad at all especially for the price!!</li>
            <li> It is difficult to control the amount of toner you want to apply to a cotton ball.</li>
            <li> I have used expensive products b4</li>
            <li> Cant go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> how dirty it still was until I started using this product.</li>
            <li> Its so inconvenient when you pour it out,every time it spilled out a lot.</li>
            <li> Try it, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> BAD TIME FOR MY FACE.</li>
            <li> This does however, very bad.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why if I use it close to my eyes, it&#x27;s stings very badly</li>
            <li> This toner is horrible!!!</li>

            <li> Great toner, great price!</li>
            <li> Item as described, light on the skin, gives u a fresh feeling and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I clean my face religously twice a day, but had no idea how dirty it still was until I started using this product. My face feels so much cleaner and clearer now. I probably won&#x27;t go without this again.</li>
            <li> I gave this 4 stars because I don&#x27;t really like the bottle design. It is difficult to control the amount of toner you want to apply to a cotton ball. But the product itself I would give 4.5, just because it isn&#x27;t a miracle product on its own. Let me elaborate:    I use this after washing with the [[ASIN:B000052YM4 Alpha Hydrox Foaming Face Wash - 6 fl oz]]. It feels refreshing and keeps the skin supple and moist. I have acne prone skin so I need to apply the [[ASIN:B001E6OC44 Proactiv Solution Original Repairing Lotion 2 oz]] after washing, followed by the [[ASIN:B001HTCYPC Proactiv Solution Green Tea Moisture 1 Oz]]. I find this regimen to be best for my skin. But I digress, if you require a refresh during the day this toner is perfect, alcohol free (so won&#x27;t dry out your skin).</li>
            <li> Although the toner is described as alcohol free, my eyes got irritated badly. So I checked the ingredients, and found that the third ingredient is \\&quot;ALCOHOL DENAT\\&quot;, which means denatured alcohol. According to wikipedia, \\&quot;It is often used as an antiseptic for minor wounds, although this practice is harmful and counterproductive, since it kills skin cells.\\&quot;   Also, it is marked \\&quot;99% Alcohol-Free\\&quot; on the back of the bottle. Since the main ingredient of all toners is water, the so-called \\&quot;alcohol-free\\&quot; is just meaningless. It seems that the toner&#x27;s description is quite deceptive.   Canceled the subscription and will never buy it again. Wish I would have checked the ingredients first.</li>
            <li> This stings my face a little, however my skin is sensitive so it may just be me.  Otherwise it is good and removes oil well.  I am going back to witch hazel which cleans but is less irritating.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.  Many toners irritate or burn my skin.  This doesn&#x27;t!  Good toner without having to spend much either.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find it anymore on shelves at local stores; I apply this immediately after washing my face, and the &amp;#34;tightness&amp;#34; goes away.  Also found it useful for both sons who sometimes end up with a razor burn following shaving - It must help because there is no hesitation when I ask if they want to use it....</li>
            <li> PROS&lt;br /&gt;Balances Skin&lt;br /&gt;Gentle&lt;br /&gt;Improves Skin Texture&lt;br /&gt;Leaves Clean Feel&lt;br /&gt;Not Greasy&lt;br /&gt;Smells Great&lt;br /&gt;BEST USES&lt;br /&gt;Combination Skin&lt;br /&gt;Daily Use&lt;br /&gt;Dry Skin&lt;br /&gt;Sensitive Skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I TAKE VERY GOOD CARE OF MY SKIN, CLEANSE GENTLY, USE MY L&#x27;OREAL HYDRATING TONER, MOISTURIZE, (RETINOL, AND ALPHA HYDROX DAILY) AND HAVE REGULAR TREATMENTS , PHOTO FACIALS, MICRODERMS, AND CHEMICAL PEELS. PLUS I SUPER HYDRATE WITH WATER, AND LOTS OF VEGGIES. SO, YOU CAN SEE I CARE ABOUT MY SKIN. L&#x27;OREAL HYDRATING TONER IS THE ONLY TONER I&#x27;VE EVER FOUND THAT ACTUALLY HYDRATES AS WELL AS TIGHTENING PORES. DEFINITELY GIVE IT A THUMBS UP! (OH, GOOD PRICE AS WELL.)</li>
            <li> Really love this!! It leaves my face feel so fresh and soft and it has a very light scent that is very pleasant will defiantly be buying this again!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start off with a description of my skin: I&#x27;m 19, have combination skin (oily T-zone), no severe acne problems, but I get the occasional breakout or a few blemishes. This toner feels great on the face, and it really helps take off the rest of the face makeup that my cleanser fails to remove. It leaves my skin feeling fresh and hydrated, leaving a great base for my moisturizer. I don&#x27;t really see or feel a dramatic difference if I ever forget to use it for one night or day, but after a week without using any toner at all, I noticed that my skin was more oily and had a more uneven complexion. Overall, this toner is great for evening out my complexion and adding more moisture, and I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> It is refreshing, gentle with a reasonable price. But u need to avoid using it around the eye area if you have sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> Good product,bad bottle design. Its so inconvenient when you pour it out,every time it spilled out a lot. So I had to change it to another bottle.</li>
            <li> Has not hurt my skin, which is pretty particular.  I like that it also does not dry it out.  I need to give it a bit longer to see how it works over time before I give it all my stars!  I like the brand.</li>
            <li> This product is really works and make my skin more younger and smooth.I use everyday,now I don&#x27;t want face cream may often. Thanks Amazon introducing this product.</li>
            <li> The smell is too heavy</li>
            <li> Great alcohol free astringent.  Smells wonderful and really freshens my face!  I use it mostly after a home microdermabrasion.  I am acne prone and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out!</li>
            <li> My all-time favorite toner. Works like it says and gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I like the product. It is indeed refreshing every time I use it. I will be happy to order again</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected from a good toner. My skin is very sensitive and the toner is gentle.</li>
            <li> this toner is too mild, cant kill the bacteria inside the pore. I would suggest using another brand to get the effect of minimizing your pores</li>
            <li> I use this every day LOVE IT</li>
            <li> it still makes my skin rash and red after applying the product because actually it&#x27;s not 100% alcohol free. Quite disappoiting.</li>
            <li> Well It&#x27;s okay for me.Because the smell is strong and my skin isn&#x27;t very comfortable when I use it. And it seems that it is a little bit pungent. I wonder whether it is totally alcohol-free or not.</li>
            <li> Feels refreshing going on but leaves a sticky residue</li>
            <li> I use L&#x27;Oreal Paris products every day. I just recently bought this toner and it is just fine for me.</li>
            <li> This product is just great. I like the smell and its effect. So moist! Only my concern is the lid. I mean under the lid, the hole is just that&#x27;s it. A big hole with liquid in it. So, you can imagine when we unintentionally drop it. It will all gone! I did once and thankfully i just spilled it a bit before i put it up again. So, I wonder if they can give something like a small tube or pipe or whatever it called so that it won&#x27;t spill easily.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite toner.  It leave you feeling moisturized instead of dried out.  Most toners - even gentle ones have a lot of alcohol in them. This one has minimum. Literally 1%. I also love that it has Beta Hydroxy. It cleanses the skin of old dry bits, and makes you look great.  This really helps if you are going sans makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I use this daily. When I can&#x27;t find this in store I usually use Neutrogena, but it isn&#x27;t 1/2 as good as this one.  L&#x27;Oreal even has a better, cleaner fragrance then the alcohol free Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> Get ready for a brand new skin, with this toner. It cleans your face, it leaves it soft and fresh and it is affordable. I have been using this for years and I love it. It is very gentle and does not burn like other toners, it is worth trying.</li>
            <li> It turned the cotton ball pink.</li>
            <li> This products better than Lancomd plus it is alcohol free.</li>
            <li> Too expensive at my local drug stores. I love this stuff because it&#x27;s not harsh on my skin, but refreshes and moisturizes just enough in between day time activities when I need a boost. I wash my face with water in the morning and splash on some of this, massage it all over with a cotton pad. I have combination (dry/normal/oily) skin.</li>
            <li> nice toner and good price. Alcohol-free is really important.</li>
            <li> Have skin feeling soft and refreshed, but it don&#x27;t really deep clean like most toners. Good to use after bath or shower.</li>
            <li> I have been using this L&#x27;Oreal toner for years and love it - gentle and feels good on my skin. Glad to find it on Amazon, love shipping to my door.</li>
            <li> The only toner I use.  This product once belonged to the Nivea Facial products line, but once Nivea abandoned the facial product line, Loreal picked this up. YEAH!. I was so nervous it would be discontinued like every other product I grow to love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways this toner is great. Doesn&#x27;t dry your skin at all, and really feels like it is exfoliating your skin with the alptha hydroxy vitamins. Great to use in the morning to prep your skin for moisturizer.  The smell  is lovely too, plus I am sucker for the pink color.</li>
            <li> I was searching for toners to try that would be alcohol free and wouldn&#x27;t break the bank. I found just that in this product and it doesn&#x27;t bother my acne or make me breakout.</li>
            <li> Great item! Leaves face refreshed and cleans off all traces of dirt &amp; make up.</li>
            <li> Amazon shipped this product very quickly, which make me very satisfied. As for this product, I think it is very suitable for summer, fresh and non-greasy. Although it said having no alcohol, but I kind of smell a little alcohol scent, yet it doesn&#x27;t really matter. Basically, this toner is very nice to my combination type face.</li>
            <li> It is good cleaner for problem skin, but skin not to dry.Toner  have a good smell. Contains salicylic acid,glycerin,alcohol,citric acid, castor oil and other.</li>
            <li> Perfect toner! It smells lovely, does not burn or irritate my skin as it does not contain alcohol! I couldn&#x27;t find this particular one in store but found it on trusty ol&#x27; Amazon!</li>
            <li> I used to like the stingy feel that my last toner would leave me with. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a month...I guess it&#x27;s good...not really sure what I&#x27;m expecting it to do for my skin????  I put it on after I shower.</li>
            <li> I have used &#x27;Neutrogena Alcohol-Free Toner, 8.5 Ounce&#x27;  for years, and just wanted to get something new for a try. I have also used astringent toner which has a lot alcohol, but neither burned my eyes. This does however, very bad. My mum told me the same. Did it not happen to all the positive reviewers?? This toner is horrible!!! Also since the opening area is very wide, it is hard to use an appropriate small amount each time and easy to spill a lot all the time.</li>
            <li> We order this monthly for my wife. Without it she&#x27;s grumpy: absolutely loves its gentle toning strength (been using about 14-16 months)</li>
            <li> It works very well especially for those with oily skin. It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry as a desert like some products do. My skin has definitely cleared up after a week of using this so I&#x27;m very satisfied with the toner.</li>
            <li> I usually love L&#x27;Oreal Paris products and I use them often.  This toner is OK, nothing special about it.  The price was right, so I guess 3 stars is a good review.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Paris HydraFresh Alcohol -free toner is the best I&#x27;ve found for my sensitive,dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;It gently removes any traces of makeup or cream left from cleansing, leaving my face feeling very clean and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for years with real satisfaction.</li>
            <li> It works well and moisturizes my face. The scent is a little bit strong, but it&#x27;s not too bad. The toner is good enough for about five dollars.&lt;br /&gt;However, there is a big flaw of the bottle - the opening of the rim is HUGE (which is about the size of the rim of a soda bottle). That made me pour out 1/5 of the liquid the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Smell is nice and light, doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent of alcohol. Cleans my face without a stinging sensation. Will be switching to this one from now on; I previously used the Olay Oil Minimizing Toner. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Refreshing and not greasy. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and actually keeps my face looking &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; and healthy. Even my husband loves it!</li>
            <li> Great, I&#x27;ve used it for years.</li>
            <li> It smells good, but when I use it on the face, it smells a little awful. However, all in all, it is OK.</li>
            <li> This product is misleading. It says alcohol free yet alcohol is listed in the ingredients. I put it in the rubbish.</li>
            <li> Using simply for my neck as my conditioner gives me neck acne.  So far so good, but the scent is heavily grapefruit that annoys my nose.  Great price, however, as I&#x27;ve noticed L&#x27;Oreal on Amazon is much cheaper than in store.  I plan on using this MORE during the summer when I&#x27;m using heavier sunscreen to get that out of my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will post if neck bumps clear off.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this for a long time my skin is very sensitive and at 63 yrs old I still break out !.  At night, I first wash with a mild soap and then  finish up with this to be sure my pores are clean.  We now live in a very warm climate and my face gets oily, so when I awake in the morning I also clean again with this toner before the make-up.</li>
            <li> Large flocculent precipitate appeared at the bottom of the bottle after a few month of using. Wondering if it still can be used or not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena oil eliminating astringent for the longest time and it sort of burns. With this stuff, it&#x27;s like putting water on your face compared to the Neutrogena.  It&#x27;s very mild, actually rather soothing. Nowhere near as good as something like LANCÃ”ME Tonique Toner which is my absolute favorite but hey, they are made by the same company so I don&#x27;t believe this one is bad at all especially for the price!!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent toner for my sensitive, dry skin. I have tried MANY toners like Lancome&#x27;s Tonique Comfort which works great but burns my skin to Dickinson&#x27;s Witch Hazel which also stings &amp; dries my skin. This toner is gentle, has no irritarion, gives you a nice glow &amp; is cheap. This product is a gem. Try it, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> This and my Lancome face soap are the two products I can&#x27;t live without. I am not completed until I wipe my face down with my L&#x27;Or&amp;eacute;al toner. It sooooo soothes it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did you know Lancome and L&#x27;Or&amp;eacute;al are the same company?</li>
            <li> I used this product for years until they raised the price too high.  With Amazon&#x27;s subscribe n save price I decided to give it another shot.  Turns out that the product is better than ever with hydroxys and almost no alcohol.  Finally, a solution for pores!</li>
            <li> I like this toner, it&#x27;s alcohol free for those with sensitive skin.  I&#x27;m not brand-loyal when it comes to things like this and I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s on par with other products of its kind.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t expect anything complex for a toner, probably you can go with avene water. If you expect something more complex, there should many other choices. For this product, i can only say it did not harm my sensitive skin but I don&#x27;t really have any impression of it.</li>
            <li> Great for refreshing your face when you do not have water to wash it or at the beach to get the salt feeling off you face.</li>
            <li> Always looking for a non-alcohol toner.  This is a great one and feels really nice on my face.  I would get it again.</li>
            <li> My face gets that tingly feeling whenever I use this toner. I really like this product, so refreshing to use in the morning.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best toners I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;ve tried many) it&#x27;s light and has a lovely scent that lasts on the skin.  It removes that last traces of my make-up, leaving skin clean, toned and refreshed.  It also helps to refine the look of my skin, leaving it hydrated and clear.</li>
            <li> This was a pretty good product to use, and it leaves a soft feel to the skin.  Not sure if will order again.</li>
            <li> This is a great toner if your just looking for something on the cheaper side. I love the smell and how fresh it makes my face feel but it is not brightening as it claims and it does take time to dry which I was not happy with I will probably not repurchase.</li>
            <li> Both my daughter and I like it very much!</li>
            <li> Like the fact that it has no alcohol and doesn&#x27;t dry out your face.  Makes it feel fresh and clean</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years.</li>
            <li> Love this product - have used for years,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toner for many years. It is the best. I&#x27;ve tried others, but they dry my skin. HydrFresh toner is moisturizing and makes my skin feel so fresh.</li>
            <li> I like all of L&#x27;Oreals products, so I was not disappointed on this Hydra Fresh Toner... I would certainly recommend it to everyone..</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd or 4th bottle of L&#x27;Oreal Paris HydraFresh Toner.  I use wet cleansing towels to take my make-up off and use 2 cotton pads with HydraFresh Toner to finish cleaning my face.  I clean my face until there isn&#x27;t any more make-up showing on any of the cotton pads, then apply my hydrating cream.  This has been my routine for years and it works for me.  Hope this helps those of you who might want to try the L&#x27;Oreal Paris HydraFresh Toner.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this toner.  I&#x27;m seriously going to start buying bottles in bulk because when I run out and use any of my backup toners my skin can tell the difference and NOT in the good way.  The keeps my skin looking bright and feeling smooth.  Doesn&#x27;t cause any issues with my acne prone skin.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work! I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin so I can try new things and I&#x27;ll be fine . I used this twice ! And broke out everywhere !):</li>
            <li> I have used this for years but was having problems finding it at my local stores. I now have it auto delivered through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my skin feel very clean, but does not dry it out. Highly recommend for normal to dry skin types.</li>
            <li> MY skin is always so dry. I used to use Pond&#x27;s Toner before when I was in Asia as it&#x27;s not so expensive there and really effective on my skin. But since I moved to USA, I changed to this L&#x27;Oreal toner. It&#x27;s about as effective as the Pond&#x27;s one and less expensive here.&lt;br /&gt;I bought first one from Walgreens, it&#x27;s good, just not so fragrant as the Pond&#x27;s one. And I decided to order another one on Amazon as Amazon&#x27;s price is about $1 less than Walgreen or other stores, and I got it for free shipping as my order is over $25. However, once you used that super saver shipping method, it also mean you accept super slow order confirmation and delivering too.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this is a good toner for the price</li>
            <li> Used this since late 80&#x27;s early 90&#x27;s classic simple toner.  None drying ph adjustor. I miss the oil control formula Loreal made at that time.</li>
            <li> Just bought it for the 1st time and totally love it. Cleans so well and dries really quick. I have used expensive products b4 but this one beats all of them. Will keep buying this for sure :)</li>
            <li> my favorite toner!  no alcohol and does not dry out my skin. It also removes every last trace of makeup!  I have tried a number of other brands as well as witch hazel.  I keep coming back to this toner.</li>
            <li> Most toners have a cover under the lid, so the contents don&#x27;t just pour out, but not this one. You have to be careful, or you&#x27;ll have a spill on your hands. Probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.  And what makes this product is that its amazing on skin and alcohol free product.  It leaves my face refreshed and has worked in toning my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent way more money on toners that didn&#x27;t work nearly as well.  This is a classic standby.  I highly recommend it, clears dirt and oil and keeps your skin fresh and tones pores.</li>
            <li> Products work differently on different skin types, so here are my specifics:&lt;br /&gt;25 years old, Combination skin that leans towards dry, Break out with a small pimple or two weekly, Harsh products sting my face, Skin usually feels tight after cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I love this product. The purpose of this toner is to gently exfoliate via Beta Hydroxy acid, AKA Salicylic acid. I used to use a grainy scrub to exfoliate but find this not toner not only gentler, but more effective. And no tightness like after using other toners. I typically only use it at night after taking off my makeup, but I do sometimes use it to refresh my skin in the morning if I&#x27;m feeling a little greasy or blah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe the directions say that some tingling is normal, which turned me off a little because tingling to me has always meant burning. But do not fear - the tingling really is just tingling, and it&#x27;s actually quite pleasant. In any case, I only felt the tingle the first couple of nights I used it. Maybe I stopped noticing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to break out if I stopped using my oil-free acne wash but now I can use a regular gentle cleaner (I use Cetaphil) and follow with this toner to get my Salicylic acid fix. I LOVE that it is so gentle. My skin has never looked better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the shining feature of this toner is that it contains Salicylic acid (AKA Beta Hydroxy acid) and does NOT contain alcohol. It&#x27;s super effective at refreshing my skin and gently exfoliating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has a GREAT price on this product, so snatch it up. It cost almost double at my local Walgreens but was on sale when I got it, which is actually the only reason I tried it in the first place!</li>
            <li> I used this for two days and felt that there are some alcohol in this product, not as it claimed\\&quot; alcohol free\\&quot;. Not recommend it for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The toner quality is fine,softens the skin but leaves it a bit dry. Its okay to use as long as you follow up with a moisturiser.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel very fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> great toner with very monimal alcohol. I found a dupe for it which works  about the same. (Store brand toner).</li>
            <li> If you read the back, it&#x27;s actually 99% alcohol-free.  My first toner was this product and it BURNS the first time I tried it.  During that time, my face was raw, like you scrapped your knee against the concrete and wasn&#x27;t bleeding but the raw skin was feeling that burn.  So I didn&#x27;t use this until my face was healed from its sensitivity break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I went back to it, it still burn a little bit, but my skin really felt refresh afterward.  After a while, my skin got used to it and don&#x27;t feel the burn sensation anymore  I would had give it 4 stars, if it weren&#x27;t for that misleading line.  Even so, it was a good toner and I notice my skin got less breakout than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So currently, I&#x27;m almost running out and decided to buy another one here at Amazon.  I&#x27;m glad for the price I&#x27;m paying for, even though I&#x27;m new to this beauty prodcut world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have VERY sensitive skin, I&#x27;ll advise you to stay away from this.  But if not, it&#x27;s worth a try with this toner.</li>
            <li> This toner left my skin feeling hydrated as it promised. There was no drying of my skin which definitely made me happy.</li>
            <li> It does its job I like the fragrance of it...!  I was looking for alcohol free toner so tried this first time and I absolutely love this!</li>
            <li> Like most reviewers, I agree that the toner itself is great.  I mostly just wanted to talk about the bottle design. I was really afraid to buy this because so many reviewers said the opening made the product hard to use but nobody wrote about how the opening actually looked. Once you screw the cap off, it basically just looks like the opening of a water/soda bottle. Maybe other people were looking for more of a small opening that you have to shake/squeeze the bottle to get product onto the cotton.   However, this was exactly what I was looking for. It makes it so easy to just hold a cotton pad (I use cotton pads, not balls) at the opening and quickly flip down and back up once or twice. So hopefully, this helps for anyone who was concerned about what the opening actually looked like.</li>
            <li> I love this toner i have purchased it before from Amazon I love that it is alcohol free since i do have sensative skiface feels&lt;br /&gt;silky ater use great buy</li>
            <li> Most women don&#x27;t realize toner is a must, after cleansing. It just makes skin much nicer! When you are told to avoid toner for harshness, trust me, its not this one! My skin felt hydrated and fed water all over, and after letting it sit to be absorbed, moisturizer and night cream felt smoother</li>
            <li> This toner removes oils and impurities from the skin without being rough.  It leaves the skin fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> love my skin after using this product! makes my skin smooth, and soft, I like to use it after exfoliating my face and after a long day at work it just gives this freshness to my skin</li>
            <li> I recommend it strongly. It very fresh and without alcohol. My sister and I like it very much.We bought several bottles.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for, at a great price.</li>
            <li> This is a great replacement for one of those department store/beauty store brands at a much more reasonable price. Finding it on Amazon makes it even more cost-effective. Not an exact substitute, but the closest thing I&#x27;ve found to replace the $27 brand. Never leaves my face dry or tight, but fresh and clean feeling. No annoying fragrance which I am very sensitive to. Depending if you cleanse your face properly, I see the same benefits.</li>
            <li> I tried using L&#x27;Oreal Paris HydraFresh Alcohol-Free Toner, for two weeks and my skin became irritated.&lt;br /&gt;When I stopped using L&#x27;Oreal Paris HydraFresh Alcohol-Free Toner, my skin cleared up.&lt;br /&gt;I DON&#x27;t LIKE L&#x27;Oreal Paris HydraFresh Alcohol-Free Toner,VERY MUCH. BAD TIME FOR MY FACE.</li>
            <li> Good product, reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I love Lâ€™Oreal products for the quality and the fact you can use them on all skin types.  This was a win, win when I needed to even out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> It contains denatured alcohol which causing burning sensation! This is the third ingredient listed. Obviously this is deceptive advertising. I would not order it again. It does a good job of removing makeup.</li>
            <li> Works very well, I have used for several years</li>
            <li> I am about halfway through my first bottle of this stuff and I usually wait until after I&#x27;ve finished a product to review it, but I couldn&#x27;t wait on this product - I just have to get on here and sing its praises! This stuff is AMAZING! I&#x27;ve used much more expensive toners (the Clinique one with witch hazel for example) in the past and they never did much for my skin - they either dried it out too much or they didn&#x27;t help with acne. I adore this stuff - I use it every morning and it has all but stopped my acne. I only get acne about a week before my period (and it&#x27;s usually pretty bad), but, for the first time in 10 years, I have not had a SINGLE ZIT IN A MONTH! NOT ONE! I attribute that miracle to this product and a Yes To night cream that I&#x27;ve been using. The combination of the two is great. This product feels so refreshing when I use it in the morning. It&#x27;s even gentle enough to clean under my eyes to get the night gunk out from the corners. It just instantly brightens my whole face after I use this... and the best part is that it doesn&#x27;t dry out my face AT ALL! It leaves my face feeling moisturized and clean. There&#x27;s hardly any scent (and the little scent there is smells clean and fresh), which is a definite plus. I will keep buying this until it stops being made or my skin stops reacting favorably to it. I&#x27;ve found my holy grail toner!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toner for over a year now. I have combo skin that either flakes if I don&#x27;t moisturize enough or blinds someone with oily reflection if I over do it. Paired with an aloe gel moisturizer, my skin has never been more consistent &amp; blemish free! I love it &amp; recommend it, esp considering the price!</li>
            <li> good stuff and quick delivery</li>
            <li> Was using a more expensive toner and got tired of paying the high price.  Tried this as a substitute and it works just as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok toner. But it didn&#x27;t really transform my skin. And I even feel it is a bit pricey for what it does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toner for many years and it&#x27;s been getting more and more difficult to find in local stores.  I switch from time to time if I see a new product on the market or feel like a change, but this is one of my favorites.  My skin feels clean and smooth after I apply it and add moisturizer.  It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin at all, although I feel a slight tingle after applying with a cotton pad.  I do not recommend cotton balls, since they&#x27;re wasteful in my opinion.  A cotton \\&quot;round\\&quot; or \\&quot;square\\&quot; uses less product and will clean your face better.  I use a facial cleanser every night before bedtime, but this toner removes any residue left on my face and any impurities from the tap water.</li>
            <li> It does the job of taking off the residue left behind by the cleanser or makeup. I don&#x27;t know why if I use it close to my eyes, it&#x27;s stings very badly and my eyes become watery afterwards.</li>
            <li> You may no know it, but no matter what you use to clean your face, there is always some residue.&lt;br /&gt;This toner removes it all. I use cotton squares, half of each side first, where you can see the residue coming off your face, and then second side of the pad where it remains white, so you know you&#x27;ve gotten it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves your skin fresh and completely clear, ready for moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I just bought this from Walmart today. I think I like it, it smells good and leaves skin feeling hydrated. If you like ponds facial cleansing wipes than you will like this. It smells just like it and leaves my skin soft and moisturized after using it.</li>
            <li> Too strong for my skin(combo, a little sensitive )&lt;br /&gt;this is actually my second bottle. I dont use it on my face ,instead i use it on my body, made my skin very soft.&lt;br /&gt;I used to use it on my face but i had this burning sensation and my face was red so i stopped.</li>
            <li> This lasts forever and I would highly recommend it.  My skin feels so clean and fresh after using and it dries quickly.</li>
            <li> This toner keeps my skin feeling pretty good after I clean my face.  My daughter uses it too and she is pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this toner to help clear my pores, but after using it for a few weeks, it&#x27;s helped with the ones on my chin but not my nose. I think I&#x27;ve been breaking out even more since I started using it but I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s because of this product.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal products always meet or exceed expectations.  I&#x27;ve used this for years and love it!  Amazon&#x27;s pricing forit is great!</li>
            <li> Gently removes any residue from mascara and makeup that didn&#x27;t come off in shower. Makes your skin feel refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li> Good reasonably priced product.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years because it is alcohol free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years, and it is almost impossible to find in local drug stores.  Does a great job and is much more cost effective than similar products at the department stores.  Very gentle and thorough.  I use it at night after a L&#x27;Oreal cleanser to remove the last bit of makeup and by itself in the morning to remove dead cells and night cream left behind.  Prepares my skin for moisturizer and makeup.  Gentle enough to use around eyes FOR ME, although it says not to use around eyes.  If your eyes are very sensitive, then don&#x27;t use it there.</li>
            <li> I have used Hydra Fresh Toner for years.I  couldn&#x27;t find it locally. It is gentle and it works!&lt;br /&gt;I received exactly what I wanted and ordered</li>
            <li> I have been using 2-3 bottle of this already. I mostly use this during the spring-summer season when it&#x27;s kinda hot because this one give me a refresh/cool feeling. Sometimes I put this in a little spray bottle and carry it with me just for some touch up : )</li>
            <li> Good toner for those with average skin type. Cleans and refreshes at a reasonable price. Cant go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> In my teen years, I toned my skin because I loved the cooling sensation.  However, I stopped doing so because there was so much conflicting expert opinions on toner isage.  Many said it was not necessary, and then there was the camp that said you needed it.  For awhile, I believed it was a wasted step, and abandoned this ritual for years and years.  Now in my 30&#x27;s... I am revisiting the use of a toner.  Working part-time at a high-end makeup counter to help support my graduate studies has taught me so much.  I have seen all sorts of women with all sorts of skin issues.  And the trend I noticed the most was that those who used toner had glowing skin (I always ask what they use or notice the ones who glow always buy toner!)  and looked so much younger than their years.  After reading research about toners, I have concluded that it is necessary.  Even though you wash your face with a cleanser, the water you use can have mineral deposits and impurities that can be left on your skin - which may impact the level of absorption of your serum/moisturizers.  I was debating if I should buy the toner at my counter (the smallest bottle is $25 - which is too spendy for a graduate student!)  I waited a bit and decided to see what drugstore brands were available that would be comparable.  I found this gem at the drugstore and L&#x27;OREAL is actual the parent company of the luxury French cosmetics counter I work at - Lancome!    Anyways... I love this!  I like how it has minimal alcohol in it, but still has 1%... which means there will be that fresh, tingly feeling!  There is glycerin, rose water, vitamin B5, and a beta hydroxy in it as well.  A lot of good ingredients!  The pink color is just so cute and the bottle is kinda old school but I feel like I&#x27;m pampering myself and looks super cute on my vanity:)  I like to wash my face with Noxzema, then follow-up with this toner.  I then apply Genifique serum/Olay Regenerist serum then follow with a Lancome moisturizer.  I started this beauty regimen on advice of a client, actually.  When I first started working there I asked her what she used because here skin was flawless.  She said she loved drugstore cleansers and toners but always used Lancome moisturizers.  I thought she was in her 20&#x27;s... but she was in her 40&#x27;s!!!!      This toner is super mild, there is a fragrance (that can be annoying to some if you are sensitive) but I don&#x27;t mind it, and it&#x27;s rather light.  I had also tried the one from Olay (in the blue bottle), but that one irritated my skin and the fragrance was much stronger.  So if you are looking for a good alternative to department store toners, try this one first!:)</li>
            <li> This is a re-order for me.  This product makes my skin feel fabulous</li>
            <li> Does a good job of cleaning off makeup</li>
            <li> This is one of the best toners that I&#x27;ve tried. There&#x27;s no odd smell and I don&#x27;t break out or get dry skin. I have very sensitive skin but this toner makes my face feel really nice. I&#x27;ve also caught my boyfriend using my toner! I used it on him once during the night when he had really dry skin and he said his face was smooth throughout work the following day. He doesn&#x27;t like my other toners because they &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; according to him.</li>
            <li> Good for gentle, allergic skin to clean pores. I bought this specifically to use on my nose after makeup removal.</li>
