            <li>I am really pleased with the color and the polish.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I did use their recommended top coat though.</li>
            <li>Follow with a top coat.</li>
            <li>I love this nail polish.  </li>
            <li>I went to a salon and they used this and the top coat</li>
            <li>it stays on better than most nail polishes</li>
            <li>but on my nails- my sheets, my desk top-</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love the color.</li>
            <li>I love the color</li>
            <li>and I love this polish.  </li>
            <li>Love this product, nice color and lasted full week.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s nice to have pretty hands for once in my life!</li>
            <li>Also, it does not chip easily.</li>
            <li>For reference, I have nails that tend to peel and break easily.</li>
            <li>This is a really beautiful Roma Apple red with a touch of copper.  </li>
            <li>i love the colors and how quickly it dries.  </li>
            <li>Service was accurate and efficient.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t need the uv light</li>
            <li>The color is so rich looking</li>
            <li>I bought the color and clear coat together (from different stores) and it works great when used together!</li>
            <li>Is there a special technique to polishing nails that I don&#x27;t know?  </li>
            <li>and it lasted a good solid week.  </li>
            <li>I made sure not to wash my hands or do much with them for an hour.</li>
            <li>It comes off pretty easily which was always the problem with laquer</li>
            <li>Subsequent applications have not given me as good a result as the first time.</li>
            <li>Looks like a fresh msnicure.</li>
            <li>Nice color [ if you like red], and truly stays on longer.</li>
            <li>No base required, dries with natural sunlight or day light.  </li>
            <li>and it looked amazing with white tips for an elegant french manicure.</li>
            <li>Beautiful color and long lasting polish.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t last more than a couple of days.</li>
            <li>I applied 2 coats of Red Baroness, allowing both ample drying time, and followed up with the Weekly Top Coat.</li>
            <li>I did not give the polish enough time before applying the top coat.</li>
            <li>Love this color red, it has a slight metallic sheen, wish they had more colors like this.</li>
            <li>As advertised and arrived fast.</li>
            <li>Also, the manicure lasts at least 10 days to 2 weeks so for the first time ever I am painting my own nails and using regular polish remover at home.  </li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t think anything will ever completely correct the splits, at least this product helps to prevent the &#x27;catching&#x27; on things as well as the pain of that and keeps my nails stronger and prettier.  </li>
            <li>I first saw it in the salon and realized that it went on as regular nail polish, no UV lights needed.  </li>
            <li>The first time I had a couple chips early on, second time around no chips till the beginning of day 7!</li>
            <li>I always mess up one or more nails with this fast dry polish no worries.</li>
            <li>Prior to my first use, I carefully removed all old polish &amp; base coat, scrubbed with soap and warm water to get any moisturizer off my nails and followed up with a good wiping of isopropyl alcohol (91%).</li>
            <li>It stays for a whole week, but I don&#x27;t like Red Baroness color...</li>
            <li>Lasts so much longer than regular polish!</li>
            <li>Exposure to direct sun does seem to help with wear.</li>
            <li>When this happens the top coat seems to partially dissolve the color coat, giving me ghosting in a few spots near the tips.</li>
            <li>I love this polish -- generally lasts at least a week with just a need for minor touch ups.  </li>
            <li>Apparently, UV exposure strengthens the polish and should give you the maximum wear.</li>
            <li>However, I bought this myself and it lasted just like regular polish... barely a day.  </li>
            <li>I am super hard on my nails</li>

            <li> Pair  this with the top coat and keep your manicure for a week. Tips lost polish. Don&#x27;t  do the whole.nail. Just polish where needed and seal with top coat. Looks like a fresh msnicure. LLIVE IT.</li>
            <li> This is a really beautiful Roma Apple red with a touch of copper.  I am really pleased with the color and the polish.  Received it in 2 days!</li>
            <li> It stays for a whole week, but I don&#x27;t like Red Baroness color...</li>
            <li> This is the worst product I have ever purchased!  Went on gloppy and made my manicure look awful!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  The color is so rich looking and it looked amazing with white tips for an elegant french manicure.</li>
            <li> I like the color. Also, it does not chip easily. It lasted me for over a week without losing the shine. I did use their recommended top coat though.</li>
            <li> Love this color red, it has a slight metallic sheen, wish they had more colors like this. Use an undercoat or it will discolor your nails. Follow with a top coat. Lasts so much longer than regular polish!</li>
            <li> The first time I had a couple chips early on, second time around no chips till the beginning of day 7!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product!  I have horrible peely and weak nails and I used to get laquer manicures at the nail salon all the time.  As a result, I developed terrible splits that go directly up the nail bed and they used to catch on everything.  While I don&#x27;t think anything will ever completely correct the splits, at least this product helps to prevent the &#x27;catching&#x27; on things as well as the pain of that and keeps my nails stronger and prettier.  Also, the manicure lasts at least 10 days to 2 weeks so for the first time ever I am painting my own nails and using regular polish remover at home.  It comes off pretty easily which was always the problem with laquer - I had to soak my nails in the remover that smelled bad and had to put foil on them to get the polish off.  This stuff is like a miracle for me!  I am super hard on my nails so it&#x27;s nice to have pretty hands for once in my life!</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish.  I first saw it in the salon and realized that it went on as regular nail polish, no UV lights needed.  I bought the color and clear coat together (from different stores) and it works great when used together!</li>
            <li> I went to a salon and they used this and the top coat and it lasted a good solid week.  However, I bought this myself and it lasted just like regular polish... barely a day.  Do they sell a different product to the salons than they do to the public?  Is there a special technique to polishing nails that I don&#x27;t know?  I still gave it 3 stars since the salon version lasted so well.</li>
            <li> Nice color [ if you like red], and truly stays on longer.</li>
            <li> this brand rocks.  i love the colors and how quickly it dries.  it stays on better than most nail polishes and you don&#x27;t need the uv light</li>
            <li> Thank you? it is very beautiful!!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!! Lasted for TWO weeks!  I Was so so shocked-I&#x27;ve told everyone about it.  Definitely recommend especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last more than a couple of days.</li>
            <li> I love the color and the polish lasted for a good while</li>
            <li> One of my favorite Vinylux Colors!  Great Pedicure color!</li>
            <li> use it when I take off the gel polish.</li>
            <li> Love this product, nice color and lasted full week. Five stars!!!</li>
            <li> Color is gorgeous, perfect for Holidays!  Oddly though this one didn&#x27;t wear as well as the others I have bought in the past; not sure if the polish or I had been conditioning my nails the week prior so maybe it didn&#x27;t adhere as well.</li>
            <li> As advertised and arrived fast. Beautiful color and long lasting polish. Ordered severals colors. Would purchase again. Cheaper than a mani and lasts longer.</li>
            <li> Beware- after application I found this polish everywhere but on my nails- my sheets, my desk top- the floor- what a mess!</li>
            <li> Very nice polish with good staying power. Prior to my first use, I carefully removed all old polish &amp; base coat, scrubbed with soap and warm water to get any moisturizer off my nails and followed up with a good wiping of isopropyl alcohol (91%). I applied 2 coats of Red Baroness, allowing both ample drying time, and followed up with the Weekly Top Coat. I made sure not to wash my hands or do much with them for an hour. That morning I went to a swim meet (as a spectator) and due to lack of shade must have spent at least 4 hours in direct sunlight. Apparently, UV exposure strengthens the polish and should give you the maximum wear. I got 3 days without any chips, and just a tiny bit of visible wear on the tips. Subsequent applications have not given me as good a result as the first time. I did not give the polish enough time before applying the top coat. When this happens the top coat seems to partially dissolve the color coat, giving me ghosting in a few spots near the tips. Exposure to direct sun does seem to help with wear. Although I doubt I will ever get 7 days out of this product, I will be buying again. For reference, I have nails that tend to peel and break easily.</li>
            <li> No base required, dries with natural sunlight or day light.  Nice shine. Great colors  I always mess up one or more nails with this fast dry polish no worries.</li>
            <li> I love this polish -- generally lasts at least a week with just a need for minor touch ups.  YEA!  As I can not tolerate the gel polishes.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Love the color. Service was accurate and efficient.</li>
            <li> Meets all expectations of an excellent and lasting manicure Great shine and color</li>
            <li> I love the color and I love this polish.  It is by far the best I have ever used for staying power.</li>
