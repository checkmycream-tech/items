            <li>I am in love with this cleanser.</li>
            <li>I made sure it did because I use the etude wonder pore freshener and there was no makeup residue on the cotton ball.</li>
            <li>and I still love it after all these months.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying this cleanser again and again unless I find something even better.</li>
            <li>I love the smell as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I decided to purchase this.</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s called a cleansing foam, it feels like more like an exfoliating scrub in your fingers.</li>
            <li>Once lathered up, I let it sit for a bit to soak in, and always look much more refreshed after rinsing.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff.</li>

            <li>It was shipped very very quickly</li>

            <li>my skin is fine with it)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>It was love from the first application!</li>
            <li>One pea size amount to clean entire face, face feel clean afterwards, so good buy!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great cleanser that leaves your skin feeling smooth and gives me confidence that it&#x27;s actually getting off the dirt and makeup that has built up on my face over the period of the day.</li>
            <li>It came fast, and was nicely wrapped up.</li>
            <li>and I even received a free sample of SkinFood&#x27;s Watery Berry Eye [Anti-wrinkle Effect] Cream.</li>
            <li>I can feel my skin is very super clean</li>
            <li>It does a great job of clearing away the guck that gets on your face and definitely cleans out the BB cream.</li>
            <li>Best of all, it doesn&#x27;t feel dried out.</li>
            <li>Smells great and really deep cleans.</li>
            <li>I just apply a light nighttime moisturizer after.</li>
            <li>If you want your face super clean use this, it really does remove access bb cream or any make up really good</li>
            <li>well.. super clean!</li>
            <li>Overall - a very nice product.</li>
            <li>It has a nice amount of grit for exfoliating, but not so much that you can&#x27;t use it to clean your eye makeup.  </li>
            <li>I have super sensitive dry/oily skin and was looking everywhere for a good cleanser.</li>
            <li>Best of all, it actually seems to be keeping my skin clear!  </li>
            <li>Just a heads up, although this face cleanser helps clean your pores, it doesn&#x27;t help remove blackheads.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best facial cleanser I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>The face wash didn&#x27;t make my skin feel like it was clean</li>
            <li>You can tell how clean it gets your skin as well.</li>
            <li>It keeps my face clean and gets rid of any imperfections.</li>
            <li>My face feels so clean after using.</li>
            <li>I used this by itself and it takes all my makeup off and it feels squeaky clean after use.</li>
            <li>It does make your face feel squeaky clean, however, I still have dirt when I use my toner.</li>
            <li>Definitely a great bb cream cleanser, it does its job with removing makeup and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>Such a pleasant surprise!&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li>Very good cleanser but a little drying for my face.</li>
            <li>Overall good product for its price.</li>
            <li>On occasion I&#x27;ll use this as a masque to give my skin a good deep cleanse.  </li>
            <li>Good experience overall, but this did not work for me.</li>
            <li>and I feel super clean afterward.  </li>
            <li>so it will last you a good while.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll have to wait on the shipping, as it comes fr overseas</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel super clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>The skin becomes more smooth and better texture and smaller pores.</li>
            <li>I love washing my face with the Simple face wash in the mornings, and this product after the day is done so my face is super clean and ready for a good night&#x27;s rest!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Plus</li>
            <li>It also smells amazing, just like the skin food black sugar scrub, kind of lemony/citrus-y.</li>
            <li>after trying tis product it make my face clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Has mild exfoliation in it.</li>
            <li>I have large pores that clog easily.  </li>
            <li>I try everything to clean out my pores so they don&#x27;t look so large, and I think this may be it!</li>
            <li>And it doesn&#x27;t have strong fragrance smell, it smells really lemonly though.</li>
            <li>The price+ shipping is pretty good for big tube.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the product yet, seeing as I just received it today, but I have used Etude House products in the past and always had a good experience!</li>
            <li>It does lather up quite well, and definitely helps to exfoliate and cleanse as your skin WILL FEEL AND LOOK AMAZING after use.</li>
            <li>I use this along with their toner to further improve my smooth and sexy skin.</li>
            <li>My face kind of looked a bit white</li>
            <li>Just a tiny dab offers a great cleansing wash.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price</li>
            <li>Wow, I just absolutely LOVE this cleanser.</li>
            <li>I was in Tokyo last June and to be honest freaked out when I saw an Etude store  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s TOTALLY worth it.</li>
            <li>Deep cleans everything...and not just that but leaves skin dirt and oil free for over 6 hrs... :)</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t know it was going to work for me at first, but I had seen many positive reviews on Etude House products on the web and thought why not give it a go.</li>
            <li>Shipment was super fast!</li>
            <li>a dime size amount will usually cover my skin as it foams up exceptionally well!</li>
            <li>just moisturize right</li>
            <li>All of the oil and dirt on my face at the end of the day comes right off.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of this cleanser and how it foams up nicely, but after just one day of use I started breaking out in areas I usually don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, this face cleanser makes my face feel really refreshing, smooth and i mean REALLY smooth(but not as smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt, like my niece&#x27;s), and sexy.</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel a little rubbery after, but it smells good (a hint of fresh lemon).</li>
            <li>it brightens the face but does kind of leave it dry so just moisturize your face after using it.</li>
            <li>Feels very very cleansing.</li>
            <li>Acne prone, sensitive, pigmented, oily T-zone and fine lines around my eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall I love it.</li>
            <li>My skin definitely looks better.</li>
            <li>Thanks for everything!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty too.</li>
            <li>it really does get all the bb cream off and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin!</li>
            <li>I had higher expectations</li>
            <li>I had watched so many review videos on this product and after like 5, I was finally convinced to try it.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>I thought it was normal to wash my face twice to make sure all BB cream is completely removed.</li>
            <li>My face feels smooth and soft after using this cleanser.</li>
            <li>First i use coconut oil to remove all make-up</li>
            <li>The results are amazingly soft and clean feeling skin.</li>
            <li>I would not use daily but good for a once/twice a week deep cleaning.</li>
            <li>Very gentle ( I have super sensitive skin and</li>
            <li>I love washing my face with it, and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of product, a pea-sized amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It is nice how the cleanser foams as well because it makes the baking powder particles not as rough as they would be in a normal cleanser like that.</li>
            <li>Like the bb cream if anyone has used it, you don&#x27;t need a large amount.</li>
            <li>I purchased it because of the reviews that mentioned it helped reduce the look of large pores.  </li>
            <li>leaves my skin feeling fresh and soft and smelling like lemon!</li>
            <li>It could only be better if the pH were better and it was a bit less stripping.</li>
            <li>I really like the way my skin feels after using this product</li>
            <li>I really like the result I am getting.</li>
            <li>This stuff really removed my makeup well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended to treat blackheads and remove stubborn BB creams!  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much.♥</li>
            <li>but It&#x27;s not caustic.</li>
            <li>- I bought so much..</li>
            <li>It also really reduces pore size around my nose area.  </li>
            <li>my face and removes my face makeup very easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It really cleans all my makeup off</li>
            <li>It really cleans out my skin</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I still keep using way too much.  </li>
            <li>: I didn&#x27;t really see a change in pore size appearance, but I don&#x27;t mind it.</li>
            <li>All I can say is that it really does what it says.</li>
            <li>better than any other face cleaning products that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I use it morning and night and have noticed a steady drop in the amount of blackheads I have, even the very stubborn ones I thought I was doomed to battle forever.</li>
            <li>I would ended up using Clinique facial soap to clean my face again.  </li>
            <li>It removes make-up residue without a problem and my face actually feels clean after washing.  </li>
            <li>Not only does this leave my face clean, it has also noticeably improved my complexion.</li>
            <li>My skin feels clean and my pores are noticeably smaller after washing.</li>
            <li>: A little goes a long way, exfoliant to foam cleanser, softer skin, pretty cheap, removes most make-up&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>It may be drying on some skin - and I do battle dry skin, but this product is fine if you moisturize</li>
            <li>I usually wear thick BB cream on my face, so this is far most best deep cleanser I ever used.</li>
            <li>There were also 3 small complementary samples of various beauty products that were included in the package, which was a nice surprise!</li>
            <li>This works better and cleans my face better than some expensive department store cleansers.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this after a gross, humid, hot summer day in New York, I felt like I got new skin.</li>
            <li>For winter, I wanted a creamier consistency that would  clean my pores but take care of the dry spots.</li>
            <li>It leaves a squeaky clean feeling and doesn&#x27;t dry out my face.</li>
            <li>Moreover, the feeling of the bubbles you create with this product when you washing your face, it is very soft too.</li>
            <li>It has a gritty texture, but not too gritty like many American exfoliating cleansers.</li>
            <li>then i use hot towel  place it to my face to open my pores and wipe of oil with same hot damp towel.</li>
            <li>Now call me crazy, but why would I want to use more of another product and wash twice if I can do it with just one pea size amount for my whole face to feel clean.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a slight lemon scent that I enjoy as well.</li>
            <li>I love the size of the tube it came in, it holds a lot of product and will last a long time as you only need the smallest amount.</li>
            <li>Keeps my face relatively clear.</li>
            <li>Has helped my face clear up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s helped clear up my acne,</li>
            <li>Overall, I really like it</li>
            <li>Not for my skin because I have sensitive skin but maybe for people that can use drug store brands can use this no problem.</li>
            <li>and WOW.</li>
            <li>my face doesn&#x27;t feel anymore old and the pimple on my face start to disappear.</li>
            <li>seller was very understanding and gave me some of my money back.</li>
            <li>I use this to remove my mineral foundation at night, and it seems to deep cleanse really well.</li>
            <li>This completely takes off all my face makeup every night.</li>
            <li>It brightens this face and leaves it soft.</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way, and it can easily cover my whole face.&lt;br /&gt;Cleanses</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin with large pores and occasional breakouts, and I was looking for a cleanser that removed dirt from my face but didn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>:) I only use it at night and a small amount.</li>
            <li>Pores aren&#x27;t that much smaller, but a little better with regular use.</li>
            <li>It exfoliates gently and has a subtle, fresh scent, then rinses off clean and doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling tight afterward.</li>
            <li>I like the tiny scrubs and citrus scent, but it really defeats the purpose as a BB Deep cleanser to not to provide thorough cleansing effect either.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t scrub too hard on face esp if you have sensitive skin, I kind of felt slight burn doing that.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just squeeze a super tiny amount, like half a dime size and you can spread it all through your face and neck.</li>
            <li>so you have to wash your face second times but this one completely erases the make up.</li>
            <li>and I have the confidence that my pores will disappear one day in near future.</li>
            <li>and I would recommend this fully, product and seller, to anyone interested in purchasing Etude and other Korean beauty products alike!</li>
            <li>My skin is combination and this product does not dry it out or irritate it.  </li>
            <li>I am 48 and it cleans my skin without being dry and takes care of my occasional acne (yes I am old and still break out!!)</li>
            <li>The box was pretty badly damaged but the items inside were fine!</li>
            <li>This has really helped in clearing up all that mess.</li>

            <li> This one is foaming and smell nice and refresh.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product since I saw so many great reviews.</li>

            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I am in love with this cleanser.</li>
            <li> I made sure it did because I use the etude wonder pore freshener and there was no makeup residue on the cotton ball.</li>
            <li> and I still love it after all these months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying this cleanser again and again unless I find something even better.</li>
            <li> I love the smell as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I decided to purchase this.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s called a cleansing foam, it feels like more like an exfoliating scrub in your fingers.</li>
            <li> Once lathered up, I let it sit for a bit to soak in, and always look much more refreshed after rinsing.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> and it kinda dries out my nose, but moisturizer helps :)</li>
            <li> Will repurchase when I run out :]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved this product ever since I first used it.</li>
            <li> Gets the makeup off, and leaves face clean refreshed!</li>

            <li> Good for removing foundation cream in a gentle way.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cleanser and its definitely worth trying!</li>
            <li> It was shipped very very quickly</li>
            <li> Dime size+Foam+beads+lemon scent&#x3D; clean face+no more makeup.</li>
            <li> and it rinses off easily.  </li>
            <li> It feels like clean and refreshing using this product.</li>
            <li> does not feel drying at all and really makes my face feel fresh and bright :)</li>
            <li> and love the light clean smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;loving</li>
            <li> my skin is fine with it)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It was love from the first application!</li>
            <li> One pea size amount to clean entire face, face feel clean afterwards, so good buy!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great cleanser that leaves your skin feeling smooth and gives me confidence that it&#x27;s actually getting off the dirt and makeup that has built up on my face over the period of the day.</li>
            <li> It came fast, and was nicely wrapped up.</li>
            <li> and I even received a free sample of SkinFood&#x27;s Watery Berry Eye [Anti-wrinkle Effect] Cream.</li>
            <li> I can feel my skin is very super clean</li>
            <li> It does a great job of clearing away the guck that gets on your face and definitely cleans out the BB cream.</li>
            <li> Best of all, it doesn&#x27;t feel dried out.</li>
            <li> Smells great and really deep cleans.</li>
            <li> I just apply a light nighttime moisturizer after.</li>
            <li> If you want your face super clean use this, it really does remove access bb cream or any make up really good</li>
            <li> well.. super clean!</li>
            <li> Overall - a very nice product.</li>
            <li> It has a nice amount of grit for exfoliating, but not so much that you can&#x27;t use it to clean your eye makeup.  </li>
            <li> I have super sensitive dry/oily skin and was looking everywhere for a good cleanser.</li>
            <li> Best of all, it actually seems to be keeping my skin clear!  </li>
            <li> Just a heads up, although this face cleanser helps clean your pores, it doesn&#x27;t help remove blackheads.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best facial cleanser I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> The face wash didn&#x27;t make my skin feel like it was clean</li>
            <li> You can tell how clean it gets your skin as well.</li>
            <li> It keeps my face clean and gets rid of any imperfections.</li>
            <li> My face feels so clean after using.</li>
            <li> I used this by itself and it takes all my makeup off and it feels squeaky clean after use.</li>
            <li> It does make your face feel squeaky clean, however, I still have dirt when I use my toner.</li>
            <li> Definitely a great bb cream cleanser, it does its job with removing makeup and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> Such a pleasant surprise!&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li> Very good cleanser but a little drying for my face.</li>
            <li> Overall good product for its price.</li>
            <li> On occasion I&#x27;ll use this as a masque to give my skin a good deep cleanse.  </li>
            <li> Good experience overall, but this did not work for me.</li>
            <li> and I feel super clean afterward.  </li>
            <li> so it will last you a good while.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll have to wait on the shipping, as it comes fr overseas</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel super clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> The skin becomes more smooth and better texture and smaller pores.</li>
            <li> I love washing my face with the Simple face wash in the mornings, and this product after the day is done so my face is super clean and ready for a good night&#x27;s rest!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Plus</li>
            <li> It also smells amazing, just like the skin food black sugar scrub, kind of lemony/citrus-y.</li>
            <li> after trying tis product it make my face clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Has mild exfoliation in it.</li>
            <li> I have large pores that clog easily.  </li>
            <li> I try everything to clean out my pores so they don&#x27;t look so large, and I think this may be it!</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t have strong fragrance smell, it smells really lemonly though.</li>
            <li> The price+ shipping is pretty good for big tube.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the product yet, seeing as I just received it today, but I have used Etude House products in the past and always had a good experience!</li>
            <li> It does lather up quite well, and definitely helps to exfoliate and cleanse as your skin WILL FEEL AND LOOK AMAZING after use.</li>
            <li> I use this along with their toner to further improve my smooth and sexy skin.</li>
            <li> My face kind of looked a bit white</li>
            <li> Just a tiny dab offers a great cleansing wash.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the price</li>
            <li> Wow, I just absolutely LOVE this cleanser.</li>
            <li> I was in Tokyo last June and to be honest freaked out when I saw an Etude store  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s TOTALLY worth it.</li>
            <li> Deep cleans everything...and not just that but leaves skin dirt and oil free for over 6 hrs... :)</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t know it was going to work for me at first, but I had seen many positive reviews on Etude House products on the web and thought why not give it a go.</li>
            <li> Shipment was super fast!</li>
            <li> a dime size amount will usually cover my skin as it foams up exceptionally well!</li>
            <li> just moisturize right</li>
            <li> All of the oil and dirt on my face at the end of the day comes right off.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this cleanser and how it foams up nicely, but after just one day of use I started breaking out in areas I usually don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, this face cleanser makes my face feel really refreshing, smooth and i mean REALLY smooth(but not as smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt, like my niece&#x27;s), and sexy.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel a little rubbery after, but it smells good (a hint of fresh lemon).</li>
            <li> it brightens the face but does kind of leave it dry so just moisturize your face after using it.</li>
            <li> Feels very very cleansing.</li>
            <li> Acne prone, sensitive, pigmented, oily T-zone and fine lines around my eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall I love it.</li>
            <li> My skin definitely looks better.</li>
            <li> Thanks for everything!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pretty too.</li>
            <li> it really does get all the bb cream off and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin!</li>
            <li> I had higher expectations</li>
            <li> I had watched so many review videos on this product and after like 5, I was finally convinced to try it.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> I thought it was normal to wash my face twice to make sure all BB cream is completely removed.</li>
            <li> My face feels smooth and soft after using this cleanser.</li>
            <li> First i use coconut oil to remove all make-up</li>
            <li> The results are amazingly soft and clean feeling skin.</li>
            <li> I would not use daily but good for a once/twice a week deep cleaning.</li>
            <li> Very gentle ( I have super sensitive skin and</li>
            <li> I love washing my face with it, and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of product, a pea-sized amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It is nice how the cleanser foams as well because it makes the baking powder particles not as rough as they would be in a normal cleanser like that.</li>
            <li> Like the bb cream if anyone has used it, you don&#x27;t need a large amount.</li>
            <li> I purchased it because of the reviews that mentioned it helped reduce the look of large pores.  </li>
            <li> leaves my skin feeling fresh and soft and smelling like lemon!</li>
            <li> It could only be better if the pH were better and it was a bit less stripping.</li>
            <li> I really like the way my skin feels after using this product</li>
            <li> I really like the result I am getting.</li>
            <li> This stuff really removed my makeup well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended to treat blackheads and remove stubborn BB creams!  </li>
            <li> Thank you very much.♥</li>
            <li> but It&#x27;s not caustic.</li>
            <li> - I bought so much..</li>
            <li> It also really reduces pore size around my nose area.  </li>
            <li> my face and removes my face makeup very easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It really cleans all my makeup off</li>
            <li> It really cleans out my skin</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I still keep using way too much.  </li>
            <li> : I didn&#x27;t really see a change in pore size appearance, but I don&#x27;t mind it.</li>
            <li> All I can say is that it really does what it says.</li>
            <li> better than any other face cleaning products that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I use it morning and night and have noticed a steady drop in the amount of blackheads I have, even the very stubborn ones I thought I was doomed to battle forever.</li>
            <li> I would ended up using Clinique facial soap to clean my face again.  </li>
            <li> It removes make-up residue without a problem and my face actually feels clean after washing.  </li>
            <li> Not only does this leave my face clean, it has also noticeably improved my complexion.</li>
            <li> My skin feels clean and my pores are noticeably smaller after washing.</li>
            <li> : A little goes a long way, exfoliant to foam cleanser, softer skin, pretty cheap, removes most make-up&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> It may be drying on some skin - and I do battle dry skin, but this product is fine if you moisturize</li>
            <li> I usually wear thick BB cream on my face, so this is far most best deep cleanser I ever used.</li>
            <li> There were also 3 small complementary samples of various beauty products that were included in the package, which was a nice surprise!</li>
            <li> This works better and cleans my face better than some expensive department store cleansers.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this after a gross, humid, hot summer day in New York, I felt like I got new skin.</li>
            <li> For winter, I wanted a creamier consistency that would  clean my pores but take care of the dry spots.</li>
            <li> It leaves a squeaky clean feeling and doesn&#x27;t dry out my face.</li>
            <li> Moreover, the feeling of the bubbles you create with this product when you washing your face, it is very soft too.</li>
            <li> It has a gritty texture, but not too gritty like many American exfoliating cleansers.</li>
            <li> then i use hot towel  place it to my face to open my pores and wipe of oil with same hot damp towel.</li>
            <li> Now call me crazy, but why would I want to use more of another product and wash twice if I can do it with just one pea size amount for my whole face to feel clean.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a slight lemon scent that I enjoy as well.</li>
            <li> I love the size of the tube it came in, it holds a lot of product and will last a long time as you only need the smallest amount.</li>
            <li> Keeps my face relatively clear.</li>
            <li> Has helped my face clear up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helped clear up my acne,</li>
            <li> Overall, I really like it</li>
            <li> Not for my skin because I have sensitive skin but maybe for people that can use drug store brands can use this no problem.</li>
            <li> and WOW.</li>
            <li> my face doesn&#x27;t feel anymore old and the pimple on my face start to disappear.</li>
            <li> seller was very understanding and gave me some of my money back.</li>
            <li> I use this to remove my mineral foundation at night, and it seems to deep cleanse really well.</li>
            <li> This completely takes off all my face makeup every night.</li>
            <li> It brightens this face and leaves it soft.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, and it can easily cover my whole face.&lt;br /&gt;Cleanses</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin with large pores and occasional breakouts, and I was looking for a cleanser that removed dirt from my face but didn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> :) I only use it at night and a small amount.</li>
            <li> Pores aren&#x27;t that much smaller, but a little better with regular use.</li>
            <li> It exfoliates gently and has a subtle, fresh scent, then rinses off clean and doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling tight afterward.</li>
            <li> I like the tiny scrubs and citrus scent, but it really defeats the purpose as a BB Deep cleanser to not to provide thorough cleansing effect either.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t scrub too hard on face esp if you have sensitive skin, I kind of felt slight burn doing that.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just squeeze a super tiny amount, like half a dime size and you can spread it all through your face and neck.</li>
            <li> so you have to wash your face second times but this one completely erases the make up.</li>
            <li> and I have the confidence that my pores will disappear one day in near future.</li>
            <li> and I would recommend this fully, product and seller, to anyone interested in purchasing Etude and other Korean beauty products alike!</li>
            <li> My skin is combination and this product does not dry it out or irritate it.  </li>
            <li> I am 48 and it cleans my skin without being dry and takes care of my occasional acne (yes I am old and still break out!!)</li>
            <li> The box was pretty badly damaged but the items inside were fine!</li>
            <li> This has really helped in clearing up all that mess.</li>
            <li> On the other hand though it is very harsh and leaves my face so stripped that it squeaks - a clean similar to if I used soap.</li>
            <li> My skin is a bit unique in that many face washes (even those for sensitive skin, like Cetaphil) will cause horrible breakouts.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it for long and only use occasionally.</li>
            <li> The product shipped the next day and arrived a week later, much earlier than the expected date.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Really deep cleansing the face, pores and really remove the thick make up or the bb creams.</li>
            <li> As a result, I have noticed less breakouts when I use this regularly and my pores seem to be smaller from regular exfoliation.</li>
            <li> However small notice is that it tends to dry your skin if you use too much or for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have to at least use it 3 times and that is really drying to my face.</li>
            <li> Not too long after, I thrown it away.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t need to exfoliate as long as I have this.</li>
            <li> There were comparison of this product with other brand&#x27;s deep cleansers.</li>
            <li> Whereas other products left somewhat make up marks still</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make my skin feel dry or tighten if anyone is wondering.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for dry skin.</li>
            <li> little goes a very long way (a pea size washes my entire face, neck &amp; chest!)</li>
            <li> But IF it does for me, like some previous face wash i have used, it usually only last few days because my skin has to get used to it.</li>
            <li> (although I admit, I&#x27;m a little worried it might be stripping necessary oil).</li>
            <li> Plus, it only takes a little dab to work.  </li>
            <li> If it were a regular facial wash, I&#x27;d probably give it a five star rating, but I had a hard time removing my BB make up using this cleanser.</li>
            <li> so I believe it was money well spent.</li>
            <li> I bought this to eliminate my pores and after a few days of trying, I can say it totally worked!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really no scent to it.</li>
            <li> I been using few different kinds of BB cream cleanser, yet this is my must have it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> when i wipe my skin with toner using cotton, i barely see make up residue left behind.</li>
            <li> A little dollop goes a long way</li>
            <li> Also little goes long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes A LONG WAY.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t make my skin red at all (unlike other cleansers I&#x27;ve used in the past.)</li>
            <li> My face is extremely oily and this helps to keep it under control.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other etude house products and they work well.</li>
            <li> It even brightens due to baking powder.</li>
            <li> For the last two years I&#x27;ve simply settled with using Olay&#x27;s foaming face wash, since it didn&#x27;t cause a reaction, but I was never completely happy with it.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed my dark spot is getting clearer.</li>
            <li> To me, a face cleaner is a face cleaner, either foaming or non forming, good smell or horrible smell.</li>
            <li> and it has a slight tingly feeling.</li>
            <li> I typically use this cleanser in the evenings when I&#x27;ve worn makeup/or heavy makeup during the day...or even sometimes when my face just feels a bit grimy.</li>
            <li> But, this baking powder BB cream cleansing foam did not clean my face.</li>
            <li> I was a little leary</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone having trouble getting rid of their pores~</li>
            <li> I like this for a few days a week to cleanse my face.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not even harsh at all as you would expect because it has I think baking powder in it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not too harsh!</li>
            <li> And I have used a lot in the past...</li>
            <li> Because we moved to a place with Hard water my face has been breaking out.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve broken out a little bit after using this</li>
            <li> I usually like Etude House products in general, but I was rather disappointed about this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not TOO bad, but I definitely use another wash afterwards.</li>
            <li> it feel sort of weird, after I use it</li>
            <li> Yet somehow it cleans like crazy!</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product, but it broke me out HORRIBLY.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like it. Lathered very nicely. Smelled great too. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> too creamy and maybe not the best for my oily skin.</li>
            <li> This product really removes any trace of BB cream, so it&#x27;s great in that regard, however it is a bit drying for your skin-- so make sure you moisturize after washing your face. Overall, I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This works wonders on my combination to oily skin. It didn&#x27;t make my skin feel dry or tighten if anyone is wondering. But IF it does for me, like some previous face wash i have used, it usually only last few days because my skin has to get used to it. If this happens to YOU, just keep using it for a week and see if it fixes the problem.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this face cleanser makes my face feel really refreshing, smooth and i mean REALLY smooth(but not as smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt, like my niece&#x27;s), and sexy. Like the bb cream if anyone has used it, you don&#x27;t need a large amount. Just squeeze a super tiny amount, like half a dime size and you can spread it all through your face and neck. I use this along with their toner to further improve my smooth and sexy skin. Just a heads up, although this face cleanser helps clean your pores, it doesn&#x27;t help remove blackheads. And it doesn&#x27;t have strong fragrance smell, it smells really lemonly though. The smell will go away after you&#x27;ve cleansed your face.</li>
            <li> Really loving this Cleansing Foam. It felt really good with my oily skin. I use it to take ouf the BB cream I use in the day time. It left my skin feeling refreshed. My face kind of looked a bit white but maybe it was just me. Overall I love it. Would buy more Etude House products.</li>
            <li> Very good cleansing form.</li>
            <li> Very good cleanser but a little drying for my face. I would suggest using lotion immediately after. It does a good job at taking all the dirt out of my face after I use coconut oil to take out make up. Makes my skin very smooth after using it and it has a slight tingly feeling. Overall good product for its price. I also always buy it as a pair with Etude baking powder toner. I always use it as a summer cleanser.</li>
            <li> I really like the way my skin feels after using this product (although I admit, I&#x27;m a little worried it might be stripping necessary oil). And I&#x27;ve broken out a little bit after using this but I don&#x27;t think it was because of the face wash. Overall, I really like it and I will be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> Not for my skin because I have sensitive skin but maybe for people that can use drug store brands can use this no problem.</li>
            <li> I keep this in the shower and use it to wash off my BB cream when I shower. It&#x27;s not TOO bad, but I definitely use another wash afterwards.</li>
            <li> The cleansing foam was so heated when it arrived. I like this cleansing foam so I bought it several times. But this time when I used this cleansing foam my skin is starting to break out. I think it&#x27;s because the cleansing foam&#x27;s plastic container got melted for some reason.</li>
            <li> It has been a week since I started using the product. I really like the result I am getting. My pores are finally minimizing. I am very happy with it. However small notice is that it tends to dry your skin if you use too much or for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I purchased it because of the reviews that mentioned it helped reduce the look of large pores.  It DOES do just that.  Plus, it only takes a little dab to work.  Takes off makeup.  My skin is combination and this product does not dry it out or irritate it.  I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is amazing. I am in love with this cleanser. I really didn&#x27;t know it was going to work for me at first, but I had seen many positive reviews on Etude House products on the web and thought why not give it a go. I works so I believe it was money well spent.</li>
            <li> This stuff really removed my makeup well. I made sure it did because I use the etude wonder pore freshener and there was no makeup residue on the cotton ball. It also smells amazing, just like the skin food black sugar scrub, kind of lemony/citrus-y. Ahhh I just wanted to rub it on my face forever~~ I totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best facial cleanser I&#x27;ve used. A little dollop goes a long way and it lathers up nicely. It exfoliates gently and has a subtle, fresh scent, then rinses off clean and doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling tight afterward. I&#x27;m on my third bottle of this cleanser and I still love it after all these months. I use it morning and night and have noticed a steady drop in the amount of blackheads I have, even the very stubborn ones I thought I was doomed to battle forever. I&#x27;ll be buying this cleanser again and again unless I find something even better.</li>
            <li> I usually wear thick BB cream on my face, so this is far most best deep cleanser I ever used. I fully read, researched about this product before I admit to buy. There were comparison of this product with other brand&#x27;s deep cleansers. Whereas other products left somewhat make up marks still so you have to wash your face second times but this one completely erases the make up. Moreover, the feeling of the bubbles you create with this product when you washing your face, it is very soft too. I love the smell as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this a while ago, and thought it was going to be very good since it has baking soda in it, but it turned out that it was not that good at cleaning.  I would ended up using Clinique facial soap to clean my face again.  Not too long after, I thrown it away.  Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I bought this to eliminate my pores and after a few days of trying, I can say it totally worked!&lt;br /&gt;My face is starting to brighten as well (in only a week)... I think I have to buy whitening soap for my body too to match.&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice scent, too! Just don&#x27;t scrub too hard on face esp if you have sensitive skin, I kind of felt slight burn doing that.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways~ I recommend this to anyone having trouble getting rid of their pores~</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing.  Just a tiny dab offers a great cleansing wash. Smells wonderful.  I have large pores that clog easily.  I am finding that this cleanser is cleaning them out. My skin definitely looks better. I try everything to clean out my pores so they don&#x27;t look so large, and I think this may be it!</li>
            <li> I use this product almost daily and it works so well. It was shipped very very quickly and I would recommend this fully, product and seller, to anyone interested in purchasing Etude and other Korean beauty products alike! Thanks for everything!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I decided to purchase this. All of the reviews I had read were correct, this cleanser is amazing! While it&#x27;s called a cleansing foam, it feels like more like an exfoliating scrub in your fingers. It does lather up quite well, and definitely helps to exfoliate and cleanse as your skin WILL FEEL AND LOOK AMAZING after use. I typically use this cleanser in the evenings when I&#x27;ve worn makeup/or heavy makeup during the day...or even sometimes when my face just feels a bit grimy. It&#x27;s a great cleanser that leaves your skin feeling smooth and gives me confidence that it&#x27;s actually getting off the dirt and makeup that has built up on my face over the period of the day. As a result, I have noticed less breakouts when I use this regularly and my pores seem to be smaller from regular exfoliation. I absolutely love this cleanser and its definitely worth trying!</li>
            <li> To me, a face cleaner is a face cleaner, either foaming or non forming, good smell or horrible smell. This one is foaming and smell nice and refresh.  One pea size amount to clean entire face, face feel clean afterwards, so good buy!</li>
            <li> Good at removing a lot of my makeup that I&#x27;ve had on my face!  Doesn&#x27;t give me any reactions or breakouts.  It could only be better if the pH were better and it was a bit less stripping.</li>
            <li> Dime size+Foam+beads+lemon scent&#x3D; clean face+no more makeup. It&#x27;s worth the price and it&#x27;s pretty too. For the remaining under-eye makeup smears, I use olive oil to wipe it away. I have dry skin so I just use toner and lotion afterwards.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended to treat blackheads and remove stubborn BB creams!  Smells very lightly of lemon which is quite pleasant.  On occasion I&#x27;ll use this as a masque to give my skin a good deep cleanse.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> It feels really amazing on my skin! Because we moved to a place with Hard water my face has been breaking out. This has really helped in clearing up all that mess. It came fast, and was nicely wrapped up. Thank you very much.♥</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I found this face wash!  My skin is a bit unique in that many face washes (even those for sensitive skin, like Cetaphil) will cause horrible breakouts.  And those that don&#x27;t cause breakouts will, instead, cause redness or dry/itchy patches of skin.  For the last two years I&#x27;ve simply settled with using Olay&#x27;s foaming face wash, since it didn&#x27;t cause a reaction, but I was never completely happy with it.  The face wash didn&#x27;t make my skin feel like it was clean and it took 2-3 washings to fully remove make-up residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Etude&#x27;s Baking Powder Cleansing Foam, however, is the face wash I had been hoping to find!  It removes make-up residue without a problem and my face actually feels clean after washing.  Best of all, it actually seems to be keeping my skin clear!  The smell is refreshing (it smells like lemon-lime soda!) and it rinses off easily.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product and have already ordered another tube!</li>
            <li> One of the best products I have ever put on my face. Once lathered up, I let it sit for a bit to soak in, and always look much more refreshed after rinsing. Pores aren&#x27;t that much smaller, but a little better with regular use. Keeps my face relatively clear. I plan on using this forever!</li>
            <li> Oh mygoodness. I LOVE this stuff. Can I get a lifetime supply? Why hasn&#x27;t anything else worked this well? I was a little leary but It&#x27;s not caustic. I&#x27;ve even used it on the  pre-ads around here and no breakouts from being senstive. Yet somehow it cleans like crazy! I know! Must have more!</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive dry/oily skin and was looking everywhere for a good cleanser. Saw this product as a recommendation on amazon and figured why not?... and i tried it. and WOW. it really does get all the bb cream off and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin! it doesn&#x27;t make my skin red at all (unlike other cleansers I&#x27;ve used in the past.) Will purchase again when I run out!</li>
            <li> I use it to remove my BB creams only (about twice per week), otherwise it dries out my skin. Overall - a very nice product.</li>
            <li> Wow, I just absolutely LOVE this cleanser. I love the size of the tube it came in, it holds a lot of product and will last a long time as you only need the smallest amount. It is nice how the cleanser foams as well because it makes the baking powder particles not as rough as they would be in a normal cleanser like that. The scent is light and citrusy and quite pleasant. You can tell how clean it gets your skin as well. The product shipped the next day and arrived a week later, much earlier than the expected date. I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> amazing product! leaves my skin feeling fresh and soft and smelling like lemon! Which I love! you can definitely feel it cleaning but it&#x27;s not too harsh!</li>
            <li> Received my order today. The box was pretty badly damaged but the items inside were fine! (I wouldn&#x27;t blame the seller for the package damage) There were also 3 small complementary samples of various beauty products that were included in the package, which was a nice surprise! :) I haven&#x27;t tried the product yet, seeing as I just received it today, but I have used Etude House products in the past and always had a good experience! Looking forward to using this one :)</li>
            <li> I was in Tokyo last June and to be honest freaked out when I saw an Etude store  - I bought so much..this is my favorite product...I am 48 and it cleans my skin without being dry and takes care of my occasional acne (yes I am old and still break out!!) It also really reduces pore size around my nose area.  Overall not ever going to be without this awesome cleaner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely happy with the product and I even received a free sample of SkinFood&#x27;s Watery Berry Eye [Anti-wrinkle Effect] Cream. Such a pleasant surprise!&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li> after trying tis product it make my face clean and fresh. my face doesn&#x27;t feel anymore old and the pimple on my face start to disappear.</li>
            <li> Love how easy it is to foam up! A little bit goes a long way, and it can easily cover my whole face.&lt;br /&gt;Cleanses my face and removes my face makeup very easily.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to this product, for me anyway, is that it dries out the skin on my cheek.&lt;br /&gt;I just moisturize right after.&lt;br /&gt;I use this only a couple days out of the week for a deep cleanse.</li>
            <li> My skin type: Acne prone, sensitive, pigmented, oily T-zone and fine lines around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results: I wanted to love this product since I saw so many great reviews. For winter, I wanted a creamier consistency that would  clean my pores but take care of the dry spots. But, this baking powder BB cream cleansing foam did not clean my face. It left a residue that made me break out. I love BB cream, it saves me from break outs... but this BB foam does not deliver that result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller was very understanding and gave me some of my money back. Good experience overall, but this did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved this product ever since I first used it. Nothing cleanses better than this. I have a combination skin type. Recommended seller. Had freebies on the package :)</li>
            <li> Love the smell, love how clean my skin feels after. definitely will buy again. Shipment was super fast!</li>
            <li> This stuff is truly amazing.  I&#x27;m now having to order 2 at a time because I realized my husband was using mine in the shower!!&lt;br /&gt;It really cleans all my makeup off and I feel super clean afterward.  It may be drying on some skin - and I do battle dry skin, but this product is fine if you moisturize after.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a very long way (a pea size washes my entire face, neck &amp; chest!) so it will last you a good while.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll have to wait on the shipping, as it comes fr overseas but it&#x27;s TOTALLY worth it.</li>
            <li> Has helped my face clear up. Really no scent to it. Has mild exfoliation in it. Def will buy again.</li>
            <li> I been using few different kinds of BB cream cleanser, yet this is my must have it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really deep cleansing the face, pores and really remove the thick make up or the bb creams. The price+ shipping is pretty good for big tube. Also little goes long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Very gentle ( I have super sensitive skin and my skin is fine with it)&lt;br /&gt;- I can feel my skin is very super clean&lt;br /&gt;- no redness or irritation after use&lt;br /&gt;- brighten my skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say this is the BEST BB cream Deep Cleansing from Etude House!</li>
            <li> love this foam cleanser. This is the only foam cleanser that takes off all of my make up at once. when i wipe my skin with toner using cotton, i barely see make up residue left behind. and love the light clean smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;loving it!!!</li>
            <li> It does a great job of clearing away the guck that gets on your face and definitely cleans out the BB cream. On the other hand though it is very harsh and leaves my face so stripped that it squeaks - a clean similar to if I used soap. I would only use this when my face really needs some harsh cleaning, even then I would follow up with some Cetaphil cleanser to put some moisture back in.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It keeps my face clean and gets rid of any imperfections.</li>
            <li> I like this for a few days a week to cleanse my face.  My face is extremely oily and this helps to keep it under control.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Best product out there! Gets the makeup off, and leaves face clean refreshed!</li>
            <li> Love love love it!!!! Would but again :)</li>
            <li> Amazing cleanser! I won&#x27;t need to exfoliate as long as I have this. This is not a regular face soap; this is a deep cleansing one. So basically, you want to wash your makeup off, and then use this. Maybe even let it sit a moment. The results are amazingly soft and clean feeling skin. I will try the pore stick next.</li>
            <li> I use this to remove my mineral foundation at night, and it seems to deep cleanse really well. It&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
            <li> This works better and cleans my face better than some expensive department store cleansers. It has a gritty texture, but not too gritty like many American exfoliating cleansers. My face feels so clean after using. Best of all, it doesn&#x27;t feel dried out. I love it!</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product, but it broke me out HORRIBLY. I&#x27;ve used other etude house products and they work well. I love the scent of this cleanser and how it foams up nicely, but after just one day of use I started breaking out in areas I usually don&#x27;t. Would not repurchase.</li>
            <li> The best cleansing gel for very oily skin!</li>
            <li> I have used this face wash several times now and i love it. It makes my face feel super clean and refreshed. It has a very pleasant smell and creamy texture. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin with large pores and occasional breakouts, and I was looking for a cleanser that removed dirt from my face but didn&#x27;t dry out my skin. I&#x27;m glad to say I finally found the perfect product for me. It was love from the first application! Not only does this leave my face clean, it has also noticeably improved my complexion. I love washing my face with it, and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of product, a pea-sized amount goes a long way. I will definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing in minimizing pore size. It really cleans out my skin and I have been using it for 2 weeks now and my skin shows obvious improvement. The skin becomes more smooth and better texture and smaller pores. I will keep using it and I have the confidence that my pores will disappear one day in near future. I will definitely recommend this product to my friends!!!!</li>
            <li> Smells great and really deep cleans.</li>
            <li> The product is a very light and lemony/citrust smell.&lt;br /&gt;1/2 a dime size amount will usually cover my skin as it foams up exceptionally well! I feel like it exfoliates and cleanses the skin well. My skin feels clean and my pores are noticeably smaller after washing. I have combo skin, and it neither over dries my face out, or leave my face feeling oily. It just feels.. well.. super clean! It&#x27;s helped clear up my acne, I believe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product! I love washing my face with the Simple face wash in the mornings, and this product after the day is done so my face is super clean and ready for a good night&#x27;s rest!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Plus the packaging is suuuuper cute!)</li>
            <li> This completely takes off all my face makeup every night. It&#x27;s not even harsh at all as you would expect because it has I think baking powder in it.</li>
            <li> Feels very very cleansing. All of the oil and dirt on my face at the end of the day comes right off.</li>
            <li> Great for removing makeup residues. If im not wearing waterproof makeup. I used this by itself and it takes all my makeup off and it feels squeaky clean after use. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser. It leaves a squeaky clean feeling and doesn&#x27;t dry out my face. It even brightens due to baking powder.</li>
            <li> This works excellent if you use BB creams. The yare not tha teasy to wash off wit hteh regular facial wash. This one works just perfectly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. I still have to wash twice. It does make your face feel squeaky clean, however, I still have dirt when I use my toner. I had higher expectations</li>
            <li> this stuff works great! does not feel drying at all and really makes my face feel fresh and bright :)</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this with some bb cream and had to buy it.  It foams up nicely.  A little goes A LONG WAY.  I still keep using way too much.  A pea size amount will do!  It has a nice amount of grit for exfoliating, but not so much that you can&#x27;t use it to clean your eye makeup.  Oh and it smells yum - orange oil and lemon oil.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel a little rubbery after, but it smells good (a hint of fresh lemon). I like to use this to take off my BB Cream. :) I only use it at night and a small amount. I have combo skin and it kinda dries out my nose, but moisturizer helps :)</li>
            <li> this is alright after you wash off the product of your face it feel sort of weird, after I use it I re wash my face with another one</li>
            <li> If it were a regular facial wash, I&#x27;d probably give it a five star rating, but I had a hard time removing my BB make up using this cleanser. I have to at least use it 3 times and that is really drying to my face. I like the tiny scrubs and citrus scent, but it really defeats the purpose as a BB Deep cleanser to not to provide thorough cleansing effect either. I usually like Etude House products in general, but I was rather disappointed about this.</li>
            <li> If you want your face super clean use this, it really does remove access bb cream or any make up really good, I even use it when I dont wear make up because i like how well it cleans.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this after a gross, humid, hot summer day in New York, I felt like I got new skin. I would definitely recommend this product, especially if you wear BB cream on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing that bothered me was that shipping took almost 4 weeks. I understand that this is shipping from South Korea, so if you have the extra time to wait, go for it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this stuff! I had watched so many review videos on this product and after like 5, I was finally convinced to try it.&lt;br /&gt;When you first apply this product it has an exfoliant consistency because of the baking powder; however, as you rub the product on your face it turns into a wonderful foam cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: A little goes a long way, exfoliant to foam cleanser, softer skin, pretty cheap, removes most make-up&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I didn&#x27;t really see a change in pore size appearance, but I don&#x27;t mind it.</li>
            <li> Great cleanser!&lt;br /&gt;Also the shipping was very fast and the samples are always a joy to try out!</li>
            <li> This feels like a good product after using. Haven&#x27;t had it for long and only use occasionally. Good for removing foundation cream in a gentle way. I would not use daily but good for a once/twice a week deep cleaning. I did not feel like it dries out my skin. I think this will be my reliable deep cleanser from now on. I just apply a light nighttime moisturizer after.</li>
            <li> It feels like clean and refreshing using this product. I&#x27;ve also noticed my dark spot is getting clearer. I will definitely continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> This cleanser take away all of my makeup off in seconds! Love it!</li>
            <li> This bb cream remover is great. It brightens this face and leaves it soft. Though try not get if in your eyes because it STINGS!!! All I can say is that it really does what it says.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Deep cleans everything...and not just that but leaves skin dirt and oil free for over 6 hrs... :) better than any other face cleaning products that I have ever used. And I have used a lot in the past...</li>
            <li> it brightens the face but does kind of leave it dry so just moisturize your face after using it.</li>
            <li> I thought it was normal to wash my face twice to make sure all BB cream is completely removed. This all changed when I tried the Etude House Baking Powder BB Deep Cleansing Foam. Now call me crazy, but why would I want to use more of another product and wash twice if I can do it with just one pea size amount for my whole face to feel clean. There&#x27;s a slight lemon scent that I enjoy as well. My face feels smooth and soft after using this cleanser.</li>
            <li> Amazing. First i use coconut oil to remove all make-up then i use hot towel  place it to my face to open my pores and wipe of oil with same hot damp towel. After i use this amazing product with my clearasonic brush and my face has nvr felt this good.</li>
            <li> Very nice product. My wife loves it.</li>
            <li> Definitely a great bb cream cleanser, it does its job with removing makeup and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin. A little goes a long way. Will repurchase when I run out :]</li>
