            <li>If you have recently colored your hair or are trying to purify your hair this stuff is awesome.</li>

            <li>Love it on my hair,</li>
            <li>This is a very unique product</li>
            <li>Easy to use...</li>
            <li>Since I have fine hair</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m fine.  </li>
            <li>I do like using it, but for the price it doesn&#x27;t make a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>...silky...and super clean!</li>
            <li>But still not completely sure it is the best.</li>
            <li>It does leave your scalp clean.</li>
            <li>I used this today for the first time and my hair is so glossy!</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>Redken really knocked it out of the park with these products and I will continue to buy, hope they never discontinue them!</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t know if you need to have really damaged hair to see results with this product, i used it and didn&#x27;t see any difference....</li>
            <li>and my hair was super soft and detangled and the build up was completely gone!</li>
            <li>I followed with the Nature&#x27;s Rescue deep conditioner, which is really nice, thick and smooth but very lightweight.</li>
            <li>This left my hair feeling soft, smooth, and shiny.</li>
            <li>I live the redken products.</li>
            <li>I have pretty long hair</li>
            <li>This surprised me because it feels like liquid sand when you&#x27;re applying it.</li>
            <li>This does make my hair feel soft when I use it.</li>
            <li>WOW...</li>
            <li>I like the product so far.</li>
            <li>Makes hair soft</li>
            <li>Rinses clean, I was a little worried about the beads getting stuck in.</li>
            <li>I get buildup really easily, which leaves my hair dull and sometimes greasy looking underneath.</li>
            <li>, I will have to give it a few more tries before I decide on whether I like it or not.</li>
            <li>I had no other service at the salon that day - had dropped by to have hair  washed</li>
            <li>(I live in a very  dry desert environment).  </li>

            <li> Too bad, because I love the smell of the product.  </li>
            <li> I have long thick coarse curly hair, that is generally dry</li>
            <li> So I used this polish, and yes, it is weird scrubbing your hair, but it rinsed right out</li>
            <li> Left the salon with it towel dried, and air dried it the rest of the way.  </li>
            <li> I have medium thick mostly straight caucasian hair that I dye magenta at least once a month.  </li>
            <li> but I feel it&#x27;s not worth the money.  </li>

            <li> I have extremely dry scalp, dandruff, thick cradle cap (like babies, but thicker).  </li>
            <li> Not happy will not use , it came open and half gone.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no way to say this without sounding creepy: but this stuff makes my hair as soft as a child&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li> Try getting hold of seller but not able to .</li>
            <li> Also, anytime I shower where there is hard water, my hair feels like hay.</li>
            <li> Despite the fact that it strips out color, I would use this product at least weekly if I could afford it.  </li>
            <li> I have washed my hair twice since (and gave it a deep conditioning),  and it still impossibly tangles and is so dull.  </li>
            <li> It feels a little weird on your hair when you are using it as it feels like sand and grit in your hair</li>
            <li> I colored my hair a few weeks ago and every since have felt like my hair has had this weird gunk or coating on it,</li>
            <li> I was appalled to see how dry and dull (and damaged)</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I think this product is very destructive.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a very unique product but I feel it&#x27;s not worth the money.  I feel as though using vinegar does just as good of a job in getting rid of product build-up!</li>
            <li> I have build up in my hair from using shampoo and conditioner with silicones in them. Also, anytime I shower where there is hard water, my hair feels like hay. I used this today for the first time and my hair is so glossy! Since I have fine hair I get buildup really easily, which leaves my hair dull and sometimes greasy looking underneath. This product took care of it better than any clarifying shampoo I have tried. I have pretty long hair but I only needed about a quarter size amount. Good product!</li>
            <li> I have long, thick and frizzy hair. This left my hair feeling soft, smooth, and shiny. This surprised me because it feels like liquid sand when you&#x27;re applying it. Does what it says it will do. Worth the price.</li>
            <li> A stylist used the Nature&#x27;s Rescue Shampoo, then the Nature&#x27;s Rescue Refining Sea Polish on my hair.  I have long thick coarse curly hair, that is generally dry (I live in a very  dry desert environment).  These products absolutely trashed my hair, stripping it of moisture and shine, making it dull and brittle.  I had no other service at the salon that day - had dropped by to have hair  washed so I didn&#x27;t have to do it that night at home.  Left the salon with it towel dried, and air dried it the rest of the way.  I was appalled to see how dry and dull (and damaged) it was.  Too bad, because I love the smell of the product.  I have washed my hair twice since (and gave it a deep conditioning),  and it still impossibly tangles and is so dull.  I think this product is very destructive.  Beware.</li>
            <li> Not happy will not use , it came open and half gone. Try getting hold of seller but not able to .</li>
            <li> I have medium thick mostly straight caucasian hair that I dye magenta at least once a month.  Despite the fact that it strips out color, I would use this product at least weekly if I could afford it.  There&#x27;s no way to say this without sounding creepy: but this stuff makes my hair as soft as a child&#x27;s hair (come on, we&#x27;ve all patted a kid on the head).  Follow this with One n Only argan oil conditioner from Sally&#x27;s and I&#x27;m set.  My only problem is there is just not enough in the bottle.  I have long hair and get maybe 4 treatments out of a bottle if I mix it with my dose of conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what happened to the lady from the desert with the curly hair.  Maybe you need a better conditioner like argan oil?  I find salon brand conditioners to usually only be so-so average compared to One n Only and Mystic Divine argan products I buy at Sally&#x27;s. I used this stuff when I was in Arizona and it worked the same.</li>
            <li> This does make my hair feel soft when I use it. I actually bought it to help with my scalp, which was itching and flaking in the winter.  It didn&#x27;t help at all with this. I do like using it, but for the price it doesn&#x27;t make a huge difference.  I won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> no idea why this is discontinued. I love it!</li>
            <li> WOW...my beautician told me to try some samples of this product so I did and I fell in love. It feels a little weird on your hair when you are using it as it feels like sand and grit in your hair but I am telling you it exfoliates all of the build up off of your hair. You will not be disappointed. LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff works awesome!!!! If you have recently colored your hair or are trying to purify your hair this stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li> I was in search of a deep cleanser for my hair and after debating between Redken&#x27;s Nature&#x27;s Rescue line and their Cleansing Cream, I decided to get the Nature&#x27;s Rescue line. The shampoo was okay, I will have to give it a few more tries before I decide on whether I like it or not. But the polish! Oh my lord this stuff is amazing! I had read reviews on how great it was and went \\&quot;yeah, yeah, but probably won&#x27;t work for my hair.\\&quot; I&#x27;m glad I tried it because it DOES work! I colored my hair a few weeks ago and every since have felt like my hair has had this weird gunk or coating on it, no matter what shampoo I used. So I used this polish, and yes, it is weird scrubbing your hair, but it rinsed right out and my hair was super soft and detangled and the build up was completely gone! I just cannot believe how well it worked! I followed with the Nature&#x27;s Rescue deep conditioner, which is really nice, thick and smooth but very lightweight. Redken really knocked it out of the park with these products and I will continue to buy, hope they never discontinue them!</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know if you need to have really damaged hair to see results with this product, i used it and didn&#x27;t see any difference....</li>
            <li> This is part of my hair care system &amp; I love this supplier!  Everything was in perfect order, and the price was the best in the market!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I like this product. I&#x27;ve been using it once a month. Rinses clean, I was a little worried about the beads getting stuck in. My hair. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I like the product so far. But still not completely sure it is the best. It does leave your scalp clean. For the price I expected a bigger size bottle.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry scalp, dandruff, thick cradle cap (like babies, but thicker).  After 2 or 3 uses, my dandruff was gone.  I now use it only when needed.  One use and I&#x27;m fine.  My hairdresser told me &amp;#34;whatever you&#x27;re doing, keep it up.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Makes hair soft...silky...and super clean! Easy to use...I use about 1-2 Times monthly. Love it. Love it. Love it. Tks</li>
            <li> I live the redken products. Redken Nature&#x27;s Rescue Refrining Sea polish Is a good product to use. Love it on my hair,</li>
