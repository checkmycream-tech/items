            <li>multi use item used for pistol sight for better acquisition</li>
            <li>from looking at my wheel and the stones I can see, it doesn&#x27;t look like many are imperfect or damaged.</li>
            <li>So glad I found these.</li>
            <li>They stay shiny too when you put polish on top of the rhinestone.</li>
            <li>WILL BE PURCHASING MORE ONCE</li>
            <li>but overall you get a ton of each color and there perfect nail size!!</li>
            <li>I tried putting top coat on and then add jewels, they would fall off.</li>
            <li>I tried putting a top coat over them to see if that would help keep them in place</li>
            <li>I recommend for sure</li>
            <li>I love these.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product that was received in a decent amount of time.  </li>
            <li>, it arrived very quickly and in wonderful condition and the wheel was taped shut so that the stones didn&#x27;t fall out or get mixed up.</li>
            <li>I have bought two of these wheels and I am so happy with them I will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li>The wheel is full of rinestones and is a much better value than the wheels at the beauty supply store in my area.   </li>
            <li>You get so much for the price, and these really are beautiful colors.</li>
            <li>I ordered 2 of these to get the free shipping.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-2 Purple (light,</li>
            <li>/&gt;Despite any negatives I gave above about this product, I think it is a good value</li>
            <li>but regardless it is a good number of different colors.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The colors are pretty, tons of them, and they are easy to stick on.</li>
            <li>Ebay and other sellers have better deals with better rhinestones!</li>
            <li>ordering and shipping was quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>They were full and super shiny and bright, love the light blue color and red.</li>
            <li>I then turned the wheel over and it was jam packed with all these colorful stones for my nails.  </li>
            <li>These were exactly as described, with lots and lots of crystals in a nice big disc.</li>
            <li>Many of the colors were short on rhinestones.</li>
            <li>These rhinestones are exactly what I thought they would be.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping too!  </li>
            <li>This product was exactly as advertised.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will try once more, to purchase this, and hope that the colors are varied, and not the same as I got this time.</li>
            <li>not as this is the first time I used jewels on my nails doing it myself.</li>
            <li>It is exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>exactly like images.</li>
            <li>just be aware that it is just 1mm unless they updated their inventory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several colors and really like how they look, I purchased these to use as nail Bling and it does its job :)</li>
            <li>The colors are all very vibrant, I can&#x27;t wait to try them all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>would certainly purchase this item again</li>
            <li>I also really wanted gold.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The 12 slots each have 1 color in them, and when I look closely some stones look smaller than others, but most look to be the same size, so I can&#x27;t say for certain if there are really 2 sizes.</li>
            <li>not even half as many in the container as you see in the picture</li>
            <li>The only con I have is that I don&#x27;t think there are two different sized rhinestones in the wheel, but that&#x27;s ok with me because the ones I got are the size I wanted.</li>
            <li>good quality shipping alright and last for ages unless ur the type that changes color everyday</li>
            <li>stones are bright &amp; reflective as the colors have silver reflective bases behind them (</li>
            <li>then i thought it would be, but the number of rhinestones was surprisingly large, it has a full rainbow to choose from as well as clear(silver) and black.</li>
            <li>The wheel came in quite a large box (I thought maybe I got extra gifts or something</li>
            <li>but there seemed to be more than half of the light blue missing from the package.</li>
            <li>It did not come with gold or white, or light pink.</li>
            <li>Also, the wheel in the picture looked MUCH fuller than the one that I finally recieved after waiting weeks to get.</li>
            <li>I used them on my 5 and 6 years old granddaughter&#x27;s fingernails and they still didn&#x27;t show up.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted white stones, which this photo shows 3 sections, which is why I ordered this.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted white or silver stones as pictured!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;the rhinestones are very tiny but it is great if you have small to average size hands and nails.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, I would say it&#x27;s quite full and will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d actually have to spill the package out to really count &amp; tell, and there are ENOUGH stones in there that I don&#x27;t want to do that.</li>
            <li>The only complaint I have with this is that the top doesn&#x27;t seal well.</li>
            <li>It gets rhinestones stuck and can barely turn.</li>
            <li>Apparently even though the name and description says 1mm AND 2mm</li>
            <li>I was also pleasantly surprised to find that my wheel is rather full, just like the item image since some people complained about their wheels seeming</li>
            <li>Love these stones, searched high a low for these, saw some that were not as plentifull and way too expensive.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to use jewels without feeling reserves on the cost of the little suckers</li>
            <li>It adds just a little bit of sparkle and is really pretty.</li>
            <li>Theirs just have a few rinestones in them and the price is much higher.  </li>

            <li> Red, Orage, Light/baby blue, dark blue, aqua (greenish blue), lime green, dark green, light pink, dark pink, light purple, dark purple, and black.&lt;br /&gt;I wish it had clear/silver</li>
            <li> The colors I got in my wheel are pink, emerald green, ruby red, aqua, lime green, fuschia, light blue, lavender purple, orange, royal purple, black, and blue.</li>

            <li> Was surprised to see how small compared to picture</li>
            <li> The only other thing about this is it&#x27;s annoying that when you turn the wheel or tilt the package, stones get stuck to the top of the package or drop into the next slot, mixing up the colors.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like these rhinestones but the wheel they come in absolutely sucks!</li>
            <li> Pink (light/baby, dark/</li>
            <li> I am guessing this product must have evolved over time slightly from what is shown in the photo and from what other reviewers describe.  </li>
            <li> but it was just this tiny little wheel (yes the wheel is quite small).  </li>
            <li> they arrived, I decided not to use them as previously thought.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;-1 Black</li>
            <li> all except black which is ALL black, v.nice).</li>

            <li> /&gt;-2 Green (light/spring, Dark/primary)&lt;br</li>
            <li> but my daughter seems to have misplaced it.)</li>
            <li> Wheel is small with opening you slide to get to color of your choice.  </li>
            <li> I usually do that</li>
            <li> They are fairly small and if you don&#x27;t need them I would consider purchasing them for like a buck elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I placed my order Sunday night (very late I might add)</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s approximately 600...</li>
            <li> I counted mine and it was around 2100 so about 300 shy of the 2400.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> I have a wheel of unused rhinestones.&lt;br /&gt;Great price and service - bad idea !</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in the size of the stones.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought these for the colors which appear to be included in the wheel. Out of the two that I received, neither include silver rhinestones. I would not have purchased these had that been the case.</li>
            <li> Many of the colors were short on rhinestones. Also, the wheel in the picture looked MUCH fuller than the one that I finally recieved after waiting weeks to get. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this wheel of rhinestones, especially for the price. Ebay and other sellers have better deals with better rhinestones!</li>
            <li> Cheaper than any wheel you can find in the stores. Good quality and great deal with the super saver shipping. It&#x27;s nice to use jewels without feeling reserves on the cost of the little suckers</li>
            <li> This is the 1st order I have made on Amazon so I didnt know what to expect.  I placed my order Sunday night (very late I might add) and I got my package today (Wednesday).  The wheel came in quite a large box (I thought maybe I got extra gifts or something lol) but it was just this tiny little wheel (yes the wheel is quite small).  I then turned the wheel over and it was jam packed with all these colorful stones for my nails.  THEY&#x27;RE THE PERFECT SIZE, COLOR AND AMOUNT!!!    I must say that this was a great 1st experience and I will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> This was a great value!   The wheel is full of rinestones and is a much better value than the wheels at the beauty supply store in my area.   Theirs just have a few rinestones in them and the price is much higher.  I ordered 2 of these to get the free shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several colors and really like how they look, I purchased these to use as nail Bling and it does its job :) Would for sure recommend and have to the girl at my salon that used to do my manicures.....</li>
            <li> These rhinestones are exactly what I thought they would be.  Perfectly tiny for using in nail art.  Wheel is small with opening you slide to get to color of your choice.  Very satisfied.  There are so many rhinestones and the colors are great.</li>
            <li> I expected the rhinestones to be larger.I&#x27;ve been looking at nail art and the ones in the stores are bigger than these.  I am very disappointed in the size of the stones.  I haven&#x27;t used them yet because I&#x27;ve been trying to figure out how to get them on my nails without smearing the polish.</li>
            <li> Why oh why I wonder can&#x27;t these tiny things be picked up? I tried tweezers, a dotting Len...everything. You can&#x27;t pick them up. Waste.</li>
            <li> multi use item used for pistol sight for better acquisition</li>
            <li> The wheel was smaller then i thought it would be, but the number of rhinestones was surprisingly large, it has a full rainbow to choose from as well as clear(silver) and black. The size makes them perfect for nail art.</li>
            <li> not even half as many in the container as you see in the picture</li>
            <li> The only con I have is that I don&#x27;t think there are two different sized rhinestones in the wheel, but that&#x27;s ok with me because the ones I got are the size I wanted. The colors are beautiful, there wasn&#x27;t any white/clear in my wheel, but I can get those at Hobby Lobby. The colors I got in my wheel are pink, emerald green, ruby red, aqua, lime green, fuschia, light blue, lavender purple, orange, royal purple, black, and blue. The colors are all very vibrant, I can&#x27;t wait to try them all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just from looking at my wheel and the stones I can see, it doesn&#x27;t look like many are imperfect or damaged. I was also pleasantly surprised to find that my wheel is rather full, just like the item image since some people complained about their wheels seeming skimpy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would certainly purchase this item again, it arrived very quickly and in wonderful condition and the wheel was taped shut so that the stones didn&#x27;t fall out or get mixed up.</li>
            <li> Love these stones, searched high a low for these, saw some that were not as plentifull and way too expensive. One place had like 100 rhinestones for 17 bucks!!! So glad I found these. Now I have all three wheels!!</li>
            <li> Great product for the price.  Fast shipping too!  I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> These rhinestones are too tiny. I used them on my 5 and 6 years old granddaughter&#x27;s fingernails and they still didn&#x27;t show up.  They were misshapped, only one size and the product was supposed to have 200 of each color but there seemed to be more than half of the light blue missing from the package. I would not buy these again.</li>
            <li> These were exactly as described, with lots and lots of crystals in a nice big disc. I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Great bargain.  Lots of color choices.</li>
            <li> You get so much for the price, and these really are beautiful colors. I have bought two of these wheels and I am so happy with them I will be buying more in the future. For those of you wondering, all you need is a coat of clear polish over your nail and these will stick perfectly. I usually do that and then another to seal it in once they have set.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these for years and they work very nice. They stay shiny too when you put polish on top of the rhinestone.</li>
            <li> PRODUCT WAS ABSOLUTELY GREAT MY GIRL LOVES THEM TO DEATH. USE THEM ON HER NAILS. OUR DAUGHTERS NAILS. HER FRIENDS NAILS. VERY BIG HIT WITH HER!!! WILL BE PURCHASING MORE ONCE SHE RUNS OUT. WOULD RECOMEND TO ANY ONE WHO DOES NAIS AND USES RHINESTONES.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;The ordering and shipping was quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;When they arrived, I decided not to use them as previously thought.&lt;br /&gt;Now I have a wheel of unused rhinestones.&lt;br /&gt;Great price and service - bad idea !</li>
            <li> The colors are not as shown, or I would have given 5 stars.  The quality and quantity is great for the price.  It did not come with gold or white, or light pink. My wheel has dark pink, dark blue,  dark green, light green , light blue, medium blue, black, orange, purple and red.  I really wanted white stones, which this photo shows 3 sections, which is why I ordered this.  I also really wanted gold.  I will try once more, to purchase this, and hope that the colors are varied, and not the same as I got this time.</li>
            <li> Got my product very quickly and in perfect shape.  Had hoped that they would be even smaller but they did the trick for the repair.</li>
            <li> Awesome product and wonderful customer service</li>
            <li> Was surprised to see how small compared to picture but overall you get a ton of each color and there perfect nail size!!</li>
            <li> I am guessing this product must have evolved over time slightly from what is shown in the photo and from what other reviewers describe.  I got my wheel yesterday, and there are 12 colors shown, but no silver or white that are shown in the product photo.  Plus I dont believe there are actually 2 sizes included.  But...there are PLENTY of stones included in the package though, I would say it&#x27;s quite full and will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12 Colors included:&lt;br /&gt;-2 Pink (light/baby, dark/fuschia)&lt;br /&gt;-1 Red&lt;br /&gt;-1 Orange&lt;br /&gt;-2 Green (light/spring, Dark/primary)&lt;br /&gt;-3 Blue (baby blue, medium/&#x27;teal&#x27;, and Dark/Royal)&lt;br /&gt;-2 Purple (light, dark)&lt;br /&gt;-1 Black&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stones are bright &amp; reflective as the colors have silver reflective bases behind them (all except black which is ALL black, v.nice). The 12 slots each have 1 color in them, and when I look closely some stones look smaller than others, but most look to be the same size, so I can&#x27;t say for certain if there are really 2 sizes. I&#x27;d actually have to spill the package out to really count &amp; tell, and there are ENOUGH stones in there that I don&#x27;t want to do that. The only other thing about this is it&#x27;s annoying that when you turn the wheel or tilt the package, stones get stuck to the top of the package or drop into the next slot, mixing up the colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite any negatives I gave above about this product, I think it is a good value and I look forward to using it.  I would recommend it....although I may choose another product next time b/c I really wanted white or silver stones as pictured!!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it is the greatest thing I&#x27;ve used on my nails, but it&#x27;s okay. You get a variety of colors, however I couldn&#x27;t get mine to stay on. I tried putting top coat on and then add jewels, they would fall off. I tried putting a top coat over them to see if that would help keep them in place and that didn&#x27;t work either. I don&#x27;t know if that makes them faulty or not as this is the first time I used jewels on my nails doing it myself. I can say when the salon puts them on they don&#x27;t fall off.</li>
            <li> Very good inexpensive...good quality shipping alright and last for ages unless ur the type that changes color everyday but I do recommend</li>
            <li> I  have used them for art projects with great success</li>
            <li> Only has 1 size and it looked low so I counted one color and came up with 56. That&#x27;s approximately 600...not 2400. (I was going to add a picture but my daughter seems to have misplaced it.)</li>
            <li> They were full and super shiny and bright, love the light blue color and red.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that was received in a decent amount of time.  It is exactly as advertised.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Got these for my girlfriend and she loves them. Good value for the money as well. I recommend for sure</li>
            <li> I really like these rhinestones but the wheel they come in absolutely sucks! It gets rhinestones stuck and can barely turn. Also when I received this product the rhinestones were completely mixed up. They are fairly small and if you don&#x27;t need them I would consider purchasing them for like a buck elsewhere.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have with this is that the top doesn&#x27;t seal well. I may have to move these to a different container to keep items from spilling all over the floor. The colors are pretty, tons of them, and they are easy to stick on. I use them for nails and poly clay beads.</li>
            <li> Good quality. good product. exactly like images.</li>
            <li> I love these.  I do a lot of nail stamping and like to add these to my stamped design.  It adds just a little bit of sparkle and is really pretty.</li>
            <li> 2400???? I don&#x27;t think so there only 30 pcs of each color</li>
            <li> Apparently even though the name and description says 1mm AND 2mm it really only had just 1mm.&lt;br /&gt;The wheel was extremely tiny but had a ton in it.  I counted mine and it was around 2100 so about 300 shy of the 2400.&lt;br /&gt;If you are buying it from Jed Mart (mine was from them but fulfilled by amazon) just be aware that it is just 1mm unless they updated their inventory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the rhinestones are very tiny but it is great if you have small to average size hands and nails.&lt;br /&gt;I got the following colors: Red, Orage, Light/baby blue, dark blue, aqua (greenish blue), lime green, dark green, light pink, dark pink, light purple, dark purple, and black.&lt;br /&gt;I wish it had clear/silver but regardless it is a good number of different colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i couldn&#x27;t give the actual product 5 stars because there were some where the plastic was attached on the side and some edges cut off to make it irregular.</li>
            <li> Great nail jewels. They arrived soon after order. I have no complaints about this product! I will order again as soon as I run out, which won&#x27;t be anytime soon.</li>
