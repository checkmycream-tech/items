            <li>I must say that it was a very good investment.</li>

            <li>Great for detangling 4c hair.</li>
            <li>The Q-Redew has worked great for me.</li>
            <li>Works great</li>
            <li>Great customer service when I call..</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it is a great product.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do as great a job as the hooded steamers, but its great for a midweek moisture booster.</li>
            <li>There are a couple of great reviews out their on youtube by nauralista&#x27;s that you should check out if you are on the fence about this product.</li>
            <li>It was great while it lasted.</li>
            <li>This is a great steamer but the stream sometimes collects and drips on your skin.  </li>
            <li>I contacted the owner and he was very nice.</li>
            <li>I coat my hair with a good oil and then use my steamer for about 25 minutes.  </li>
            <li>but there is a good reason for it.&lt;br /&gt;Ever</li>
            <li>It does a good job.  </li>
            <li>The steam feels really good on my hair.  </li>
            <li>idea of it is good but for me I could not make it work for my regimen.</li>
            <li>quality product, good results, even with a defective one.</li>
            <li>In fact,  I own a great Huetiful hair steamer that works like a champ with results.  </li>
            <li>It is a good way to add moisture to your hair too.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product a while ago and have used the product on and off for a good amount of time to test it out.</li>
            <li>The steams works great for re-moisturizing and stretching the hair (love this).</li>
            <li>She said that she had used a friend&#x27;s, loved the way it softened her hair, and came to the show specifically to purchase her own at the promotional price.</li>
            <li>I love my Q redew!  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the results, my hair looking good and full and happy.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the results, my hair looking good and full and happy.</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad someone told me about this product!  </li>
            <li>and I am glad you contacted me now because I used a gift card with that purchase!  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the first example of excellent customer</li>
            <li>will give it 2 more times but 3 strikes and you&#x27;re out!</li>
            <li>and it felt fabulous!!</li>
            <li>I love the Q-Redew!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Buyer the aware, save your money!!!!</li>
            <li>An amazing product that works well on my 4C hair.</li>
            <li>nothing amazing for my 4c hair.</li>
            <li>Amazing product....</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>the Q-Redew, you can basically apply steam, whenever and wherever needed on your hair at your own convenience.</li>
            <li>Nice to use with conditioner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this is a good product for some.</li>
            <li>Nice device.</li>
            <li>This Q-Redew is nice</li>
            <li>The whole concept of the product is great!</li>
            <li>Nice product.  </li>
            <li>I used it right away after it was delivered and my curls came out  beautiful, moist and bouncy.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d love this product IF it worked!  </li>
            <li>The Q-Redew is, by far, the best tool I have ever purchased for my hair.</li>
            <li>I wish, though, that the teeth part were thinner and more abundant.  </li>
            <li>Overall,.im pretty happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>It barely produces any steam, intermittent at best.</li>
            <li>This product is good for providing quick steaming treatments to hair.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I truly love it</li>
            <li>Love this steamer.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m just not using it correctly or if its better suited for someone with thinner hair or a looser curl pattern.</li>
            <li>I am in love .</li>
            <li>I am really in love with this .</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to stop touching my hair now.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I got the steamer at the recommendation of many Kinky/Natural Hair care sites and posts.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I viewed YouTube demonstrations after the fact to get a better understanding of how it works.  </li>
            <li>(bought it at amazon.com) and I am so satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to use it! :)</li>
            <li>&amp; I love it.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely in love with the Q-Redew.</li>
            <li>have never been able to do the things I can do now, before getting the Q-Redew.</li>
            <li>I love this product..</li>
            <li>Love Love Love.</li>
            <li>I love my Q-Redew.</li>
            <li>Heidi gets 10 more stars for how she handled this issue.</li>
            <li>My hair was actually more moisturized and looked way better before I used the steamer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gets rid of most of my frizz, redefines my curls, and gives me some needed volume after a night of wearing my hair up in a ponytail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It work better when you steam your hair in sections and then seal it with you favorite hair oil.</li>
            <li>those two together are magic for mt hair.</li>
            <li>It even worked on refreshing and renewing curly wigs.</li>
            <li>So I added more water.</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the product</li>
            <li>Therefore, if you have not used a friends and are 100% sure you want to keep item, do not buy.  </li>
            <li>Zero stars is more appropriate.</li>
            <li>I am able to maintain my hair throughout the week and add moisture.</li>
            <li>but so did spraying them with water, and the Q-Redew reshapes and wakes up my curls so much better than spraying them ever did.</li>
            <li>It works perfectly with my afro textured low porosity hair.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this.</li>
            <li>I have NEVER had a better product.</li>
            <li>The texture on top always breaks no matter the technique.</li>
            <li>I pull out the Q-Redew and its detangled, oiled, and styled in 10 minutes at the most</li>
            <li>AND it looks, feels, and is healthy.</li>
            <li>I can not express how much I love this thing.</li>
            <li>My my $20 clothes steamer works better at 1/3 the price.  </li>
            <li>I find using the steamer provides moisture without soaking my hair and makes my hair more pliable.</li>
            <li>So then why do so many of your units malfunction?</li>
            <li>the results and I was pleased and bought it.</li>
            <li>… Love it-</li>
            <li>Spray bottle revives my curls better.</li>
            <li>Maybe when I get more length I will revisit</li>
            <li>It works perfectly, thanks to their great phone support.  </li>
            <li>my hair becomes much more manageable.</li>
            <li>I would need to rewet my hair and hope for the best on day 2 and definitely on day 3!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for refreshing a hair style and deep conditioning.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s better for use with longer hair.</li>
            <li>Great customer service and a very helpful tool.</li>
            <li>Loved it at first.  </li>
            <li>It does not mist the hair, instead it provides warm very humidified air- 2 stars for honest advertising.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m grateful to the young woman who told me about this great product.  </li>
            <li>but you can’t so out with a wet head in the winter, this thing, detangles, stretches and revives my curls perfectly!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always happy when I get my goodies early.</li>
            <li>The Q-Redew is the best thing that ever happened to my 4C, very dry hair!</li>
            <li>I just want big happy healthy hair.</li>
            <li>I just want big happy healthy hair.</li>
            <li>but it’s easy to wipe it off, and</li>
            <li>The steam makes it easy to detangle my hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use</li>
            <li>It  adds moisture, curl enhancement, and easy detangling to my hair.</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to used.</li>
            <li>Easy way to stretcg my hair without breaking it off</li>
            <li>The steam is warm and not too hot to the touch.  </li>
            <li>It was decided that the connection between the reservoir and pump wasn&#x27;t a good one, so they would send out a new reservoir</li>
            <li>, that was fine in the summer</li>
            <li>Great steamer if your looking for something quick and less cumbersome than sitting under your hooded Huetiful steamer (which works exceptionally well).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I recommend watching online demonstrations for people with your hair type to make sure it’s worth adding to your hair product collection.  </li>
            <li>My hair is much healthier as well as nicely curled.  </li>
            <li>But Heidi offered to ship it for free, at the show price.</li>
            <li>2-3 timer and use a light moisturizer and seal with oil.</li>
            <li>It is also great for wash day for deep conditioning.</li>
            <li>only con I have experienced is that I have to refill the thing after each section of hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>This is a good product for someone that is natural.</li>
            <li>Ladies please get this product, if you are a natural this is a good product to have in your health hair care section.</li>
            <li>Okay so at first I was happy with this product, however I did not know that you are supposed to use it constantly.</li>
            <li>The steamer heats up pretty quickly and delivers!!</li>
            <li>I looked in the claws of the steamer first for some steam that didn&#x27;t really flow out that good ,and saw the residue from the products I had put on my hair.</li>
            <li>After washing a light conditioner was applied then sit under the steamer followed by cool rinse.</li>
            <li>And, it&#x27;s very portable for easy travel on the go!</li>
            <li>Really like this product for detailing and refreshing purposes between washes...</li>
            <li>My curls are really softer and more rejuvenated after using it.</li>
            <li>So overall, I think this is a good product.</li>
            <li>Nourishing moist heat to stretch and detangle hair, revive an old style, allows conditioning products to better penetrate the shaft for DEEP conditioning---a great product.</li>
            <li>Fair enough.</li>
            <li>And I want to have my hair look good the next day as well.</li>
            <li>Good product, would definitely recommend for burst of moisture</li>
            <li>Will use a heat protectant and follow by cool spritz to close cubicles and a leave in  conditioner w slip and coconut oil Shea butter</li>
            <li>I love that the product heats up quick 1-2 mins and that I can &amp;#34;seam&amp;#34; my whole head in about 3 mins.</li>
            <li>Works well and shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>And it has helped tremendously.  </li>
            <li>love this product and am so glad i finally purchased.</li>
            <li>My defined waves quickly turned into an Afro.</li>
            <li>If you are not washing your hair on a particular day; use the QREDEW you will love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product and use it to put moister back in my hair as I wear kinky twists extensions most of the and am often concerned about the moisture level in my hair.</li>
            <li>Great as a refresher on old styles for my natural 4C hair.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very satisfied with this product</li>
            <li>/&gt;Negatives:  Steam is very hot.</li>
            <li>Very hot.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this steamer for all the beautiful Black women who are now wearing their lovely curls naturally.</li>
            <li>I truly love how Q-Redew kept my 3b hair soft, supple and curly for days!</li>
            <li>I used to have a full sized steamer before giving it away and I love this option much better because, it does not take up a lot of space, and is easy to use on my lazy days.</li>
            <li>Ladies although you may have a found a loop hole around buying this device, you might end up experiencing the damage I experienced just to save a few bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although I have spent a great deal of time, money, and energy on my hair-styling efforts, I have never been able to properly detangle my hair.</li>
            <li>Every time I plug it in now, it just has a fast blinking light and overheats.&lt;br</li>
            <li>We will see if it was worth the risk...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money</li>
            <li>My hair responds well to the drenching moisture of a warm shower followed by a leave in conditioner like Mixed Chicks.</li>
            <li>My product was shipped super fast!</li>
            <li>but when I use it, it is RIGHT</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the right temperature and pressure not to cause frizz</li>
            <li>If you have the type of hair that looks great after you&#x27;ve taken a long walk on the beach in the ocean mist or responds well to deep south extreme humidity--this product will work GREAT for you.</li>
            <li>Wow, Wow, Wow, this is the only words I can honestly use to describe how happy I am with the Q-Redew.  </li>
            <li>I spent a great deal of time early on in my natural hair journey trying to find ways to safely use combs and brushes on my hair.</li>
            <li>This item is so worth the money---it really works!</li>
            <li>So I tried using it while conditioning my hair, my hair barely heated up (it did a better job steaming up by itself in a shower cap).</li>
            <li>but the Q-Redew is specially designed to use on and go through your hair which I found particularly helpful towards detangling.</li>
            <li>That steamer is definitely good for clothes, but not for hair (but that is whole other review).</li>
            <li>I was really excited when I ordered this as I am newly going</li>
            <li>and it got pretty hot.</li>
            <li>this thing gets really hot and at times spittles hot boiling water.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off getting a regular steamer</li>
            <li>I was able to bring my thirsty strands back in between shampoos</li>
            <li>Steaming my hair is EXACTLY what I needed.</li>
            <li>I can safely remove all of my shed hair, and stretching my hair has never been so simple.</li>
            <li>I was very DISPLEASED with this item!  </li>
            <li>When the first replacement reservoir arrived cracked, she immediately sent another, with a hand written note apologizing for the inconvenience.</li>
            <li>I just received my steamer on Saturday and the used it for the first time yesterday.  </li>
            <li>Love it overall.</li>
            <li>It did exactly what I needed it to do.</li>
            <li>Does get really hot.</li>
            <li>I use more steam to deep condition or to moisturize my hair with coconut or jojoba oil.</li>
            <li>Nice invention.i would not use every morning for long period of time because too much steam shrinks my hair.</li>
            <li>Then a week later I discovered this product and now I am in love.</li>
            <li>Puffs of hot air.</li>
            <li>An alternative is to take a hot shower and allow the steam from the shower to add moisture.</li>
            <li>Personally, I do NOT look better under those conditions.</li>
            <li>I have not yet tried this using a leave in conditioner first, but I have heard that does wonders to keep the frizz at bay.</li>
            <li>To top it all off, it stopped giving out steam, so it went back.</li>
            <li>I used it the first time it worked well .</li>
            <li>I use it when I&#x27;m am doing a hot oil treatment to Detangle my hair and the boost of moisture from the steam</li>
            <li>My product arrived really early and as soon as I opened the box I immediately filled the reservoir with water and began steaming.</li>
            <li>Come on, make sure your units are working properly before sending them to customers so they won&#x27;t have these kinds of headaches.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely</li>
            <li>I am really interested to see how it works on softening and loosening my curl pattern after wearing in a &amp;#34;puff&amp;#34; or wash-n-go.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I love using this to add just amount of moisture to my hair with out having to spray it with water, especially in the winter months.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be a staple products once I grow my hair back again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ready to use in 20 seconds, and just keep a water bottle near for easy refills.</li>
            <li>Excellent for african american curly hair - added so much needed moisture esp after the big chop</li>
            <li>Used to go to high priced natural salon whose focus was  encouraging women to stop relaxing and hair health but focus was flat iron styles gorgeous cuts and one of the hair treatments was the steamer.</li>
            <li>I have returned two non-functioning units via their AWESOME customer service (really, they are very sweet) and thought the third one was a charm, but I was wrong.  </li>
            <li>The q-redew is a lot less hassle with the better results than my hooded steamer!</li>
            <li>I had read reviews and looked on Youtube and all of the reviews was positive.</li>
            <li>I like the vintage mint green color, and I am very pleased that I decided to purchase this product.</li>
            <li>I like the vintage mint green color, and I am very pleased that I decided to purchase this product.</li>
            <li>, my hair does also, I&#x27;m just not too confident in how long it will hold out.</li>
            <li>but I have never let it get more than an inch long before buzzing it off.</li>
            <li>Very convenient and does exactly what I needed it for.  </li>
            <li>It decides when it wants to release steam in a consistent matter.  </li>
            <li>I was never able to detangle my hair completely, and I experienced some matting because I couldn&#x27;t remove excess shed hair.</li>
            <li>I really think , who ever invented this</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use heat on my hair very often</li>
            <li>I really want to stress that in this review.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ready</li>
            <li>All in all, I really like the device</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it to my family and friends!</li>
            <li>I doubt I&#x27;ll be using my hooded steamer much now.  </li>
            <li>I like it better than using a spray bottle because your hair is not dripping wet after you use it.</li>
            <li>It provides so much moisture..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s how the company handles the situation and how they make you feel while doing so that really matters.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>so I still very texturized.</li>
            <li>I have 3A hair or botticelli curls that won´t stay overnight no matter how much product I use or what I do with them (</li>
            <li>Results are the same, and it&#x27;s free.</li>
            <li>I really like this product, it makes detangling so much easier.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ready for use.</li>
            <li>Sorry, but I am being brutally honest because I really wanted to LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t do much for my hair at this length</li>
            <li>so I can really feel the heat fast, but this answered my problems.  </li>
            <li>I do the LCO method almost every morning so this really helps.</li>
            <li>And it absolutely helps with detangling.</li>
            <li>If you have 4c (really 4e) type hair, then you need this.</li>
            <li>This gently keeps my hair moisturized and curly.  </li>
            <li>Well, it seems to only work when full or near full</li>
            <li>Tried to return item and received message this item is listed as hazardous and I need to dispose of it in a waste receptacle.</li>
            <li>I am newly natural and have a twa and was very excited to get this product based on the reviews but have only used it twice.</li>
            <li>easy to do bun on stretched</li>
            <li>I am excited about using this for my detangling and deep conditioning sessions.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am excited about using this for my detangling and deep conditioning sessions.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>I was satisfied with the customer service, but I read other reviews before making the purchase.</li>
            <li>I am able to detangle much quicker with a lot less breakage.</li>
            <li>This product would be nice but the water holder is way too small.</li>
            <li>I loved this thing so much i used  it for facials to steam my hair , to deep condition i used it everyday.</li>
            <li>I fill like if the receptacle was bigger, the steamer could not be handheld, so I&#x27;m cool with it.</li>
            <li>I tested it on my hair after a night out at a hot smokey club and my hair was completely refreshed and moisturized.</li>
            <li>After emailing the help line I received a quick response, I sent the device back (free shipping) and a new one was sent back to me within days.</li>
            <li>since I found out about this product I have been trying to come up with clever ways to steam my hair without shelling out all the money for the Q-Redew.</li>
            <li>I heard that it could help with detangling, which was my main motivation for buying it.</li>
            <li>Despite various attempts to love this gadget, It made my 2nd day curls seem as if I had rolled around in wool sheets all night.&lt;br /&gt;(My</li>
            <li>Overall, I bought this product with the premise that I could use it to quickly steam or re-set my hairstyle.</li>
            <li>Not enough to leave a mark but enough to shock me and make me pay more attention to indicator</li>
            <li>steam in it does not last long, therefore I have to fill it many times before I can get my whole head steamed.</li>
            <li>NOT recommending this to anyone, the probability of receiving a malfunctioning unit is too high.</li>
            <li>I think it should be a little more durable.</li>
            <li>or it doesn’t produce enough steam, this things kicks out stream and its HOT!  </li>
            <li>I have 2 different textures in my hair, fine 4b on top and thick 4a on bottom.</li>
            <li>I do my whole head of APL natural hair within 5-10 mins.</li>
            <li>Works really well for my natural hair.  </li>
            <li>it did give me really nice full curls, but unfortunately it included a layer of frizz.</li>
            <li>My hair needs water everyday, and during the winter steam is a much better option for me, rather than drenching or spraying with water.</li>
            <li>Like everyone else has said, the manufacturers need to create a larger reservoir and make it so that current owners are able to change out the old one for the new one.  </li>
            <li>Great result and did not take a  long to dry as wet</li>
            <li>A few days ago I received my new hair steamer and it works even better than before.</li>
            <li>, the water chamber needs to be double the size, it needs an off switch, needs a better way to remove all the water from the chamber for immediate storage, and prevent mold for those who can&#x27;t wait to air dry the water chamber.</li>
            <li>For women like me with a big coily bush to manage, this is better than spritzing your dry hair with water to retwist or reset your hair.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this tool for any natural curlies!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s looking like a good third day hair where my curls are full and yet still a little defined but not a matted mess.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s looking like a good third day hair where my curls are full and yet still a little defined but not a matted mess.</li>
            <li>I just received my new Q-Redew today</li>
            <li>He immediately sent me a new working Q-Redew and I returned my damage one.</li>
            <li>Cant live without it.</li>
            <li>The company said i could clean it with vinegar and water to see if it would open back still nothing all i get now is hot air and an occasional burst of steam very fustrating considering what i paid for it.</li>
            <li>(I use distilled water only) until it becomes filled up, and then you snap it back into place.</li>
            <li>highly recommend to my natural sistas….</li>
            <li>It make my hair very soft and moisturized</li>
            <li>When I first purchased the device it was defective, I had to send it back for a new one.</li>
            <li>I use it for deep conditioning, hot oil treatments, to hydrate, and refresh my hair.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure I&#x27;m not the only person living internationally with this product as I&#x27;ve read in other reviews.</li>
            <li>Detangling my coily, natural hair is a breeze!</li>
            <li>Maybe it is good for other hair types, but definitely not for really soft curly hair that has trouble holding curl after the first day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s steam you can run right out the house and not worry about it needing to dry.</li>
            <li>My hair simply LOVES steam, and my hair strands stretch out straight nearly instantaneously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My curls are soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my hair soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>My hair no longer feels brittle, but feels soft.</li>
            <li>I really wish I could have my money back.</li>
            <li>The tool itself is rather lightweight and not heavy at all.</li>
            <li>Only con is water in steamer runs out fast have to change it every 5mins.</li>
            <li>(so far).</li>
            <li>a nutshell, this makes my hair soft and frizzy, does not refresh my curls</li>
            <li>This is a natural girl staple.</li>
            <li>I have had natural hair for over 20 years</li>
            <li>this summer, i attended a natural hair show and saw the company founder demonstrating this product that I had never heard of.</li>
            <li>, I wish my soft feeling lasted longer</li>
            <li>It sat in its box for a while because I was transitioning from relaxed to natural and I was wearing my hair in braids at the time.</li>
            <li>Makes my Afro soft and feel moisturized.</li>
            <li>I decided to relax by hair after 3 years natura l because I couldn&#x27;t deal with my unruly natural hair anymore.</li>
            <li>I used it and my hair felt so soft and moisurized afterwards and it also leightens the hair.</li>
            <li>With this method my hair stays soft for four days instead of 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Like what I&#x27;ve seen so far.</li>
            <li>I encouraged every natural girl she needed to get one.</li>
            <li>last the whole time i am steaming my hair</li>
            <li>First of all, this product gets REALLY hot, so if you are going to use it you need to be careful not to get it too close to your ears, scalp, etc because it will definitely hurt.</li>
            <li>it worked better for that at least.</li>
            <li>This product makes your hair feel soft and manageable and your hair is not saturated with water.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair so soft and keeps my curls moisturize.</li>
            <li>and I have natural hair.  </li>
            <li>I have fairly thick shoulder length healthy hair.  </li>
            <li>used it a few times at first, because it was my new toy, but didn&#x27;t really need it during the summer.</li>
            <li>I used the Q-Redew to bring moisture to my hair because it was pretty dry.</li>
            <li>The steam isn&#x27;t too hot and works wonders for detangling 2nd or 3rd day hair.</li>
            <li>I use to refresh wash n gos, but I mainly use it for deep conditioning.  </li>
            <li>Her recommendation partially fixed the problem and then she sent me a new reservoir to totally fix it.</li>
            <li>That NEVER happens in my braidouts when following my normal hair routine.  </li>
            <li>I expected this to work a little better.</li>
            <li>Where I live the voltage is 120, and I have numerous products that work with this voltage.</li>
            <li>Their warranty is only 90 days, not even close to a year, which means they would not find it unreasonable for me to buy a new one every three months.  </li>
            <li>One last point, I saw some chatter about using a regular clothes steamer since they are much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>ESPECIALLY if I know they&#x27;re buying it from outside the US for so much money.</li>
            <li>My hair was left very soft and not soggy</li>
            <li>For my 4c hair that constantly needs moisturizing, this little gadget is simple and easy to use in the mornings.</li>
            <li>Heidi, tried to trouble shoot the issue with me by making suggestions to clean it with vinegar mixed with water however it still did not work.</li>
            <li>I only had to refill this once to complete my hair.</li>
            <li>I only had to refill this once to complete my hair.</li>
            <li>I would not hold this near for my face for a facial-</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product for any woman with natural hair that is having difficulty with the detangling process.</li>
            <li>Will definitely recommend if you are natural or textlaxed.</li>
            <li>I put vinegar mixed with water to fix the problem but so far nothing has changed.</li>
            <li>Only reason I haven&#x27;t given 5 stars is I haven&#x27;t seen how it works on my natural hair with no extensions.</li>
            <li>In one of my refills I apparently did not let it heat up all the way and scalding water dropped out and burned my shoulder.</li>
            <li>I wear my hair natural and live in a desert areas, so my hair tends to be very dry.  </li>
            <li>like I can just send it back ,I live internationally.</li>
            <li>My hair texture is coarse, dry, fine and tight curled.</li>
            <li>Although I was able to retain more length and break less hair with this method, it was extremely time consuming and tedious.</li>
            <li>Slightly cumbersome during my first experience using the product.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s start with the fact that I got the product 3 days earlier than predicted, major plus!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have hard water, however, I haven&#x27;t tried to clean it with vinegar yet.</li>
            <li>Hard to clean.</li>
            <li>I recently did my big chop and am completely natural.</li>
            <li>In my experience, the product did not produce nearly enough steam to even mildly steam my thick, natural hair.</li>
            <li>I also dropped it once in the bathroom and now the little container that holds the water doesn&#x27;t stay in all the way, so it drops hot water on me sometimes.</li>
            <li>got the Q-Redew to moisturize my heat stretched natural hair.</li>
            <li>few tips; do not overfill the water reservoir because steam will not come out, the prongs will get pretty dusty/messy from any debris/ residue in your hair</li>
            <li>My hair is down my back, but that has more to do with luck than anything else, considering the detangling struggles I have had in the past.</li>
            <li>the reservoir does not hold enough water and can be tiring using this consistently because it is a little bulky.</li>
            <li>I use this for 2nd and 3rd day hair days, My daughter has all natural african american hair and she loves it.. .. you can use for deep conditioning and even steam facials.</li>
            <li>Instead I ended up with a hot frizzy mess!</li>
            <li>decided to get a Q-Redew after seeing a few tutorials and reading positive reviews about the product.</li>
            <li>Extremely disappointed, especially since I heard such great things about it.</li>
            <li>I know the price is scarey, but go sign up on the Q-Redew mailing list and wait on a good coupon, I used a $20 off coupon I got for a Black Friday sale, so in the end, the damage to my hair from the clothes steamer and the coupon made me decide to fork out the money for this device.</li>
            <li>When I let it go natural, I wake up with some curls, some flat, some sticking up in strange ways.  </li>
            <li>Detangled thick curly hair very well!!</li>
            <li>Being a low porosity natural, my hair tends to be very dry.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Works great</li>
            <li> Great customer service when I call..</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it is a great product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do as great a job as the hooded steamers, but its great for a midweek moisture booster.</li>
            <li> There are a couple of great reviews out their on youtube by nauralista&#x27;s that you should check out if you are on the fence about this product.</li>
            <li> It was great while it lasted.</li>
            <li> This is a great steamer but the stream sometimes collects and drips on your skin.  </li>
            <li> I contacted the owner and he was very nice.</li>
            <li> I coat my hair with a good oil and then use my steamer for about 25 minutes.  </li>
            <li> but there is a good reason for it.&lt;br /&gt;Ever</li>
            <li> It does a good job.  </li>
            <li> The steam feels really good on my hair.  </li>
            <li> idea of it is good but for me I could not make it work for my regimen.</li>
            <li> quality product, good results, even with a defective one.</li>
            <li> In fact,  I own a great Huetiful hair steamer that works like a champ with results.  </li>
            <li> It is a good way to add moisture to your hair too.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a while ago and have used the product on and off for a good amount of time to test it out.</li>
            <li> The steams works great for re-moisturizing and stretching the hair (love this).</li>
            <li> She said that she had used a friend&#x27;s, loved the way it softened her hair, and came to the show specifically to purchase her own at the promotional price.</li>

            <li> I am very pleased with the results, my hair looking good and full and happy.</li>

            <li> Nice device.</li>
            <li> This Q-Redew is nice</li>
            <li> The whole concept of the product is great!</li>
            <li> Nice product.  </li>
            <li> I used it right away after it was delivered and my curls came out  beautiful, moist and bouncy.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d love this product IF it worked!  </li>
            <li> The Q-Redew is, by far, the best tool I have ever purchased for my hair.</li>
            <li> I wish, though, that the teeth part were thinner and more abundant.  </li>
            <li> Overall,.im pretty happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> It barely produces any steam, intermittent at best.</li>
            <li> This product is good for providing quick steaming treatments to hair.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I truly love it</li>
            <li> Love this steamer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m just not using it correctly or if its better suited for someone with thinner hair or a looser curl pattern.</li>
            <li> I am in love .</li>
            <li> I am really in love with this .</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to stop touching my hair now.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I got the steamer at the recommendation of many Kinky/Natural Hair care sites and posts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I viewed YouTube demonstrations after the fact to get a better understanding of how it works.  </li>
            <li> (bought it at amazon.com) and I am so satisfied.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use it! :)</li>
            <li> &amp; I love it.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with the Q-Redew.</li>
            <li> have never been able to do the things I can do now, before getting the Q-Redew.</li>
            <li> I love this product..</li>
            <li> Love Love Love.</li>
            <li> I love my Q-Redew.</li>
            <li> Heidi gets 10 more stars for how she handled this issue.</li>
            <li> My hair was actually more moisturized and looked way better before I used the steamer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gets rid of most of my frizz, redefines my curls, and gives me some needed volume after a night of wearing my hair up in a ponytail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It work better when you steam your hair in sections and then seal it with you favorite hair oil.</li>
            <li> those two together are magic for mt hair.</li>
            <li> It even worked on refreshing and renewing curly wigs.</li>
            <li> So I added more water.</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the product</li>
            <li> Therefore, if you have not used a friends and are 100% sure you want to keep item, do not buy.  </li>
            <li> Zero stars is more appropriate.</li>
            <li> I am able to maintain my hair throughout the week and add moisture.</li>
            <li> but so did spraying them with water, and the Q-Redew reshapes and wakes up my curls so much better than spraying them ever did.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly with my afro textured low porosity hair.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this.</li>
            <li> I have NEVER had a better product.</li>
            <li> The texture on top always breaks no matter the technique.</li>
            <li> I pull out the Q-Redew and its detangled, oiled, and styled in 10 minutes at the most</li>
            <li> AND it looks, feels, and is healthy.</li>
            <li> I can not express how much I love this thing.</li>
            <li> My my $20 clothes steamer works better at 1/3 the price.  </li>
            <li> I find using the steamer provides moisture without soaking my hair and makes my hair more pliable.</li>
            <li> So then why do so many of your units malfunction?</li>
            <li> the results and I was pleased and bought it.</li>
            <li> … Love it-</li>
            <li> Spray bottle revives my curls better.</li>
            <li> Maybe when I get more length I will revisit</li>
            <li> It works perfectly, thanks to their great phone support.  </li>
            <li> my hair becomes much more manageable.</li>
            <li> I would need to rewet my hair and hope for the best on day 2 and definitely on day 3!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for refreshing a hair style and deep conditioning.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s better for use with longer hair.</li>
            <li> Great customer service and a very helpful tool.</li>
            <li> Loved it at first.  </li>
            <li> It does not mist the hair, instead it provides warm very humidified air- 2 stars for honest advertising.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m grateful to the young woman who told me about this great product.  </li>
            <li> but you can’t so out with a wet head in the winter, this thing, detangles, stretches and revives my curls perfectly!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always happy when I get my goodies early.</li>
            <li> The Q-Redew is the best thing that ever happened to my 4C, very dry hair!</li>
            <li> I just want big happy healthy hair.</li>
            <li> I just want big happy healthy hair.</li>
            <li> but it’s easy to wipe it off, and</li>
            <li> The steam makes it easy to detangle my hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use</li>
            <li> It  adds moisture, curl enhancement, and easy detangling to my hair.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to used.</li>
            <li> Easy way to stretcg my hair without breaking it off</li>
            <li> The steam is warm and not too hot to the touch.  </li>
            <li> It was decided that the connection between the reservoir and pump wasn&#x27;t a good one, so they would send out a new reservoir</li>
            <li> , that was fine in the summer</li>
            <li> Great steamer if your looking for something quick and less cumbersome than sitting under your hooded Huetiful steamer (which works exceptionally well).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I recommend watching online demonstrations for people with your hair type to make sure it’s worth adding to your hair product collection.  </li>
            <li> My hair is much healthier as well as nicely curled.  </li>
            <li> But Heidi offered to ship it for free, at the show price.</li>
            <li> 2-3 timer and use a light moisturizer and seal with oil.</li>
            <li> It is also great for wash day for deep conditioning.</li>
            <li> only con I have experienced is that I have to refill the thing after each section of hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> This is a good product for someone that is natural.</li>
            <li> Ladies please get this product, if you are a natural this is a good product to have in your health hair care section.</li>
            <li> Okay so at first I was happy with this product, however I did not know that you are supposed to use it constantly.</li>
            <li> The steamer heats up pretty quickly and delivers!!</li>
            <li> I looked in the claws of the steamer first for some steam that didn&#x27;t really flow out that good ,and saw the residue from the products I had put on my hair.</li>
            <li> After washing a light conditioner was applied then sit under the steamer followed by cool rinse.</li>
            <li> And, it&#x27;s very portable for easy travel on the go!</li>
            <li> Really like this product for detailing and refreshing purposes between washes...</li>
            <li> My curls are really softer and more rejuvenated after using it.</li>
            <li> So overall, I think this is a good product.</li>
            <li> Nourishing moist heat to stretch and detangle hair, revive an old style, allows conditioning products to better penetrate the shaft for DEEP conditioning---a great product.</li>
            <li> Fair enough.</li>
            <li> And I want to have my hair look good the next day as well.</li>
            <li> Good product, would definitely recommend for burst of moisture</li>
            <li> Will use a heat protectant and follow by cool spritz to close cubicles and a leave in  conditioner w slip and coconut oil Shea butter</li>
            <li> I love that the product heats up quick 1-2 mins and that I can &amp;#34;seam&amp;#34; my whole head in about 3 mins.</li>
            <li> Works well and shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li> And it has helped tremendously.  </li>
            <li> love this product and am so glad i finally purchased.</li>
            <li> My defined waves quickly turned into an Afro.</li>
            <li> If you are not washing your hair on a particular day; use the QREDEW you will love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it to put moister back in my hair as I wear kinky twists extensions most of the and am often concerned about the moisture level in my hair.</li>
            <li> Great as a refresher on old styles for my natural 4C hair.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> /&gt;Negatives:  Steam is very hot.</li>
            <li> Very hot.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this steamer for all the beautiful Black women who are now wearing their lovely curls naturally.</li>
            <li> I truly love how Q-Redew kept my 3b hair soft, supple and curly for days!</li>
            <li> I used to have a full sized steamer before giving it away and I love this option much better because, it does not take up a lot of space, and is easy to use on my lazy days.</li>
            <li> Ladies although you may have a found a loop hole around buying this device, you might end up experiencing the damage I experienced just to save a few bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although I have spent a great deal of time, money, and energy on my hair-styling efforts, I have never been able to properly detangle my hair.</li>
            <li> Every time I plug it in now, it just has a fast blinking light and overheats.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We will see if it was worth the risk...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money</li>
            <li> My hair responds well to the drenching moisture of a warm shower followed by a leave in conditioner like Mixed Chicks.</li>
            <li> My product was shipped super fast!</li>
            <li> but when I use it, it is RIGHT</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the right temperature and pressure not to cause frizz</li>
            <li> If you have the type of hair that looks great after you&#x27;ve taken a long walk on the beach in the ocean mist or responds well to deep south extreme humidity--this product will work GREAT for you.</li>
            <li> Wow, Wow, Wow, this is the only words I can honestly use to describe how happy I am with the Q-Redew.  </li>
            <li> I spent a great deal of time early on in my natural hair journey trying to find ways to safely use combs and brushes on my hair.</li>
            <li> This item is so worth the money---it really works!</li>
            <li> So I tried using it while conditioning my hair, my hair barely heated up (it did a better job steaming up by itself in a shower cap).</li>
            <li> but the Q-Redew is specially designed to use on and go through your hair which I found particularly helpful towards detangling.</li>
            <li> That steamer is definitely good for clothes, but not for hair (but that is whole other review).</li>
            <li> I was really excited when I ordered this as I am newly going</li>
            <li> and it got pretty hot.</li>
            <li> this thing gets really hot and at times spittles hot boiling water.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off getting a regular steamer</li>
            <li> I was able to bring my thirsty strands back in between shampoos</li>
            <li> Steaming my hair is EXACTLY what I needed.</li>
            <li> I can safely remove all of my shed hair, and stretching my hair has never been so simple.</li>
            <li> I was very DISPLEASED with this item!  </li>
            <li> When the first replacement reservoir arrived cracked, she immediately sent another, with a hand written note apologizing for the inconvenience.</li>
            <li> I just received my steamer on Saturday and the used it for the first time yesterday.  </li>
            <li> Love it overall.</li>
            <li> It did exactly what I needed it to do.</li>
            <li> Does get really hot.</li>
            <li> I use more steam to deep condition or to moisturize my hair with coconut or jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> Nice invention.i would not use every morning for long period of time because too much steam shrinks my hair.</li>
            <li> Then a week later I discovered this product and now I am in love.</li>
            <li> Puffs of hot air.</li>
            <li> An alternative is to take a hot shower and allow the steam from the shower to add moisture.</li>
            <li> Personally, I do NOT look better under those conditions.</li>
            <li> I have not yet tried this using a leave in conditioner first, but I have heard that does wonders to keep the frizz at bay.</li>
            <li> To top it all off, it stopped giving out steam, so it went back.</li>
            <li> I used it the first time it worked well .</li>
            <li> I use it when I&#x27;m am doing a hot oil treatment to Detangle my hair and the boost of moisture from the steam</li>
            <li> My product arrived really early and as soon as I opened the box I immediately filled the reservoir with water and began steaming.</li>
            <li> Come on, make sure your units are working properly before sending them to customers so they won&#x27;t have these kinds of headaches.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely</li>
            <li> I am really interested to see how it works on softening and loosening my curl pattern after wearing in a &amp;#34;puff&amp;#34; or wash-n-go.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love using this to add just amount of moisture to my hair with out having to spray it with water, especially in the winter months.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be a staple products once I grow my hair back again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ready to use in 20 seconds, and just keep a water bottle near for easy refills.</li>
            <li> Excellent for african american curly hair - added so much needed moisture esp after the big chop</li>
            <li> Used to go to high priced natural salon whose focus was  encouraging women to stop relaxing and hair health but focus was flat iron styles gorgeous cuts and one of the hair treatments was the steamer.</li>
            <li> I have returned two non-functioning units via their AWESOME customer service (really, they are very sweet) and thought the third one was a charm, but I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> The q-redew is a lot less hassle with the better results than my hooded steamer!</li>
            <li> I had read reviews and looked on Youtube and all of the reviews was positive.</li>
            <li> I like the vintage mint green color, and I am very pleased that I decided to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> I like the vintage mint green color, and I am very pleased that I decided to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> , my hair does also, I&#x27;m just not too confident in how long it will hold out.</li>
            <li> but I have never let it get more than an inch long before buzzing it off.</li>
            <li> Very convenient and does exactly what I needed it for.  </li>
            <li> It decides when it wants to release steam in a consistent matter.  </li>
            <li> I was never able to detangle my hair completely, and I experienced some matting because I couldn&#x27;t remove excess shed hair.</li>
            <li> I really think , who ever invented this</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use heat on my hair very often</li>
            <li> I really want to stress that in this review.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ready</li>
            <li> All in all, I really like the device</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it to my family and friends!</li>
            <li> I doubt I&#x27;ll be using my hooded steamer much now.  </li>
            <li> I like it better than using a spray bottle because your hair is not dripping wet after you use it.</li>
            <li> It provides so much moisture..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s how the company handles the situation and how they make you feel while doing so that really matters.</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> so I still very texturized.</li>
            <li> I have 3A hair or botticelli curls that won´t stay overnight no matter how much product I use or what I do with them (</li>
            <li> Results are the same, and it&#x27;s free.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it makes detangling so much easier.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ready for use.</li>
            <li> Sorry, but I am being brutally honest because I really wanted to LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t do much for my hair at this length</li>
            <li> so I can really feel the heat fast, but this answered my problems.  </li>
            <li> I do the LCO method almost every morning so this really helps.</li>
            <li> And it absolutely helps with detangling.</li>
            <li> If you have 4c (really 4e) type hair, then you need this.</li>
            <li> This gently keeps my hair moisturized and curly.  </li>
            <li> Well, it seems to only work when full or near full</li>
            <li> Tried to return item and received message this item is listed as hazardous and I need to dispose of it in a waste receptacle.</li>
            <li> I am newly natural and have a twa and was very excited to get this product based on the reviews but have only used it twice.</li>
            <li> easy to do bun on stretched</li>
            <li> I am excited about using this for my detangling and deep conditioning sessions.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am excited about using this for my detangling and deep conditioning sessions.  </li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> I was satisfied with the customer service, but I read other reviews before making the purchase.</li>
            <li> I am able to detangle much quicker with a lot less breakage.</li>
            <li> This product would be nice but the water holder is way too small.</li>
            <li> I loved this thing so much i used  it for facials to steam my hair , to deep condition i used it everyday.</li>
            <li> I fill like if the receptacle was bigger, the steamer could not be handheld, so I&#x27;m cool with it.</li>
            <li> I tested it on my hair after a night out at a hot smokey club and my hair was completely refreshed and moisturized.</li>
            <li> After emailing the help line I received a quick response, I sent the device back (free shipping) and a new one was sent back to me within days.</li>
            <li> since I found out about this product I have been trying to come up with clever ways to steam my hair without shelling out all the money for the Q-Redew.</li>
            <li> I heard that it could help with detangling, which was my main motivation for buying it.</li>
            <li> Despite various attempts to love this gadget, It made my 2nd day curls seem as if I had rolled around in wool sheets all night.&lt;br /&gt;(My</li>
            <li> Overall, I bought this product with the premise that I could use it to quickly steam or re-set my hairstyle.</li>
            <li> Not enough to leave a mark but enough to shock me and make me pay more attention to indicator</li>
            <li> steam in it does not last long, therefore I have to fill it many times before I can get my whole head steamed.</li>
            <li> NOT recommending this to anyone, the probability of receiving a malfunctioning unit is too high.</li>
            <li> I think it should be a little more durable.</li>
            <li> or it doesn’t produce enough steam, this things kicks out stream and its HOT!  </li>
            <li> I have 2 different textures in my hair, fine 4b on top and thick 4a on bottom.</li>
            <li> I do my whole head of APL natural hair within 5-10 mins.</li>
            <li> Works really well for my natural hair.  </li>
            <li> it did give me really nice full curls, but unfortunately it included a layer of frizz.</li>
            <li> My hair needs water everyday, and during the winter steam is a much better option for me, rather than drenching or spraying with water.</li>
            <li> Like everyone else has said, the manufacturers need to create a larger reservoir and make it so that current owners are able to change out the old one for the new one.  </li>
            <li> Great result and did not take a  long to dry as wet</li>
            <li> A few days ago I received my new hair steamer and it works even better than before.</li>
            <li> , the water chamber needs to be double the size, it needs an off switch, needs a better way to remove all the water from the chamber for immediate storage, and prevent mold for those who can&#x27;t wait to air dry the water chamber.</li>
            <li> For women like me with a big coily bush to manage, this is better than spritzing your dry hair with water to retwist or reset your hair.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this tool for any natural curlies!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s looking like a good third day hair where my curls are full and yet still a little defined but not a matted mess.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s looking like a good third day hair where my curls are full and yet still a little defined but not a matted mess.</li>
            <li> I just received my new Q-Redew today</li>
            <li> He immediately sent me a new working Q-Redew and I returned my damage one.</li>
            <li> Cant live without it.</li>
            <li> The company said i could clean it with vinegar and water to see if it would open back still nothing all i get now is hot air and an occasional burst of steam very fustrating considering what i paid for it.</li>
            <li> (I use distilled water only) until it becomes filled up, and then you snap it back into place.</li>
            <li> highly recommend to my natural sistas….</li>
            <li> It make my hair very soft and moisturized</li>
            <li> When I first purchased the device it was defective, I had to send it back for a new one.</li>
            <li> I use it for deep conditioning, hot oil treatments, to hydrate, and refresh my hair.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure I&#x27;m not the only person living internationally with this product as I&#x27;ve read in other reviews.</li>
            <li> Detangling my coily, natural hair is a breeze!</li>
            <li> Maybe it is good for other hair types, but definitely not for really soft curly hair that has trouble holding curl after the first day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s steam you can run right out the house and not worry about it needing to dry.</li>
            <li> My hair simply LOVES steam, and my hair strands stretch out straight nearly instantaneously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My curls are soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my hair soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> My hair no longer feels brittle, but feels soft.</li>
            <li> I really wish I could have my money back.</li>
            <li> The tool itself is rather lightweight and not heavy at all.</li>
            <li> Only con is water in steamer runs out fast have to change it every 5mins.</li>
            <li> (so far).</li>
            <li> a nutshell, this makes my hair soft and frizzy, does not refresh my curls</li>
            <li> This is a natural girl staple.</li>
            <li> I have had natural hair for over 20 years</li>
            <li> this summer, i attended a natural hair show and saw the company founder demonstrating this product that I had never heard of.</li>
            <li> , I wish my soft feeling lasted longer</li>
            <li> It sat in its box for a while because I was transitioning from relaxed to natural and I was wearing my hair in braids at the time.</li>
            <li> Makes my Afro soft and feel moisturized.</li>
            <li> I decided to relax by hair after 3 years natura l because I couldn&#x27;t deal with my unruly natural hair anymore.</li>
            <li> I used it and my hair felt so soft and moisurized afterwards and it also leightens the hair.</li>
            <li> With this method my hair stays soft for four days instead of 2 hours.</li>
            <li> Like what I&#x27;ve seen so far.</li>
            <li> I encouraged every natural girl she needed to get one.</li>
            <li> last the whole time i am steaming my hair</li>
            <li> First of all, this product gets REALLY hot, so if you are going to use it you need to be careful not to get it too close to your ears, scalp, etc because it will definitely hurt.</li>
            <li> it worked better for that at least.</li>
            <li> This product makes your hair feel soft and manageable and your hair is not saturated with water.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so soft and keeps my curls moisturize.</li>
            <li> and I have natural hair.  </li>
            <li> I have fairly thick shoulder length healthy hair.  </li>
            <li> used it a few times at first, because it was my new toy, but didn&#x27;t really need it during the summer.</li>
            <li> I used the Q-Redew to bring moisture to my hair because it was pretty dry.</li>
            <li> The steam isn&#x27;t too hot and works wonders for detangling 2nd or 3rd day hair.</li>
            <li> I use to refresh wash n gos, but I mainly use it for deep conditioning.  </li>
            <li> Her recommendation partially fixed the problem and then she sent me a new reservoir to totally fix it.</li>
            <li> That NEVER happens in my braidouts when following my normal hair routine.  </li>
            <li> I expected this to work a little better.</li>
            <li> Where I live the voltage is 120, and I have numerous products that work with this voltage.</li>
            <li> Their warranty is only 90 days, not even close to a year, which means they would not find it unreasonable for me to buy a new one every three months.  </li>
            <li> One last point, I saw some chatter about using a regular clothes steamer since they are much cheaper.  </li>
            <li> ESPECIALLY if I know they&#x27;re buying it from outside the US for so much money.</li>
            <li> My hair was left very soft and not soggy</li>
            <li> For my 4c hair that constantly needs moisturizing, this little gadget is simple and easy to use in the mornings.</li>
            <li> Heidi, tried to trouble shoot the issue with me by making suggestions to clean it with vinegar mixed with water however it still did not work.</li>
            <li> I only had to refill this once to complete my hair.</li>
            <li> I only had to refill this once to complete my hair.</li>
            <li> I would not hold this near for my face for a facial-</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product for any woman with natural hair that is having difficulty with the detangling process.</li>
            <li> Will definitely recommend if you are natural or textlaxed.</li>
            <li> I put vinegar mixed with water to fix the problem but so far nothing has changed.</li>
            <li> Only reason I haven&#x27;t given 5 stars is I haven&#x27;t seen how it works on my natural hair with no extensions.</li>
            <li> In one of my refills I apparently did not let it heat up all the way and scalding water dropped out and burned my shoulder.</li>
            <li> I wear my hair natural and live in a desert areas, so my hair tends to be very dry.  </li>
            <li> like I can just send it back ,I live internationally.</li>
            <li> My hair texture is coarse, dry, fine and tight curled.</li>
            <li> Although I was able to retain more length and break less hair with this method, it was extremely time consuming and tedious.</li>
            <li> Slightly cumbersome during my first experience using the product.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start with the fact that I got the product 3 days earlier than predicted, major plus!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have hard water, however, I haven&#x27;t tried to clean it with vinegar yet.</li>
            <li> Hard to clean.</li>
            <li> I recently did my big chop and am completely natural.</li>
            <li> In my experience, the product did not produce nearly enough steam to even mildly steam my thick, natural hair.</li>
            <li> I also dropped it once in the bathroom and now the little container that holds the water doesn&#x27;t stay in all the way, so it drops hot water on me sometimes.</li>
            <li> got the Q-Redew to moisturize my heat stretched natural hair.</li>
            <li> few tips; do not overfill the water reservoir because steam will not come out, the prongs will get pretty dusty/messy from any debris/ residue in your hair</li>
            <li> My hair is down my back, but that has more to do with luck than anything else, considering the detangling struggles I have had in the past.</li>
            <li> the reservoir does not hold enough water and can be tiring using this consistently because it is a little bulky.</li>
            <li> I use this for 2nd and 3rd day hair days, My daughter has all natural african american hair and she loves it.. .. you can use for deep conditioning and even steam facials.</li>
            <li> Instead I ended up with a hot frizzy mess!</li>
            <li> decided to get a Q-Redew after seeing a few tutorials and reading positive reviews about the product.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed, especially since I heard such great things about it.</li>
            <li> I know the price is scarey, but go sign up on the Q-Redew mailing list and wait on a good coupon, I used a $20 off coupon I got for a Black Friday sale, so in the end, the damage to my hair from the clothes steamer and the coupon made me decide to fork out the money for this device.</li>
            <li> When I let it go natural, I wake up with some curls, some flat, some sticking up in strange ways.  </li>
            <li> Detangled thick curly hair very well!!</li>
            <li> Being a low porosity natural, my hair tends to be very dry.  </li>
            <li> and then it peters out when a little over half full.</li>
            <li> Then, a few weeks ago and well past the warranty period, I pulled it out to deal with dry winter hair and had an issue more likely related to prolonged non-usage than to the manufacturing of the unit.</li>
            <li> then all of a sudden the steam will come bursting out followed by extremely hot water dripping down my arm burning me, then the steam will die down 30 seconds later.</li>
            <li> For black hair we need this extra moisture this handheld device offers especially in the colder months!!</li>
            <li> hair texture is 3b/3c- African American, long length, natural/unprocessed)</li>
            <li> Oh, im black female with natural hair.</li>
            <li> I did a braid out after using it and my hair felt crunchy/brittle the next day while also not being dry in the middle of the braid</li>
            <li> I tried it on my hair with product from the day before, then the next time with a leave in conditioner and the third time with gel and every single attempt I ended up with a frizzy mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> wow, then one day a few short weeks later nothing.</li>
            <li> It even works well on first day hair that didn&#x27;t dry quite the way I wanted, or when I diffused a little too roughly.</li>
            <li> I hate having to wet my hair every morning in order to get a decent second day hair because is not convenient in winter and because my hair takes forever (more than 4 hours) to dry and it just doesn´t look professional to go to work with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The shed hair would wrap around other hairs, forming multitudes of tangles and causing me major amounts of grief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Well, with the Q-Redew Steamer, I can spend 5 minutes or less on my naturally curly hair on day two (often day 3 as well) and go.</li>
            <li> It made this weird sound which I could deal with if the product actually worked.</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely curly and for years I suffered getting those curls back into shape the next day, after shampooing and setting.  </li>
            <li> To pay so much money for this and it not even lasting 6 months is ridiculous .am</li>
            <li> If I tried to control it, I spent at least an hour on blowing it out straight, and then every morning flat ironing it with mixed results.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a lot smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> It is a lot smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> We shall see what benefits it has after using it long term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I waited so long to purchase it.</li>
            <li> as long as it&#x27;s within 30 days.</li>
            <li> You can get the same effect with a hand held steamer...without a $70.00 price...with either product you have to be careful...</li>
            <li> I have thick 4a,b,c hair depending on the area of my head and this steamer doesn&#x27;t really do much for me.</li>
            <li> The only improvement I would recommend is making the water reservoir larger because people with longer hair would have to keep refilling, even with my TWA I had used half of the water.</li>
            <li> It can be really hard to add a little moisture to straightened or stretched natural hair without completely ruining the style or causing the hair to revert.</li>
            <li> I use it when my hair is dry</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not make your dry hair re-curl like I was under the impression that it would.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone with dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have to press the button for at least a minute when I turn it on so that the steam comes out steadily.</li>
            <li> Not a favorite item thus far.</li>
            <li> Pretty annoyed.</li>
            <li> I use this tool shortly in morning to refluff my hair on days 2,3,4 or 5 after I take my pineapple down.</li>
            <li> Since I am a Black female who is now wearing my hair in the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; state, this product has help maintain moisture in my hair.</li>
            <li> I only purchased it less than a month ago, but no problems as of yet.</li>
            <li> With that being said, I had to refill the steamer numerous times to the point of exhaustion (slight exaggeration), but maybe not.  </li>
            <li> Every morning I had to wet it down, spritz with products, and push back into place.  </li>
            <li> I have maximum hydrated, curly and tightly coiled, wide toothed combed, water only, hennaed, and oiled and sealed, It still breaks when I detangle.</li>
            <li> When you already have a hairstyle that need a little moisture just use the QREDEW it makes it easier to apply 6he moisture while using some of your essential hair oils to help seal in that moisture.</li>
            <li> , I feel that the extreme heat from this small steamer (My Little Steamer particularly) is what caused these bubbles on my hair, and I have seen reviews where women say they use this steamer on their hair, and I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> First I want to say sorry for this long review</li>
            <li> and today I am rocking flattened, limp, slept on twist out from last night...</li>
            <li> and today I am rocking flattened, limp, slept on twist out from last night...</li>
            <li> Now I just mist my hair and fluff a bit.  </li>
            <li> I use thus to help with detangling, but not much else.</li>
            <li> Heavier than I expected.</li>
            <li> After each use I empty the reservoir and wipe off the comb part and where the steam comes out to remove product build up and hair.</li>
            <li> Once I picked it up I immediately tried it out, but it only dried my hair out.</li>
            <li> have run out of options and I will just have to consider this product a complete failure for me.</li>
            <li> -Black woman with 3c/ 4a long hair (no chemicals to alter texture or color; use heat once in a blue)-&lt;br /&gt;Right out the box, this was going to change my hair care routine!</li>
            <li> Cuticle must have opened due to extreme heat and hair felt rough even though it made combing through a breeze.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that I have to keep refilling the container with water because it is a small container.  </li>
            <li> I have never seen, small white dots about 1/4 in.</li>
            <li> The only problems are the small water reservoir and the way my hair curls around the teeth.  </li>
            <li> and when I reached out to the seller she was extremely helpful.</li>
            <li> This product does produce steam but it does not consistently release the steam as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li> The water holder is so small, needed constant refilling for a detangling session.</li>
            <li> I have retained my entire 1 and 1/2 inches over the past 3 months.</li>
            <li> I am not interested in repurchasing this product every year.</li>
            <li> There are other ways to get your hair steamed or a hair steamer that costs less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had exhausted every other option, so I wanted to give this new solution a try.</li>
            <li> Not to heavy, which I love, being I have a bad shoulder.</li>
            <li> This product DOES make my hair soft, BUT it doesnt do much to reciralize my curls; which i was a bit disappointed about.</li>
            <li> The product itself was unfortunately defective in that it did not produce the steam as much as it should have when the button was pressed, but that was something that couldn&#x27;t be helped.</li>
            <li> I got it within a few days, a lot sooner than I had expected.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love it and hate</li>
            <li> i have low poroisty hair and it thick the water  </li>
            <li> Ja, ja,  no more dry, dull curls the next day,</li>
            <li> This Q-Redew has cut my breakage down and my anxiety.</li>
            <li> To cut down on the annoyance of that, I keep a water bottle and fill up after each section.</li>
            <li> I usually have a water bottle that I use with EVOO, almond oil and glycerin but the problem was I would have to let my hair air dry</li>
            <li> It literally takes less than 15 seconds for the machine to let you know</li>
            <li> This does cause me some slight canopy frizz</li>
            <li> My hair was hydrated and I had less breakage.  </li>
            <li> Ordered this for my fianc&amp;eacute; in March of 2014, here I am in January of 2015  (less than a year)</li>
            <li> After a year of using it less than once a week, it stopped making steam.</li>
            <li> and I found out that these are usually caused by using heat on wet hair, that causes bubbles to form on the strands of hair, called bubble hair.</li>
            <li> I wish it were a little less cumbersome for travel purposes.</li>
            <li> I have very tightly coiled, very dense 4a/b and random chunks of 3b/c hair.</li>
            <li> So I went out and bought a My Little Steamer, for $20, and there was a LOT of steam coming out of that little thing</li>
            <li> give it 4 stars because at $70 it is a little pricey and at times the device can be louder than I would like.</li>
            <li> So I pressed the button, and just noise and a little steam.</li>
            <li> I decided to use it for something a little different!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I add a little oil to the hair, steam it and bun</li>
            <li> I got it within a few days, a lot sooner</li>
            <li> I use it a few times a week or whenever my hair needs moisture.</li>
            <li> I give this product 3/5 stars for a few reasons.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair steamer a few months ago and it worked well in moisturizing my hair</li>
            <li> So far I am not impressed.  </li>
            <li> but after a few uses it started to malfunction.  </li>
            <li> I had hoped to extend that &amp;#34;first day, just washed look&amp;#34; This product does deliver an imperceptible moisture.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product a few days ago and I tried it this morning.  </li>
            <li> I just got it today, and so far I am not impressed.  </li>
            <li> Fill the reservoir, plug it up, wait a few minutes...</li>
            <li> I have 4b -4c hair and after watching a few you tube reviews I purchased this.</li>
            <li> I do feel like women who like crunchy or stiff ultra defined curls may not like this product.</li>
            <li> I do feel like women who like crunchy or stiff ultra defined curls may not like this product.</li>
            <li> Receptacle a little small</li>
            <li> I seal my hair with raw shay butter...</li>
            <li> for very tight kinky coily hair.</li>
            <li> I never had a bad 2nd or 3rd hair day after using this product.</li>
            <li> Especially in the winter time because I can’t just use my water bottle to refreshen my curls anymore and go out in the cold with a wet head.  </li>
            <li> I usually use it during the week after having done a two-strand twist.</li>
            <li> have 3c/4a medium porosity hair, and I am working on 4 day old dirty hair that has been in an afro puff 3 of those days</li>
            <li> I have 3c/4a medium porosity hair, and I am working on 4 day old dirty hair that has been in an afro puff 3 of those days</li>
            <li> Having to wet my hair was no fun, and using curl refresher products can be expensive.  </li>
            <li> Others have had similar issues as mine which makes skeptical of the quality of the device.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any and everything can and likely will go wrong with any and every product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why it&#x27;s so testy.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Not satisfied.</li>
            <li> no I actually love this product.</li>
            <li> yesssssssssss not sure why I didn&#x27;t get one of these along time ago</li>
            <li> I’m not sure about reviews saying it doesn’t work</li>
            <li> As for me this product has proven to be an epic fail!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the last time I used it it seemed a it slow in releasing steam.i put it away as I&#x27;ve had braids in.</li>
            <li> I have thin and tight 4a curls.</li>
            <li> Because it is so hard for my hair to retain moisture</li>
            <li> Hard to handle.</li>
            <li> I look frizzy and my defined curls separate as if someone has given me a &amp;#34;nuggie&amp;#34; (you know, rubbing the head rudely and scattering hair everywhere)</li>
            <li> I use this thing at least twice a week.</li>
            <li> I tried using the steamer from my Caruso Steam Rollers, it was very uncomfortable and there wasn&#x27;t enough steam for me.</li>
            <li> and seriously I am looking forward to the winter.  </li>
            <li> The steam is very slow coming out.</li>
            <li> my handheld steamer works as well if not better!!</li>
            <li> However, what the product is actually capable of doing is horrible.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s broken.  </li>
            <li> not saying it&#x27;s not a good product but longevity for money is absurd.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed because I was no only eager to use it but also because it an expensive device (that I couldn&#x27;t even use).</li>
            <li> Also the nozzle head that the water reservoir clips onto gets stuck in the wrong place.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical because  of the price and the fact that it was handheld</li>
            <li> Can’t beat this guys, sorry for the people who didn’t receive their desired results.  </li>
            <li> I hate the small container that is used to hold the water.</li>
            <li> Awkward to handle.</li>
            <li> Combing and brushing is impossible for me.</li>
            <li> I was too frustrated to bother, I just threw it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mimiplac</li>
            <li> I hate screwing with my hair...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m SO disappointed, though, because IF it worked, it would be THE BOMB!</li>
            <li> AWFUL!</li>
            <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED!</li>
            <li> I dont have to spend dreadful time in the bathtub detangling their hair.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works well and shipped quickly.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Really like this product for detailing and refreshing purposes between washes...I truly love it</li>
            <li> Love this steamer. I can say it lives up to its name. My curls are really softer and more rejuvenated after using it.But can anyone comment if they&#x27;ve experienced the device leaking?</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t like it. I have thick 4a,b,c hair depending on the area of my head and this steamer doesn&#x27;t really do much for me. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m just not using it correctly or if its better suited for someone with thinner hair or a looser curl pattern. I also dropped it once in the bathroom and now the little container that holds the water doesn&#x27;t stay in all the way, so it drops hot water on me sometimes. I think it should be a little more durable.</li>
            <li> I am in love . It does everything . I really think , who ever invented this is a genius. 😘😘😘😘😘😘  I am really in love with this .</li>
            <li> I love my Q redew!  It has changed my hair.  I wear my hair natural and live in a desert areas, so my hair tends to be very dry.  I use it about 3 times a week and it is so simple to use and then store.  I coat my hair with a good oil and then use my steamer for about 25 minutes.  The only downside is that I have to keep refilling the container with water because it is a small container.  (I use spring or filtered water in my Q redew)  I use it when I am reading or watching Tv.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I am done I rinse my hair with a conditioner and then put in my product.  My curls are soft and shiny.  The puffiness and dryness is gone when I use it regularly.  The key that I have found to make it work for me, is using the oil on my hair (but not in my scalp). I use it when my hair is dry and then I  rinse it.  It brings moisture to my hair and my husband commented on how shiny my hair looked !  My hair loves Q Redew!</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair steamer after reading about it in Essence Magazine. Since I am a Black female who is now wearing my hair in the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; state, this product has help maintain moisture in my hair. I usually use it during the week after having done a two-strand twist. It keeps my hair soft and moisturized. I recommend this steamer for all the beautiful Black women who are now wearing their lovely curls naturally.</li>
            <li> First I want to say sorry for this long review but there is a good reason for it.&lt;br /&gt;Ever since I found out about this product I have been trying to come up with clever ways to steam my hair without shelling out all the money for the Q-Redew. I tried using the steamer from my Caruso Steam Rollers, it was very uncomfortable and there wasn&#x27;t enough steam for me. So I went out and bought a My Little Steamer, for $20, and there was a LOT of steam coming out of that little thing and it got pretty hot. It worked for me but I started to notice something on my hair I have never seen, small white dots about 1/4 in. from the bottom of my strands, and when I pulled on them, my hair would break off. I looked up possible reasons why this could be happening and I found out that these are usually caused by using heat on wet hair, that causes bubbles to form on the strands of hair, called bubble hair. You may be wondering why this is a part of my review, it is a warning to you all. I don&#x27;t use heat on my hair very often, I feel that the extreme heat from this small steamer (My Little Steamer particularly) is what caused these bubbles on my hair, and I have seen reviews where women say they use this steamer on their hair, and I would not recommend it. That steamer is definitely good for clothes, but not for hair (but that is whole other review). Using that streamer was the only thing in my regimen that had changed over the 2 weeks I was using it and noticed the damage to my hair. I really want to stress that in this review. Ladies although you may have a found a loop hole around buying this device, you might end up experiencing the damage I experienced just to save a few bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally this brings me to my review of the Q-Redew.  I know the price is scarey, but go sign up on the Q-Redew mailing list and wait on a good coupon, I used a $20 off coupon I got for a Black Friday sale, so in the end, the damage to my hair from the clothes steamer and the coupon made me decide to fork out the money for this device. I received it today, once they shipped it I got it within a few days, a lot sooner than I had expected.&lt;br /&gt;I have 3c/4a medium porosity hair, and I am working on 4 day old dirty hair that has been in an afro puff 3 of those days and today I am rocking flattened, limp, slept on twist out from last night...I plugged this baby in, waited for it to heat up and went to work. I am very pleased with the results, my hair looking good and full and happy. It&#x27;s looking like a good third day hair where my curls are full and yet still a little defined but not a matted mess. I only had to refill this once to complete my hair. I am excited about using this for my detangling and deep conditioning sessions.&lt;br /&gt;It is a lot smaller than I expected. I like the vintage mint green color, and I am very pleased that I decided to purchase this product. I do feel like women who like crunchy or stiff ultra defined curls may not like this product. I personally like that it give my hair volume and makes it look fuller within minutes. I don&#x27;t need ultra defined curls I just want big happy healthy hair. I only knocked off 1 star because of the price.the money for this device. I received it today, once they shipped it I got it within a few days, a lot sooner than I had expected.

            <li> I&#x27;ve been checking this out on YouTube for several months before I took the plunge and purchased it.  It does a good job.  I have 4A hair and she loves steam. I put my products on, and steam. It saves me from having to sit under the dryer for 1/2 an hour. The only problems are the small water reservoir and the way my hair curls around the teeth.  Like everyone else has said, the manufacturers need to create a larger reservoir and make it so that current owners are able to change out the old one for the new one.  Cuz I&#x27;m not buying another one!</li>
            <li> An amazing product that works well on my 4C hair. I can&#x27;t imagine life without it. I use it for deep conditioning, hot oil treatments, to hydrate, and refresh my hair. My hair no longer feels brittle, but feels soft. I don&#x27;t want to stop touching my hair now. I use it a few times a week or whenever my hair needs moisture. It&#x27;s ready to use in 20 seconds, and just keep a water bottle near for easy refills. I do my whole head of APL natural hair within 5-10 mins. I used to have a full sized steamer before giving it away and I love this option much better because, it does not take up a lot of space, and is easy to use on my lazy days. I would not hold this near for my face for a facial- this thing gets really hot and at times spittles hot boiling water. It&#x27;s easy to clean. Some of the cons are as follows: there&#x27;s no storage case, the water chamber needs to be double the size, it needs an off switch, needs a better way to remove all the water from the chamber for immediate storage, and prevent mold for those who can&#x27;t wait to air dry the water chamber. Lastly, I do not use a heat protectant- it&#x27;s not needed for steaming.</li>
            <li> I love it.  I use it for both my hair and face.  I only purchased it less than a month ago, but no problems as of yet.</li>
            <li> Ultimately, i returned this item. It was bulky to hold.</li>
            <li> AWFUL! It stopped working after 2 uses. VERY DISAPPOINTED!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. I don&#x27;t see the hype. Also I believe mine may be defective because it will not blow steam then all of a sudden the steam will come bursting out followed by extremely hot water dripping down my arm burning me, then the steam will die down 30 seconds later. I really wish I could have my money back. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again. You&#x27;re better off getting a regular steamer</li>
            <li> Great steamer if your looking for something quick and less cumbersome than sitting under your hooded Huetiful steamer (which works exceptionally well). You can use it throughout to refresher and add moisture to your strands! I was able to bring my thirsty strands back in between shampoos</li>
            <li> I use this for 2nd and 3rd day hair days, My daughter has all natural african american hair and she loves it.. .. you can use for deep conditioning and even steam facials. it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> I have been having this product around 3-4 months now. I must say that it was a very good investment. It is very easy to use. You snap out the reservoir it comes with that&#x27;s designed to hold the water, you apply water into it (I use distilled water only) until it becomes filled up, and then you snap it back into place. It literally takes less than 15 seconds for the machine to let you know it&#x27;s ready and then you can start steaming away! This product is good for providing quick steaming treatments to hair. And, it works quite well at helping to refresh and revive curly hair in the mornings or basically anytime of day as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Q-Redew, you can basically apply steam, whenever and wherever needed on your hair at your own convenience. The tool itself is rather lightweight and not heavy at all. And, it&#x27;s very portable for easy travel on the go!</li>
            <li> love it! Detangled thick curly hair very well!!</li>
            <li> Only con is water in steamer runs out fast have to change it every 5mins. Other than that it&#x27;s okay nothing amazing for my 4c hair.</li>
            <li> This product would be nice but the water holder is way too small.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start with the fact that I got the product 3 days earlier than predicted, major plus!  I got the steamer at the recommendation of many Kinky/Natural Hair care sites and posts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not make your dry hair re-curl like I was under the impression that it would.  I viewed YouTube demonstrations after the fact to get a better understanding of how it works.  I found it to be excellent for giving your hair some moisture and helping to detangle it.  For women like me with a big coily bush to manage, this is better than spritzing your dry hair with water to retwist or reset your hair.  I noticed my hair was immediately softer and shinier.  We shall see what benefits it has after using it long term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few tips; do not overfill the water reservoir because steam will not come out, the prongs will get pretty dusty/messy from any debris/ residue in your hair but it’s easy to wipe it off, and I recommend watching online demonstrations for people with your hair type to make sure it’s worth adding to your hair product collection.  One last point, I saw some chatter about using a regular clothes steamer since they are much cheaper.  I haven’t tried that yet but the Q-Redew is specially designed to use on and go through your hair which I found particularly helpful towards detangling.</li>
            <li> works perfectly on my hair and on my face.</li>
            <li> Wow, Wow, Wow, this is the only words I can honestly use to describe how happy I am with the Q-Redew.  I just received my new Q-Redew today (bought it at amazon.com) and I am so satisfied.  My hair is extremely curly and for years I suffered getting those curls back into shape the next day, after shampooing and setting.  Having to wet my hair was no fun, and using curl refresher products can be expensive.  This product is a blessing  for curly hair.  Thank you for providing a cure to my &amp;#34;next day curls blue&amp;#34;.  I used it right away after it was delivered and my curls came out  beautiful, moist and bouncy. after steaming with the Q-Redew.  I can not believe this product has been created, it is the best.  I am so happy and I will recommend, let me rephrase that, my curls, by the way they look, will recommend the Q-Redew because people will ask about my curls I know.  My curls look like if I just came out of the salon, Ja, ja,  no more dry, dull curls the next day, and seriously I am looking forward to the winter.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad someone told me about this product!  I&#x27;ve fought with my uncontrollable hair for decades.  When I let it go natural, I wake up with some curls, some flat, some sticking up in strange ways.  Every morning I had to wet it down, spritz with products, and push back into place.  And hope for the best. If I tried to control it, I spent at least an hour on blowing it out straight, and then every morning flat ironing it with mixed results.  Now I just mist my hair and fluff a bit.  My hair is much healthier as well as nicely curled.  I&#x27;m grateful to the young woman who told me about this great product.  We&#x27;re very mixed ethnic heritage in Hawaii, so this review is all about hair, not heritage.  Mahalo for this wonderful product that helps all ladies with curls!</li>
            <li> I expected this to work a little better. the reservoir does not hold enough water and can be tiring using this consistently because it is a little bulky. It is a bit pricey, so I used a gift card that i received in order to purchase it</li>
            <li> I give this product 3/5 stars for a few reasons. 1. When I first purchased the device it was defective, I had to send it back for a new one. I was very disappointed because I was no only eager to use it but also because it an expensive device (that I couldn&#x27;t even use). After emailing the help line I received a quick response, I sent the device back (free shipping) and a new one was sent back to me within days. I was satisfied with the customer service, but I read other reviews before making the purchase. Others have had similar issues as mine which makes skeptical of the quality of the device. Again, for the price you&#x27;d expect it to work flawlessly. 2. The device they sent me works great (so far). The steam isn&#x27;t too hot and works wonders for detangling 2nd or 3rd day hair. I like to use it for deep conditioning treatments (co-washing) and for dry-twists/braid-outs. The steams works great for re-moisturizing and stretching the hair (love this). 3. I hate the small container that is used to hold the water. I section my hair in smaller sections and literally have to refill the container each time. I guess you&#x27;ll get use to it, but it is time consuming. All in all, I really like the device, my hair does also, I&#x27;m just not too confident in how long it will hold out. We will see if it was worth the risk...</li>
            <li> This product DOES make my hair soft, BUT it doesnt do much to reciralize my curls; which i was a bit disappointed about. I use thus to help with detangling, but not much else. Overall,.im pretty happy with the purchase. Oh, im black female with natural hair.</li>
            <li> This does not refresh my curls, but makes it frizzy. I only use it when I need to wash and detangle my hair the night before. When I do that it does make it easier to wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The steam in it does not last long, therefore I have to fill it many times before I can get my whole head steamed. I also feel that it is way over-priced for what you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a nutshell, this makes my hair soft and frizzy, does not refresh my curls but it *does* make it easier to wash. So I gave it two stars for the detangle. I would have given three if it was cheaper and one if I did not use it for detangling.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair steamer a few months ago and it worked well in moisturizing my hair however about 2 weeks ago I noticed it stopped worked and when I reached out to the seller she was extremely helpful. Heidi, tried to trouble shoot the issue with me by making suggestions to clean it with vinegar mixed with water however it still did not work.After that she asked me for my order number and suggested I ship it back and they would repair or replace my hair steamer. A few days ago I received my new hair steamer and it works even better than before. Overall, I am very satisfied with this product and I would highly recommend it to my family and friends!</li>
            <li> Seller was great to work with! Just got my order today! Can&#x27;t wait to use it! :)</li>
            <li> The Q-Redew is the best thing that ever happened to my 4C, very dry hair! I absolutely love it and hate I waited so long to purchase it. I am able to detangle much quicker with a lot less breakage. I doubt I&#x27;ll be using my hooded steamer much now.  The q-redew is a lot less hassle with the better results than my hooded steamer!</li>
            <li> This is a good product for someone that is natural.I like it better than using a spray bottle because your hair is not dripping wet after you use it.</li>
            <li> Had this for years &amp; used it two times. Started using it this winter between wash weeks &amp; I love it. I now wash every 2 weeks. This is a natural girl staple. Awesome product.</li>
            <li> if your hair gets frizzy in humid weather, this is not the styling tool for you. it did give me really nice full curls, but unfortunately it included a layer of frizz. no problem returning it either. as long as it&#x27;s within 30 days.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with the Q-Redew. I have been wearing my hair natural for roughly 5 years. My hair is down my back, but that has more to do with luck than anything else, considering the detangling struggles I have had in the past. Although I have spent a great deal of time, money, and energy on my hair-styling efforts, I have never been able to properly detangle my hair. I have thin and tight 4a curls. Combing and brushing is impossible for me. I spent a great deal of time early on in my natural hair journey trying to find ways to safely use combs and brushes on my hair. All efforts were in vain. Instead of detangling, the combs and brushes would simply rip through, or rip out, my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wised up and started finger detangling. Although I was able to retain more length and break less hair with this method, it was extremely time consuming and tedious. I was never able to detangle my hair completely, and I experienced some matting because I couldn&#x27;t remove excess shed hair. The shed hair would wrap around other hairs, forming multitudes of tangles and causing me major amounts of grief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to get a Q-Redew after seeing a few tutorials and reading positive reviews about the product. I heard that it could help with detangling, which was my main motivation for buying it. I had exhausted every other option, so I wanted to give this new solution a try. The Q-Redew is, by far, the best tool I have ever purchased for my hair. Steaming my hair is EXACTLY what I needed. I steam my hair while holding the hair taut, and use my fingers to separate my strands afterwards. Finger detangling all of my hair used to take multiple hours over multiple days. With the Q-Redew, literally, I can steam my head for 5-8 minutes and detangle my  hair in under 30 minutes. My hair simply LOVES steam, and my hair strands stretch out straight nearly instantaneously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never been able to do the things I can do now, before getting the Q-Redew. I cannow part my hair at any spot on my head with my fingers. I don&#x27;t have to worry about tangles, or wasting 10+ hours trying to stretch and detangle my hair. I can safely remove all of my shed hair, and stretching my hair has never been so simple. I would definitely recommend this product for any woman with natural hair that is having difficulty with the detangling process. The Q-Redew has worked miracles for me, so perhaps it will help others as well.</li>
            <li> I was very DISPLEASED with this item!  I sent it back and I am glad you contacted me now because I used a gift card with that purchase!  Can I get my Gift Card Amount of $16.27 back?</li>
            <li> Each product is excellent</li>
            <li> I love this product..It provides so much moisture..My styles last for a week now.. Love Love Love.I would recommend to others</li>
            <li> You can get the same effect with a hand held steamer...without a $70.00 price...with either product you have to be careful...my handheld steamer works as well if not better!!</li>
            <li> I love my Q-Redew. My hair needs water everyday, and during the winter steam is a much better option for me, rather than drenching or spraying with water. But,its not just the product itself that earns the stars, but also the person who runs the company that makes it. Here is my experience. Admittedly, I am a gadget junkie. I have had natural hair for over 20 years but I have never let it get more than an inch long before buzzing it off. In January 2013, i decided to let it grow and see what it wanted to do. So while visiting D.C. this summer, i attended a natural hair show and saw the company founder demonstrating this product that I had never heard of. I thought it was great, but trying to resist the urge to buy another gadget, I walked away. Later while talking to another attendee, I noticed she had purchased the Q-Redew. I asked her why she bought it. She said that she had used a friend&#x27;s, loved the way it softened her hair, and came to the show specifically to purchase her own at the promotional price. That was all I needed to give into my demons. I went back to the Q-Redew table and they had sold out! But Heidi offered to ship it for free, at the show price. Not only did she ship it, but it got to NJ before I did. That&#x27;s the first example of excellent customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it a few times at first, because it was my new toy, but didn&#x27;t really need it during the summer. Into the drawer it went. Then, a few weeks ago and well past the warranty period, I pulled it out to deal with dry winter hair and had an issue more likely related to prolonged non-usage than to the manufacturing of the unit. I contacted the company via their website and Heidi responded to my question within hours. She went over and above to get my unit working properly. Her recommendation partially fixed the problem and then she sent me a new reservoir to totally fix it. When the first replacement reservoir arrived cracked, she immediately sent another, with a hand written note apologizing for the inconvenience. Example # 2 of excellent customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any and everything can and likely will go wrong with any and every product. It&#x27;s how the company handles the situation and how they make you feel while doing so that really matters. Heidi gets 10 more stars for how she handled this issue.</li>
            <li> I just received my steamer on Saturday and the used it for the first time yesterday.  So far I am not impressed.  It left my hair feeling like it lacked moisture.  I did a braid out after using it and my hair felt crunchy/brittle the next day while also not being dry in the middle of the braid and the ends were frizzy.  That NEVER happens in my braidouts when following my normal hair routine.  My hair was actually more moisturized and looked way better before I used the steamer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will give it 2 more times but 3 strikes and you&#x27;re out!</li>
            <li> It softens and detangles, I wish my soft feeling lasted longer but that&#x27;s just my hair, definitely a staple product.</li>
            <li> So overall, I think this is a good product. It gets rid of most of my frizz, redefines my curls, and gives me some needed volume after a night of wearing my hair up in a ponytail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it 4 stars because at $70 it is a little pricey and at times the device can be louder than I would like.</li>
            <li> Finally, I can have second, third and fourth day curls!! Great purchase.</li>
            <li> This item probably would work for someone else, not me. Using the stream made my hair frizzy. So, I returned the item.</li>
            <li> AWSOME!!! MY HAIR THANKS YOU</li>
            <li> Works really well for my natural hair.  Being a low porosity natural, my hair tends to be very dry.  So u decided to try this steamer to see it will help with getting moisture into my hair.  And it has helped tremendously.  I use to refresh wash n gos, but I mainly use it for deep conditioning.  The steam feels really good on my hair.  I wish, though, that the teeth part were thinner and more abundant.  Love it overall.</li>
            <li> I received this product as a Christmas gift from my sister. It sat in its box for a while because I was transitioning from relaxed to natural and I was wearing my hair in braids at the time. I recently did my big chop and am completely natural. I used the Q-Redew to bring moisture to my hair because it was pretty dry. It did exactly what I needed it to do. It heats up in like 10-15 seconds and there is a constant flow of steam. The only improvement I would recommend is making the water reservoir larger because people with longer hair would have to keep refilling, even with my TWA I had used half of the water.</li>
            <li> This product does produce steam but it does not consistently release the steam as I had hoped.  Also the nozzle head that the water reservoir clips onto gets stuck in the wrong place.  I have to push the swivel thingy back in place so that I can affix the water compartment to it.  That sucks--because I fear that it will eventually break.</li>
            <li> Nice to use with conditioner. Heavier than I expected. Does get really hot. Makes my Afro soft and feel moisturized. I use this tool shortly in morning to refluff my hair on days 2,3,4 or 5 after I take my pineapple down. I use more steam to deep condition or to moisturize my hair with coconut or jojoba oil. Nice invention.i would not use every morning for long period of time because too much steam shrinks my hair.</li>
            <li> What I regreat is not buying this sooner. I decided to relax by hair after 3 years natura l because I couldn&#x27;t deal with my unruly natural hair anymore. Then a week later I discovered this product and now I am in love. Thank goodness I textlaxed so I still very texturized. I used it and my hair felt so soft and moisurized afterwards and it also leightens the hair. I just section my hair in four run the steamer through each section 2-3 timer and use a light moisturizer and seal with oil. With this method my hair stays soft for four days instead of 2 hours. Will definitely recommend if you are natural or textlaxed.</li>
            <li> Like what I&#x27;ve seen so far.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.... for very tight kinky coily hair. Restores moisture!!! It work better when you steam your hair in sections and then seal it with you favorite hair oil. Because it is so hard for my hair to retain moisture I seal my hair with raw shay butter... those two together are magic for mt hair.</li>
            <li> MOISTURE MOISTURE MOISTURE!!! WOW! love this product and am so glad i finally purchased.</li>
            <li> I loved this thing so much i used  it for facials to steam my hair , to deep condition i used it everyday. I encouraged every natural girl she needed to get one. It even worked on refreshing and renewing curly wigs. wow, then one day a few short weeks later nothing. Puffs of hot air. The company said i could clean it with vinegar and water to see if it would open back still nothing all i get now is hot air and an occasional burst of steam very fustrating considering what i paid for it.</li>
            <li> Great purchase adds a lot of hydration to my curls... If you are on the fence about purchasing, please do ... It&#x27;s worth the money</li>
            <li> -Black woman with 3c/ 4a long hair (no chemicals to alter texture or color; use heat once in a blue)-&lt;br /&gt;Right out the box, this was going to change my hair care routine! Nourishing moist heat to stretch and detangle hair, revive an old style, allows conditioning products to better penetrate the shaft for DEEP conditioning---a great product. However, on my 4th or 5th use, the steam wouldn&#x27;t come out. So I pressed the button, and just noise and a little steam. WHAT? So I added more water. Well, it seems to only work when full or near full and then it peters out when a little over half full. I don&#x27;t have hard water, however, I haven&#x27;t tried to clean it with vinegar yet. After each use I empty the reservoir and wipe off the comb part and where the steam comes out to remove product build up and hair. I&#x27;m not sure why it&#x27;s so testy. Perhaps mine is defective. I think so. SAD-FACE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I contacted the company and they troubleshooted with me over the phone. It was decided that the connection between the reservoir and pump wasn&#x27;t a good one, so they would send out a new reservoir and we&#x27;ll take it from there. Fair enough. Cross fingers.</li>
            <li> perfect for any day steaming. i love it. the only flaw is my hair i have low poroisty hair and it thick the water  last the whole time i am steaming my hair but some times i got to refill it. no biggie. my daughter using it she is 9 it is simple to use. i use distilled or filter water.</li>
            <li> I have 3A hair or botticelli curls that won´t stay overnight no matter how much product I use or what I do with them (pineapple, bun, etc). I hate having to wet my hair every morning in order to get a decent second day hair because is not convenient in winter and because my hair takes forever (more than 4 hours) to dry and it just doesn´t look professional to go to work with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product hoping that it would steam my hair and help my curl come back to life after I wake up. First of all, this product gets REALLY hot, so if you are going to use it you need to be careful not to get it too close to your ears, scalp, etc because it will definitely hurt. Second of all, it didn´t do a thing for my hair. I tried it on my hair with product from the day before, then the next time with a leave in conditioner and the third time with gel and every single attempt I ended up with a frizzy mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you ask me, this is WAY overpriced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have run out of options and I will just have to consider this product a complete failure for me. Maybe it is good for other hair types, but definitely not for really soft curly hair that has trouble holding curl after the first day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now I will use it as a clothes steamer... it worked better for that at least.</li>
            <li> The steam makes it easy to detangle my hair.  I saw it demonstrated on a youtube video and decided to buy it.  Great for detangling 4c hair.</li>
            <li> I love it. It smooths the kinks but defines the curl. I put masque or curl definer in and use the steamer. It is awesome. Pulls through the snarls without ripping the hair. It is also great for wash day for deep conditioning. I wish there was a carrying case for travel. I am always concerned about breaking the teeth of the steamer.</li>
            <li> The customer service is excellent.  I love the product but after a few uses it started to malfunction.  It was replaced within a week!</li>
            <li> Item does not perform as described. I have 4a hair and attempted to add moisture to refresh my braid out and stretch my hair. Instead I ended up with a hot frizzy mess! My defined waves quickly turned into an Afro. Tried to return item and received message this item is listed as hazardous and I need to dispose of it in a waste receptacle. Therefore, if you have not used a friends and are 100% sure you want to keep item, do not buy.  If item was $20, I wouldn&#x27;t be too upset. Nonetheless, it&#x27;s pricey and doesn&#x27;t deliver the results for the price you pay. An alternative is to take a hot shower and allow the steam from the shower to add moisture. Results are the same, and it&#x27;s free. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I have short 4c hair, and I tend to use he prongs to try to elongate my hair and detangle but this steamer causes my hair to break. So I wouldn&#x27;t substitute this with a blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Hello Frizz.  If you have the type of hair that looks great after you&#x27;ve taken a long walk on the beach in the ocean mist or responds well to deep south extreme humidity--this product will work GREAT for you. Personally, I do NOT look better under those conditions. I look frizzy and my defined curls separate as if someone has given me a &amp;#34;nuggie&amp;#34; (you know, rubbing the head rudely and scattering hair everywhere) My hair responds well to the drenching moisture of a warm shower followed by a leave in conditioner like Mixed Chicks. I had hoped to extend that &amp;#34;first day, just washed look&amp;#34; This product does deliver an imperceptible moisture.  It does not mist the hair, instead it provides warm very humidified air- 2 stars for honest advertising. (Truly, I would like to give it zero stars because I paid money to look like a monchichi  doll) Hopefully this rejuvenates your curls. Despite various attempts to love this gadget, It made my 2nd day curls seem as if I had rolled around in wool sheets all night.&lt;br /&gt;(My hair texture is 3b/3c- African American, long length, natural/unprocessed)</li>
            <li> Received a unit that does not work and I have to pay for shipping the defective unit back to the company!  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Zero stars is more appropriate.</li>
            <li> I decided to use it for something a little different!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the Q-Redew to moisturize my heat stretched natural hair. It can be really hard to add a little moisture to straightened or stretched natural hair without completely ruining the style or causing the hair to revert. The Q-Redew has worked great for me. I am able to maintain my hair throughout the week and add moisture. I add a little oil to the hair, steam it and bun it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use and it definitely did what I needed it to do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy</li>
            <li> This does cause me some slight canopy frizz but so did spraying them with water, and the Q-Redew reshapes and wakes up my curls so much better than spraying them ever did. It even works well on first day hair that didn&#x27;t dry quite the way I wanted, or when I diffused a little too roughly. I have not yet tried this using a leave in conditioner first, but I have heard that does wonders to keep the frizz at bay. I highly recommend this tool for any natural curlies!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a few days ago and I tried it this morning.  It worked great!!! I had read reviews and looked on Youtube and all of the reviews was positive. The steam is warm and not too hot to the touch.  My hair was left very soft and not soggy like if I had used a spray bottle to moisturize my hair.  I would recommend this to anyone with dry hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this is a good product for some. But I have 4c, low porosity hair and did not see a change in my hair when using this. It was not what I was excepting. The water holder is so small, needed constant refilling for a detangling session. The steam comes out of two tiny, tiny holes. The  guides seemed like they would help with detangling but not for me.&lt;br /&gt;The idea of it is good but for me I could not make it work for my regimen. To top it all off, it stopped giving out steam, so it went back.</li>
            <li> The product itself was unfortunately defective in that it did not produce the steam as much as it should have when the button was pressed, but that was something that couldn&#x27;t be helped. I have returned the product but can confirm that the product does in fact do what it says it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good quality product, good results, even with a defective one. I was just unlucky, that&#x27;s all. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> This item is a godsend!!! It works perfectly with my afro textured low porosity hair.</li>
            <li> Slightly cumbersome during my first experience using the product. I have fairly thick shoulder length healthy hair.  With that being said, I had to refill the steamer numerous times to the point of exhaustion (slight exaggeration), but maybe not.  This alone was a deterrent and made me second guess my rationale for making this purchase.  In fact,  I own a great Huetiful hair steamer that works like a champ with results.  I guess I will give the Redew another try...may work as an accessory when traveling.  Not a favorite item thus far.</li>
            <li> Works great it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it makes detangling so much easier. It is a good way to add moisture to your hair too.</li>
            <li> Great product! It  adds moisture, curl enhancement, and easy detangling to my hair.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this. Great customer service when I call..</li>
            <li> Not satisfied. I ordered two but only one arrived.</li>
            <li> Nice device. Hard to handle. Awkward to handle. Hard to clean.</li>
            <li> Works very well. Very convenient and does exactly what I needed it for.  The steamer heats up pretty quickly and delivers!!</li>
            <li> I was really excited when I ordered this as I am newly going natural.when I used it the first time it worked well . I&#x27;ve had if for about  3 or 4 months. I&#x27;ve only used it about 3 times. Unfortunately the last time I used it it seemed a it slow in releasing steam.i put it away as I&#x27;ve had braids in. Trying to use this morning nothing. No steam. It&#x27;s ot like I can just send it back ,I live internationally. To pay so much money for this and it not even lasting 6 months is ridiculous .am not saying it&#x27;s not a good product but longevity for money is absurd.</li>
            <li> I have NEVER had a better product. I use this thing at least twice a week. I steam, detangle, condition, and use it as a facial treatment some nights. I LOVVVVE it! I have 2 different textures in my hair, fine 4b on top and thick 4a on bottom. The texture on top always breaks no matter the technique. I have maximum hydrated, curly and tightly coiled, wide toothed combed, water only, hennaed, and oiled and sealed, It still breaks when I detangle. This Q-Redew has cut my breakage down and my anxiety. I have retained my entire 1 and 1/2 inches over the past 3 months. I even use it on my kids hair who all have different textures on the chart. I dont have to spend dreadful time in the bathtub detangling their hair. I pull out the Q-Redew and its detangled, oiled, and styled in 10 minutes at the most AND it looks, feels, and is healthy. I can not express how much I love this thing. If you are having issues with your hair, if you have tried every method in the book, if you have curly, coily, or kinky hair then this tool is for you!&lt;br /&gt;The only con I have experienced is that I have to refill the thing after each section of hair. To cut down on the annoyance of that, I keep a water bottle and fill up after each section. Refilling is not enough for me to remove a star. I fill like if the receptacle was bigger, the steamer could not be handheld, so I&#x27;m cool with it.</li>
            <li> Been through 2 of these and they both stopped working after the third use.</li>
            <li> Okay so at first I was happy with this product, however I did not know that you are supposed to use it constantly. I have only used it 3 times in the 3 years I have had it. When I contacted customer support I was told that not using it all the time causes it to clog. I put vinegar mixed with water to fix the problem but so far nothing has changed. Buyer the aware, save your money!!!!</li>
            <li> Works owners for my low porosity hair!!</li>
            <li> I just got it today, and so far I am not impressed.  It barely produces any steam, intermittent at best. My my $20 clothes steamer works better at 1/3 the price.  I also purchased one as a gift but am considering returning it unopened.  Extremely disappointed, especially since I heard such great things about it.</li>
            <li> Omg this product is wonderful, hair saver!!!!</li>
            <li> Ladies please get this product, if you are a natural this is a good product to have in your health hair care section. I use it when I&#x27;m am doing a hot oil treatment to Detangle my hair and the boost of moisture from the steam turn my hair into a soft,smooth, butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to all ladies please try this.</li>
            <li> This was not for me.This Q-Redew is nice but,oh here it comes !!! To  heavey and it was a hassle to stop and fill the water chamber . As I was steaming My hair I looked in the claws of the steamer first for some steam that didn&#x27;t really flow out that good ,and saw the residue from the products I had put on my hair.,oh we&#x27;ll had to go back,,,,,,</li>
            <li> I hate screwing with my hair...there, said it. I am not one to spend an hour fussing and fussing ---I want to wash it, scrunch some product in it and go. And I want to have my hair look good the next day as well. Yup, asking for a lot. Well, with the Q-Redew Steamer, I can spend 5 minutes or less on my naturally curly hair on day two (often day 3 as well) and go. This item is so worth the money---it really works!</li>
            <li> Loved it at first.  My hair was hydrated and I had less breakage.  I used the product every morning for 10 minutes. After 1 year, it doesn&#x27;t work as well.  It may be clogged with product but I have not found a solution or assistance to increase the steam pressure.  I am not interested in repurchasing this product every year.</li>
            <li> The only reason I do not &amp;#34;LOVE&amp;#34; this product is the frequency which I feel I need to refill the water well. Otherwise, it is a great product. I am still trying to work it perfectly into my hair regimen. My hair texture is coarse, dry, fine and tight curled. When not properly moisturized, it frizzes and mattes. I find using the steamer provides moisture without soaking my hair and makes my hair more pliable. I wish it were a little less cumbersome for travel purposes.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use. Fill the reservoir, plug it up, wait a few minutes... then bam!!! it&#x27;s ready for use. It doesn&#x27;t do as great a job as the hooded steamers, but its great for a midweek moisture booster.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for myself because I am in the transitioning process. When you already have a hairstyle that need a little moisture just use the QREDEW it makes it easier to apply 6he moisture while using some of your essential hair oils to help seal in that moisture. My product arrived really early and as soon as I opened the box I immediately filled the reservoir with water and began steaming. Do I like this product no I actually love this product. It&#x27;s great for detangling and stretching your hair which I think is perfect. This product makes your hair feel soft and manageable and your hair is not saturated with water. If you are not washing your hair on a particular day; use the QREDEW you will love it.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift from my cousin who is in the US, so she brought it for me. Where I live the voltage is 120, and I have numerous products that work with this voltage. But never had I have to worry about any of those products malfunctioning. This product malfunctioned after just 3 or 4 uses. Every time I plug it in now, it just has a fast blinking light and overheats.&lt;br /&gt; I am pretty sure I&#x27;m not the only person living internationally with this product as I&#x27;ve read in other reviews. So then why do so many of your units malfunction? Do you know how stressful and costly it is to return a product to the US? Come on, make sure your units are working properly before sending them to customers so they won&#x27;t have these kinds of headaches.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely NOT recommending this to anyone, the probability of receiving a malfunctioning unit is too high. ESPECIALLY if I know they&#x27;re buying it from outside the US for so much money. There are other ways to get your hair steamed or a hair steamer that costs less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely lost a customer.....</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a while ago and have used the product on and off for a good amount of time to test it out. The whole concept of the product is great! However, what the product is actually capable of doing is horrible. In my experience, the product did not produce nearly enough steam to even mildly steam my thick, natural hair. It made this weird sound which I could deal with if the product actually worked. Overall, I bought this product with the premise that I could use it to quickly steam or re-set my hairstyle. As for me this product has proven to be an epic fail! Sorry, but I am being brutally honest because I really wanted to LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> yesssssssssss not sure why I didn&#x27;t get one of these along time ago</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because  of the price and the fact that it was handheld I figured it should be cheaper but I went on you tube to see how it&#x27;s used and the results and I was pleased and bought it. For black hair we need this extra moisture this handheld device offers especially in the colder months!! I also used it as a facial steamer just kept the stream several inches away from my face and it felt fabulous!! I recommend this!</li>
            <li> I used it once to refresh my hair but it only made it frizzy. So now I only use it when I pre-poo my hair and/or deep conditioning. The steam is very slow coming out. I have to press the button for at least a minute when I turn it on so that the steam comes out steadily.</li>
            <li> I purchased this thinking that it would work a miracle, it did not. I have very tightly coiled, very dense 4a/b and random chunks of 3b/c hair. Once I picked it up I immediately tried it out, but it only dried my hair out. I used it as a moisturize boost and sealed it, it still did not work. So I tried using it while conditioning my hair, my hair barely heated up (it did a better job steaming up by itself in a shower cap). My hair requires a lot of water to moisturize and the steam was not enough. I plan on returning this and just going back to plastic bags and caps.</li>
            <li> Excellent for african american curly hair - added so much needed moisture esp after the big chop… Love it- highly recommend to my natural sistas….</li>
            <li> LOVE MY Q-REDEW!!!  Easy to used. Works as described. Not to heavy, which I love, being I have a bad shoulder.</li>
            <li> Re-moisturizes my hair between washes and deep conditions. I am a 4a 4b girl I co-wash or shampoo and deep condition every two weeks. I use this hair steamer twice per month to freshen up my twist outs and even my blowouts. It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> This steamer is so wonderful. Makes my hair so soft and keeps my curls moisturize. Easy way to stretcg my hair without breaking it off</li>
            <li> Good product, would definitely recommend for burst of moisture</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it to put moister back in my hair as I wear kinky twists extensions most of the and am often concerned about the moisture level in my hair. I love that the product heats up quick 1-2 mins and that I can &amp;#34;seam&amp;#34; my whole head in about 3 mins. Because it&#x27;s steam you can run right out the house and not worry about it needing to dry. Only reason I haven&#x27;t given 5 stars is I haven&#x27;t seen how it works on my natural hair with no extensions. I am really interested to see how it works on softening and loosening my curl pattern after wearing in a &amp;#34;puff&amp;#34; or wash-n-go. I will update in moth or so after I take my twists out and let you know how it worked. There are a couple of great reviews out their on youtube by nauralista&#x27;s that you should check out if you are on the fence about this product.</li>
            <li> I am newly natural and have a twa and was very excited to get this product based on the reviews but have only used it twice. It really doesn&#x27;t do much for my hair at this length so it&#x27;s tucked away in a drawer. Spray bottle revives my curls better. Maybe when I get more length I will revisit</li>
            <li> **Update**  Per Q-Redew&#x27;s suggestion, we contacted their support who walked us through cleaning out the inside of the steamer with vinegar.  It works perfectly, thanks to their great phone support.  5 Star acheivement unlocked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Original**  Ordered this for my fianc&amp;eacute; in March of 2014, here I am in January of 2015  (less than a year) and it&#x27;s broken.  She uses it MAYBE once per month so it&#x27;s not \\&quot;worn out\\&quot;.  Their warranty is only 90 days, not even close to a year, which means they would not find it unreasonable for me to buy a new one every three months.  In my experience, a 90 day warranty is for companies who know that their products won&#x27;t last.  I will be replacing it, but not with another Q-Redew.</li>
            <li> I love this item!!!! Detangling my coily, natural hair is a breeze! I would recommend this to anyone!!!</li>
            <li> This is an AWESOME product for a curly girl like me!  Especially in the winter time because I can’t just use my water bottle to refreshen my curls anymore and go out in the cold with a wet head.  I’m not sure about reviews saying it doesn’t work or it doesn’t produce enough steam, this things kicks out stream and its HOT!  I have short hair so I can really feel the heat fast, but this answered my problems.  I usually have a water bottle that I use with EVOO, almond oil and glycerin but the problem was I would have to let my hair air dry, that was fine in the summer but you can’t so out with a wet head in the winter, this thing, detangles, stretches and revives my curls perfectly!  You fill up the reservoir with water and its ready to go in a few seconds.  Can’t beat this guys, sorry for the people who didn’t receive their desired results.  But I’m totally happy with my purchase!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Have to add water too often. Notice no difference.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after 2-3 uses</li>
            <li> Nice product.  Just as described.</li>
            <li> My product was shipped super fast! I&#x27;m always happy when I get my goodies early. I tested it on my hair after a night out at a hot smokey club and my hair was completely refreshed and moisturized. The only downside is that the stretching doesn&#x27;t last. That&#x27;s only because of my hair texture. I&#x27;ll probably style of twist my hair after to prevent shrinkage.</li>
            <li> It was great while it lasted. After a year of using it less than once a week, it stopped making steam. I got a replacement water reservoir from the manufacturer but that did not permanently resolve the issue. Pretty annoyed.</li>
            <li> I saw this product on YouTube and it seems to work well for the people that were using it. I purchased it and it stopped working after several use. I contacted the owner and he was very nice. He immediately sent me a new working Q-Redew and I returned my damage one. After a couple of weeks, it stopped working again. I was too frustrated to bother, I just threw it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mimiplac</li>
            <li> I am african american and I have natural hair.  I love using this to add just amount of moisture to my hair with out having to spray it with water, especially in the winter months.  Cant live without it.</li>
            <li> I love my Qrewdew!!! It make my hair very soft and moisturized my hair becomes much more manageable.</li>
            <li> Great as a refresher on old styles for my natural 4C hair.</li>
            <li> I love the Q-Redew!  I do not use it daily but when I use it, it is RIGHT ON TIME and considered a lifesaver!</li>
            <li> I truly love how Q-Redew kept my 3b hair soft, supple and curly for days! I never had a bad 2nd or 3rd hair day after using this product. I would need to rewet my hair and hope for the best on day 2 and definitely on day 3! I think this product should be a staple in every curly&#x27;s hair care regiment!! Definitely a keeper!!</li>
            <li> Used to go to high priced natural salon whose focus was  encouraging women to stop relaxing and hair health but focus was flat iron styles gorgeous cuts and one of the hair treatments was the steamer. After washing a light conditioner was applied then sit under the steamer followed by cool rinse. I think this same sequence should be used with this handheld steamer.  I have 4b -4c hair and after watching a few you tube reviews I purchased this. One comment on you tube review is that this is still heat so a heat protectant should probably be used, after using this I agree.&lt;br /&gt;- I used it before a braid out and to loosen and help detangling a  puff and stretching hair for a bun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives: I like that hair is steamed uniformly and not saturated. Great result and did not take a  long to dry as wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;Made detangling a breeze. easy to do bun on stretched hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:  Steam is very hot. Cuticle must have opened due to extreme heat and hair felt rough even though it made combing through a breeze. Receptacle a little small so I had to refill it 3-4 Times in one session. In one of my refills I apparently did not let it heat up all the way and scalding water dropped out and burned my shoulder. Not enough to leave a mark but enough to shock me and make me pay more attention to indicator light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:  Will use infrequently possibly not comb through feature. Will use a heat protectant and follow by cool spritz to close cubicles and a leave in  conditioner w slip and coconut oil Shea butter</li>
            <li> Love it! It&#x27;s perfect for refreshing a hair style and deep conditioning.</li>
            <li> For my 4c hair that constantly needs moisturizing, this little gadget is simple and easy to use in the mornings. I do the LCO method almost every morning so this really helps. And it absolutely helps with detangling. I use it for everything.  If you have 4c (really 4e) type hair, then you need this. Trust me!!</li>
            <li> This is a great steamer but the stream sometimes collects and drips on your skin.  Very hot.  I think it&#x27;s better for use with longer hair. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be a staple products once I grow my hair back again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d love this product IF it worked!  I have returned two non-functioning units via their AWESOME customer service (really, they are very sweet) and thought the third one was a charm, but I was wrong.  It decides when it wants to release steam in a consistent matter.  Otherwise, it just bursts bits of steam out here and there.  I&#x27;m SO disappointed, though, because IF it worked, it would be THE BOMB!</li>
            <li> This gently keeps my hair moisturized and curly.  It&#x27;s just the right temperature and pressure not to cause frizz but it makes curls spring into shape.  Great customer service and a very helpful tool.</li>
