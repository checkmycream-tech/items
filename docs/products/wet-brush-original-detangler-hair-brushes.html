            <li>Love this brush, wish I knew about it sooner :)</li>
            <li>Brushing hair is always a challenging time in our house.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has the curliest, most tangled hair I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li>Love this brush.</li>
            <li>and they all love them.  </li>
            <li>I have a very tender head and this was a joy to work with.  </li>
            <li>I bought 4, because I&#x27;m sure at some point it&#x27;ll break, and I don&#x27;t want to risk ever being without it.</li>
            <li>love these brushes i have 2</li>
            <li>We have owned 5 of them now and we love them.  </li>
            <li>My kids love this brush.</li>
            <li>They call it the magic Brush.</li>
            <li>Be sure to clean it out free EVERY brushing!</li>
            <li>Now for young children this is a great brush since their hair is thinner</li>
            <li>Loved it so much I bought one for a friend.</li>
            <li>It is so soft yet very effective.</li>
            <li>and it tangles easily.</li>
            <li>, then I started brushing and tangles came out easy and painlessly.</li>
            <li>Easy to brush through your hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that knots up in the shower.</li>
            <li>These brushes are fantastic.</li>
            <li>enjoy.</li>
            <li>The first one is 2 years old and still going strong!!!</li>
            <li>I have super fine hair that tangles easy.  </li>
            <li>Also perfect for little girls!</li>
            <li>Most brushes are very hard on tangled hair, but this brush is absolutely great!  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried every spray on detangler and special hair brush out there.</li>
            <li>Nothing special about this brush...</li>
            <li>and it works great wet or dry very nice</li>
            <li>I am now able to skip the moisturizing step because my hair is so slick and fine on its own, that I love skipping this step.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t, but still pretty cool.</li>
            <li>Three different colors would have been nice.</li>
            <li>This brush just glides right through it.  </li>
            <li>This brush goes right through her hair with no problems.</li>
            <li>I have to  be honest that I probably would not have purchased these brushes if they weren&#x27;t online because  they do not look very attractive compared to other brushes of the same price -- but these brushes work VERY WELL even with long curly hair right out of the shower!</li>
            <li>I always used a very large wide-tooth comb to deal with it,&lt;br /&gt;then</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different brushes that claim to get out tangles without tears,  but this one does EXACTLY what it says!</li>
            <li>Great for my fine hair and my daughter&#x27;s copious amounts of hair-- wet or dry.</li>
            <li>My daughter has natural wavy hair, and she gets huge knots in it.  </li>
            <li>The product details lead you to believe that you will receive a set of pretty colored brushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to be repurchasing this for sure and probably will also get it in smaller sizes for my desk/purse/car.</li>
            <li>When I tried this brush for the first time, it yanked a wad of hair out, which I could see in the bristles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made mornings so much easier in this house!</li>
            <li>This brush doesn&#x27;t look any different than a normal brush, and even looking at it, I didn&#x27;t think it was going to be any different, but boy is it great.</li>
            <li>I have very long hair and during the winter it gets a lot more tangled.</li>
            <li>Had to return, but seller acted quickly and professionally.</li>
            <li>This brush works great getting thru wet, long hair.  </li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s just say that I&#x27;ve Strongly considered doing dredlocks on several occasions.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Owned one before, this brush is great on thick hair!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great for brushing wet or dry hair.  </li>
            <li>Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I like it better than a comb on my wet hair.</li>
            <li>was the real thing with the writing on the brush.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t give this to a friend, it is going straight into the trash can.</li>
            <li>This brush REALLY works.  </li>
            <li>So I tried it &amp; couldn&#x27;t believe how much easier it was to detangle my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is also very oily</li>
            <li>It really works and gets all the tangles out.</li>
            <li>It gets the tangles out so very easily without pulling out half my hair as my wide-toothed comb combined with moisturizer did.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it works well for others, but I have very fine long buttery soft hair</li>
            <li>It is great to use on wet or dry hair, and it doesn&#x27;t pull hair like a normal brush would.  </li>
            <li>I actually first received this brush in a popsugar subscription, then my daughter took it, so I bought a new one.  </li>
            <li>This does it easily and relatively pain free, even when the hair is dry.  </li>
            <li>Over all good purchase , just wish it worked a little better in thick hair.</li>
            <li>My 8 year old daughter thanks you!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It also works great in wet or dry hair unlike some brushes which work well on only one.</li>
            <li>My granddaughter has long curly hair and it was always a struggle to comb it right after her shower, but that problem was solved by this brush!  </li>
            <li>Oh well, live and learn.</li>
            <li>I will always buy it when I need a new one.</li>
            <li>No more crying, just beautiful hair.</li>
            <li>This brush has saved my relationship with my 9 year old daughter!</li>
            <li>It removed every tangle, except one bit that had worked itself into a solid knot, easily, and with a very minimal pulling sensation.  </li>
            <li>The brushes work very well, especially with curly or tangled hair.</li>
            <li>The bristles were too soft / bendy for me.</li>
            <li>I was so surprised at how well it worked.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look or feel much different than every other brush I&#x27;ve had, but this thing sure does work differently.</li>
            <li>It gets matted and tangled so easily that when I wake in the morning I usually have to spend 15 minutes combing the rats out.</li>
            <li>She has long hair and this brush makes it di much easier to cumb through.</li>
            <li>It also works on my long straight hair.  </li>
            <li>it works fine with hardly any pain.</li>
            <li>They work well for thick or fine hair.</li>
            <li>It us amazing and no more crying when I brush her hair!</li>
            <li>While the price was great, I was disappointed in the product packaging &amp; the condition of the brush.</li>
            <li>I had to get another for my grandson who has longer than average, very curly hair.</li>
            <li>My 2 young daughters have long hair and we have not found anything that works this well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also slightly curled and kinky, but in some parts it&#x27;s straight.</li>
            <li>gets through my wet or dry hair like it&#x27;s absolutely nothing.  </li>

            <li> gets through my wet or dry hair like it&#x27;s absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li> I have long lightly curly thin hair.  </li>
            <li> I have baby fine, thin, colored hair, that I hardly ever use conditioner on since I want as much fullness as I can get.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> Yes, my hair has a lot of texture and it&#x27;s really pretty, but it is hard to manage!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> The only complaint is that I ordered 3 at once and they sent 2 of the same color.</li>
            <li> You have another seller that sell&#x27;s the \\&quot;wet brush\\&quot; for a lower price.  </li>
            <li> She would cry when we had to brush it out, even while it was wet and we put conditioner in it.</li>
            <li> I am so amazed that $8 could have be spent so well.</li>
            <li> I have all but ditched my million dollar Mason Pearson brush (which smoothes well, but doesn&#x27;t untangle well) for The Wet Brush.</li>
            <li> I have long thick Asian hair and detangling after washing my hair used to take several minutes in the morning and hurt a bit, and now takes less than 1 minute and doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick, naturally wavy hair down to my waist.</li>
            <li> My girls love how they work on their hair, but I have to admit that we were disappointed.  </li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s wet, it is a champ!  </li>

            <li> I would definitely recommend these for those with hard to manage hair out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I have long hair that reaches past my shoulder blades.</li>
            <li> It gets tangled and used to take me 1/2 hour to brush it out, and was extremely painful, often causing an incredible amount of frustration, tears and anger.  </li>
            <li> It combs through my hair within ten minutes after each shower, even brushing while wet, it just runs through the nasty tangles so easily.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s NOT true.  </li>
            <li> but my hair is long and thick</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> now i have long thick hair</li>
            <li> Hurts less and rips out so much less hair after showering!</li>
            <li> A little pricey for a brush though.</li>
            <li> I actually had to cut a couple of tangles out of my hair a few weeks ago because it was too painful to try and work them out - prior to buying this brush.</li>
            <li> The product packaging was all scratched, dusty &amp; had the appearance that it had been in someone&#x27;s basement long term.</li>
            <li> On top of that terrible packaging.</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s wet, it&#x27;s a thousand times worse.</li>
            <li> With thick hair you still have to brush both sides of your hair (inside and outside layers) so as long as you have that expectation, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a hard time brushing my hair.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very thin compared to my other brushes, I guess that is the secret.  </li>
            <li> you get 1 and only 1 :(.</li>
            <li> No more tears for us!!</li>
            <li> I can detangle all of my hair in around 2 minutes with out hearing my hair get pulled and broken.  </li>
            <li> the trip just made it worse.</li>
            <li> remember when I was a child and teenager, I would have to lay my head across my sister&#x27;s lap while she spent hours brushing through the knots that got caught on the base of my neck.</li>
            <li> If this brush works on my difficult hair type, it should work on anyone&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I had heard about this brush and was really skeptical, but I got one any way</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I bought this that it could do what it said.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical as to how this brush would work, but I thought I would give it a try anyway.  </li>
            <li> It says colors may vary, but we didn&#x27;t count on getting all 4 of the ugly gold color.  </li>
            <li> De-tangling it before and after washing has always been a painful and time-consuming chore.  </li>
            <li> How am I supposed to give that crap for a gift?</li>
            <li> Mine are both under 10, and hate getting the knots worked out.  </li>
            <li> I stared at the brush in disbelief because the reviews raved about it, yet I suddenly hated it.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine had the brush at the lake, and we all know that tangles are at their worst after hours in the lake.</li>
            <li> She bristles were bent to hell and it looks terrible.</li>

            <li> So I thought this was going to be some kind of magical hair brush... It isn&#x27;t, but still pretty cool. If you have A LOT of hair like me, this brush will not be your go to. But if you have thin-normal hair I think this will be perfect. I brush my toddlers crazy hair with easy with this brush. Over all good purchase , just wish it worked a little better in thick hair.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter with long hair loves this brush. I had to get another for my grandson who has longer than average, very curly hair. She wouldn&#x27;t share hers! LOL!</li>
            <li> Great in looks, price, packaging, delivery, &amp; function.  Best brush ever!!!  This is a very good deal....go for it now.</li>
            <li> Love this brush, wish I knew about it sooner :)</li>
            <li> Never used a brush that didn&#x27;t pull my hair until this one! Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Excellent brush. Works without damaging your hair.</li>
            <li> Brushing hair is always a challenging time in our house. We&#x27;ve tried every spray on detangler and special hair brush out there. So far this one seems to work the best.</li>
            <li> It reads the \\&quot;collection\\&quot;  I assumed that I was getting the collection meaning all 4, I got 1 for 7.70.  You have another seller that sell&#x27;s the \\&quot;wet brush\\&quot; for a lower price.  I should have gone with that because this was no set.</li>
            <li> i purchased this after my stylist recommended it to help minimize breakage.  it&#x27;s great for brushing wet or dry hair.  but do not style with it - the heat melts the bristles.</li>
            <li> Brushes came in today.  My girls love how they work on their hair, but I have to admit that we were disappointed.  It says colors may vary, but we didn&#x27;t count on getting all 4 of the ugly gold color.  Oh well, live and learn.</li>
            <li> The absolute best brush in the world! So great that after buying one I ordered another for a friends birthday!!!!! And they hold up well! The first one is 2 years old and still going strong!!! Be sure to clean it out free EVERY brushing! Also perfect for little girls!</li>
            <li> Best brush I have ever owned! Gets out all tangles with ease.</li>
            <li> This brush has saved my relationship with my 9 year old daughter! She has long hair and this brush makes it di much easier to cumb through. No more tears for us!!</li>
            <li> The brush initially worked very well on my daughters long, thick hair. However, over a period of 2-3 months,the little plastic balls at the end of each individual \\&quot;comb\\&quot; fell off, causing tearing, pulling, and damage to her hair. I eventually had to throw the brush away. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love love love this brush! My hairdresser used it on me and suggested I get one. Hurts less and rips out so much less hair after showering!</li>
            <li> These brushes are fantastic. They work well for thick or fine hair. It also works great in wet or dry hair unlike some brushes which work well on only one.</li>
            <li> As another recent review states, 1 brush comes in the order as opposed to the 4 pack collection it appears you are ordering. On top of that terrible packaging.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush \\&quot;set\\&quot; and only received 1 brush for over $7. are you kidding me?. Now that&#x27;s what I call a SCAM. The product details lead you to believe that you will receive a set of pretty colored brushes. NOT! Count it...you get 1 and only 1 :(. The seller got me with this one. Fool me twice...shame on me.</li>
            <li> this brush does make it easier to de tangle my hair after washing but my hair is long and thick and it takes a lot longer than it does with a regular de tangling brush. I usually end up starting out with the wet brush and finishing with my regular de tangling brush.  Now for young children this is a great brush since their hair is thinner it works fine with hardly any pain. Life saver for those tender headed baby girls!</li>
            <li> Great Product. Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li> These brushes don&#x27;t pull your hair or cause any pain. The brushes work very well, especially with curly or tangled hair.</li>
            <li> The bristles were too soft / bendy for me. Had to return, but seller acted quickly and professionally.</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick, naturally wavy hair down to my waist. It gets matted and tangled so easily that when I wake in the morning I usually have to spend 15 minutes combing the rats out. When it&#x27;s wet, it&#x27;s a thousand times worse. I have tried every brush and detangling comb imaginable and nothing worked well...until I found this brush. It slides through my hair like butter. Four or five strokes and it&#x27;s all combed out. If this brush works on my difficult hair type, it should work on anyone&#x27;s hair. I highly recommend it! I plan to buy another one to keep in the shower to comb conditioner through my hair, and another one to keep in my purse.</li>
            <li> I have quite long hair. It&#x27;s very fine and it tangles easily. I had heard about this brush and was really skeptical, but I got one any way and I&#x27;m so glad I did. This brush doesn&#x27;t look any different than a normal brush, and even looking at it, I didn&#x27;t think it was going to be any different, but boy is it great. I can detangle all of my hair in around 2 minutes with out hearing my hair get pulled and broken.  I threw out my existing brush the day I got this. I&#x27;m going to be repurchasing this for sure and probably will also get it in smaller sizes for my desk/purse/car.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine had the brush at the lake, and we all know that tangles are at their worst after hours in the lake. I forgot my brush so I used my friends brush thinking nothing of it, then I started brushing and tangles came out easy and painlessly. I was so amazed I ordered my brush on Amazon that day!</li>
            <li> This brush works great getting thru wet, long hair.  My 2 young daughters have long hair and we have not found anything that works this well.  A little pricey for a brush though.</li>
            <li> Best Brush Ever!!!!  For all hair types.  I have super fine hair that tangles easy.  This brush just glides right through it.  Loved it so much I bought one for a friend.</li>
            <li> Best thing ever. Wet or dry!,,</li>
            <li> Great for my fine hair and my daughter&#x27;s copious amounts of hair-- wet or dry.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I bought this that it could do what it said. I have to say that this hair brush might single handedly save my relationship with my daughter. It us amazing and no more crying when I brush her hair! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  I actually first received this brush in a popsugar subscription, then my daughter took it, so I bought a new one.  It is great to use on wet or dry hair, and it doesn&#x27;t pull hair like a normal brush would.  I like it better than a comb on my wet hair.</li>
            <li> They made it look like you got 4 brushes for 6.99 but its only one and you can&#x27;t even pick the color. Then when I received it it had been packaged in a book package far too small for th brush. She bristles were bent to hell and it looks terrible. How am I supposed to give that crap for a gift? Not only that but the handle was dented along with the plastic covering that was supposed to have protected the bristles. Now I have to go through the hassel of returning. And hopefully I can get the nxt one by Christmas. What carelessness. It was obviously already damaged before they even sent it and the trip just made it worse. How irresponsible!</li>
            <li> good brush, but did not arrive as picture seen...writing on brush is not visible...it is on outer package...and brush that I bought from my hair salon was the real thing with the writing on the brush.  but still a good brush!</li>
            <li> My daughter has the curliest, most tangled hair I&#x27;ve ever seen. She would cry when we had to brush it out, even while it was wet and we put conditioner in it. This brush goes right through her hair with no problems. No more crying, just beautiful hair. I would recommend this brush to anyone.</li>
            <li> Owned one before, this brush is great on thick hair!</li>
            <li> Ouch. I read all of the wonderful reviews and decided to purchase this brush thinking it would solve my tangled hair issues. When I tried this brush for the first time, it yanked a wad of hair out, which I could see in the bristles. I tried it again, OUCH. I stared at the brush in disbelief because the reviews raved about it, yet I suddenly hated it. I wouldn&#x27;t give this to a friend, it is going straight into the trash can. Perhaps it works well for others, but I have very fine long buttery soft hair and this brush yanked and snapped my hair into pieces. Ugh.</li>
            <li> This brush is so great. It was recommended to me by my hairdresser. I have long thick Asian hair and detangling after washing my hair used to take several minutes in the morning and hurt a bit, and now takes less than 1 minute and doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. With thick hair you still have to brush both sides of your hair (inside and outside layers) so as long as you have that expectation, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser uses one and it worked so well I bought them for my girls and my nieces. The only complaint is that I ordered 3 at once and they sent 2 of the same color. Three different colors would have been nice.</li>
            <li> Love this brush. We have one for my daughter with a tender head and one for my husband who kept stealing my daughters brush.</li>
            <li> These are the best....enjoy. I gave them to 4 girls and they all love them.  Easy to brush through your hair.</li>
            <li> I have had this product now for a year and frankly wondered how I ever lived without it. It gets the tangles out so very easily without pulling out half my hair as my wide-toothed comb combined with moisturizer did. I am now able to skip the moisturizing step because my hair is so slick and fine on its own, that I love skipping this step. Before I had to use moisturizer just to get the comb through. This is a wonderful product: well-made and comfortable to use. And, does what it promises!</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, curly hair.  De-tangling it before and after washing has always been a painful and time-consuming chore.  This brush REALLY works.  It removed every tangle, except one bit that had worked itself into a solid knot, easily, and with a very minimal pulling sensation.  I have a very tender head and this was a joy to work with.  Where have you been all my life?  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This brush lives up to its claims. I have very long hair and during the winter it gets a lot more tangled. I actually had to cut a couple of tangles out of my hair a few weeks ago because it was too painful to try and work them out - prior to buying this brush. Get it. It works!</li>
            <li> 5 star if they can get this brush to last longer than about 3 mths!! The bristles get softened over time &amp; won&#x27;t comb thru nothing! Ugh!!</li>
            <li> Amazing! I have long hair that reaches past my shoulder blades. It is very fine hair, but LOTs of it. It&#x27;s also slightly curled and kinky, but in some parts it&#x27;s straight. Let&#x27;s just say that I&#x27;ve Strongly considered doing dredlocks on several occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember when I was a child and teenager, I would have to lay my head across my sister&#x27;s lap while she spent hours brushing through the knots that got caught on the base of my neck. I&#x27;ve frustrated hair stylists at upscale salons with how easily my hair tangles. I&#x27;ve sat for 45 minutes to two hours after EACH shower, brushing my damn hair. Yes, my hair has a lot of texture and it&#x27;s really pretty, but it is hard to manage!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried lots of different brushes and picks and combs and cremes, mousses, glossers, etc. Nothing worked! For thirty years, nothing worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until I got this brush. I am so amazed that $8 could have be spent so well. How did I not find this brush before? It combs through my hair within ten minutes after each shower, even brushing while wet, it just runs through the nasty tangles so easily. I never thought I was going to find a solution after all this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When hair gets built up in the brush, it doesn&#x27;t detangle as well, so I suggest cleaning the brush of hair after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful product. Planning to gift it to all of my female family members. We all have some form of the hair hell I&#x27;ve described.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a hard time brushing my hair. This brush is wonderful! I will always buy it when I need a new one.</li>
            <li> I have 2 girls, ages 6 and 8, and brushing their hair has always been an issue.  Most brushes are very hard on tangled hair, but this brush is absolutely great!  My kids do not complain and they like these brushes.  I have ordered several for our home.  These brushes are great!</li>
            <li> I have baby fine, thin, colored hair, that I hardly ever use conditioner on since I want as much fullness as I can get.&lt;br /&gt;When I get out of the shower, my hair looks like a tangled up rats nest.  I always used a very large wide-tooth comb to deal with it,&lt;br /&gt;then my hairdresser friend raved about this brush. So I tried it &amp; couldn&#x27;t believe how much easier it was to detangle my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Works GREAT! I definitely recommend trying it out.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this brush! I have tried so many different brushes that claim to get out tangles without tears,  but this one does EXACTLY what it says! It&#x27;s made mornings so much easier in this house! My 8 year old daughter thanks you!</li>
            <li> gets through my wet or dry hair like it&#x27;s absolutely nothing.  I have long lightly curly thin hair.  It gets tangled and used to take me 1/2 hour to brush it out, and was extremely painful, often causing an incredible amount of frustration, tears and anger.  I couldn&#x27;t believe that this would actually work, because to me, it seemed like.. a brush is a brush is a brush.  but that&#x27;s NOT true.  This is literally the best and only brush I will EVER own.  I bought 4, because I&#x27;m sure at some point it&#x27;ll break, and I don&#x27;t want to risk ever being without it.</li>
            <li> I purchased mine at another online store (not Amazon) for $6 each.  I have to  be honest that I probably would not have purchased these brushes if they weren&#x27;t online because  they do not look very attractive compared to other brushes of the same price -- but these brushes work VERY WELL even with long curly hair right out of the shower! The bristles are very thin compared to my other brushes, I guess that is the secret.  My granddaughter has long curly hair and it was always a struggle to comb it right after her shower, but that problem was solved by this brush!  By the 3rd stroke, the tangles were smoothed away!  I was so surprised at how well it worked.  It also works on my long straight hair.  I would definitely recommend these for those with hard to manage hair out of the shower.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased this brush for my daughters.  Now we have one for upstairs and one for downstairs.  This works great for knotty girls hair.  Mine are both under 10, and hate getting the knots worked out.  This does it easily and relatively pain free, even when the hair is dry.  When it&#x27;s wet, it is a champ!  Good buy for a cheap price.</li>
            <li> love these brushes i have 2 now i have long thick hair and it works great wet or dry very nice</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that knots up in the shower. It is also very oily so I cannot use a lot of product. This brush combs out my knots without a lot of breakage.</li>
            <li> I had this brush recommend to me, and have now bought it for another friend. This brush is perfect if you have fine hair that tangles easily. Especially in the winter, when my hair would be knotted from wearing a scarf, this thing saved the day. But it doesn&#x27;t feel ripping, like I am harming my hair either. I have all but ditched my million dollar Mason Pearson brush (which smoothes well, but doesn&#x27;t untangle well) for The Wet Brush. 5-stars!</li>
            <li> We have owned 5 of them now and we love them.  They do not pull, yank, and/or tear our hair.</li>
            <li> Nothing special about this brush... I have fine, thin hair, and it still gets caught up when brushing wet.</li>
            <li> I am really impressed with this brush. It is so soft yet very effective. I wish I knew about this brush before. It would have saved me lots of hair loss due to hair tangling. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush for my niece after purchasing the same product at a local store. While the price was great, I was disappointed in the product packaging &amp; the condition of the brush. The product packaging was all scratched, dusty &amp; had the appearance that it had been in someone&#x27;s basement long term. The back of the brush was also scratched &amp; covered in what ever debris the outer packaging had also been exposed to. I suppose I could take the brush out of its packaging to give it to my niece, but it looks as if the brush has been used.&lt;br /&gt;While I wasn&#x27;t choosey about the color, I also received the same gold color.</li>
            <li> My kids love this brush. They call it the magic Brush. It really works and gets all the tangles out.</li>
            <li> My daughter has natural wavy hair, and she gets huge knots in it.  I was skeptical as to how this brush would work, but I thought I would give it a try anyway.  It works because the pad allows the bristles to move with the hair.  I have given this brush as gifts to family members.</li>
            <li> This brush will get out the biggest and rattiest of tangles, and no tears!  It doesn&#x27;t look or feel much different than every other brush I&#x27;ve had, but this thing sure does work differently.</li>
