            <li>However they are the perfect size to go in your  purse or for traveling.</li>

            <li>I am so blown away by the great size and quality of these powder containers.</li>
            <li>The product itself is great</li>
            <li>It was great because I don&#x27;t have to buy another powder.</li>
            <li>They are lovely, great quality and they even come with a closing sifter, AND the price was for two!!...</li>
            <li>Excellent product and it arrived quickly!</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Will purchase more if the need arises, great price</li>
            <li>These are great quality and i love that there is a mechanism to prevent the powder from leaking out during transport therefore preventing messes.  </li>
            <li>Happy with the purchase. :)</li>
            <li>Perfect, exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used them for powder prodcuts that don&#x27;t have the handy sifter that closes...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, great product!</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how perfectly it works.</li>
            <li>and I have a new, perfect container :)</li>
            <li>I was even more excited when I received them!!</li>
            <li>They are good quality and work perfect for transferring Ben Nye&#x27;s loose powders to a container for easy use!</li>
            <li>The container seals very nicely and allows the right amount of powder to come out per use.</li>
            <li>Honestly, what loose powder container is perfect?</li>
            <li>These are fantastic!</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t think I can find a better container.</li>
            <li>Yes there is a bit of static electricity at the beginning, but that has gone away.</li>
            <li>I bothered to read the description, I would have known this is more for brushing, not proofing powder all over the bathroom.  </li>
            <li>Love the size and the sifter.  </li>
            <li>The reason is probably static electricity, because the powder clings to the walls of the container.</li>
            <li>One&#x27;s for my purse &amp; another in my vanity drawer at home. :)</li>
            <li>I was very excited when I saw these on Amazon.</li>
            <li>These containers are perfect for storing loose powder if your container breaks.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my loose powder.  </li>
            <li>But some people mentioned that the packaging wasn&#x27;t very good, it had no option to open and close</li>
            <li>These arrived much quicker than I thought they would and were very easy to put together!</li>
            <li>Nothing is perfect (esp when it comes to dealing with loose powder) but this does what I expected and I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li>Any suggestions on where I can find a container to fit my puff?</li>
            <li>This is what I use when my face powder cracks in its original container.</li>
            <li>The sifter turns smoothly and the right amount of powder comes out.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>These jars were exactly what I needed!  </li>
            <li>This was a perfect solution for a broken powder I had.</li>
            <li>My powder comes out just the right amount.</li>
            <li>just need it larger. :)</li>
            <li>A bit smaller than I expected, but this will be great for travel.</li>
            <li>no loose powder spills, no extra powder in the top of the container!  </li>
            <li>Since you can open and close the inside dispener with the rotating tab, it&#x27;s easy to select the amount I want to use</li>
            <li>Very well priced.</li>
            <li>I like that you can adjust how much powder comes out.</li>
            <li>It came much quicker than I anticipated.</li>
            <li>It has the option to open and close, and is very travel friendly.</li>
            <li>I purchased a 3.5&amp;#34; puff and not being familiar with these kinds of products, I assumed powder containers were all the same size.  </li>
            <li>these jars made it possible to keep using the blushes, and keep my makeup bag clean and neat.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slightly cheap, light weight, and smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li>I was glad to find this compact container that could be locked to avoid mess.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something a half an inch bigger for my finishing powder (about the size of my neutrogena powder), but overall this is still a good size esp.</li>
            <li>The lid of my Cover Girl loose Powder always cracked and I tried to fix it with tape, super glue etc.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t realize how small they are, but you do get 2 of everything, and the holder with holes is fantastic!</li>
            <li>so the product makes a huge mess when traveling with.</li>
            <li>I can put a small amount in the container and store the rest in a dark cool place so it doesn&#x27;t expire quickly.</li>
            <li>My Bare Minerials container had busted and I needed something to keep it in that</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I didn&#x27;t have to waste my expensive make up that broke</li>

            <li> Good for a few weeks until the plastic cracks at the threads :-(&lt;br /&gt;Little chunks start to come off, then you have to throw it away, and find a new container.</li>
            <li> It was much smaller than I expected.</li>

            <li> Will be ordering another to mix two colors of loose blush together.</li>
            <li> Product was just what I needed, a container for loose powder.</li>
            <li> As another reviewer has written, I was going to use them for the leftovers of my compact powder, and also for a loose powder that didn&#x27;t come in a locking container.</li>
            <li> The container is sturdy, the lid screws tight so the powder will not leak, and you can open and close the sifter.</li>
            <li> had they been a little bigger.</li>
            <li> A plain, simple, empty container for a 3 and 1/2 puff?  </li>
            <li> (The other container I still have not used yet).</li>
            <li> I am surprized that other reviewers didn&#x27;t seem to have this experience -</li>
            <li> I just got this the other day.</li>
            <li> I put powder in both of the containers and put one in my travel cosmetic case and the other in my everyday cosmetic case.</li>
            <li> Typical guy mistake when it comes to unfamiliar situations.</li>
            <li> Alas, the lock is useless, because even when it&#x27;s open I can&#x27;t get the powder out of there, no matter how much I shake it.</li>
            <li> I was in desperate need of a loose powder container to hold my new SPF powder.</li>
            <li> I put the broken powder in this container, crushed it all the way, and now I have a loose powder.  </li>
            <li> Allows me to store my mineral powder makeup in a narrow desk drawer where I keep all my makeup.</li>
            <li> I found these and ordered a few</li>
            <li> Container slightly too small.  </li>
            <li> I love the powder I use but the container was awful and I always had powder all over in my makeup case.</li>
            <li> so there&#x27;s no more waste!</li>
            <li> I travel all the time and usually have to buy two of everything...</li>
            <li> so you have the option to have the powder come through or not (kind of like pepper dispenser).  </li>
            <li> VERY small.</li>
            <li> I use this container to put my broken Bobbi Brown shimmer brick in.</li>
            <li> so I could split my expensive powder products and always have what I want with me!  </li>
            <li> I tend to react badly to stuff that has additives in it.</li>

            <li> Good for a few weeks until the plastic cracks at the threads :-(&lt;br /&gt;Little chunks start to come off, then you have to throw it away, and find a new container. This happened to both. This also happens to almost every powder container I use. I don&#x27;t know why - and if it&#x27;s just me!!  I just want a powder container that won&#x27;t crack.</li>
            <li> A bit smaller than I expected, but this will be great for travel.</li>
            <li> Perfect, exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic! They are good quality and work perfect for transferring Ben Nye&#x27;s loose powders to a container for easy use! Will purchase more if the need arises, great price and they look good too!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Palladio rice powder which got rave reviews. But some people mentioned that the packaging wasn&#x27;t very good, it had no option to open and close so the product makes a huge mess when traveling with. So I purchased this container and its perfect, I love it! It has the option to open and close, and is very travel friendly. But like most other loose powder containers, it can get can get a little messy. But I don&#x27;t think I can find a better container.</li>
            <li> VERY small. Not quite what I was looking for (my fault for not seeing size). However they are the perfect size to go in your  purse or for traveling.</li>
            <li> These are great quality and i love that there is a mechanism to prevent the powder from leaking out during transport therefore preventing messes.  Highly recommend, great product!</li>
            <li> Allows me to store my mineral powder makeup in a narrow desk drawer where I keep all my makeup. I like that I can put a small amount in the container and store the rest in a dark cool place so it doesn&#x27;t expire quickly.</li>
            <li> Container slightly too small.  Prefer larger.</li>
            <li> These were perfect! My Bare Minerials container had busted and I needed something to keep it in that had some sort of sifter to it. These arrived much quicker than I thought they would and were very easy to put together! Very well priced.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. I like that you can adjust how much powder comes out. Works great with my mineral powder makeup</li>
            <li> They were an excellent make up powder container.  My powder comes out just the right amount.</li>
            <li> This was a perfect solution for a broken powder I had. The container is sturdy, the lid screws tight so the powder will not leak, and you can open and close the sifter. I was pleasantly surprised at how perfectly it works. Saved my $30 powder from being trash.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and it arrived quickly! I may place a second order soon! These containers are perfect for storing loose powder if your container breaks. No need to throw the makeup away anymore.</li>
            <li> Nothing is perfect (esp when it comes to dealing with loose powder) but this does what I expected and I am happy with the product. It isn&#x27;t too solid but it isn&#x27;t flimsy either. I hope the silver wont chip.</li>
            <li> The lid of my Cover Girl loose Powder always cracked and I tried to fix it with tape, super glue etc.  These containers are a great solution - and great for travel.</li>
            <li> Definatly exceeded my expectation! I got this for my loose makeup setting powder. I love the powder I use but the container was awful and I always had powder all over in my makeup case. Since I transferred my powder into this Buca container, my powder stays inside because it actually screws shut, which is why I ordered it. Since you can open and close the inside dispener with the rotating tab, it&#x27;s easy to select the amount I want to use so there&#x27;s no more waste! I love it!</li>
            <li> I was in desperate need of a loose powder container to hold my new SPF powder. I just purchased the refill of the powder and not the dispensing brush since it was an extra $36.00, so I needed something that i could dip my brush in.  I was very excited when I saw these on Amazon. I was even more excited when I received them!! They are lovely, great quality and they even come with a closing sifter, AND the price was for two!!...I thought I was buying one. Yes there is a bit of static electricity at the beginning, but that has gone away. Honestly, what loose powder container is perfect?</li>
            <li> Did not arrive with the powder sifter ... therefore, I won&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> I put arrowroot powder in one of the two containers (The other container I still have not used yet). I used the powder to keep my oily skin at bay. The sifter turns smoothly and the right amount of powder comes out. Good product.</li>
            <li> To tiny to use a brush for my powder</li>
            <li> I ordered this to use when the makeup in my pressed powder compact broke.  I put the broken powder in this container, crushed it all the way, and now I have a loose powder.  Didn&#x27;t have to throw away my makeup!  Will be ordering another to mix two colors of loose blush together.</li>
            <li> I purchased a 3.5&amp;#34; puff and not being familiar with these kinds of products, I assumed powder containers were all the same size.  Typical guy mistake when it comes to unfamiliar situations. I don&#x27;t like to ask for directions either.&lt;br /&gt;Had I bothered to read the description, I would have known this is more for brushing, not proofing powder all over the bathroom.  Any suggestions on where I can find a container to fit my puff? A plain, simple, empty container for a 3 and 1/2 puff?  I recall my mother having one with unscented baby powder in it, which is my ultimate goal. I tend to react badly to stuff that has additives in it.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for! Happy with the purchase. :)</li>
            <li> I use this container to put my broken Bobbi Brown shimmer brick in. It works perfectly! The container seals very nicely and allows the right amount of powder to come out per use.</li>
            <li> Product was just what I needed, a container for loose powder.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my loose powder.  Love the size and the sifter.  Just what I needed!!</li>
            <li> These jars were exactly what I needed!  I had two blush compacts where the powder cake started to break up - these jars made it possible to keep using the blushes, and keep my makeup bag clean and neat.</li>
            <li> I was glad to find this compact container that could be locked to avoid mess. As another reviewer has written, I was going to use them for the leftovers of my compact powder, and also for a loose powder that didn&#x27;t come in a locking container. Alas, the lock is useless, because even when it&#x27;s open I can&#x27;t get the powder out of there, no matter how much I shake it. The reason is probably static electricity, because the powder clings to the walls of the container. So, I just removed the sieve and simply stick my powder brush inside the container. I am surprized that other reviewers didn&#x27;t seem to have this experience - perhaps, that depends on the type of powder? Mine is a translucent pigment-free finishing powder, so maybe it&#x27;s lighter.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that the cap (the mid part) had a twisty thing so you have the option to have the powder come through or not (kind of like pepper dispenser).  I&#x27;m so happy I didn&#x27;t have to waste my expensive make up that broke and I have a new, perfect container :)</li>
            <li> I just got this the other day. It came much quicker than I anticipated. It&#x27;s slightly cheap, light weight, and smaller than I expected. I was looking for something a half an inch bigger for my finishing powder (about the size of my neutrogena powder), but overall this is still a good size esp. for traveling in a make up bag so in the end I am happy. One&#x27;s for my purse &amp; another in my vanity drawer at home. :)</li>
            <li> I am so blown away by the great size and quality of these powder containers. I can&#x27;t wait to use them with my homemade make up.</li>
            <li> I must have missed something. It was much smaller than I expected. The product itself is great just need it larger. :)</li>
            <li> This is what I use when my face powder cracks in its original container. It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I travel all the time and usually have to buy two of everything...I found these and ordered a few so I could split my expensive powder products and always have what I want with me!  I&#x27;ve also used them for powder prodcuts that don&#x27;t have the handy sifter that closes...no loose powder spills, no extra powder in the top of the container!  You can totally see through these so you&#x27;ll always know when you need to refill...no guessing.</li>
            <li> Got these yesterday. Didn&#x27;t realize how small they are, but you do get 2 of everything, and the holder with holes is fantastic! I put powder in both of the containers and put one in my travel cosmetic case and the other in my everyday cosmetic case. It was great because I don&#x27;t have to buy another powder. Would have given it a 5 star rating had they been a little bigger.</li>
