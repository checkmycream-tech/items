            <li>--LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li>That said, nothing has come off on my pillow, but I guess that could be because I don&#x27;t sleep on the top of my head, lol!  </li>
            <li>then, I will use the light brown and do my best, as there is nothing else on the market quite like it.</li>
            <li>It was delivered quickly and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Therefore, I think it is absolutely perfect for me and well worth the expense.</li>
            <li>Great stuff but its like your paying for a full dye job for the amt you get.</li>
            <li>Excellent coverage and not messy at all.</li>
            <li>Darker than advertised, which is fine with me, had to learn with trial and error, but BY FAR best and easiest to use root concealer on the market.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s not as sticky and washes out better</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Works much better than the liquid tubes I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Definitely the best root concealer I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>Love it, Too pricey.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the better root concealers out there.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>br /&gt;it&#x27;s not a terrible contrast</li>
            <li>it is very handy to have dont have to colour it as much</li>
            <li>Perfect cover of grey</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more shade for dark brown would be perfect!</li>
            <li>Works well and easily.  </li>
            <li>It flushes easily from the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply, is not effected by rain/water, stays on hair, does not flake or dust.  </li>
            <li>My hair grows very quickly with roots showing at the end of 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Very good to cover the grey hair immediately</li>
            <li>This light brown works, but tends to look as if I have highlighted roots.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fabulous product.</li>
            <li>The Rita Hazan Root spray is by far the easiest and most effective way of covering roots between colors.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply, looks natural, covers nicely, and doesn&#x27;t have the stinky toxic smell of the &amp;#34;Tween Time&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Anyway, I tried their tester in the store first to be sure of the color.  </li>
            <li>Also, I wash my scalp pretty vigorously and most of the spray stays on my hair</li>
            <li>Great temporary cover for grey roots.</li>
            <li>or it can just cleans up your look when your roots want to show there true color, blend them away with Rita Hazan Concealer.</li>
            <li>so you will need to spray in quick bursts and move the sprayer quickly along the hairline.  </li>
            <li>The light brown isn&#x27;t light enough, should be lighter.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s because my hair (natural or relaxed) is porous and can absorb the color effectively because it looks so natural that even I can&#x27;t tell that it&#x27;s a cover up.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>Very high quality product,</li>
            <li>The spray comes out really fast</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>I really like this product because it covers the gray roots and lasts until you wash your hair.</li>
            <li>spray bottle costs $25, but you don&#x27;t need much at all.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Caution:  You only need a quick spray and I highly recommend you do that over the sink and without any clothes on!  </li>
            <li>I have white hair, dyed professionally every four weeks to a hi-lights/low-lights light brown/blond.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I think next time I&#x27;ll just try to read the fine print and order a bigger can or find one at sophora.</li>
            <li>I bought a can of this at Sephora, wow talk about sticker shock!  </li>
            <li>I usually use it just where my hair parts on the top of my head and</li>
            <li>I thought the product of the can would be larger and the price was a bit higher for what I got.</li>
            <li>The light brown goes on fairly dark, but I run my brush through my parted hair and it blends beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>BE CAREFUL if this is your first time using this spray!  </li>
            <li>It lasts, is super-easy to apply just where you want it and blends in to look completely natural.</li>
            <li>It covers completely and also gives body to your hair.</li>
            <li>It just looks like my natural hair color.</li>
            <li>It will easily last two days if you don&#x27;t wash your hair, and even hangs in there when I get it wet in the shower between shampoos, only requiring a quick, light extra shot the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like everyone else I am on a budget and this product is worth every penny as color touch ups at the Salon are less frequent which in the long run saves money !</li>

            <li> I do prefer Style Edit because for one, it&#x27;s half the price and secondly, it works as well for me.  </li>
            <li> so I only have to do really little touch up after blow</li>
            <li> Pretty expensive for such little amt.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> only complaint?</li>
            <li> There is not a color for us dark brown haired ladies.</li>
            <li> Purchased &amp;#34;light brown&amp;#34; as I have medium to dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> If you scratch your head or rub your fingers with slight pressure, the color does get on your fingers.  </li>
            <li> The black coverage is truly black and looks a bit harsh when I try to blend it into the dark brown.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The concealer is very dark.</li>
            <li> I had to try it a few times to write this review.</li>
            <li> It does make your hair feel a little bit stiff, but still does the trick.</li>
            <li> After spraying a small amount all over the gray areas, I noticed that the color dried in less than 5 minutes, it didn&#x27;t come off on my hands</li>
            <li> This looked like I sprayed liquid face concealer onto my hair and it dried into a sticky, hard, glue-like substance.  </li>
            <li> However too expensive.</li>
            <li> I bought this one because I was desperate and couldn&#x27;t wait for my delivery of Style Edit from Amazon.</li>
            <li> It covers gray hair well, does not rub off and does not look artificial.</li>
            <li> BUT it is crazy overpriced here!  </li>
            <li> made my hair feel awful even though said it wouldn&#x27;t :-(</li>
            <li> Horrible, horrible product.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Blends well and hides that unbaring bald spot or it can just cleans up your look when your roots want to show there true color, blend them away with Rita Hazan Concealer.</li>
            <li> This does NOT cover your roots! I bought blonde. My natural color is a dark blonde. This looked like I sprayed liquid face concealer onto my hair and it dried into a sticky, hard, glue-like substance.  Horrible, horrible product.</li>
            <li> I bought a can of this at Sephora, wow talk about sticker shock!  Anyway, I tried their tester in the store first to be sure of the color.  I usually use it just where my hair parts on the top of my head and it colors well.  BE CAREFUL if this is your first time using this spray!  The spray comes out really fast so you will need to spray in quick bursts and move the sprayer quickly along the hairline.  I noticed that the spray leave the hair a bit sticky.  If you scratch your head or rub your fingers with slight pressure, the color does get on your fingers.  That said, nothing has come off on my pillow, but I guess that could be because I don&#x27;t sleep on the top of my head, lol!  Also, I wash my scalp pretty vigorously and most of the spray stays on my hair so I only have to do really little touch up after blow drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy this again?  Maybe.  I do prefer Style Edit because for one, it&#x27;s half the price and secondly, it works as well for me.  Plus it&#x27;s not as sticky and washes out better which I prefer.  I bought this one because I was desperate and couldn&#x27;t wait for my delivery of Style Edit from Amazon.</li>

            <li> Wonderful product. It really works. I am so happy to have found this.</li>

            <li> Purchased &amp;#34;light brown&amp;#34; as I have medium to dark brown hair. The concealer is very dark. Cheaper products are equal.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. If not for this product I would need to go to the salon every 2 weeks to have my roots dyed. With this product, I can stretch it to 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> Works well and easily.  Does just what I wanted it for.  This is my second purchase and not my last.</li>
            <li> Very high quality product, but I only got 5 uses (days) out of the bottle, so cost is a factor. Would like to see it last 2X as long given the cost, would be 5 stars then.</li>
            <li> Works much better than the liquid tubes I&#x27;ve tried.  It does make your hair feel a little bit stiff, but still does the trick.</li>
            <li> Wish I could have rated it no stars</li>
            <li> Very good product. However too expensive.</li>
            <li> I really like this product because it covers the gray roots and lasts until you wash your hair.</li>
            <li> this is for anyone that get&#x27;s skunk hair before they can get it dyed.  it will save you!  the color is great, it stays in place with no issues all day and washes out (may need 2 washes to get it out).  Love!!</li>
            <li> I did not like this product...made my hair feel awful even though said it wouldn&#x27;t :-(</li>
            <li> I had to try it a few times to write this review. It is an excellent product. Definitely the best root concealer I have ever tried. It covers gray hair well, does not rub off and does not look artificial. A little goes a long way. You don not have to reapply it between hair washes.</li>
            <li> Yes, this tiny 2 oz. spray bottle costs $25, but you don&#x27;t need much at all.  I have white hair, dyed professionally every four weeks to a hi-lights/low-lights light brown/blond.  I use Rita Hazan the last week between salon appointments.  I just use it for my part and another place where I might part my hair.  The light brown goes on fairly dark, but I run my brush through my parted hair and it blends beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caution:  You only need a quick spray and I highly recommend you do that over the sink and without any clothes on!  Occasionally, a bit will dribble from the spray spout and you don&#x27;t want it on your clothes.  It flushes easily from the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all--LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> I love the product. It was delivered quickly and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Love it, Too pricey.  Sephora does not stock it anymore... Look for an alternative.</li>
            <li> The light brown isn&#x27;t light enough, should be lighter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product several times. It works great in between beauty salon visits. It does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> This is one of the better root concealers out there. It is easy to apply, is not effected by rain/water, stays on hair, does not flake or dust.  Its perfect for in between colors when you have a lot of roots to cover.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This product is great ! Like everyone else I am on a budget and this product is worth every penny as color touch ups at the Salon are less frequent which in the long run saves money !</li>
            <li> it is very handy to have dont have to colour it as much</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fabulous product. It covers completely and also gives body to your hair.</li>
            <li> Very good to cover the grey hair immediately</li>
            <li> Excellent coverage and not messy at all. Best I have found.</li>
            <li> Works great for me in between salon appointments.</li>
            <li> Pretty expensive for such little amt.</li>
            <li> I have African American &amp;#34;nappy&amp;#34; hair that has been relaxed and I did not have the problems mentioned by others here. After spraying a small amount all over the gray areas, I noticed that the color dried in less than 5 minutes, it didn&#x27;t come off on my hands and it didn&#x27;t come off when I began to sweat. Maybe it&#x27;s because my hair (natural or relaxed) is porous and can absorb the color effectively because it looks so natural that even I can&#x27;t tell that it&#x27;s a cover up. It just looks like my natural hair color. Therefore, I think it is absolutely perfect for me and well worth the expense. I should mention that I did use hair spray before applying the cover up so that also may be the reason it went on so well....the hair spray may be acting as a type of &amp;#34;primer.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> great product.  start off with a dab of spray. a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It is easy to apply, looks natural, covers nicely, and doesn&#x27;t have the stinky toxic smell of the &amp;#34;Tween Time&amp;#34; that I used to buy from Sally Beauty Supply.  BUT it is crazy overpriced here!  Sephora sells it for $25.00 for 2 oz. spray bottle.</li>
            <li> This product provides the best coverage for grays.  Helps me extend my color touch ups at lease another week!</li>
            <li> Great temporary cover for grey roots.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  My hair grows very quickly with roots showing at the end of 2 weeks.  Fortunately I&#x27;m a blonde so&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s not a terrible contrast but I see it; this keeps me for another 2 weeks until roots need to be done again.</li>
            <li> Great stuff but its like your paying for a full dye job for the amt you get. 2 oz!!! Root touch up products are suppose to save you money in between dye jobs!</li>
            <li> Does cover the gray but doesn&#x27;t spray on evenly.</li>
            <li> Darker than advertised, which is fine with me, had to learn with trial and error, but BY FAR best and easiest to use root concealer on the market.</li>
            <li> Perfect cover of grey</li>
    </ol>
