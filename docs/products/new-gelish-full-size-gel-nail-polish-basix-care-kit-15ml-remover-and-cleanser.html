            <li>I love doing my own nails, and this set is perfect.</li>
            <li>birthday girl, my daughter, just loved this.</li>
            <li>What I didn&#x27;t like was my inability to find a really good manicurist, and</li>
            <li>I also loved the fact that once I set the time on the lamp it automatically started when I placed my hand in to cure.</li>
            <li>This is a good starter kit to begin using gel nail polish.  </li>
            <li>I loved my daughters</li>
            <li>and I had lost a fair amount of it.  </li>
            <li>but I imagine it has a good purpose to prepare the nail for the Foundation.  </li>
            <li>Good idea</li>
            <li>I recieved this package in great shape and it even had directions with it that were very easy to understand.  </li>
            <li>but these are full size and awesome.</li>
            <li>I waited to write this review until I had tried MANY of the tips from MANY of the wonderful reviewers on Amazon.com!  </li>
            <li>Awesome set, perfect for starting to do your own gel nails.</li>
            <li>Its thicker than most non salon brands its great and its gives salon results.</li>
            <li>the foundation and top it off along with the ph bond works great.</li>
            <li>These are fabulous products, they work incredibly well.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re nails more than i do my own but still a great product</li>
            <li>Great products, would have liked to have instructions come with them, but I was able to get instructions off the Gelish website.</li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>WAITED TO WRITE THIS REVIEW UNTIL AFTER READING MANY REVIEWERS, WEBSITES AND MONTHS OF TRIAL AND ERROR!    </li>
            <li>I love this kit!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I have used this product for about a month now and just love it!</li>
            <li>First timer and loved this is the way to go !!!</li>
            <li>The sound is excellent and it is easy to operate .  </li>
            <li>I ran out of the polish remover much more quickly than anything else, but it was definitely a great investment!</li>
            <li>Great price and product to start you off on gelish nails for the UV curing light.</li>
            <li>It saves me time by allowing me to do my nails when I have the time and the convenience of doing it in my own home.  </li>
            <li>I decided that I wanted to try to do my own gel manicures.</li>
            <li>removed the salon gel application which was OPI Axxium (good product also, just geared more toward pros</li>
            <li>I have been doing my own nails for years ..</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t want any kind of oil on the nails.      </li>
            <li>Nail Strengthener,  REALLY HANDY FOR ACETONE &amp; ALCHOHOL-</li>
            <li>so this was really nice.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled with the product.</li>
            <li>This is a good buy because it comes with the pH bond, bottom coat, and top coat which are your essentials to use the gelish polish.</li>
            <li>It is nice to have everything I need for my Gelish nails.</li>
            <li>has everything you need to start off doing your own gel nails.</li>
            <li>the cuticle oil dnelks wondeful, kind of lemony.</li>
            <li>so I could do my own nails and save money.</li>
            <li>I have really liked the Gelish products</li>
            <li>I liked it</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going to do your own nails</li>
            <li>I had this product used at a manicure shop and liked the results; however, the baisc kit came without any instructions what so ever.  </li>
            <li>I think it was a good buy for the beginner &amp; am pleased with the package kit.  </li>
            <li>I would advise a beginner to get it one time then make your own decision.</li>
            <li>I found it very easy to use and started doing my own nails.  </li>
            <li>I even use regular color nail polish under the top coat of gel and it works great and looks beautiful!</li>
            <li>They come with detailed instructions that me, being a novice, had no difficulty being successful with.</li>
            <li>Seller was reliable, nice, inexpensive and shipped very quickly!</li>

            <li>I am not a manicurist, just a chick with a love of nice looking nails.  </li>
            <li>This complete kit gets you started with everything you need for your gelish mani, and at a great price too!</li>
            <li>I am just starting to do my own gel manis, and this was the perfect starter kit!</li>
            <li>My friend recently started doing her own gel nails and this was the perfect starter kit for her.</li>
            <li>I was happy to get everything I needed in one kit and the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li>The first time it was great then just ruined my nails and would stay on longer than a week</li>
            <li>Great price, shipment is fast!</li>
            <li>Doing my own gel manicures is so easy and saves me a ton of money.</li>
            <li>A quick Google search of \\&quot;Gelish instructions\\&quot; gave me some good web sites and videos for instruction.</li>

            <li>Love it great thanks.</li>
            <li>Shop elsewhere and make sure you get the product through a qualified vendor.</li>
            <li>Love this starter kit . . .</li>
            <li>I get better at it every time I use it.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to make appts or travel across the city to my favorite manicurist.  </li>
            <li>Love the product, and came in on time.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the pricing.</li>
            <li>I use most of the kit, however I use Acetone to remove the nails and not the stuff supplied in the kit.</li>
            <li>I have already used it many times.</li>
            <li>This is such a wonderful kit to start Gel Nails.  </li>
            <li>then i looked at the rest of the products i brought, the nail polish remover was mostly gone</li>
            <li>even more pissed cause</li>
            <li>I have really enjoyed using this kit to do gel polish at home.</li>
            <li>I love the Gelish products.  </li>
            <li>I decided to buy my own LED light and start doing them at home.  </li>
            <li>you basically would need most of these to use the gel nail polish.</li>
            <li>Below is what has finally worked for me the best.  </li>
            <li>Apply  NAIL STRENGHTENER RECOVERY-gold bottle for added strength and that takes care of most problems.)</li>
            <li>Apply Gelish Top Coat (GELISH TOP IT OFF GEL SEALER).</li>
            <li>TOP LED Nail Gel Polish Cure Lamp Harmony Shellac UV Dryer Timer Control</li>
            <li>They are taking the top layer of keratin off.</li>
            <li>Polish as desired followed by the Gelish Top</li>
            <li>My nails feel like they have a glass coating on top.  </li>
            <li>It has everything I needed and it is top quality.</li>
            <li>Love this kit.</li>
            <li>After about a week the top of the bottle for the top coat came off.</li>
            <li>That being said I love everything else.</li>
            <li>so it has more than paid for itself.</li>
            <li>Authentic.</li>
            <li>I cant wait to get more</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>This is why I LOVE Amazon.  </li>
            <li>While I love the Gelish products, I did not like this buying experience.  </li>
            <li>Love it, save a ton of money at the nail shop,</li>
            <li>SINCE STARTED TO USE IT, MY NAILS GROW PU HEALTHY AND</li>
            <li>The Gelish Basix kit is a much better value on-line than in the store.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the best makes my nails look wonderful without having to have fake nails on</li>
            <li>better than to buy it all separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although I will probably just use acetone polish remover and regular rubbing alcohol when their counterparts run out, this was the PERFECT starter set!</li>
            <li>depending on how often you use them and how many people you are doing.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>I love being able to do my on gel polish.  </li>
            <li>This is such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>I love gelish.</li>
            <li>but I still love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I don&#x27;t have to do that anymore.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Then your doing touch ups more often.</li>
            <li>I love it because I got it on time and the product was in perfect conditions, I totally recommend it</li>
            <li>I love doing my shellac nails at home.</li>
            <li>:) :)</li>
            <li>what more can you say...</li>
            <li>Was an ok kit but could have just skipped the nail cleaner, the top coat take off.</li>
            <li>Love that I found this set at the price I got it for.  </li>
            <li>I love it, even though it seem the company fix this kit</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
            <li>Love this brand,I had the lamp from them too.</li>
            <li>I love this set.</li>
            <li>This is the next best thing.</li>
            <li>I think it is better, I have flimsy nails and this has helped keep them stronger.</li>
            <li>My wife &amp; daughters absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love love love Gelish.</li>
            <li>cheaper than the nail salon :)</li>
            <li>Just love this kit.  </li>
            <li>They all work but the Gelish polish seems to have a better set &amp; it is a stronger, more durable polish bond in the end.  </li>
            <li>The Top</li>

            <li>Off top coat for even more intense shine!)</li>

            <li>My very first attempt at doing my own nails was a huge success.  </li>
            <li>yet that isn&#x27;t basically accurate.  </li>
            <li>I can buy that for like $4 for a huge bottle.</li>
            <li>next time,offer directions, a DVD would have been great (especially appreciated by the novice as I).  </li>

            <li>it&#x27;s a great size and last for a while</li>

            <li>[...]  Gelish recommended cure times are based on using a Gelish Harmony LED Curing Light.  </li>
            <li>They are great products, and similar to Shellac in their wearing, but all of the others come in a pot and are applied with a gel brush.      </li>
            <li>The end result is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic kit of everything you need to start at home gel use.</li>
            <li>This comes with everything you need to do gel nails except the light and the color of gelish polish you want.  </li>
            <li>You need to also buy the color and a UV light to cure, but once you are all set up you will save loads as opposed to going to the salon.  </li>
            <li>what a fantastic value.</li>
            <li>I enjoy going to a salon for a manicure</li>
            <li>This kit plus the purchase of a curing light and 1 additional color will allow you to have gel nails at a fraction of the price of going to the salon.</li>
            <li>Fortunately I had placed it all in a ziplok bag before placing it in my suitcase so there was no damage done.....</li>
            <li>goes on smooth without bubbles.&lt;br /&gt;Top</li>
            <li>It works great, and I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li>The Gelish  basic kit works great .</li>
            <li>After a few times you will perfect it.  </li>
            <li>I wish I would&#x27;ve bought a LED light instead of UV.</li>
            <li>Light Nail Dryer]]  </li>
            <li>so you get a smooth finish.  </li>
            <li>You will require an LED or UV curing light.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy that I can buy the same product and do my nails myself.</li>
            <li>I used the Gelish and so far so good.  </li>
            <li>Just what I was looking for and true to description they are full size!</li>
            <li>I was in the hospital at the time, so I wasn&#x27;t able to go through my mail right away.</li>
            <li>I tried the Top It Off on my right hand and it wouldn&#x27;t cure either.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So very worth it.</li>
            <li>i was extremely excited, but then as i touch the nail polish top, it just came right off.</li>
            <li>They work great, easy to use and cost me just a little bit more than a &amp;#34;mini&#x27;s&amp;#34; starter set my friend purchased.</li>
            <li>This full size kit is such a great value compared to the Mini line that&#x27;s being sold at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.  </li>
            <li>It works so good, and I love how long it lasts.  </li>
            <li>These are not the mini sized bottles, they are the full-size bottles, kit was well worth it!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is the original consistency</li>
            <li>Received in a timely manner excited to try it out</li>
            <li>I was so excited when it came in the mail that I had to immediately try it out.</li>
            <li>I was really satisfied with this purchase because every bottle did exactly what the instructions said it was suppose to do.</li>
            <li>The items were taped shut with packaging tape and did not have their original seal.</li>
            <li>Clean up as needed.  </li>
            <li>Remove the dust and clean the nail.  .  </li>
            <li>Use an orange stick to fully clean around cuticles with the alcohol.</li>
            <li>this is called a clean up brush.</li>
            <li>If you like Gel Nails this product is super fantastic.</li>
            <li>It is by far my favorite top coat.  </li>
            <li>it will still be SUPER tacky even when you wipe it as directed after being under the light.  </li>
            <li>Gently remove the shine using the 100 grit side of a 100/180 Buffer until very smooth.      </li>
            <li>I do not believe this is the true Gelish product...  </li>
            <li>I went with full size.</li>
            <li>it came with full size</li>
            <li>Nice quality no harsh smells.</li>
            <li>I had tried getting gel manicure at a local salon and loved it.  </li>
            <li>This helps the applied gel to self level in a nicely rounded and natural shape.</li>
            <li>The larger size containers make this kit a good value for the price.</li>
            <li>I just bought these items and so far I liked using them .It</li>
            <li>It has everything you need to get started, all in full size bottles.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would recommend is if your going to buy this kit make sure you have a LED/UV light with 18W or better.</li>

            <li>The cuticle oil is a nice touch but not necessary.</li>
            <li>Allowed me to get familiar with these products without investing too much money.</li>
            <li>Loved the product!!I got the full size bottles for the same price that I would have gotten the complete mini basix kit at Sally&#x27;s.</li>

            <li>it peels right away</li>
            <li>If you use it right you should have it for a food amount of time</li>

            <li>I put too much the first time &amp; it took longer under the light.</li>
            <li>Love that I can get full size product at same price as &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; kits!</li>
            <li>It will even up your French manicure very easily.</li>
            <li>However, the other bottles are great and it really helped me to purchase this as a first time user.</li>
            <li>Start to Finish Regular Clear Polish on top of the Gelish Top it</li>
            <li>Sometimes I even just coat my nails with the bottom and top clear gels and then use a regular colored polish on top then</li>
            <li>i am not a professional just wanted to have my own kit for when i have no time to make it into the salon</li>
            <li>It has a great shine and seals everything in and is probably the key of the polish lasting so long.&lt;br /&gt;Nail</li>
            <li>but anyways this is by far a scam to get 43$ easy cause first when i opened it</li>
            <li>If you are just starting out this is an awesome buy you get full size products that last a long time....</li>
            <li>Also I received it very fast.</li>
            <li>this has everything you are going to need and it is pretty self explanatory with each bottles labels.</li>
            <li>if you  have payed attention during your gel polish manicure at a salon you will know exactly what to do</li>
            <li>it peels off the first time she bathes</li>
            <li>Definately worth the cost and will stock up again very soon.</li>
            <li>it is first time i use Gel nail.</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>I bought this the first time I started doing gel manicures at home myself.</li>
            <li>I think) and applied this Harmony product using a  UV light I also purchased on Amazon (USpicy® MACARON USND-3603 36W Professional UV</li>
            <li>i suggest u try it from some1 else but read reviews first it might help.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve been known to add a final top coat of OPI</li>
            <li>For the whole kit and price, it was worth it.</li>
            <li>it will last better.  </li>
            <li>Apply Gelish NAIL STRENGHENER STRENGTH-green bottle ..  (instead of GELISH FOUNDATION GEL) - first seal the edges of the nail.</li>
            <li>then add a regular top coat to make it all shiny.  </li>
            <li>These are exactly what was needed and  </li>
            <li>First let me say that I would have given this 5 stars had the Acetone not leaked all over.  </li>
            <li>technician uses CDN Shellac on my nails and its always peeling off, lasting maybe 3 days at the most.  </li>
            <li>Its only been a day, but I can tell this is more durable.  </li>
            <li>Some of the items are a necessity and others you can do without or purchase a larger size at a better price.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Otherwise, the nail system works great for long lasting mani&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I love not having to pay extra for gel colors.</li>
            <li>This was my first purchase.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery too!</li>
            <li>, they go on well, look great, last a long time (you can get 2-3 weeks out of a correctly applied manicure), and</li>
            <li>It seems that maybe the top of the bottle wasn&#x27;t on properly.  </li>
            <li>This was my first experience with gel polish.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Its price is better than buying individually.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed...only caveat....</li>
            <li>Exactly what&#x27;s advertised</li>
            <li>This was a great deal and will last me a long time.</li>

            <li>I didn&#x27;t the first manicure I did on myself and</li>
            <li>Clearly that person didn&#x27;t understand that this type of polish requires a light to cure and the cleaning solution at the end.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted...</li>
            <li>Paid for itself the first two times i used it.</li>
            <li>Still great to have full size products for a little extra.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised that these are actually Full Size Bottles like the ne you see in your nail salon.  </li>
            <li>This gel stuff is very drying on the nails and you must moisturize constantly for healthy nails.</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s a huge influx of similar uv gel polish products right now.</li>
            <li>Loved it got it sooner than expected!!!!</li>
            <li>This is pretty much your prefect starter kit...</li>

            <li>Peels off easy even when following all steps correctly.</li>
            <li>Key is to be patient... soak nails, scrape off what comes off easily, then soak again, and repeat.  </li>
            <li>I find my pedicure will last easily 4 weeks ..</li>
            <li>and I can see them lasting for a good long while.</li>
            <li>Even if you use pure acetone it will NOT remove.  </li>
            <li>I have been able to make my nails last up to nearly 4 weeks!  </li>
            <li>My product was in a re-used box with labels taped over, I&#x27;m not sure the bottle labels are authentic and liquid bottles did not have their original seal</li>
            <li>ordered this after I noticed that my CND shellac was peeling off much sooner than it should have.</li>
            <li>Picture is from a whole week after doing my nails.</li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t care for the way it was packaged</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>works very well.</li>
            <li>so I appreciated finding the whole kit in one place.</li>
            <li>This is a reasonably priced kit for gelish polishes.</li>
            <li>apply vitamin E oil to your nails and fingers after this process because the acetone is very drying.  </li>
            <li>I use a narrow orange stick and an old cleaned polish bottle filled with acetone to remove any gel touching  a cuticle or skin.  </li>
            <li>Various helpful supplies I got from Amazon.com:  magnifying glasses, lint free cloth, brush for Structure Gel,  </li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s not that much of money for the amount of products you&#x27;re getting</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for the item.</li>
            <li>or so I can then just gently scrape/</li>
            <li>I also bought the Harmony18G LED light that was my BIG investment</li>
            <li>So I cannot really review my order.</li>
            <li>(Except for the LED or UV light and actual color polish.)</li>
            <li>this is whole kit is a must.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and very well packaged</li>
            <li>Very satisfated with the kit.</li>
            <li>You really cannot beat this price.</li>
            <li>but the whole process does take time, so it depends on how much I have.  </li>
            <li>I can highly recommend these products and this seller!</li>
            <li>Thanks for the kit, it makes it much easier to order.</li>
            <li>cover that with a regular clear top coat polish....</li>
            <li>This is a good kit but it seems like some of the prep polishes are thick.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this, as it is easy to apply and definitely adds strength to the nail.  </li>
            <li>this works very, very well and my nails look very natural.  </li>
            <li>gel hardened as it should, nice glossy finish as promised, rock hard after final round under the UV light, &#x27;sticky&#x27; finish came off easily with lint free rounds.  </li>
            <li>It &#x27;s easy and the products go a long way.</li>
            <li>It has the remover, nail cleaner (needed before your first coat and after your last), your base coat, top coat, ph bond (to help the basecoat adhere better), and nail oil (to keep your cuticles in good shape).  </li>
            <li>Since only about 1/4 of one bottle leaked and I had been so excited to try the gel polish, I decided not to return the item, but just go ahead and use it.</li>
            <li>Wipe the nail with NAIL PREP (or70/91% alcohol) using a lint free wipe (can even use small cuts of lint free paper towel).  </li>
            <li>I received in less than 7 days, and they are real full sizes.</li>
            <li>I only go to the salon when I want a special treat.  </li>
            <li>These bottles are all full size bottles; such a deal.  </li>
            <li>First remove old gel polish.</li>
            <li>overall can&#x27;t beat the price because they are all full size bottles.</li>
            <li>Full size bottle are a bang for your buck because the mini set cost the same.</li>
            <li>This kit saves you money by doing your gel manicure at home and with the full size bottles it will last awhile.</li>
            <li>I particularly like that they are FULL SIZE bottles...not the mini ones that you can purchase (for around the same price) in beauty stores.  </li>
            <li>and I have more than half a bottle.</li>
            <li>Half of the top coat polish spilt over everything else in the box.</li>
            <li>When I run out, I will only buy the things that are essential--The Blue Nail Cleaner, which someone said is just rubbing alcohol, the Foundation, the polish, &amp; the Top</li>
            <li>The Gelish line is super high quality and if you do it correctly your manicure will last for weeks.  </li>
            <li>I do not always use it due to how much time I have on hand &amp; it does fine without</li>
            <li>Top coat wont close and it leaks and make mess</li>
            <li>This set is the real deal, it even arrived early for me!</li>
            <li>That would probably be the only down side, but overall great product.</li>
            <li>Would recommend highly recommend.    </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I love this brand as it stays a little longer than a lot of the cheaper brands.  </li>
            <li>That is why you make sure it goes under the nail a little too</li>
            <li>If you choose you can  emove some of the tacky surface residue with clean dry brush.  </li>
            <li>After all the supplies I&#x27;ve bought, including polish and a UV light, I&#x27;ve probably spent $120.</li>
            <li>After all the supplies I&#x27;ve bought, including polish and a UV light, I&#x27;ve probably spent $120.</li>
            <li>I use a q-tip and really scrub near the cuticle with the cleaning solution, and that seems to do the trick.  </li>
            <li>Everything is full size and lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li>just a few more layers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so not only is it better to not have the UV exposure but cheaper in the long run.    </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t normally write reviews of products like this, but the product description on Amazon is unclear.</li>
            <li>Normally would have not been an issue, but I gave it as a gift to my daughter.</li>
            <li>Worth the investment if you get your nails done regularly.</li>
            <li>but it is not hard to do also.</li>
            <li>with one hand at a time because the gel  does not dry at all .. causing smudges if I attempt to do the step on the 2nd hand without the LED light.      </li>
            <li>PH to remove oil from the nail to begin with, then Base coat, followed by your own polish (I use regular polish, and it works fine), then Top Coat.</li>
            <li>New    </li>
            <li>I am new to the UV gel products.</li>
            <li>The product came opened in the box and they weren&#x27;t new they were taped shut.</li>
            <li>But do think they should be more careful since the package did say FRAGILE!!!</li>
            <li>Then, apply to the nail plate in a THIN LIGHT APPLICATION from cuticle to free edge.  </li>
            <li>Then, apply from cuticle to free edge using a THIN LIGHT APPLICATION.</li>
            <li>The product is fantastic, but when my package arrived the PH bond had leaked and only about 1/4 of it was left.</li>
            <li>It takes a few tries to get the hang of it, but it&#x27;s fairly easy to use and fun!</li>
            <li>It works perfectly so far, looks just like I had them done at a salon!</li>
            <li>I use it all, from the first step pHbond to the last step nourishing oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been changing the color every 3 to 4 weeks because the nails grow out so much and by then I can&#x27;t wait to try another color!</li>
            <li>Some women I apply an extra topcoat, some protein bond, some a layer or two of structure first,</li>
            <li>It seems many of the other sellers only offered mini sized bottles.</li>
            <li>Would like to mention my foundation arrived broken, but I&#x27;m pretty sure this was the carriers</li>
            <li>The next time, I bought some pure acetone nail polish remover and it cleaned the brush like a dream  </li>
            <li>I certainly will return for future business.  </li>
            <li>and I am certain that one bottle just contained regular drug store polish remover.  </li>
            <li>That one had more in the way of instructions, but with Google, instructions are hardly needed.</li>
            <li>Clear Pump Dispenser Bottle  </li>
            <li>I prefer gel to acrylics because they let your natural nail grow out without damaging the nail upon removal.</li>
            <li>I used this and found that the gelish provided a more durable option than CND, They didn&#x27;t peel or chip for at least a week</li>
            <li>so far no problems til now</li>
            <li>so I really can&#x27;t last much longer than 3 weeks without a LOT of regrowth along the cuticle.  </li>
            <li>When 5 fingers complete .. put on a disposable glove. .</li>
            <li>flick off old polish from</li>
            <li>Shape the natural nail using your 240 grit file of choice.      </li>
            <li>I find I must do this nearly every day ..</li>
            <li>Debra Lynn Professional 4 oz.</li>
            <li>Using a gentle swirling motion I cover the entire nail.</li>
            <li>I used this kit once so far with the help of youtube videos</li>
            <li>wipe the old gel off</li>
            <li>I would completely recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>and so far I don&#x27;t have a problem with it damaging or drying out my hands or nails.&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser...</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t old or sticky.</li>
            <li>Everything has worked out perfectly so far.</li>
            <li>It Off is the key to whole process I believe.  </li>
            <li>This was well worth the money although the blue remover is just simply acetone, so you could just buy your own.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>When \\&quot;tipping the ends\\&quot; .. if I am not in a hurry .. the best way is to use an OPI base coat plus the color ..</li>
            <li>It took a little practice, but well worth it!</li>
            <li>the nail remover bottle arrived half full.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much less than going to Sally&#x27;s, AND the nail bottles are full sizes.  </li>
            <li>The product itself worked okay for her, but some serious work needs to be done with the containers.</li>
            <li>Pretty much any other starter kit only has the mini bottles</li>
            <li>Like if the Foundation is not &amp;#34;set&amp;#34;  long enough (it will always be tacky after being under the light no matter how long you leave it)</li>
            <li>Do you realize these are large bottles for the same price as the kit sold at beauty supply stores which have tiny bottles!</li>
            <li>one of my bottles (final/finishing top coat) appears to have been opened prior to shipping, as the brush was hard and stuck together.</li>
            <li>so it really goes a long way!</li>
            <li>Everything was top quality &amp; helps my polish to last at least 10 days.</li>
            <li>my other gave me this for Christmas and the funny thing is between her and my daughter</li>
            <li>I first applied the foundation coat, then dry brushed it, then applied the Structure Gel.</li>
            <li>You should never pay for a salon manicure if you have at least some semblance of fine motor skills.</li>
            <li>The only trouble with the delivery is that the bottles were wrapped in a bubble wrap envelope, and although they seemed well handled, the bottle of nail cleanser leaked, which meant I had to clean everything up when it arrived.</li>
            <li>Actual Salon professional products for a majorly discounted price.</li>
            <li>I used a #6 flat gel brush to apply it very thinly, and it leveled nicely, cured thoroughly in 90 seconds to a high shine.</li>
            <li>It really does last as long as Gelish says it will.  </li>
            <li>*Debra Lynn Professional French Manicure Clean-Up Brush (Misc.)  </li>
            <li>and I gotta say you barely use anything.</li>
            <li>I have had it last nearly a month</li>
            <li>This could save some money and get you started with your gel nails with the bare necessities.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This could save some money and get you started with your gel nails with the bare necessities.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m not careful with it either.  </li>
            <li>I have only used this polish twice, so I might need to update in the future but so far I am quite happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I had purchased this same product for my daughter before Christmas and received smaller bottles and was surprised by the 2-8oz instead of 2-4oz.  </li>
            <li>The remover also evaporated so only half of it was left after a month, despite my being careful to close the container securely.</li>
            <li>Only complaint was the seller did not ship it in the original box.</li>
            <li>Pull it tightly over the nail bed, it will settle to the center of the nail bed, keeping full contact with the nail as it soaks the gel off.  </li>
            <li>thanks to all the other Reviewers who helped me get started on gel nails!    </li>
            <li>I would have spent this much at a beauty supply store locally for the smaller bottles of the same items.</li>
            <li>I did a Gelish manicure on my 4 year old just to see how long it would last</li>
            <li>took about 30 minutes as the professional application was pretty thick...</li>
            <li>(secured in clear ziplock bag and sealed with tape, rather than loose in a postal box)</li>
            <li>(Use a dry brush and pull more product OFF the nail to ensure it&#x27;s thin enough.) .  </li>
            <li>Initially it took a long with all the different steps to remove and apply gel nails, which was pretty frustrating at first.</li>

            <li> What I didn&#x27;t like was my inability to find a really good manicurist, and</li>
            <li> I also loved the fact that once I set the time on the lamp it automatically started when I placed my hand in to cure.</li>
            <li> This is a good starter kit to begin using gel nail polish.  </li>
            <li> I loved my daughters</li>
            <li> and I had lost a fair amount of it.  </li>
            <li> but I imagine it has a good purpose to prepare the nail for the Foundation.  </li>
            <li> Good idea</li>
            <li> I recieved this package in great shape and it even had directions with it that were very easy to understand.  </li>
            <li> but these are full size and awesome.</li>

            <li> It saves me time by allowing me to do my nails when I have the time and the convenience of doing it in my own home.  </li>
            <li> I decided that I wanted to try to do my own gel manicures.</li>
            <li> removed the salon gel application which was OPI Axxium (good product also, just geared more toward pros</li>
            <li> I have been doing my own nails for years ..</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want any kind of oil on the nails.      </li>
            <li> Nail Strengthener,  REALLY HANDY FOR ACETONE &amp; ALCHOHOL-</li>
            <li> so this was really nice.  </li>

            <li> If you&#x27;re going to do your own nails</li>
            <li> I had this product used at a manicure shop and liked the results; however, the baisc kit came without any instructions what so ever.  </li>
            <li> I think it was a good buy for the beginner &amp; am pleased with the package kit.  </li>
            <li> I would advise a beginner to get it one time then make your own decision.</li>
            <li> I found it very easy to use and started doing my own nails.  </li>
            <li> I even use regular color nail polish under the top coat of gel and it works great and looks beautiful!</li>

            <li> I was happy to get everything I needed in one kit and the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> The first time it was great then just ruined my nails and would stay on longer than a week</li>
            <li> Great price, shipment is fast!</li>
            <li> Doing my own gel manicures is so easy and saves me a ton of money.</li>
            <li> A quick Google search of \\&quot;Gelish instructions\\&quot; gave me some good web sites and videos for instruction.</li>

            <li> Same product my salon uses, and works perfect!  </li>

            <li> Shop elsewhere and make sure you get the product through a qualified vendor.</li>
            <li> Love this starter kit . . .</li>
            <li> I get better at it every time I use it.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to make appts or travel across the city to my favorite manicurist.  </li>
            <li> Love the product, and came in on time.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the pricing.</li>
            <li> I use most of the kit, however I use Acetone to remove the nails and not the stuff supplied in the kit.</li>
            <li> I have already used it many times.</li>
            <li> This is such a wonderful kit to start Gel Nails.  </li>
            <li> then i looked at the rest of the products i brought, the nail polish remover was mostly gone</li>
            <li> even more pissed cause</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed using this kit to do gel polish at home.</li>
            <li> I love the Gelish products.  </li>
            <li> I decided to buy my own LED light and start doing them at home.  </li>
            <li> you basically would need most of these to use the gel nail polish.</li>
            <li> Below is what has finally worked for me the best.  </li>
            <li> Apply  NAIL STRENGHTENER RECOVERY-gold bottle for added strength and that takes care of most problems.)</li>
            <li> Apply Gelish Top Coat (GELISH TOP IT OFF GEL SEALER).</li>
            <li> TOP LED Nail Gel Polish Cure Lamp Harmony Shellac UV Dryer Timer Control</li>
            <li> They are taking the top layer of keratin off.</li>
            <li> Polish as desired followed by the Gelish Top</li>
            <li> My nails feel like they have a glass coating on top.  </li>
            <li> It has everything I needed and it is top quality.</li>
            <li> Love this kit.</li>
            <li> After about a week the top of the bottle for the top coat came off.</li>
            <li> That being said I love everything else.</li>
            <li> so it has more than paid for itself.</li>
            <li> Authentic.</li>
            <li> I cant wait to get more</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li> This is why I LOVE Amazon.  </li>
            <li> While I love the Gelish products, I did not like this buying experience.  </li>
            <li> Love it, save a ton of money at the nail shop,</li>
            <li> SINCE STARTED TO USE IT, MY NAILS GROW PU HEALTHY AND</li>
            <li> The Gelish Basix kit is a much better value on-line than in the store.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best makes my nails look wonderful without having to have fake nails on</li>
            <li> better than to buy it all separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although I will probably just use acetone polish remover and regular rubbing alcohol when their counterparts run out, this was the PERFECT starter set!</li>
            <li> depending on how often you use them and how many people you are doing.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> I love being able to do my on gel polish.  </li>
            <li> This is such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I love gelish.</li>
            <li> but I still love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I don&#x27;t have to do that anymore.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Then your doing touch ups more often.</li>
            <li> I love it because I got it on time and the product was in perfect conditions, I totally recommend it</li>
            <li> I love doing my shellac nails at home.</li>
            <li> :) :)</li>
            <li> what more can you say...</li>
            <li> Was an ok kit but could have just skipped the nail cleaner, the top coat take off.</li>
            <li> Love that I found this set at the price I got it for.  </li>
            <li> I love it, even though it seem the company fix this kit</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
            <li> Love this brand,I had the lamp from them too.</li>
            <li> I love this set.</li>
            <li> This is the next best thing.</li>
            <li> I think it is better, I have flimsy nails and this has helped keep them stronger.</li>
            <li> My wife &amp; daughters absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love love love Gelish.</li>
            <li> cheaper than the nail salon :)</li>
            <li> Just love this kit.  </li>
            <li> They all work but the Gelish polish seems to have a better set &amp; it is a stronger, more durable polish bond in the end.  </li>
            <li> The Top</li>
            <li> This will make everything look better and save some you some frustration.&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> Realistically, you could just buy the pH bond, foundation and top it off.</li>

            <li> Love this gel nail polish.  </li>
            <li> the polish didn&#x27;t stick as well and started peeling at the top edge.  </li>

            <li> good price for the large sized bottles.</li>

            <li> For Shellac Gelish Nail Gel Polish Curing NailDryer Light Timer    </li>
            <li> [...]  Gelish recommended cure times are based on using a Gelish Harmony LED Curing Light.  </li>
            <li> They are great products, and similar to Shellac in their wearing, but all of the others come in a pot and are applied with a gel brush.      </li>
            <li> The end result is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic kit of everything you need to start at home gel use.</li>
            <li> This comes with everything you need to do gel nails except the light and the color of gelish polish you want.  </li>
            <li> You need to also buy the color and a UV light to cure, but once you are all set up you will save loads as opposed to going to the salon.  </li>
            <li> what a fantastic value.</li>
            <li> I enjoy going to a salon for a manicure</li>
            <li> This kit plus the purchase of a curing light and 1 additional color will allow you to have gel nails at a fraction of the price of going to the salon.</li>
            <li> Fortunately I had placed it all in a ziplok bag before placing it in my suitcase so there was no damage done.....</li>
            <li> goes on smooth without bubbles.&lt;br /&gt;Top</li>
            <li> It works great, and I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> The Gelish  basic kit works great .</li>
            <li> After a few times you will perfect it.  </li>
            <li> I wish I would&#x27;ve bought a LED light instead of UV.</li>
            <li> Light Nail Dryer]]  </li>
            <li> so you get a smooth finish.  </li>
            <li> You will require an LED or UV curing light.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy that I can buy the same product and do my nails myself.</li>
            <li> I used the Gelish and so far so good.  </li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for and true to description they are full size!</li>
            <li> I was in the hospital at the time, so I wasn&#x27;t able to go through my mail right away.</li>
            <li> I tried the Top It Off on my right hand and it wouldn&#x27;t cure either.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So very worth it.</li>
            <li> i was extremely excited, but then as i touch the nail polish top, it just came right off.</li>
            <li> They work great, easy to use and cost me just a little bit more than a &amp;#34;mini&#x27;s&amp;#34; starter set my friend purchased.</li>
            <li> This full size kit is such a great value compared to the Mini line that&#x27;s being sold at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.  </li>
            <li> It works so good, and I love how long it lasts.  </li>
            <li> These are not the mini sized bottles, they are the full-size bottles, kit was well worth it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is the original consistency</li>
            <li> Received in a timely manner excited to try it out</li>
            <li> I was so excited when it came in the mail that I had to immediately try it out.</li>
            <li> I was really satisfied with this purchase because every bottle did exactly what the instructions said it was suppose to do.</li>
            <li> The items were taped shut with packaging tape and did not have their original seal.</li>
            <li> Clean up as needed.  </li>
            <li> Remove the dust and clean the nail.  .  </li>
            <li> Use an orange stick to fully clean around cuticles with the alcohol.</li>
            <li> this is called a clean up brush.</li>
            <li> If you like Gel Nails this product is super fantastic.</li>
            <li> It is by far my favorite top coat.  </li>
            <li> it will still be SUPER tacky even when you wipe it as directed after being under the light.  </li>
            <li> Gently remove the shine using the 100 grit side of a 100/180 Buffer until very smooth.      </li>
            <li> I do not believe this is the true Gelish product...  </li>
            <li> I went with full size.</li>
            <li> it came with full size</li>
            <li> Nice quality no harsh smells.</li>
            <li> I had tried getting gel manicure at a local salon and loved it.  </li>
            <li> This helps the applied gel to self level in a nicely rounded and natural shape.</li>
            <li> The larger size containers make this kit a good value for the price.</li>
            <li> I just bought these items and so far I liked using them .It</li>
            <li> It has everything you need to get started, all in full size bottles.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would recommend is if your going to buy this kit make sure you have a LED/UV light with 18W or better.</li>
            <li> This set is full size bottles and a must have with your supplies.</li>
            <li> Love the whole thing.</li>
            <li> The Foundation is really cool.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been in salons enough to know the sequence in which to use these products, however I needed to do my own research for UV light times.  </li>
            <li> My nails grow quickly</li>
            <li> I find it better to complete one step .. including the LED light ..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried out a few at home gel manicure kits and this one was the absolute best for the price.</li>
            <li> Definitely use lint free wipes, the gel is kind of sticky and any cotton or lint will stick on and not come off!&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> Free and very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> First, seal the free edge of the nail.</li>

            <li> I was thrilled to get the full size kit, and recently purchased my light and did my first manicure.</li>
            <li> all needed last long too great deal !</li>
            <li> Really works great and polish lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> The seller was good about sending me a 2nd shipment since the first one had leaked, but I couldn&#x27;t believe it leaked again and eventually ruining my table.</li>
            <li> In this kit you will have all your basic needs to complete a beautiful gel polish finish.  </li>
            <li> I already use Gelish products and this kit was perfect to replace several of the items that I was running short on at a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li> Same product, more for your money!  </li>
            <li> When you follow the directions exactly it comes out just like the salon!</li>
            <li> The first time I got the starter kit for slightly less to see how I would like it, then I found the full size kit and was even more in love!</li>
            <li> Have used all of the products several times now and love the easy application and removal process.</li>
            <li> Everything was packaged tight (which can be an issue with nail polish) and received it in great condition.</li>
            <li> Super nice kit with everything you need to get started minus a light</li>
            <li> This requires a little learning, but it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li> It dries so fast with an LED light, just 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> Fantastic products, fast deliver.</li>
            <li> light that fits both hands, which is really handy.&lt;br /&gt;5)</li>
            <li> light that fits both hands, which is really handy.&lt;br /&gt;5)</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li> worth the money everything you need in one purchase.</li>
            <li> Worth the money</li>
            <li> it just seemis ed worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> We having been having so much fun with this kit.  </li>
            <li> useful and convenient to have all six at once.&lt;br /&gt;i</li>
            <li> is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li> The more advanced my skills are getting, the longer my polish is lasting.  </li>
            <li> Thin layers are best.</li>
            <li> If you plan on doing a lot of manicures it might be worth it.</li>
            <li> Have fun with your Gelish kit.</li>
            <li> Have fun with your Gelish kit.</li>
            <li> The cuticle oil is a nice touch but not necessary.</li>
            <li> Allowed me to get familiar with these products without investing too much money.</li>
            <li> Loved the product!!I got the full size bottles for the same price that I would have gotten the complete mini basix kit at Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> The item is just right what I wanted.</li>
            <li> it peels right away</li>
            <li> If you use it right you should have it for a food amount of time</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this product and did not nails right after Thanksgiving.</li>
            <li> I put too much the first time &amp; it took longer under the light.</li>
            <li> Love that I can get full size product at same price as &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; kits!</li>
            <li> It will even up your French manicure very easily.</li>
            <li> However, the other bottles are great and it really helped me to purchase this as a first time user.</li>
            <li> Start to Finish Regular Clear Polish on top of the Gelish Top it</li>
            <li> Sometimes I even just coat my nails with the bottom and top clear gels and then use a regular colored polish on top then</li>
            <li> i am not a professional just wanted to have my own kit for when i have no time to make it into the salon</li>
            <li> It has a great shine and seals everything in and is probably the key of the polish lasting so long.&lt;br /&gt;Nail</li>
            <li> but anyways this is by far a scam to get 43$ easy cause first when i opened it</li>
            <li> If you are just starting out this is an awesome buy you get full size products that last a long time....</li>
            <li> Also I received it very fast.</li>
            <li> this has everything you are going to need and it is pretty self explanatory with each bottles labels.</li>
            <li> if you  have payed attention during your gel polish manicure at a salon you will know exactly what to do</li>
            <li> it peels off the first time she bathes</li>
            <li> Definately worth the cost and will stock up again very soon.</li>
            <li> it is first time i use Gel nail.</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> I bought this the first time I started doing gel manicures at home myself.</li>
            <li> I think) and applied this Harmony product using a  UV light I also purchased on Amazon (USpicy® MACARON USND-3603 36W Professional UV</li>
            <li> i suggest u try it from some1 else but read reviews first it might help.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve been known to add a final top coat of OPI</li>
            <li> For the whole kit and price, it was worth it.</li>
            <li> it will last better.  </li>
            <li> Apply Gelish NAIL STRENGHENER STRENGTH-green bottle ..  (instead of GELISH FOUNDATION GEL) - first seal the edges of the nail.</li>
            <li> then add a regular top coat to make it all shiny.  </li>
            <li> These are exactly what was needed and  </li>
            <li> First let me say that I would have given this 5 stars had the Acetone not leaked all over.  </li>
            <li> technician uses CDN Shellac on my nails and its always peeling off, lasting maybe 3 days at the most.  </li>
            <li> Its only been a day, but I can tell this is more durable.  </li>
            <li> Some of the items are a necessity and others you can do without or purchase a larger size at a better price.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Otherwise, the nail system works great for long lasting mani&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I love not having to pay extra for gel colors.</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery too!</li>
            <li> , they go on well, look great, last a long time (you can get 2-3 weeks out of a correctly applied manicure), and</li>
            <li> It seems that maybe the top of the bottle wasn&#x27;t on properly.  </li>
            <li> This was my first experience with gel polish.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Its price is better than buying individually.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed...only caveat....</li>
            <li> Exactly what&#x27;s advertised</li>
            <li> This was a great deal and will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> The excess on your nails gets in the space between your nail and skin and ends up making a funny ridge</li>
            <li> B001RMP7M6 Thermal Spa 49135 Professional U/V Gel Light Nail Dryer]]  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t the first manicure I did on myself and</li>
            <li> Clearly that person didn&#x27;t understand that this type of polish requires a light to cure and the cleaning solution at the end.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted...</li>
            <li> Paid for itself the first two times i used it.</li>
            <li> Still great to have full size products for a little extra.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised that these are actually Full Size Bottles like the ne you see in your nail salon.  </li>
            <li> This gel stuff is very drying on the nails and you must moisturize constantly for healthy nails.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s a huge influx of similar uv gel polish products right now.</li>
            <li> Loved it got it sooner than expected!!!!</li>
            <li> This is pretty much your prefect starter kit...</li>
            <li> They the ph Balance evidently gets the nail ready for application.  </li>
            <li> For just a little more, FULL SIZE (.05 oz vs .03).</li>
            <li> Peels off easy even when following all steps correctly.</li>
            <li> Key is to be patient... soak nails, scrape off what comes off easily, then soak again, and repeat.  </li>
            <li> I find my pedicure will last easily 4 weeks ..</li>
            <li> and I can see them lasting for a good long while.</li>
            <li> Even if you use pure acetone it will NOT remove.  </li>
            <li> I have been able to make my nails last up to nearly 4 weeks!  </li>
            <li> My product was in a re-used box with labels taped over, I&#x27;m not sure the bottle labels are authentic and liquid bottles did not have their original seal</li>
            <li> ordered this after I noticed that my CND shellac was peeling off much sooner than it should have.</li>
            <li> Picture is from a whole week after doing my nails.</li>
            <li> but I really don&#x27;t care for the way it was packaged</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> works very well.</li>
            <li> so I appreciated finding the whole kit in one place.</li>
            <li> This is a reasonably priced kit for gelish polishes.</li>
            <li> apply vitamin E oil to your nails and fingers after this process because the acetone is very drying.  </li>
            <li> I use a narrow orange stick and an old cleaned polish bottle filled with acetone to remove any gel touching  a cuticle or skin.  </li>
            <li> Various helpful supplies I got from Amazon.com:  magnifying glasses, lint free cloth, brush for Structure Gel,  </li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s not that much of money for the amount of products you&#x27;re getting</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for the item.</li>
            <li> or so I can then just gently scrape/</li>
            <li> I also bought the Harmony18G LED light that was my BIG investment</li>
            <li> So I cannot really review my order.</li>
            <li> (Except for the LED or UV light and actual color polish.)</li>
            <li> this is whole kit is a must.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and very well packaged</li>
            <li> Very satisfated with the kit.</li>
            <li> You really cannot beat this price.</li>
            <li> but the whole process does take time, so it depends on how much I have.  </li>
            <li> I can highly recommend these products and this seller!</li>
            <li> Thanks for the kit, it makes it much easier to order.</li>
            <li> cover that with a regular clear top coat polish....</li>
            <li> This is a good kit but it seems like some of the prep polishes are thick.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this, as it is easy to apply and definitely adds strength to the nail.  </li>
            <li> this works very, very well and my nails look very natural.  </li>
            <li> gel hardened as it should, nice glossy finish as promised, rock hard after final round under the UV light, &#x27;sticky&#x27; finish came off easily with lint free rounds.  </li>
            <li> It &#x27;s easy and the products go a long way.</li>
            <li> It has the remover, nail cleaner (needed before your first coat and after your last), your base coat, top coat, ph bond (to help the basecoat adhere better), and nail oil (to keep your cuticles in good shape).  </li>
            <li> Since only about 1/4 of one bottle leaked and I had been so excited to try the gel polish, I decided not to return the item, but just go ahead and use it.</li>
            <li> Wipe the nail with NAIL PREP (or70/91% alcohol) using a lint free wipe (can even use small cuts of lint free paper towel).  </li>
            <li> I received in less than 7 days, and they are real full sizes.</li>
            <li> I only go to the salon when I want a special treat.  </li>
            <li> These bottles are all full size bottles; such a deal.  </li>
            <li> First remove old gel polish.</li>
            <li> overall can&#x27;t beat the price because they are all full size bottles.</li>
            <li> Full size bottle are a bang for your buck because the mini set cost the same.</li>
            <li> This kit saves you money by doing your gel manicure at home and with the full size bottles it will last awhile.</li>
            <li> I particularly like that they are FULL SIZE bottles...not the mini ones that you can purchase (for around the same price) in beauty stores.  </li>
            <li> and I have more than half a bottle.</li>
            <li> Half of the top coat polish spilt over everything else in the box.</li>
            <li> When I run out, I will only buy the things that are essential--The Blue Nail Cleaner, which someone said is just rubbing alcohol, the Foundation, the polish, &amp; the Top</li>
            <li> The Gelish line is super high quality and if you do it correctly your manicure will last for weeks.  </li>
            <li> I do not always use it due to how much time I have on hand &amp; it does fine without</li>
            <li> Top coat wont close and it leaks and make mess</li>
            <li> This set is the real deal, it even arrived early for me!</li>
            <li> That would probably be the only down side, but overall great product.</li>
            <li> Would recommend highly recommend.    </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this brand as it stays a little longer than a lot of the cheaper brands.  </li>
            <li> That is why you make sure it goes under the nail a little too</li>
            <li> If you choose you can  emove some of the tacky surface residue with clean dry brush.  </li>
            <li> After all the supplies I&#x27;ve bought, including polish and a UV light, I&#x27;ve probably spent $120.</li>
            <li> After all the supplies I&#x27;ve bought, including polish and a UV light, I&#x27;ve probably spent $120.</li>
            <li> I use a q-tip and really scrub near the cuticle with the cleaning solution, and that seems to do the trick.  </li>
            <li> Everything is full size and lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> just a few more layers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so not only is it better to not have the UV exposure but cheaper in the long run.    </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t normally write reviews of products like this, but the product description on Amazon is unclear.</li>
            <li> Normally would have not been an issue, but I gave it as a gift to my daughter.</li>
            <li> Worth the investment if you get your nails done regularly.</li>
            <li> but it is not hard to do also.</li>
            <li> with one hand at a time because the gel  does not dry at all .. causing smudges if I attempt to do the step on the 2nd hand without the LED light.      </li>
            <li> PH to remove oil from the nail to begin with, then Base coat, followed by your own polish (I use regular polish, and it works fine), then Top Coat.</li>
            <li> New    </li>
            <li> I am new to the UV gel products.</li>
            <li> The product came opened in the box and they weren&#x27;t new they were taped shut.</li>
            <li> But do think they should be more careful since the package did say FRAGILE!!!</li>
            <li> Then, apply to the nail plate in a THIN LIGHT APPLICATION from cuticle to free edge.  </li>
            <li> Then, apply from cuticle to free edge using a THIN LIGHT APPLICATION.</li>
            <li> The product is fantastic, but when my package arrived the PH bond had leaked and only about 1/4 of it was left.</li>
            <li> It takes a few tries to get the hang of it, but it&#x27;s fairly easy to use and fun!</li>
            <li> It works perfectly so far, looks just like I had them done at a salon!</li>
            <li> I use it all, from the first step pHbond to the last step nourishing oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been changing the color every 3 to 4 weeks because the nails grow out so much and by then I can&#x27;t wait to try another color!</li>
            <li> Some women I apply an extra topcoat, some protein bond, some a layer or two of structure first,</li>
            <li> It seems many of the other sellers only offered mini sized bottles.</li>
            <li> Would like to mention my foundation arrived broken, but I&#x27;m pretty sure this was the carriers</li>
            <li> The next time, I bought some pure acetone nail polish remover and it cleaned the brush like a dream  </li>
            <li> I certainly will return for future business.  </li>
            <li> and I am certain that one bottle just contained regular drug store polish remover.  </li>
            <li> That one had more in the way of instructions, but with Google, instructions are hardly needed.</li>
            <li> Clear Pump Dispenser Bottle  </li>
            <li> I prefer gel to acrylics because they let your natural nail grow out without damaging the nail upon removal.</li>
            <li> I used this and found that the gelish provided a more durable option than CND, They didn&#x27;t peel or chip for at least a week</li>
            <li> so far no problems til now</li>
            <li> so I really can&#x27;t last much longer than 3 weeks without a LOT of regrowth along the cuticle.  </li>
            <li> When 5 fingers complete .. put on a disposable glove. .</li>
            <li> flick off old polish from</li>
            <li> Shape the natural nail using your 240 grit file of choice.      </li>
            <li> I find I must do this nearly every day ..</li>
            <li> Debra Lynn Professional 4 oz.</li>
            <li> Using a gentle swirling motion I cover the entire nail.</li>
            <li> I used this kit once so far with the help of youtube videos</li>
            <li> wipe the old gel off</li>
            <li> I would completely recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> and so far I don&#x27;t have a problem with it damaging or drying out my hands or nails.&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser...</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t old or sticky.</li>
            <li> Everything has worked out perfectly so far.</li>
            <li> It Off is the key to whole process I believe.  </li>
            <li> This was well worth the money although the blue remover is just simply acetone, so you could just buy your own.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> When \\&quot;tipping the ends\\&quot; .. if I am not in a hurry .. the best way is to use an OPI base coat plus the color ..</li>
            <li> It took a little practice, but well worth it!</li>
            <li> the nail remover bottle arrived half full.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much less than going to Sally&#x27;s, AND the nail bottles are full sizes.  </li>
            <li> The product itself worked okay for her, but some serious work needs to be done with the containers.</li>
            <li> Pretty much any other starter kit only has the mini bottles</li>
            <li> Like if the Foundation is not &amp;#34;set&amp;#34;  long enough (it will always be tacky after being under the light no matter how long you leave it)</li>
            <li> Do you realize these are large bottles for the same price as the kit sold at beauty supply stores which have tiny bottles!</li>
            <li> one of my bottles (final/finishing top coat) appears to have been opened prior to shipping, as the brush was hard and stuck together.</li>
            <li> so it really goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Everything was top quality &amp; helps my polish to last at least 10 days.</li>
            <li> my other gave me this for Christmas and the funny thing is between her and my daughter</li>
            <li> I first applied the foundation coat, then dry brushed it, then applied the Structure Gel.</li>
            <li> You should never pay for a salon manicure if you have at least some semblance of fine motor skills.</li>
            <li> The only trouble with the delivery is that the bottles were wrapped in a bubble wrap envelope, and although they seemed well handled, the bottle of nail cleanser leaked, which meant I had to clean everything up when it arrived.</li>
            <li> Actual Salon professional products for a majorly discounted price.</li>
            <li> I used a #6 flat gel brush to apply it very thinly, and it leveled nicely, cured thoroughly in 90 seconds to a high shine.</li>
            <li> It really does last as long as Gelish says it will.  </li>

            <li> and I gotta say you barely use anything.</li>
            <li> I have had it last nearly a month</li>
            <li> This could save some money and get you started with your gel nails with the bare necessities.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This could save some money and get you started with your gel nails with the bare necessities.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m not careful with it either.  </li>
            <li> I have only used this polish twice, so I might need to update in the future but so far I am quite happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I had purchased this same product for my daughter before Christmas and received smaller bottles and was surprised by the 2-8oz instead of 2-4oz.  </li>
            <li> The remover also evaporated so only half of it was left after a month, despite my being careful to close the container securely.</li>
            <li> Only complaint was the seller did not ship it in the original box.</li>
            <li> Pull it tightly over the nail bed, it will settle to the center of the nail bed, keeping full contact with the nail as it soaks the gel off.  </li>
            <li> thanks to all the other Reviewers who helped me get started on gel nails!    </li>
            <li> I would have spent this much at a beauty supply store locally for the smaller bottles of the same items.</li>
            <li> I did a Gelish manicure on my 4 year old just to see how long it would last</li>
            <li> took about 30 minutes as the professional application was pretty thick...</li>
            <li> (secured in clear ziplock bag and sealed with tape, rather than loose in a postal box)</li>
            <li> (Use a dry brush and pull more product OFF the nail to ensure it&#x27;s thin enough.) .  </li>
            <li> Initially it took a long with all the different steps to remove and apply gel nails, which was pretty frustrating at first.</li>
            <li> I think I saw someone else complain that the polish never dried on this product or one of the other Gelish polishes I was looking at on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I use it on the natural nail plate up to my false nail tip on the first and second application.</li>
            <li> I am a baker and this is the only  polish I have had last through a single work shift.</li>
            <li> The bottles last a long time.</li>
            <li> adore this kit because it has everything you would need to get a long lasting shellac manicure.</li>
            <li> I started out with the mini set, but they did not last long, i needed something that had value and content.</li>
            <li> I dry brushed that layer</li>
            <li> Peeling: If you have tried thinner layers, and upping your cure time (try 1 min extra for UV, 30 sec extra  for LED) isn&#x27;t working, consider blaming your foundation coat formula</li>
            <li> To make matters worse, the product appears to have eaten thru my nail bed to the point that wholes developing to the quick.  </li>
            <li> The other thing to be mindful of is to be careful when applying near the cuticles.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my current polish on for 2 weeks without a single chip or loss of shine!  </li>
            <li> The base and top coat last much longer than any other I have tried; kiss, Sally Hansen ...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hard on my nails and they holds up really well.  </li>
            <li> I was having to redo the CND Shellac at least twice a week and didn&#x27;t want that much</li>
            <li> I had gotten used to doing my own manis at home, but would get frustrated with the look after about a week.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this happened partly because I&#x27;ve never purchased gel polish before, but I didn&#x27;t realize until I received the order that this product is for artificial nails.</li>
            <li> Everything came earlier than I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this set for a long time</li>
            <li> has everything you will need, minus an actual color.</li>
            <li> when I heard how long gel nails lasted ..</li>
            <li> I then carefully add the #350 around the upper nail bed ..</li>
            <li> It lasts quite a long time, unless you redo your nails every day or something.</li>
            <li> I received the set with a third of the gel remover empty-</li>
            <li> pink bottled no closed item come out thank you arawan you can put tap a round the bottled to lock bottled no open for shipping</li>
            <li> I have now had the chance to try several other brands and Gelish</li>
            <li> this is a DRY cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I paint the base and two clear coats on my natura nails to give them more strength and shine.  </li>
            <li> This also hides the little ridges that you get when you get a little older.  </li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had a single one break or tear while I&#x27;ve had this polish on.  </li>
            <li> This brush made even this amateur try look professional.</li>
            <li> Has last average of 2 weeks since I began using it</li>
            <li> No bristles were loose nor have any fallen out.</li>
            <li> Start with the short end of Hands Down ..  </li>
            <li> so I am constantly scrubbing down rooms.  </li>
            <li> IMPOSSIBLE after the LED light!    </li>
            <li> I tried to forge ahead with the foundation and top coat, but the instructions on the bottles were impossible to read forcing me to go online to figure out what to do.</li>
            <li> the pad can be cut in half for double usage!)   </li>
            <li> (I keep mine next to my bed and put it on at night when I set my alarm) as this helps keep the product flexible and less prone to cracking.     </li>
            <li> Soak Off Gel Nail Wraps, Debra Lynn Black 240/320 Grit Nail File ,  Professional 100/100 grit Nail files zebra file emery board,  Harmony Gelish Vitagel - Strength- green bottle  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend the extra money to buy LED, but if I factor in the price of bulbs over the next few years, an LED would&#x27;ve probably paid off, plus the curing time is less.</li>
            <li> One of the solutions leaked a little but no big deal.</li>
            <li> Then starting with the little finger and work to the thumb.  </li>
            <li> After 20 minutes, remove the glove and pull off the pads, one at a time .. starting with little finger-1st hand, flipping the polish off each nail with an orange stick as you go.</li>
            <li> For some reason it only lasts a little over a week on me</li>
            <li> If not it will take so long to dry with anything less then 18W.</li>
            <li> Then as the gel gets to be 2-3 to 4 weeks old my nail beds have grown out at least 1/4\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> AND I even add a thin layer of clear acrylic powder to the second layer of bottom gel coat.</li>
            <li> then i tried seeing if any polish was left  nothing just dried.</li>
            <li> Rough up nails</li>
            <li> I do this as I go as it is easier to do while wet ..</li>
            <li> just do this as I put on my make up .. being careful of the finger tips as I apply my make up.  </li>
            <li> I got 2 empty bottles that I paid for.</li>
            <li> Everything worked as expected, just like the nail salon.</li>
            <li> I looked carefully at the bottles and have used the products and it appears to be the legitimate Gelish products (if not I&#x27;ve been fooled).  </li>
            <li> This was delivered as advertised and as expected.</li>
            <li> Came when expected</li>
            <li> There are a couple of things to be careful of when applying.  </li>
            <li> I just received my order and the soak off bottle was 3/4 empty and all over the box.</li>
            <li> than that, everything came as expected, but I won&#x27;t waste the money on the cleanser, remover or cuticle oil in the future.</li>
            <li> If you get it on the skin &amp; don&#x27;t wipe it off, you can pick it off later &amp; it is a thick layer that actually keeps it from chipping.  </li>
            <li> I like that Gelish has the lasting power, but isn&#x27;t as harsh as some other brands to remove.</li>
            <li> All the product is pretty thick, so try hard to get the excess off the brush before applying.</li>
            <li> I can use it with all of my other brands of gel polish, not just gelish.  </li>
            <li> Just what I expected and wanted!</li>
            <li> Usually discount bottles are only .3 ounces instead of .5 ounces.</li>
            <li> im extremely surprize why this person got a four star</li>
            <li> With the gloves on, can do other tasks.  </li>
            <li> [...]  TIPS I PICKED UP FROM OTHER REVIEWERS:  </li>
            <li> When applying, I use a small flat brush and place a dot of gel into the center of my nail.</li>
            <li> The only thing missing is a color!</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have stated the acetone and alcohol can be purchased for cheaper.</li>
            <li> Stop paying for other people to do your gel nails.</li>
            <li> Of course she took mine and left me with the small ones.  </li>
            <li> One is nail polish remover and the other is rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> Because of this, there was leakage on other items.</li>
            <li> I have used both Gelish &amp; other nail polishes.</li>
            <li> with the pad slightly off center.  </li>
            <li> (This xtra step is only necessary for poor nails</li>
            <li> Half the bottle was spilled, the packing although no longer wet, smelled of acetone as did the rest of the bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was probably half empty.</li>
            <li> I got the product wet and half of one of the bottles had leaked out.  </li>
            <li> On the third application I cover the entire nail including the false tip.</li>
            <li> The only thing is it is REALLY hard to get off.  </li>
            <li> I accidentally ordered two of these kits, and it&#x27;s certainly not worth it to return it, so I still have it.</li>
            <li> is a mess you need to do your nails every other day ,</li>
            <li> My only complaint was that, on arriving home and unpacking the bottles from their bubble wrap pouch, I discovered that one of the items had been leaking</li>
            <li> The bottle of \\&quot;artificial nail remover\\&quot; is the same (or similar) to acetone remover, the bottle of \\&quot;Nail surface cleanse\\&quot; can be substituted with 70% alcohol wipes and the \\&quot;Nourish\\&quot; cuticle oil can be substituted with regular nail oil (I don&#x27;t use it anyway).</li>
            <li> The bottle of \\&quot;artificial nail remover\\&quot; is the same (or similar) to acetone remover, the bottle of \\&quot;Nail surface cleanse\\&quot; can be substituted with 70% alcohol wipes and the \\&quot;Nourish\\&quot; cuticle oil can be substituted with regular nail oil (I don&#x27;t use it anyway).</li>
            <li> if I don&#x27;t put the base coat under my nails as well as on top, it doesn&#x27;t stay as well - a tip for all.</li>
            <li> All installation steps followed to the letter and thoroughly completed--there seems to be no remedy to the situation beyond finding a better base coat.  </li>
            <li> Soak pad of Hands Down with acetone.  </li>
            <li> Graham Hands Down</li>
            <li> Graham Hands Down</li>
            <li> Use the mostly dry brush to spread the small amount of product on your nail.</li>
            <li> It came in a small box with all the bottles loose inside.</li>
            <li> half of the product spilled before arriving</li>
            <li> and it stayed put with NO chipping for a week and half before she started chewing it off.  </li>
            <li> (This xtra step is only necessary for poor nails!)  </li>
            <li> Use cuticle oil nightly  as this helps keep the product flexible and less prone to cracking.    </li>
            <li> (less harmful to cuticles and surrounding skin than UV lamps)  </li>
            <li> I give this 3 stars just because it&#x27;s a starter kit with what you needm but contains things you can get at the store for less money.</li>
            <li> I bought this starter set here on amazon and it was half the price of Sallys.</li>
            <li> It was a mess.</li>
            <li> I do all kinds of gardening work and house remodeling projects, so there are plenty of chances to mess it up.  </li>
            <li> Use is sparingly or it is hard to dry or set under the lamp.</li>
            <li> The motto for GEL is \\&quot;thin to win\\&quot; - several very thin layers, no thick ones!    </li>
            <li> I soak half a round with it and wrap it around my nail then cover with foil and 10 minutes</li>
            <li> five stars is because when I received it the nail cleaner was spilled a little in the package box.</li>
            <li> If some sticks on the tips, a little pressure with an orange stick coated with acetone ought to make it release.  </li>
            <li> it does make the nail a little weaker because of the soaking and scrapping.</li>
            <li> The motto for GEL is \\&quot;thin to win\\&quot; - several very thin layers, no thick ones.    </li>
            <li> to save you a little time, here&#x27;s a few things I learned.&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> I compared a store brand acetone to Gelish artificial polish remover and found that Gelish works fast and gets the job done with ease.  </li>
            <li> ,it will save you the time and frustration im having tring to return this shit or get what was gone when i opened it.</li>
            <li> Also, the cuticle oil was not really needed, at least for me.</li>
            <li> All that is missing is a color polish, so you can pick up</li>
            <li> Regular polish would be chipped or worse within an hour of work.  </li>
            <li> (one said to lightly wipe nail with 70% alcohol or the cleanser after the base, another site didn&#x27;t add that step), so I just went with what the official Gelish video showed and it turned out</li>
            <li> This set doesn&#x27;t come with instructions, but I went onto You tube and watched a few videos on how to apply the products.</li>
            <li> I do not believe these are true, Gelish items and for that reason only, I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Products were packaged well and no leaks like other reviews complained about.</li>
            <li> I was a little frustrated because different sites had slightly different instructions</li>
            <li> Purpose: Used to strengthen weak nails OR to equalize the level differences between the natural nail plate and applied false nail tips.</li>
            <li> No more nail salons for me.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that usually if I polish her nails</li>
            <li> small toenails</li>
            <li> I am currently waiting to hear back from the seller about an issue with a missing base coat</li>
            <li> I had given up on nail polish because with my work it was pointless.  </li>
            <li> not sure what it is</li>
            <li> This is the only one I&#x27;ve  found that does not bubble on cause those annoying tiny bumps.</li>
            <li> 4 days after completion of total application of all the layers, foundation releases and base coat, color and top coat fall off due to poor quality adherence of base coat to the nail.</li>
            <li> In short, the Gelish kit was an expensive failure for me.</li>
            <li> and I was quite hard on my hands.</li>
            <li> these work well, follow directions and it was not to hard to do.</li>
            <li> i can at least do my polish at home.</li>
            <li> My gelish manicures have lasted at least 3 weeks or longer each time.</li>
            <li> Gel polish by Gelish lasts for at least two weeks.  </li>
            <li> I am sorry that I ever spent the money.</li>
            <li> If there is one complaint, there were no instructions</li>
            <li> If you apply too thick a coat, your results will suffer.  </li>
            <li> If you apply too thick a coat, your results will suffer.</li>
            <li> If you apply too thick a coat, your results will suffer.  </li>
            <li> When you apply the polish, since it&#x27;s a thick gel, it settles out any brush strokes before it cures</li>
            <li> Not satisfied with the quality of this brand because of this poor performance.  </li>
            <li> If you have normal nails just using Foundation Gel  as your base.  </li>
            <li> i tried Shellac and that one is not good</li>
            <li> If needed apply 2 thin layers of the Gelish strengthener.  </li>
            <li> Apply 1-3 thin coats depending upon nail strength desired; curing between each application.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit because I was tired of paying 50$ to get it done at the salon.</li>
            <li> One bottle came broken, contacted seller, and they replaced it.  </li>
            <li> Now I am completely addicted.  </li>
            <li> I bought this so I could repair my broken nails in between visits to the salon.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if I&#x27;ll buy the Artificial Nail Remover again though.</li>
            <li> I have very weak nails</li>
            <li> If you try to stay a little ways away from the base of the nail it won&#x27;t be a problem.  </li>
            <li> Separately these items are expensive.</li>
            <li> this shit is worthless</li>
            <li> Sorry neighbors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> (SORRY IN ADVANCE THAT MY \\&quot;WORD\\&quot; DOCUMENT CONVERTS</li>
            <li> This ensures a thin layer OR WILL PEEL!  </li>
            <li> In the beginning it is merely \\&quot;tipping\\&quot; the nails ..</li>
            <li> Expensive when ordered through prime.</li>
            <li> Whomever packed this, failed to tighten the bottle to ensure it didn&#x27;t leak.  </li>
            <li> You can not go wrong with that.</li>
            <li> Finally, as you&#x27;re working on your nails, just ignore how awful the cuticles look.  </li>
            <li> Use very thin coats of the product.</li>
            <li> dot a small amount of base coat on each nail with the brush.</li>
            <li> have thin nails and a bad habit of biting them...</li>
            <li> i never had to return or was unhappy at somthing i brought from amazon til now.</li>
            <li> but what&#x27;s the point of sending artificial nail remover and cleanser if they get spilled while shipping?</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want to deal with artificial nail upkeep.</li>
            <li> Everything you need to give yourself that expensive salon mani at home!</li>
            <li> (or skip if you used alcohol if you choose) APPLY SPARINGLY - i.e. very thin coat!  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical buying this set worrying that it was a knock-off or bottles</li>
            <li> I never have to be disappointed with a crappy, expensive gel manicure again!</li>
            <li> SO BADLY TO AMAZON</li>
            <li> Too bad the Acetone wasn&#x27;t sealed well.</li>
            <li> update on user results for the products contained here--specifically the foundation or base coat--3-</li>

            <li> great starter kit. will buy again</li>
            <li> So happy with this purchase. Everything is full size and lasts a really long time. Pretty much any other starter kit only has the mini bottles but these are full size and awesome.</li>
            <li> Products were full and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> You should never pay for a salon manicure if you have at least some semblance of fine motor skills. I prefer gel to acrylics because they let your natural nail grow out without damaging the nail upon removal. This is a great product, just make sure you own a &amp;#34;smile brush&amp;#34; for french manicures and a top-quality UV light.</li>
            <li> I have only used this polish twice, so I might need to update in the future but so far I am quite happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this after I noticed that my CND shellac was peeling off much sooner than it should have. I was having to redo the CND Shellac at least twice a week and didn&#x27;t want that much upkeep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thin nails and a bad habit of biting them...so that is why I always try to keep gel on. I used this and found that the gelish provided a more durable option than CND, They didn&#x27;t peel or chip for at least a week and I was quite hard on my hands. I especially liked the nourish oil, after all the chemicals it is a nice soothing feeling to end the manicure.</li>
            <li> Wish it had directions. Did not come in a starter box like at the store. But it did perform same as going to nail salon.</li>
            <li> Same product my salon uses, and works perfect!  I paint the base and two clear coats on my natura nails to give them more strength and shine.  Picture is from a whole week after doing my nails.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for someone that asked for it specifically but I really don&#x27;t care for the way it was packaged so I made up my own packaging to make it look more professional to fit the price I paid for it. I know nothing about this type product so I can&#x27;t comment on that part. My repackaged product picture. (secured in clear ziplock bag and sealed with tape, rather than loose in a postal box) The polish bottles where sealed in bubble wrap just not the larger bottles; now they are all secured together.</li>
            <li> these work well, follow directions and it was not to hard to do.</li>
            <li> I really love this starter kit.  I can use it with all of my other brands of gel polish, not just gelish.  I love the quality and it has lasted me a while.  I even use this to do my moms nails and I have more than half a bottle.</li>
            <li> Awesome set, perfect for starting to do your own gel nails.</li>
            <li> this is the perfect starter kit for anyone wanting to do gel polish at home! i am not a professional just wanted to have my own kit for when i have no time to make it into the salon i can at least do my polish at home. this has everything you are going to need and it is pretty self explanatory with each bottles labels. if you  have payed attention during your gel polish manicure at a salon you will know exactly what to do</li>
            <li> nice size, perfect for what I wanted. They worked well with my machine and polish. Great price I will buy again</li>
            <li> The gelish system is the BEST!  My very first attempt at doing my own nails was a huge success.  I am hooked!  I have achieved salon quality results.  This is so easy to do yourself.  You will achieve such a beautiful glossy shine to your nails.  This is a beauty miracle!</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li> Everything came earlier than I expected. Love!!</li>
            <li> neat set! all needed last long too great deal !</li>
            <li> I love my gelish set it&#x27;s a great size and last for a while</li>
            <li> I love this kit!!  I&#x27;ve been doing at home manicures for months now and this is my staple!!  Really works great and polish lasts a long time.  Definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I love this system!  It doesn&#x27;t chip or wear out.  It took a little practice, but well worth it!</li>
            <li> if I don&#x27;t put the base coat under my nails as well as on top, it doesn&#x27;t stay as well - a tip for all.</li>
            <li> I love this kit. Has all the essentials, for a great price. Everything was top quality &amp; helps my polish to last at least 10 days. I&#x27;ve had this set for a long time &amp; I still do not need to replace everything.</li>
            <li> For just a little more, FULL SIZE (.05 oz vs .03). I think they make up this &#x27;kit&#x27; themselves: Great value. Would buy from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> Very good!  Just what I expected and wanted!</li>
            <li> Love it great thanks.</li>
            <li> I compared a store brand acetone to Gelish artificial polish remover and found that Gelish works fast and gets the job done with ease.  I will only purchase Gelish nail polish remover from here on.</li>
            <li> I do not believe this is the true Gelish product...  I have used this product several times and it WILL NOT soak off.  Even if you use pure acetone it will NOT remove.  So, I finally shared my concerns with my nail technologist after mutilating my nails technologist.  She also tried to soak the product off as well and could not.  She said that she has only seen this happen with a product from China and did not feel it was truly Gelish.  To make matters worse, the product appears to have eaten thru my nail bed to the point that wholes developing to the quick.  Shop elsewhere and make sure you get the product through a qualified vendor.</li>
            <li> Works just like the professionals!</li>
            <li> Love this starter kit . . . everything you will need to do your own gel nails at home and was pretty affordable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing my own nails with this kit and love it.  It saves me time by allowing me to do my nails when I have the time and the convenience of doing it in my own home.  I get better at it every time I use it.  I would recommend this kit.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! This is a very good deal for full size bottles, especially since the mini kits are $50+ at Sally&#x27;s. It works perfectly so far, looks just like I had them done at a salon! When I received my package it was packed well with no leakage!</li>
            <li> Actual Salon professional products for a majorly discounted price. Fast delivery. The base and top coat last much longer than any other I have tried; kiss, Sally Hansen ... This is the only one I&#x27;ve  found that does not bubble on cause those annoying tiny bumps.</li>
            <li> pink bottled no closed item come out thank you arawan you can put tap a round the bottled to lock bottled no open for shipping</li>
            <li> Great value!  Now that I do my nails at home, I save myself $80+/month...and I don&#x27;t have to make appts or travel across the city to my favorite manicurist.  I have no doubt about the quality of this product.  If you want to speed up the process, I recommend buying two LED drying lights.</li>
            <li> Perfect kit for starters i love my gel polishes its one of the best products i have ever purchased and I&#x27;m going to continue purchasing.  Thank you for your service i recommend this seller to all.</li>
            <li> Perfect set to have when you are a beginner doing your owe gel nails. The only reason why I did not give this product five stars is because when I received it the nail cleaner was spilled a little in the package box.</li>
            <li> one of my bottles (final/finishing top coat) appears to have been opened prior to shipping, as the brush was hard and stuck together. couldn&#x27;t even use it because the brush was ruined...</li>
            <li> This is one of the best investments I have ever made. No more nail salons for me. Im saving myself time and money</li>
            <li> Love the product, and came in on time.</li>
            <li> same price as at the beauty store but these are FULL SIZE!  arrived promptly (during the holidays) .  i&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> This would get a 5 star except for the price--very high--typical for this industry.  Soak off remover is acetone but priced as if it were fine champagne  update on user results for the products contained here--specifically the foundation or base coat--3-4 days after completion of total application of all the layers, foundation releases and base coat, color and top coat fall off due to poor quality adherence of base coat to the nail. Not satisfied with the quality of this brand because of this poor performance.  All installation steps followed to the letter and thoroughly completed--there seems to be no remedy to the situation beyond finding a better base coat.  The search begins outside the Gellish line of products.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product for my daughter to go along with her new gel manicure set.  Good quality product and very happy I went with full size.</li>
            <li> Great starter set,wish that it came with more specific direction.like it came with full size bottles.this line recommended by my sister</li>
            <li> Love everything in the kit! I use it all, from the first step pHbond to the last step nourishing oil. Gotta keep my hands lookin fly! Thank you!</li>
            <li> the remover and cleanse bottles are trial size. the nail remover bottle arrived half full. half of the product spilled before arriving</li>
            <li> These are not the mini sized bottles, they are the full-size bottles, kit was well worth it! Very pleased with the quality and the shipping!</li>
            <li> This full size kit is such a great value compared to the Mini line that&#x27;s being sold at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.  The Gelish line is super high quality and if you do it correctly your manicure will last for weeks.  I did a Gelish manicure on my 4 year old just to see how long it would last and it stayed put with NO chipping for a week and half before she started chewing it off.  Keep in mind that usually if I polish her nails it peels off the first time she bathes so it&#x27;s really impressive that the gel lasted as long as it did.</li>
            <li> Great Products and Great Price too!</li>
            <li> Peels off easy even when following all steps correctly. The first time it was great then just ruined my nails and would stay on longer than a week</li>
            <li> Excellent value. Allowed me to get familiar with these products without investing too much money. Have used all of the products several times now and love the easy application and removal process. Definately worth the cost and will stock up again very soon. The smaller sizes are also great for traveling.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the harmony gelish line! This basix kit is awesome! Great price, shipment is fast!</li>
            <li> worth the money everything you need in one purchase.Nice full size bottles. they will last awhile. Yes Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> birthday girl, my daughter, just loved this. She has been doing everyone&#x27;s nails that comes over to visit. works very well.Thanx</li>
            <li> One bottle of this set leaked two different times in shipment. Not only that, but when my sons brought the mail in, they put the packages on my table. The 2nd shipment was sitting on my kitchen table and had leaked causing it to damage my table. I was in the hospital at the time, so I wasn&#x27;t able to go through my mail right away. I couldn&#x27;t believe when I picked up the box that it was stuck to my table and ruined it. The seller was good about sending me a 2nd shipment since the first one had leaked, but I couldn&#x27;t believe it leaked again and eventually ruining my table. Frustrated, but the product itself does a good job. After all, it took off the finish of my wood table.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the pricing. Separately these items are expensive. Usually discount bottles are only .3 ounces instead of .5 ounces.</li>
            <li> works well... nails sometimes lift!</li>
            <li> Great price and product to start you off on gelish nails for the UV curing light. They work great on hands and toes.</li>
            <li> i like the harmony product. it is first time i use Gel nail. but it is not hard to do also. love the kit! thanks!</li>
            <li> I use most of the kit, however I use Acetone to remove the nails and not the stuff supplied in the kit.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, there are directions online</li>
            <li> One of the solutions leaked a little but no big deal. I have already used it many times. Same as what is in salons.</li>
            <li> The product is working fine, this is my first attempt at do it yourself no chip - and my skills aren&#x27;t that great, but the product is performing fine</li>
            <li> Great starter kit for the home gel mani/pedi.  I don&#x27;t have time to shop for everything I need so I appreciated finding the whole kit in one place.</li>
            <li> In this kit you will have all your basic needs to complete a beautiful gel polish finish.  Nice quality no harsh smells. Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I love being able to clean house immediately after painting my nails.  It dries so fast with an LED light, just 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> These bottles are all full size bottles; such a deal.  I would have spent this much at a beauty supply store locally for the smaller bottles of the same items.</li>
            <li> I decided that I wanted to try to do my own gel manicures. This is pretty much your prefect starter kit... has everything you will need, minus an actual color. That would probably be the only down side, but overall great product.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit to save time and money by doing my nails myself.  I love it!  It takes a few tries to get the hang of it, but it&#x27;s fairly easy to use and fun!</li>
            <li> This is such a wonderful kit to start Gel Nails.  It has everything that you need at a great price.</li>
            <li> This is a well made sturdy attractive piece. The sound is excellent and it is easy to operate .  Worth the money</li>
            <li> Great starter pack. I bought this the first time I started doing gel manicures at home myself. Perfect size bottles and the remover works great.</li>
            <li> Having fallen in love with gel manis, but not the price, this was a wonderful starter kit.  I had gotten used to doing my own manis at home, but would get frustrated with the look after about a week.  That&#x27;s when I went on and got a gel mani and fell in love!  What I didn&#x27;t like was my inability to find a really good manicurist, and the price.  So, I got this kit and I love it!  I like that Gelish has the lasting power, but isn&#x27;t as harsh as some other brands to remove.</li>
            <li> I am not a manicurist, just a chick with a love of nice looking nails.  I had tried getting gel manicure at a local salon and loved it.  After reading and researching online and amongst friends I found that Harmony Gelish is what is used to teach students at a local Beauty school so I went ahead and ordered this kit.  I went with this one vs the mini based on the cost for the larger bottles... it just seemis ed worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I removed the salon gel application which was OPI Axxium (good product also, just geared more toward pros I think) and applied this Harmony product using a  UV light I also purchased on Amazon (USpicy® MACARON USND-3603 36W Professional UV Gel Nail Dryer / Lamp).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long Story short?.... gel hardened as it should, nice glossy finish as promised, rock hard after final round under the UV light, &#x27;sticky&#x27; finish came off easily with lint free rounds.  Application was no different that putting on regular polish, just a few more layers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding removal?  took about 30 minutes as the professional application was pretty thick... there are super videos on Youtube on how to remove gel polish and I haven&#x27;t found one yet that isn&#x27;t basically accurate.  Key is to be patient... soak nails, scrape off what comes off easily, then soak again, and repeat.  When you take your nails out of the acetone the gel will begin to harden so keep nails you aren&#x27;t currently working on soaking.</li>
            <li> This is a reasonably priced kit for gelish polishes. It arrived on time, and I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I am just starting to do my own gel manis, and this was the perfect starter kit! Everything you need to give yourself that expensive salon mani at home!</li>
            <li> This is a great kit but there were no instructions.  I&#x27;ve been in salons enough to know the sequence in which to use these products, however I needed to do my own research for UV light times.  Overall, I would buy again but recommend the supplier to include instructions.</li>
            <li> This is a great package! Everything you need to get started with Shellac. I ran out of the polish remover much more quickly than anything else, but it was definitely a great investment!</li>
            <li> Wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t be any better!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> i saw the 4 star thats why i brought it in the fisrt place because ive been using gelish products for awhile at the nail salon plus i brought gelish products from amazon before and so far no problems til now but anyways this is by far a scam to get 43$ easy cause first when i opened it i was extremely excited, but then as i touch the nail polish top, it just came right off. it was a set up to make it seem as if i broke it or something then i tried seeing if any polish was left  nothing just dried. then i looked at the rest of the products i brought, the nail polish remover was mostly gone i just tried using to see how it works to see if that would some how brighten my day, and im even more pissed cause this shit is worthless dont buy this,it will save you the time and frustration im having tring to return this shit or get what was gone when i opened it. i never had to return or was unhappy at somthing i brought from amazon til now. im extremely surprize why this person got a four star it deserve no stars and the only reason why i gave this a 1 star because i had to put a star to submit it in. trust my word if you want this product i suggest u try it from some1 else but read reviews first it might help.</li>
            <li> Do you realize these are large bottles for the same price as the kit sold at beauty supply stores which have tiny bottles!</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed using this kit to do gel polish at home. I watched youtube videos from gelish and others to figure it out and can now do my nails on my schedule. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love the Gelish products.  I got my first manicure with gelish a few months ago and got hooked!  I decided to buy my own LED light and start doing them at home.  My gelish manicures have lasted at least 3 weeks or longer each time. Great products! Hasn&#x27;t chipped at all any time I&#x27;ve had it on.  My nails get stronger and longer with this product. I&#x27;ve only been changing the color every 3 to 4 weeks because the nails grow out so much and by then I can&#x27;t wait to try another color! (I&#x27;ve been known to add a final top coat of OPI Start to Finish Regular Clear Polish on top of the Gelish Top it Off top coat for even more intense shine!)</li>
            <li> Loved the product!!I got the full size bottles for the same price that I would have gotten the complete mini basix kit at Sally&#x27;s. I was very excited to try it. Would like to mention my foundation arrived broken, but I&#x27;m pretty sure this was the carriers fault I didn&#x27;t bother to send it back since I have a Sally&#x27;s store nearby and figured it would be cheaper to just buy another one. But do think they should be more careful since the package did say FRAGILE!!! in big red words. Other than that it would have been a perfect purchase.</li>
            <li> For the whole kit and price, it was worth it. you basically would need most of these to use the gel nail polish.</li>
            <li> The cleanser in my package wasn&#x27;t screwed all the way on, and it leaked through the cardboard and smelled up my apartment mail area like rubbing alcohol... Sorry neighbors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, everything came as expected, but I won&#x27;t waste the money on the cleanser, remover or cuticle oil in the future.</li>
            <li> WAITED TO WRITE THIS REVIEW UNTIL AFTER READING MANY REVIEWERS, WEBSITES AND MONTHS OF TRIAL AND ERROR!    I waited to write this review until I had tried MANY of the tips from MANY of the wonderful reviewers on Amazon.com!  Below is what has finally worked for me the best.  I have been doing my own nails for years .. when I heard how long gel nails lasted .. I was hooked!  I find my pedicure will last easily 4 weeks .. my manicure very nicely 2 weeks .. then I must start to \\&quot;tip\\&quot; the ends with a matching regular nail polish.  When \\&quot;tipping the ends\\&quot; .. if I am not in a hurry .. the best way is to use an OPI base coat plus the color .. it will last better.  My nails grow quickly so I really can&#x27;t last much longer than 3 weeks without a LOT of regrowth along the cuticle.  Hope the below is helpful .. thanks to all the other Reviewers who helped me get started on gel nails!    AUGUST 2013  (SORRY IN ADVANCE THAT MY \\&quot;WORD\\&quot; DOCUMENT CONVERTS SO BADLY TO AMAZON VIA THE SENTENCE STRUCTURES!)     The motto for GEL is \\&quot;thin to win\\&quot; - several very thin layers, no thick ones!    Manicure &amp; Pedicure Gelish Application    AUGUST 2013  The motto for GEL is \\&quot;thin to win\\&quot; - several very thin layers, no thick ones.    1. First remove old gel polish. Rough up nails well so acetone can get through. Then starting with the little finger and work to the thumb.  Soak pad of Hands Down with acetone.  Start with the short end of Hands Down ..  with the pad slightly off center.  Pull it tightly over the nail bed, it will settle to the center of the nail bed, keeping full contact with the nail as it soaks the gel off.  When 5 fingers complete .. put on a disposable glove. . This helps keep the pads moist longer.  Do the second hand.  Put a glove on the second hand and set the timer for 20 minutes after completing 2nd hand. With the gloves on, can do other tasks.  After 20 minutes, remove the glove and pull off the pads, one at a time .. starting with little finger-1st hand, flipping the polish off each nail with an orange stick as you go. If some sticks on the tips, a little pressure with an orange stick coated with acetone ought to make it release.  Pads can reused a couple of times before throwing away .. flick off old polish from pad/flatten/let dry/store separated in paper sheets they came in.  (Using: Graham Hands Down Soak Off Gel Nail Wraps-works GREAT! -for small toenails the pad can be cut in half for double usage!)   2.  Apply cuticle remover .. push back the cuticle.      3.  Remove cuticle from nail plate.  Clean up as needed.  4.  Shape the natural nail using your 240 grit file of choice.      5.  Gently remove the shine using the 100 grit side of a 100/180 Buffer until very smooth.      6.  Remove the dust and clean the nail.  .  (IF POSSIBLE:  apply vitamin E oil to your nails and fingers after this process because the acetone is very drying.  Leave on overnight if possible. Then:  wash with soap and water and polish using the proper steps.   7.  Wipe the nail with NAIL PREP (or70/91% alcohol) using a lint free wipe (can even use small cuts of lint free paper towel).  Use an orange stick to fully clean around cuticles with the alcohol. You don&#x27;t want any kind of oil on the nails.      8. Apply  PH Bond to the nail plate. (or skip if you used alcohol if you choose) APPLY SPARINGLY - i.e. very thin coat!  (Use a dry brush and pull more product OFF the nail to ensure it&#x27;s thin enough.) .  9. SKIP TO #12 IF nails are not peeling/brittle/weak/damaged.  If you have normal nails just using Foundation Gel  as your base.  **Apply Gelish NAIL STRENGHENER STRENGTH-green bottle ..  (instead of GELISH FOUNDATION GEL) - first seal the edges of the nail. If needed apply 2 thin layers of the Gelish strengthener.  Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds.  10.  Apply  NAIL STRENGHTENER RECOVERY-gold bottle for added strength and that takes care of most problems.) Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds.  (This xtra step is only necessary for poor nails!)  If you apply too thick a coat, your results will suffer.  Place hand in the LED Light for 10 seconds.  10b NEXT  .. \\&quot;STRUCTURE GEL.  NOTE:  dot a small amount of base coat on each nail with the brush. Then, wipe the rest of the gel off of the brush. Use the mostly dry brush to spread the small amount of product on your nail. I even wipe the brush off between each nail. This ensures a thin layer OR WILL PEEL!  Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds. (This xtra step is only necessary for poor nails but Structure Gel is a wonderful strong product!.)  11. If you choose you can  emove some of the tacky surface residue with clean dry brush.  DO NOT USE CLEANSER... this is a DRY cleaning.  12.  Apply Gelish Color Coat of Choice. First, seal the free edge of the nail. Then, apply to the nail plate in a THIN LIGHT APPLICATION from cuticle to free edge.  If you apply too thick a coat, your results will suffer. APPLICATION SHOULD BE ALMOST SEE-THROUGH ON 1st COAT!  Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds (30 seconds for light colors).  (As with ALL UV products, cure thumbs very carefully OR separately for best results.  13.  Repeat Step 11, 12 &amp; 13 for 2nd color coat.    14.  Apply Gelish Top Coat (GELISH TOP IT OFF GEL SEALER). First seal the free edge. Then, apply from cuticle to free edge using a THIN LIGHT APPLICATION. If you apply too thick a coat, your results will suffer.  Place hand in LED Light for 20 seconds.  (As with ALL UV products, cure thumbs very carefully OR separately for best results.      15.  Wipe off the tacky surface residue with NAIL PREP (or alcohol) using a lint free wipe.      16.  Use cuticle oil nightly  as this helps keep the product flexible and less prone to cracking.    TIPS:  a.  I find it better to complete one step .. including the LED light .. with one hand at a time because the gel  does not dry at all .. causing smudges if I attempt to do the step on the 2nd hand without the LED light.      b.  I use a narrow orange stick and an old cleaned polish bottle filled with acetone to remove any gel touching  a cuticle or skin.  I do this as I go as it is easier to do while wet .. IMPOSSIBLE after the LED light!    c.  Peeling: If you have tried thinner layers, and upping your cure time (try 1 min extra for UV, 30 sec extra  for LED) isn&#x27;t working, consider blaming your foundation coat formula, this was the culprit in my second  Gelish kit.    d.  By searching and finally finding a regular nail polish (Sally Hansen \\&quot;#350 Heart to Heart\\&quot; Diamond Strength No Chip Nail Color) close to my gel polish (gelish \\&quot;Tiger Blossum-Item #01334) I have been able to make my nails last up to nearly 4 weeks!  Not looking great toward the end but tolerable!  In the beginning it is merely \\&quot;tipping\\&quot; the nails .. ie using the #350 to color the tip of the nails after they wear off.  I find I must do this nearly every day .. just do this as I put on my make up .. being careful of the finger tips as I apply my make up.  Then as the gel gets to be 2-3 to 4 weeks old my nail beds have grown out at least 1/4\\&quot;.  I then carefully add the #350 around the upper nail bed .. then add a regular top coat to make it all shiny.  I get another week out of it .. YEAH!    e.

NOT $115.99!!  12W TOP LED Nail Gel Polish Cure Lamp Harmony Shellac UV Dryer Timer Control New    **I also loved the fact that once I set the time on the lamp it automatically started when I placed my hand in to cure. I was always using my Iphone as a timer backup for the UV lamp so this was really nice.  I found that the replacement bulbs for the UV lamp were almost $30, and the LED lamp is supposed to last 35,000 hours - so not only is it better to not have the UV exposure but cheaper in the long run.    TECH TIPS: [...]  Gelish recommended cure times are based on using a Gelish Harmony LED Curing Light.  For best performance follow recommended cure times.    **I think the soaking the Gel polish off in Acetone every time they come in weakens the nail bed as well. I make my client only wear it ever third time they get a manicure. I don&#x27;t care what they say...it does make the nail a little weaker because of the soaking and scrapping. [...]     **clients who like to peel the product off, I believe this may be why subsequent applications are not working. They are taking the top layer of keratin off. I always caution my clients not do to this and if they do, they cannot expect the product to perform the way it&#x27;s designed to do.     **Do buy a bottle of cuticle oil and use it over your Shellac every day (I keep mine next to my bed and put it on at night when I set my alarm) as this helps keep the product flexible and less prone to cracking.     **there&#x27;s a huge influx of similar uv gel polish products right now. Gelish, Geleration, Axxium, Gelicure... lots of them. They are great products, and similar to Shellac in their wearing, but all of the others come in a pot and are applied with a gel brush.      **Some women I apply an extra topcoat, some protein bond, some a layer or two of structure first, some, all of the above.  **  [...]  TIPS I PICKED UP FROM OTHER REVIEWERS:  *****GELISH STRUCTURE GEL  **I used a #6 flat gel brush to apply it very thinly, and it leveled nicely, cured thoroughly in 90 seconds to a high shine. I highly recommend this, as it is easy to apply and definitely adds strength to the nail.  .. Purpose: Used to strengthen weak nails OR to equalize the level differences between the natural nail plate and applied false nail tips. Use this product after the Gelish Foundation (BASE) step has been completed  Directions: Apply 1-3 thin coats depending upon nail strength desired; curing between each application. When applying, I use a small flat brush and place a dot of gel into the center of my nail. Using a gentle swirling motion I cover the entire nail. You want to minimize the times you lift the brush from the product so as not to incorporate air bubbles. Once the nail is covered with the sculpting gel, turn your hand over keeping it level for 1 minute. This helps the applied gel to self level in a nicely rounded and natural shape. Cure as directed between each application. See requirements for the cure time needed  Requirements: Gelish structure must be cured with an LED lamp or UV lamp system. LED cure time 30 seconds. 36W UV Lamp - 2 minutes  Note: For me this is a must have product. I use it on the natural nail plate up to my false nail tip on the first and second application. This helps to equal out the level differences between the two. On the third application I cover the entire nail including the false tip. Polish as desired followed by the Gelish Top If Off as the final step .  **.  **Apply with a nail art brush.  **I first applied the foundation coat, then dry brushed it, then applied the Structure Gel. I dry brushed that layer as well andfinished applying layers as directed. The end result is fantastic.  **The next time, I bought some pure acetone nail polish remover and it cleaned the brush like a dream  **Debra Lynn Professional French Manicure Clean-Up Brush (Misc.)  **Notice this is called a clean up brush. That is what it does. It will even up your French manicure very easily. Don&#x27;t know how anyone can do a French manicure without one. I wanted to try the French tip look with the CND Shellac process I do at home and purchased this brush for that specific purpose. This brush made even this amateur try look professional. This brush is well made and an easy weight in the hand. No bristles were loose nor have any fallen out. Would recommend highly recommend.    BEAUTY~NAILS~GEL-JULY 2012  **VIDEO: [...]</li>
            <li> This is a good kit but it seems like some of the prep polishes are thick. I don&#x27;t know if this is the original consistency but it makes it tricky to do my nails. Expensive when ordered through prime.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t wait to start using! Thank You!!</li>
            <li> One star doesn&#x27;t have to do anything with Gelish products. The packaging is HORRIBLE. I know it&#x27;s not that much of money for the amount of products you&#x27;re getting but what&#x27;s the point of sending artificial nail remover and cleanser if they get spilled while shipping? I got 2 empty bottles that I paid for. Just horrible. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product combo is the best deal on the Internet. I certainly will return for future business.  The gelish brand works great for my nails. Simple process to apply.</li>
            <li> Received in a timely manner excited to try it out</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for the item. It is very nice and it came very well packed. I will recommend you. The item is just right what I wanted.</li>
            <li> LOVE THE PRODUCTS!! wouldnt use anything else.</li>
            <li> Great products.. These are exactly what was needed and  good price for the large sized bottles. Would buy from again!!</li>
            <li> They work great, easy to use and cost me just a little bit more than a &amp;#34;mini&#x27;s&amp;#34; starter set my friend purchased. That one had more in the way of instructions, but with Google, instructions are hardly needed. A great buy.</li>
            <li> First let me say that I would have given this 5 stars had the Acetone not leaked all over.  Whomever packed this, failed to tighten the bottle to ensure it didn&#x27;t leak.  Half the bottle was spilled, the packing although no longer wet, smelled of acetone as did the rest of the bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My technician uses CDN Shellac on my nails and its always peeling off, lasting maybe 3 days at the most.  I used the Gelish and so far so good.  Its only been a day, but I can tell this is more durable.  My nails feel like they have a glass coating on top.  I&#x27;m thrilled with the product.</li>
            <li> This kit was perfect for my startup. It has everything I needed and it is top quality. I will want anyone to get this.</li>
            <li> This was well worth the money although the blue remover is just simply acetone, so you could just buy your own.&lt;br /&gt;But overall can&#x27;t beat the price because they are all full size bottles.</li>
            <li> This is a good starter kit to begin using gel nail polish.  Some of the items are a necessity and others you can do without or purchase a larger size at a better price.  I&#x27;m happy I bought this so I could figure out what I needed.</li>
            <li> I love this kit! I was so excited when it came in the mail that I had to immediately try it out. The bottles are a great size and I can see them lasting for a good long while. The only thing I&#x27;ll be needing to buy is the remover seeing as how I like to change up my nail color often. I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is a great starter kit for gelish gel polish manicures, I use all of these products and have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I never have to be disappointed with a crappy, expensive gel manicure again!</li>
            <li> Same product, more for your money!  I have purchased a smaller set through a retailer and it was twice this amount!  THis is a great deal!</li>
            <li> Love this kit. The polishes go in great!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend.  The remover arrived leaking acetone all over the inside of the package.  It was probably half empty. After about a week the top of the bottle for the top coat came off. The product itself worked okay for her, but some serious work needs to be done with the containers.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and went with this gel manicure kit and couldn&#x27;t be more happy with it!  After using this kit step by step, my nails look like I went to the salon!</li>
            <li> I accidentally ordered two of these kits, and it&#x27;s certainly not worth it to return it, so I still have it.</li>
            <li> Super nice kit with everything you need to get started minus a light</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this happened partly because I&#x27;ve never purchased gel polish before, but I didn&#x27;t realize until I received the order that this product is for artificial nails. I tried to forge ahead with the foundation and top coat, but the instructions on the bottles were impossible to read forcing me to go online to figure out what to do. I tried the foundation on my left hand but it wouldn&#x27;t cure in the LED dryer. I tried the Top It Off on my right hand and it wouldn&#x27;t cure either.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t normally write reviews of products like this, but the product description on Amazon is unclear. There are no instructions shipped with the product, and the information for Gelish products on the web wasn&#x27;t helpful. I don&#x27;t understand why neither product would cure in the LED dryer. In short, the Gelish kit was an expensive failure for me.</li>
            <li> The product is fantastic, but when my package arrived the PH bond had leaked and only about 1/4 of it was left.</li>
            <li> Fantastic kit of everything you need to start at home gel use. The only thing missing is a color! I used this with opi gel colors and it worked fantastically.</li>
            <li> The larger size containers make this kit a good value for the price. However, the plastic bottles the remover and cleanse come in fell apart the second time I used them: the tops of the bottles broke away with the lids, just as if someone had sliced the plastic below the lids. The remover also evaporated so only half of it was left after a month, despite my being careful to close the container securely. These should be packaged in glass bottles.</li>
            <li> I would buy this kit again.  The seller is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> I just used these products last week. This is a good buy because it comes with the pH bond, bottom coat, and top coat which are your essentials to use the gelish polish. The cuticle oil I could do without as well as the remover and cleansing solution. Cuticlie oil I have never used because that&#x27;s what olive oil or your lotion is for. The remover is just acetone. I can buy that for like $4 for a huge bottle. The cleansing solution is just rubbin alcohol and that is used to get the sticky residue off your nails. I give this 3 stars just because it&#x27;s a starter kit with what you needm but contains things you can get at the store for less money.</li>
            <li> Only complaint was the seller did not ship it in the original box. Normally would have not been an issue, but I gave it as a gift to my daughter. She loved the set and uses it all the time! Great product!!!</li>
            <li> Save a ton of money doing this at home and it works just as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving this 4 stars because it&#x27;s a bit overpriced. The cleanser and remover are simply acetone and alcohol. That being said I love everything else. It&#x27;s works well for me.</li>
            <li> If you are looking to have a great polish nails this is the way to go , this product last more than 2 weeks and is great i tried Shellac and that one is not good it peels right away is a mess you need to do your nails every other day ,</li>
            <li> Love it! And for a great price! Only thing is that the bottles holding the nail cleaner and remover tend to build up pressure and leak when opened! I recommend buying different bottles or containers to use, or keep them in multiple plastic bags, which is what I do!</li>
            <li> Great atarted kit with quality products. Will give u a salon look at home!</li>
            <li> Great set! No leaking during shopping. Love that I can get full size product at same price as &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; kits!</li>
            <li> Use very thin coats of the product. The bottles last a long time.</li>
            <li> I used this kit once so far with the help of youtube videos and I gotta say you barely use anything. If you use it right you should have it for a food amount of time</li>
            <li> This comes with everything you need to do gel nails except the light and the color of gelish polish you want.  My gel nails last about two weeks and this saves me a lot of money.  The salons charge 30 plus for a set so it has more than paid for itself.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit because I was tired of paying 50$ to get it done at the salon. This product has it all, just buy cotton swab&#x27;s and a nail file. It&#x27;s been over a year and I&#x27;ve gone through the two removers. Still have plenty of the polish left. Good first timer kit.</li>
            <li> I bought this starter set here on amazon and it was half the price of Sallys. This is a great product!  You need to also buy the color and a UV light to cure, but once you are all set up you will save loads as opposed to going to the salon.  I have my hands in water all day and I do my nails about once a month or every two months.  One time I got away with 3!  The only thing is it is REALLY hard to get off.  You have to soak your nails in acetone, or peel it off, which is easier but destroys your nail.  If you follow the directions and wrap your nails in a cotton pad soaked in acetone and cover with tin foil it is easy to scrape off after about 15 min.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Authentic.</li>
            <li> It seems many of the other sellers only offered mini sized bottles. This one offered full size ones, which is nice. As other reviewers have stated the acetone and alcohol can be purchased for cheaper. However, the other bottles are great and it really helped me to purchase this as a first time user. Everything worked as expected, just like the nail salon. Also, the cuticle oil was not really needed, at least for me.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Its thicker than most non salon brands its great and its gives salon results. I cant wait to get more</li>
            <li> LOVE the full size bottles!</li>
            <li> Great product for a great place.</li>
            <li> The product itself works great but the problem was with packaging!!!  I got the product wet and half of one of the bottles had leaked out.  Great product but don&#x27;t know about ordering it from this company.</li>
            <li> just received my kit today. i received an 8 oz cleaner and 8 oz remover instead of the 4 oz bottles that are listed. i guess i cant complain. ;) the foundation and top it off along with the ph bond works great. the cuticle oil is a plus. over all very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The Gelish kit is great, it has everything you need (except gel color polish) to do your gel manicure. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because one of the bottles leaked in the package (the &amp;#34;nail surface cleanse&amp;#34; alcohol) shorting me some product. Otherwise, the nail system works great for long lasting mani&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It is nice to have everything I need for my Gelish nails. I am not sure if I&#x27;ll buy the Artificial Nail Remover again though. 100% Acetone seems to work just as well for soaking off the polish. And I have yet to remember to use Nourish after doing my nails. My bad! I think that bottle will last me awhile</li>
            <li> Excellent starter kit! has everything you need to start off doing your own gel nails. im very happy with it</li>
            <li> This is a great set! I was happy to get everything I needed in one kit and the price was very reasonable. The gel adheres to my nails and doesn&#x27;t lift, last 2+ week&#x27;s. The soak off works GREAT! I soak half a round with it and wrap it around my nail then cover with foil and 10 minutes or so I can then just gently scrape/wipe the old gel off AND I even add a thin layer of clear acrylic powder to the second layer of bottom gel coat. The soak off even gets through that!! I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I even use regular color nail polish under the top coat of gel and it works great and looks beautiful! Sometimes I even just coat my nails with the bottom and top clear gels and then use a regular colored polish on top then cover that with a regular clear top coat polish....that way I can change colors by simply using regular nail polish remover to wipe off color without damaging gel or having to remove all the gel just to change color. I&#x27;ve even successfully used large glitter polishes under the top gel coat and the my gel light does not damage it. I love not having to pay extra for gel colors. One last note....the cuticle oil dnelks wondeful, kind of lemony.</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase. I am new to the UV gel products. So far I am happy with my results.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised that these are actually Full Size Bottles like the ne you see in your nail salon.  Very good product.</li>
            <li> Polish remover needs to be bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> I love the full size bottles. I have used this product for about a month now and just love it! This gel last for about 2 weeks. Full size bottle are a bang for your buck because the mini set cost the same. The only issue I had with the shipper was that I had to wait two week becasue they were out!</li>
            <li> My daughter had a gel nail set and took it to college with her.  I decided I had to have on for myself but wanted to try the Gelish brand.  I LOVE IT.  I loved my daughters she used a different brand, but now that I have used Gelish, I won&#x27;t use anything else.  It works so good, and I love how long it lasts.  I got the starter kit here because it was cheaper on Amazon than anywhere else I found it.  This is why I LOVE Amazon.  If you like Gel Nails this product is super fantastic.</li>
            <li> Very nice product.  Easy to use.  I&#x27;m hard on my nails and they holds up really well.  Soaks off easily without damage to my nails.</li>
            <li> I just bought these items and so far I liked using them .It seems my nails are growing faster and its  easy to do the Gel nails yourself. Will buy again</li>
            <li> These are fabulous products, they work incredibly well. They come with detailed instructions that me, being a novice, had no difficulty being successful with. I will be using gelish products in the future.</li>
            <li> While I love the Gelish products, I did not like this buying experience.  My product was in a re-used box with labels taped over, I&#x27;m not sure the bottle labels are authentic and liquid bottles did not have their original seal and I am certain that one bottle just contained regular drug store polish remover.  I do not believe these are true, Gelish items and for that reason only, I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy this product again as soon as I run out. I received in less than 7 days, and they are real full sizes. I&#x27;m happy with my products.</li>
            <li> One of the best things I&#x27;ve ever bought!  Doing my own gel manicures is so easy and saves me a ton of money. It paid for itself with just two uses.  I would definitely buy this kit again. It has everything you need to get started, all in full size bottles.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit back in April and have been using it ever since.  It &#x27;s easy and the products go a long way. Here it is Oct. and now I will need to restock some of the products.  You can not go wrong with that.</li>
            <li> Great starter kit for a newbie, easy to understand and use right away. Initially it took a long with all the different steps to remove and apply gel nails, which was pretty frustrating at first. Now I&#x27;m almost an expert in the removal and application technique. Practice makes perfect!!</li>
            <li> Excellent size of all boltles. Still you need to buy the UV lamp, nail gel brush, and if you want any nail decoration.</li>
            <li> Love it, save a ton of money at the nail shop,</li>
            <li> Stop paying for other people to do your gel nails. You save a lot doing it yourself and this product is very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Top coat wont close and it leaks and make mess</li>
            <li> O.M.G. what a fantastic value. Bought the mini set at my local beauty supply store and paid the same amount for that set as I did for this set. This set has all full size bottles, this is a much better deal.</li>
            <li> We having been having so much fun with this kit.  Great buy!  One bottle came broken, contacted seller, and they replaced it.  Very happy!</li>
            <li> great product!!! This complete kit gets you started with everything you need for your gelish mani, and at a great price too! Seller was reliable, nice, inexpensive and shipped very quickly! Everything was packaged tight (which can be an issue with nail polish) and received it in great condition.</li>
            <li> SINCE STARTED TO USE IT, MY NAILS GROW PU HEALTHY AND QUICKLY, EXCELLENT PACKAGE, SIMPLY LOVE IT. I RECOMMENDED 100%</li>
            <li> The Gelish Basix kit is a much better value on-line than in the store. I recommend it.  You will pay yourself back in three nail applications than going to a solon.</li>
            <li> Loved it got it sooner than expected!!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best makes my nails look wonderful without having to have fake nails on</li>
            <li> useful and convenient to have all six at once.&lt;br /&gt;i use all of them except for the oil. which i should more.&lt;br /&gt;if you&#x27;re a starter, then just buy this set. better than to buy it all separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good price, too.</li>
            <li> I am currently waiting to hear back from the seller about an issue with a missing base coat and I will update this after it has been taken care of, that is why it currently has 4 instead of 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I adore this kit because it has everything you would need to get a long lasting shellac manicure. Helps shellac polish last for forever! Free and very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this Gelish set. It comes with EVERYTHING! This set is the real deal, it even arrived early for me!</li>
            <li> Bought this kit when I first decided to do my own gel nails.  Although I will probably just use acetone polish remover and regular rubbing alcohol when their counterparts run out, this was the PERFECT starter set!</li>
            <li> This was a gift and just what the person wanted.</li>
            <li> The kit is very nice and it is great getting the Gelish products together.  I&#x27;ve only used the products once and they worked well.  Fast delivery too!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical buying this set worrying that it was a knock-off or bottles were re-filled with a cheaper product.  I looked carefully at the bottles and have used the products and it appears to be the legitimate Gelish products (if not I&#x27;ve been fooled).  Products were packaged well and no leaks like other reviews complained about.</li>
            <li> If you are just starting out this is an awesome buy you get full size products that last a long time....depending on how often you use them and how many people you are doing. I bought these for myself and still have plenty of all product. I love the Gelish product it is easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this so I could do my own nails and save money. I also bought the Harmony18G LED light that was my BIG investment but I&#x27;m glad I did. Thank you Gelish for a great product!</li>
            <li> I love this I now can do my nails at home and not have to pay the salon price. I would completely recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great polish starter kit!</li>
            <li> This collection is everything you need to get started with your gel manicure.  It has the remover, nail cleaner (needed before your first coat and after your last), your base coat, top coat, ph bond (to help the basecoat adhere better), and nail oil (to keep your cuticles in good shape).  All that is missing is a color polish, so you can pick up whatever color you like.  I have really liked the Gelish products, they go on well, look great, last a long time (you can get 2-3 weeks out of a correctly applied manicure), and best of all, it comes off reasonably easy (which is the part that worried me).</li>
            <li> This kit saves you money by doing your gel manicure at home and with the full size bottles it will last awhile. I enjoy going to a salon for a manicure but you don&#x27;t always get a quality manicure for the money you spend.</li>
            <li> I love being able to do my on gel polish.  This kit plus the purchase of a curing light and 1 additional color will allow you to have gel nails at a fraction of the price of going to the salon.</li>
            <li> Great deal.  Works perfectly.</li>
            <li> This is such a wonderful product. I&#x27;m so glad I got the full size bottles instead of ordering the mini&#x27;s. I love gelish. For some reason it only lasts a little over a week on me but I still love it. I was having to redo regular nail polish daily. I&#x27;m so glad I don&#x27;t have to do that anymore. Especially with having a baby. Gelish is so easy to apply, I just love it. Also I received it very fast. I was extremely happy with that!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Still need a bit of practice keeping it off my skin. If you get it on the skin around your nail it starts to peel sooner than it should. Then your doing touch ups more often.</li>
            <li> I was really satisfied with this purchase because every bottle did exactly what the instructions said it was suppose to do. The only thing I would recommend is if your going to buy this kit make sure you have a LED/UV light with 18W or better. If not it will take so long to dry with anything less then 18W.</li>
            <li> my other gave me this for Christmas and the funny thing is between her and my daughter i do they&#x27;re nails more than i do my own but still a great product</li>
            <li> I just got this in the mail and I think what I paid for it was an awesome deal for what all came. Everything came undamaged and all there. I would definitely recommend it for just starting out!</li>
            <li> I love it because I got it on time and the product was in perfect conditions, I totally recommend it</li>
            <li> This was a great package to get me started on my gel nail journey.  After going to gel nails, I can&#x27;t see ever going back to the nail salon again!</li>
            <li> Was travelling from overseas and had item delivered to hotel so I was very happy that it arrived promptly and was waiting for me when I checked in.  I already use Gelish products and this kit was perfect to replace several of the items that I was running short on at a very reasonable price.  I particularly like that they are FULL SIZE bottles...not the mini ones that you can purchase (for around the same price) in beauty stores.  My only complaint was that, on arriving home and unpacking the bottles from their bubble wrap pouch, I discovered that one of the items had been leaking and I had lost a fair amount of it.  It seems that maybe the top of the bottle wasn&#x27;t on properly.  Fortunately I had placed it all in a ziplok bag before placing it in my suitcase so there was no damage done.....I just lost some of the product!</li>
            <li> I am a baker and this is the only  polish I have had last through a single work shift. I am totally hooked. Has last average of 2 weeks since I began using it</li>
            <li> This was delivered as advertised and as expected. I love doing my shellac nails at home. Saves a lot of money over time. So very worth it.</li>
            <li> I can do my nails whenever I want, very easy  and lasts at least 2 weeks very pleased!!!  :) :)</li>
            <li> I had purchased this same product for my daughter before Christmas and received smaller bottles and was surprised by the 2-8oz instead of 2-4oz.  Of course she took mine and left me with the small ones.  I wondered why I ordered the same thing twice from the same people and got two different things but paid the same. This gel stuff is very drying on the nails and you must moisturize constantly for healthy nails.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this product and did not nails right after Thanksgiving. I liked it so well I decided to order it for myself. I ordered it on 12-16 thinking I would get it before Christmas so I could redo my nails. Today is 12-24 and I am still waiting. So I cannot really review my order. I might change my rating if I ever receive this order.</li>
            <li> I recieved this package in great shape and it even had directions with it that were very easy to understand.  It made the transition to gel very simple!</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with gel polish.  Now I am completely addicted.  I have now had the chance to try several other brands and Gelish is by far my favorite.  I recommend it everywhere I go and someone asks about my nails and trust me ever since I switched to gel polishes I get asked constantly about my nails.  I had given up on nail polish because with my work it was pointless.  I work as a dog trainer so not only am I dealing with dogs jumping and biting my nails and hands, I wash my hands a hundred times a day.  I also work at a Pet Hotel so I am constantly scrubbing down rooms.  Regular polish would be chipped or worse within an hour of work.  Gel polish by Gelish lasts for at least two weeks.  The more advanced my skills are getting, the longer my polish is lasting.  I have had it last nearly a month once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foundation... Is very good.  goes on smooth without bubbles.&lt;br /&gt;Top it off... is incredible.  It is by far my favorite top coat.  It has a great shine and seals everything in and is probably the key of the polish lasting so long.&lt;br /&gt;Nail polish remover.... its acetone with fragrance and probably some moisturizers.  I have just switched to regular acetone that I get from a hardware store.  It is just cheaper and so far I don&#x27;t have a problem with it damaging or drying out my hands or nails.&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser... its just scented rubbing alcohol... so now thats what I use... way cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;Ph Bond... not sure what it is but I use it every time I do my nails.&lt;br /&gt;nourish cuticle oil... its cuticle oil... what more can you say... but it does have a great scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great starter kit and a great brand.  I recommend it several times a week.</li>
            <li> Was an ok kit but could have just skipped the nail cleaner, the top coat take off. One is nail polish remover and the other is rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. I&#x27;m happy with the price for the amount that you get. It isn&#x27;t old or sticky. Came when expected</li>
            <li> The product came opened in the box and they weren&#x27;t new they were taped shut. Half of the top coat polish spilt over everything else in the box. It was a mess.</li>
            <li> Fantastic products, fast deliver.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and good product!</li>
            <li> Has everything you need to get started with Gelish gel nail polish application. (Except for the LED or UV light and actual color polish.) Good value!</li>
            <li> This set is full size bottles and a must have with your supplies. Its price is better than buying individually.</li>
            <li> Product is great, love it with the color I chose! The only trouble with the delivery is that the bottles were wrapped in a bubble wrap envelope, and although they seemed well handled, the bottle of nail cleanser leaked, which meant I had to clean everything up when it arrived. Since only about 1/4 of one bottle leaked and I had been so excited to try the gel polish, I decided not to return the item, but just go ahead and use it. It works great, and I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Best gel nail kit out there.  Nails remain shiny and unchipped for days; even after painting the interior of a house and getting paint on the nails.  If you&#x27;re going to do your own nails this is whole kit is a must.</li>
            <li> Love that I found this set at the price I got it for.  It&#x27;s much less than going to Sally&#x27;s, AND the nail bottles are full sizes.  I love this brand as it stays a little longer than a lot of the cheaper brands.  If you&#x27;re looking for a starter kit for gel nails, definitely buy this set.  It lasts quite a long time, unless you redo your nails every day or something.</li>
            <li> Great products, would have liked to have instructions come with them, but I was able to get instructions off the Gelish website.</li>
            <li> This is a must have starter set for anyone getting into UV nail Art.&lt;br /&gt;All bottles arrived with NO leaks...and they work great</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed...only caveat....next time,offer directions, a DVD would have been great (especially appreciated by the novice as I).  Great product.</li>
            <li> I love doing my own nails, and this set is perfect. I started out with the mini set, but they did not last long, i needed something that had value and content. This set met that. I feel like I am getting the best value for my money and will never order the mini set again. Full Size is so much better.</li>
            <li> I had this product used at a manicure shop and liked the results; however, the baisc kit came without any instructions what so ever.  The only advice I had is what was posted by another customer about how to use the product.  I am sorry that I ever spent the money.</li>
            <li> Excellent products and easy to use. Too bad the Acetone wasn&#x27;t sealed well. It leaked all over the package. When I got it only about 1/2 the bottle was left.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I started out by purchasing the full kit.  I know where to go from now on (in terms of buying individual pieces etc).</li>
            <li> I love it, even though it seem the company fix this kit and it does not come in a case or instruccions. Still great to have full size products for a little extra. Arrived on time and very well packaged</li>
            <li> Nothing I have ever purchased has grown my nails out or strengthened my nails like the Gelish kit! The first time I got the starter kit for slightly less to see how I would like it, then I found the full size kit and was even more in love! The starter kit lasted almost 5 months with me doing my nails once a week so it really goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Very satisfated with the kit.Awesome product.It&#x27;s my favorite.I work eadily with it..Ordered the french kit too.Love this brand,I had the lamp from them too.The best in my opinion....</li>
            <li> Horrible packaging. I received the set with a third of the gel remover empty- it was all over everything else.. Not only that but the foundation gel was all gushed out too all over the bottle and the one it was next too. Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> Everything you need to give yourself a gel manicure, with the exception of the polish color.  PH to remove oil from the nail to begin with, then Base coat, followed by your own polish (I use regular polish, and it works fine), then Top Coat. Finisher to remove residue, and cuticle oil if you need.  Also a bottle of Gel Polish Remover.  Everything works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I love this set. If you don&#x27;t want to deal with artificial nail upkeep. This is the next best thing. I think it is better, I have flimsy nails and this has helped keep them stronger.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY. The items were taped shut with packaging tape and did not have their original seal. Because of this, there was leakage on other items.</li>
            <li> Exactly what&#x27;s advertised</li>
            <li> The Gelish  basic kit works great . After a few times you will perfect it.  You get everything you need for your  gel nails . I rated the product a 4 because , the product did not come with any instructions . The kit came with items that you don&#x27;t need and wont use .</li>
            <li> My wife &amp; daughters absolutely love this stuff. I searched the web &amp; the local beauty supplies &amp; Amazon had the best price I could find anywhere.</li>
            <li> I love love love Gelish. I&#x27;ve tried out a few at home gel manicure kits and this one was the absolute best for the price. You really cannot beat this price. Everything has worked out perfectly so far. I&#x27;ve had this kit for about four months now.</li>
            <li> When you follow the directions exactly it comes out just like the salon! Worth the investment if you get your nails done regularly.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and great deal!</li>
            <li> cheaper than the nail salon :)</li>
            <li> Just love this kit.  Love the whole thing. The blue cleaner gets any funky residue off the nail before beginning. They the ph Balance evidently gets the nail ready for application.  I do not always use it due to how much time I have on hand &amp; it does fine without but I imagine it has a good purpose to prepare the nail for the Foundation.  The Foundation is really cool.  I think it does something to help bond the polish to the nail. Use is sparingly or it is hard to dry or set under the lamp. I put too much the first time &amp; it took longer under the light. It is tacky when done. I believe this is what hold the polish color to the nail.  I have used both Gelish &amp; other nail polishes. They all work but the Gelish polish seems to have a better set &amp; it is a stronger, more durable polish bond in the end.  I guess I would say maybe thicker would be the word.  The Top It Off is the key to whole process I believe.  It puts a coat of almost like a plastic (but not) coat.  If you get it on the skin &amp; don&#x27;t wipe it off, you can pick it off later &amp; it is a thick layer that actually keeps it from chipping.  That is why you make sure it goes under the nail a little too so it is like one piece of coating protecting the tips of the nails.  The Nourish is the last step &amp; I do not always do that depending on my time constraints.  It is for the cuticle &amp; nail bed.  Good idea but the whole process does take time, so it depends on how much I have.  I think it was a good buy for the beginner &amp; am pleased with the package kit.  When I run out, I will only buy the things that are essential--The Blue Nail Cleaner, which someone said is just rubbing alcohol, the Foundation, the polish, &amp; the Top It Off.  I would advise a beginner to get it one time then make your own decision. You are saving a ton of money from not having to go to the salon so best to learn correctly. If there is one complaint, there were no instructions so I had to search online &amp; print them out.  Some stuff goes under the LED lights &amp; some does not.  I found I needed to leave the nails under the lights longer than the instructions stated.  Like if the Foundation is not &amp;#34;set&amp;#34;  long enough (it will always be tacky after being under the light no matter how long you leave it) it will still be SUPER tacky even when you wipe it as directed after being under the light.  So I just learned as I went &amp; it has worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li> This was a great deal and will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> I researched different gel products and ended up putting a Gelish kit on my Christmas list this year. I was thrilled to get the full size kit, and recently purchased my light and did my first manicure. I&#x27;m extremely happy with the results! My nails are short and always breaking, so the Gelish manicure is giving my nails some strength to grow out. I&#x27;ve purchased some Gelish colors (Sally&#x27;s has them buy 2 get 1 free right now, April 2013).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One downfall of the kit is packaging. It came in a small box with all the bottles loose inside. There were no instructions at all, just the bottles. A quick Google search of \\&quot;Gelish instructions\\&quot; gave me some good web sites and videos for instruction. I was a little frustrated because different sites had slightly different instructions (one said to lightly wipe nail with 70% alcohol or the cleanser after the base, another site didn&#x27;t add that step), so I just went with what the official Gelish video showed and it turned out great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to save you a little time, here&#x27;s a few things I learned.&lt;br /&gt;1) Thin layers are best. All the product is pretty thick, so try hard to get the excess off the brush before applying. The excess on your nails gets in the space between your nail and skin and ends up making a funny ridge that&#x27;s annoying.&lt;br /&gt;2) Pick up a wood stick (a toothpick could probably work) and get everything off your skin and cuticle prior to curing. This will make everything look better and save some you some frustration.&lt;br /&gt;3) Definitely use lint free wipes, the gel is kind of sticky and any cotton or lint will stick on and not come off!&lt;br /&gt;4) I wish I would&#x27;ve bought a LED light instead of UV. I didn&#x27;t want to spend the extra money to buy LED, but if I factor in the price of bulbs over the next few years, an LED would&#x27;ve probably paid off, plus the curing time is less. If you plan on doing a lot of manicures it might be worth it. I did get the [[ASIN:B001RMP7M6 Thermal Spa 49135 Professional U/V Gel Light Nail Dryer]]  light that fits both hands, which is really handy.&lt;br /&gt;5) Realistically, you could just buy the pH bond, foundation and top it off. The bottle of \\&quot;artificial nail remover\\&quot; is the same (or similar) to acetone remover, the bottle of \\&quot;Nail surface cleanse\\&quot; can be substituted with 70% alcohol wipes and the \\&quot;Nourish\\&quot; cuticle oil can be substituted with regular nail oil (I don&#x27;t use it anyway). This could save some money and get you started with your gel nails with the bare necessities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s a great kit. If you want something with instructions though, get the mini Gelish Basix kit. Have fun with your Gelish kit. After all the supplies I&#x27;ve bought, including polish and a UV light, I&#x27;ve probably spent $120. This is the price of about 3 salon gel manicures. Definitely worth investing in your own supplies.Light Nail Dryer]]  light that fits both hands, which is really handy.&lt;br /&gt;5) Realistically, you could just buy the pH bond, foundation and top it off.

            <li> Love this gel nail polish.  It really does last as long as Gelish says it will.  I&#x27;ve had my current polish on for 2 weeks without a single chip or loss of shine!  And I&#x27;m not careful with it either.  I do all kinds of gardening work and house remodeling projects, so there are plenty of chances to mess it up.  The best thing about this type of polish is it adds thickness and strength to your nails.  I have very weak nails and I haven&#x27;t had a single one break or tear while I&#x27;ve had this polish on.  When you apply the polish, since it&#x27;s a thick gel, it settles out any brush strokes before it cures so you get a smooth finish.  There are a couple of things to be careful of when applying.  Make sure to really clean the nail up near the cuticle.  I didn&#x27;t the first manicure I did on myself and the polish didn&#x27;t stick as well and started peeling at the top edge.  I use a q-tip and really scrub near the cuticle with the cleaning solution, and that seems to do the trick.  The other thing to be mindful of is to be careful when applying near the cuticles.  It will wick up under the skin, and as it grows out you&#x27;ll have a huge ridge.  If you try to stay a little ways away from the base of the nail it won&#x27;t be a problem.  Finally, as you&#x27;re working on your nails, just ignore how awful the cuticles look.  The cleaning solution drys them out, but the nourish oil fixes it all up at the end.  Read the directions on the Gelish website.  You will require an LED or UV curing light.  I think I saw someone else complain that the polish never dried on this product or one of the other Gelish polishes I was looking at on Amazon.  Clearly that person didn&#x27;t understand that this type of polish requires a light to cure and the cleaning solution at the end.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for and true to description they are full size! First timer and loved this is the way to go !!!</li>
            <li> This kit is perfect as a starter kit! My nails look great and the gell still haven&#x27;t peeled up after 1 week!</li>
            <li> I bought this so I could repair my broken nails in between visits to the salon.  I found it very easy to use and started doing my own nails.  I only go to the salon when I want a special treat.  this works very, very well and my nails look very natural.  I have been able to grow them longer than ever before in my life (and I am in my 50&#x27;s).  This also hides the little ridges that you get when you get a little older.  Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Really love this line of gel polish.  Check YouTube for how-to&#x27;s on application.</li>
            <li> Very happy, beautiful results</li>
            <li> I wanted to start doing my Gel nails at home. My mother and sister also wanted to try doing their nails at home and this set has worked out great for us. I saw that there was a mini set and it came with instructions. This set doesn&#x27;t come with instructions, but I went onto You tube and watched a few videos on how to apply the products.</li>
            <li> One of the newest things is Shellac and Gelish nail polishes and technology.  The downside is affording the manicures at the local spa.  This requires a little learning, but it&#x27;s great.  This set is perfect and buying from amazon is so convenient.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely pleased with my purchase of these products in the full sized bottles. The products are of excellent quality and I have used them several times. Great products and the seller provided very rapid and safe shipping. I can highly recommend these products and this seller!</li>
            <li> My friend recently started doing her own gel nails and this was the perfect starter kit for her.</li>
            <li> I just received my order and the soak off bottle was 3/4 empty and all over the box. When I pay for something I expect to get 100% of what I paid for.</li>
            <li> Works just as advertised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy that I can buy the same product and do my nails myself. Thanks for the kit, it makes it much easier to order.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted...</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this seller and their product. I have used it 8 times now. Paid for itself the first two times i used it. And i still have a lot of product left. WILL be buying this again.</li>
            <li> It is nice to have all the products in the large size bottles.  The cuticle oil is a nice touch but not necessary.</li>
