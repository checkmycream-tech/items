            <li>Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I purchased based on an article in Men&#x27;s Health magazine and am very happy I did.</li>
            <li>Great price!  </li>
            <li>It is pleasant to use and the results are excellent.</li>
            <li>my face looks great.</li>
            <li>The product itself workED great...</li>
            <li>This device is great.</li>
            <li>I recommend it as a good buy.</li>
            <li>I am hoping the Clarisonic Brand is good all over because four years ago I purchased the Clarisonic Pro</li>
            <li>The product is good</li>
            <li>My skin has never been softer or looked as good.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>I love this device and do not regret buying it at all!  </li>
            <li>Size is great, and it&#x27;s gentle!</li>
            <li>Very happy with the quality, good instruction booklet, it&#x27;s a bit much to use it every day (dries out my skin too much), twice a week is plenty.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>For most of the four years I used my Clarisonic Pro most days twice a day.</li>
            <li>I am still in love</li>
            <li>I love Clarisonic because it takes the years off.</li>
            <li>I love to cleanse my face using the Clarisonic MIA 3.  </li>
            <li>Love the color for my son.</li>
            <li>The price of the mia 3 is more</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better to buy Clarisonics from a Clarisonic retailer because you get a 3 year warranty on the mia 3.</li>
            <li>I thought for sure these were just a gimmick.</li>
            <li>and I am absolutely in love with it.  </li>
            <li>Love the skin care and the color.</li>
            <li>Great for younger customers for preventive measures and great for improving older skin.</li>
            <li>I thought it would spin and it wasn&#x27;t easy to put together.</li>
            <li>The packaging was fine, looked like it was never even opened before , but it just never worked.</li>
            <li>cause it will clean ur face really clean!</li>
            <li>This is a great facial cleaner.  </li>
            <li>Face feels clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li>So excited to receive my Mia 3.</li>
            <li>I also noticed a significant reduction in pores on and around my nose.  </li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m out $159 not even having it for a full 3 months.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s just a gentle vibration :)</li>
            <li>The charge lasts forever and my skin is more smooth, clear and bright than it has been in a very long time!  </li>
            <li>Just as I had hoped and was happy to have it as a choice in black</li>
            <li>My face felt so clean and my pores seemed to shrink after the first use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s completely worth it.</li>
            <li>Pricey, but proved worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>worth the money</li>
            <li>So worth the money.</li>
            <li>I have used some of the imitation versions of the home cleaning systems but none are as good as this.</li>
            <li>The first one of these I got worked all of 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised</li>
            <li>I will keep on getting my Clarisonics cause my first love served me so well for most of the past four years.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this clarisonic!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time buying this product as I got acne skin issues.</li>
            <li>This one comes with the sensitive brush, which is ok, but no where near as powerful as the deep clean.</li>
            <li>but I knew I really wanted the higher speed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far easier to charge, smoother to use and much easier to clean.</li>
            <li>I use mine once a day at the most because it&#x27;s not good to over exfoliate or take too many oils out of face.</li>
            <li>and I miss my Clarisonic so much so in spite of the price (which hurts my pocket a whole hell of a lot)</li>
            <li>and I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I really like the speed of the mia 3, the stand, and battery indicator.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t make that much of a difference for me</li>
            <li>The clarisonic really makes the soaps penetrate in the skin.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really feel like you&#x27;re scrubbing your face</li>
            <li>I am very upset to find out that the manufactures warranty is not valid if purchased thru amazon.  </li>
            <li>Very durable and big improvement over the original Mia.</li>
            <li>I recommend getting the deep clean brush.</li>
            <li>and this particular model seems to be discontinued for whatever reason.</li>
            <li>(I keep it in the shower) for about a month, I&#x27;ve seen only a mild difference in my complexion as I&#x27;m not prone to breakouts, but I have noticed my skin is smoother</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I was very nervous to buy this updates version of my old clarisonic because of the price .</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money as my skin was softer and clearer after only one use.</li>
            <li>but MIA 3 &amp;#34;destroy&amp;#34; them! Overall- worth the investment</li>
            <li>Live in Florida with iron in the water.</li>
            <li>The first one didn&#x27;t have the different speeds.</li>
            <li>my face looks so clear.</li>
            <li>I like that there are two brushes to choose from since I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My face has not been this clear since I was in my early twenties</li>
            <li>and it seems my complexition is improving- but not clearing up my old scar marks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was pleasantly surprised to find that the brush head is so soft you barely notice it!</li>
            <li>I had great skin that went bad on me.</li>
            <li>I was not rough with it nor was I pulling it.  </li>
            <li>So far using it once daily</li>
            <li>Wait until you see all the makeup you have been leaving behind when you though your face was clean!</li>

            <li> I bought the Aria over other Clarisonics for the timer feature</li>
            <li> I still really wanted to try it before I bought it because the price was so expensive.</li>
            <li> and I get less clogged pores around my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I emphasize the past tense because all of a sudden the charging cord the broke in 1/2.  </li>
            <li> but I felt that the shipping cost of the product is excessive for the price I paid for the product.</li>
            <li> spinning brush for people too lazy to move a wash cloth around their face.</li>
            <li> I dont press too hard.</li>
            <li> still there will be a few hardcore acne who just wana prove me wrong</li>
            <li> I was so wrong.</li>
            <li> The timer helps me not over-cleanse, as that can be quite bad for your skin.</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Wife loves it.  Uses it every night.</li>
            <li> Clairisonic will not cover the warranty on any products sold thru Amazon. The first one of these I got worked all of 2 minutes. Ordered another one for replacement and thats when I found out from Clairisonic they do not warrant these devices thru Amazon.</li>
            <li> Just as I had hoped and was happy to have it as a choice in black</li>
            <li> wish it would stop stopping every 3 seconds and pause...no I dont press too hard. If I want polished skin I use a scrub of sugar or my wash cloth</li>
            <li> I just bought mine last night. I love it. my face looks great. I look like I&#x27;m wearing makeup my face looks so clear. The only reason why I didn&#x27;t give this item give stars is because it didn&#x27;t spin. I thought it would spin and it wasn&#x27;t easy to put together.</li>
            <li> This is a great facial cleaner.  My face felt so clean and my pores seemed to shrink after the first use.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> The product itself workED great...and I emphasize the past tense because all of a sudden the charging cord the broke in 1/2.  I was not rough with it nor was I pulling it.  Now I&#x27;m out $159 not even having it for a full 3 months.  Horrible.</li>
            <li> My wife-to-be loves it and use it twice a day. I recommend it as a good buy. Tho a bit pricy.</li>
            <li> I am hoping the Clarisonic Brand is good all over because four years ago I purchased the Clarisonic Pro and this particular model seems to be discontinued for whatever reason. Like one of the reviewers said, the battery no longer charges well. For most of the four years I used my Clarisonic Pro most days twice a day. It worked well. When it stopped working I told myself that I am over Clarisonic. I was so wrong. I am still in love and I miss my Clarisonic so much so in spite of the price (which hurts my pocket a whole hell of a lot) I purchased my Mia 3 which I am expecting any day now. I hope the Mia 3 lasts as long or even longer than the Pro with the years in between for improvements. I love Clarisonic because it takes the years off. So excited to receive my Mia 3. I will keep on getting my Clarisonics cause my first love served me so well for most of the past four years. Yeah Clarisonic!!!</li>
            <li> I was sent a lemon. My clarisonic didn&#x27;t work ! The packaging was fine, looked like it was never even opened before , but it just never worked.</li>
            <li> I was very nervous to buy this updates version of my old clarisonic because of the price . It&#x27;s completely worth it. It&#x27;s far easier to charge, smoother to use and much easier to clean. Well upgraded.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy and I really like this product.  Face feels clean and smooth.  The battery seems to run forever between charges.</li>
            <li> The product is good but I felt that the shipping cost of the product is excessive for the price I paid for the product.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected- cleaned my skin without irritating it. I like that there are two brushes to choose from since I have sensitive skin. Can go a long time without being charged. Definitely worth the money as my skin was softer and clearer after only one use.</li>
            <li> I love to cleanse my face using the Clarisonic MIA 3.  It cleans so well but doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin when used as instructed.  I also noticed a significant reduction in pores on and around my nose.  The Clarisonic MIA 3 is a &#x27;must have&#x27; in my daily cleansing regiment!</li>
            <li> This saved my skin. I had great skin that went bad on me. Thank God for Clarisonic!! Pricey, but proved worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did the same for my hair dresser, who recommended the product to me!</li>
            <li> Love it! Use it only twice a week but cleans out my pores without having to rub my face like before. Size is great, and it&#x27;s gentle! I can&#x27;t complain about anything!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase. Love the color for my son. Very durable and big improvement over the original Mia.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> I bought the mia 3 after researching a lot of reviews. I still really wanted to try it before I bought it because the price was so expensive. I went to Ulta and had a Clarisonic representative try the mia 2 on one side of my face and the mia 3 on the highest speed on the other side of my face. She used the deep pore brush and deep pore gel and I saw a big difference in the size of my pores just after 1 use.  I really like the speed of the mia 3, the stand, and battery indicator. The price of the mia 3 is more but I knew I really wanted the higher speed. I tried the brush head that comes with the pack and the gel and its okay but it didn&#x27;t make that much of a difference for me but my skin felt a lot cleaner. When I tried it with the deep pore kit that sells for $65 that comes with the deep pore brush, deep pore gel and mask it made such a big difference even just after 1 week. The clarisonic really makes the soaps penetrate in the skin. It dries your face out so you need to moisturize. It&#x27;s better to buy Clarisonics from a Clarisonic retailer because you get a 3 year warranty on the mia 3.</li>
            <li> I thought for sure these were just a gimmick. spinning brush for people too lazy to move a wash cloth around their face. actually works though. worth the money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had mine for a little over a week and I am absolutely in love with it.  My face feels cleaner than it ever has in years. I have used some of the imitation versions of the home cleaning systems but none are as good as this. I recommend getting the deep clean brush. This one comes with the sensitive brush, which is ok, but no where near as powerful as the deep clean.</li>
            <li> My face has not been this clear since I was in my early twenties (in my thirties now).  I love this device and do not regret buying it at all!  The charge lasts forever and my skin is more smooth, clear and bright than it has been in a very long time!  Highly recommend this clarisonic!!</li>
            <li> Finally decided to splurge on this. There are a lot of cheaper ones on the market but hey, it&#x27;s my FACE. Very happy with the quality, good instruction booklet, it&#x27;s a bit much to use it every day (dries out my skin too much), twice a week is plenty. Noticeable improvement in my skin clarity.</li>
            <li> This device is great. My skin has never been softer or looked as good. It is pleasant to use and the results are excellent. Highly recommend it. I purchased based on an article in Men&#x27;s Health magazine and am very happy I did. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought the Aria over other Clarisonics for the timer feature and I do not regret it! The timer helps me not over-cleanse, as that can be quite bad for your skin. So far using it once daily (I keep it in the shower) for about a month, I&#x27;ve seen only a mild difference in my complexion as I&#x27;m not prone to breakouts, but I have noticed my skin is smoother and I get less clogged pores around my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised to find that the brush head is so soft you barely notice it! It doesn&#x27;t really feel like you&#x27;re scrubbing your face, it&#x27;s just a gentle vibration :) That had been my only aversion to buying one of these and now that I know I wish I&#x27;d gotten one sooner!</li>
            <li> Love the skin care and the color. Live in Florida with iron in the water. Does not stain!</li>
            <li> This is my second clarisonic. The first one didn&#x27;t have the different speeds. I like that option. Great price!  Update to my review: My Clarisonic has died. It didn&#x27;t last a year. I am very upset to find out that the manufactures warranty is not valid if purchased thru amazon.  I would not recommend buying this product on Amazon. I will purchase another one but I would like to have the warranty.</li>
            <li> Give your skin a gift and buy this now. Great for younger customers for preventive measures and great for improving older skin. The results don&#x27;t take long to notice. It will draw a lot of blemishes out of skin to begin with but clears up with regular use. I use mine once a day at the most because it&#x27;s not good to over exfoliate or take too many oils out of face. So worth the money. Wait until you see all the makeup you have been leaving behind when you though your face was clean!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time buying this product as I got acne skin issues. its been 2 weeks and it seems my complexition is improving- but not clearing up my old scar marks. still there will be a few hardcore acne who just wana prove me wrong but MIA 3 &amp;#34;destroy&amp;#34; them! Overall- worth the investment cause it will clean ur face really clean!</li>
