            <li>Iâ€™ve used Jhirmack Silver Brightening shampoo every day for many years.  </li>
            <li>mostly gray hair</li>
            <li>If you have foiled, bleached or grey hair it is the perfect product.</li>
            <li>so soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased to find that I could purchase it online at Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;The convenience of having it come right to my door</li>
            <li>Good product, fast service.</li>
            <li>This is the best product for gray/silver hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other products but,</li>
            <li>The order was filled and delivered promptly.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy</li>
            <li>I received the product within a couple of days which was great timing, but the product is not the same as I used to buy.  </li>
            <li>The product worked fine but also not quite as \\&quot;creamy\\&quot; as the original.</li>
            <li>Consequently, it took a bit to clean up all the containers before putting them on my shelf.  </li>
            <li>As described and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Sometimes you just have to laugh and today is their lucky day I laughed for not paying attention to the other reviewers.  </li>
            <li>I had been using this for many years and all of the sudden it was no longer available at Wal-Mart.  </li>
            <li>I have to use more of it, and it does not work as well as the old formula.</li>
            <li>But the price was right</li>
            <li>Quick delivery is appreciated.</li>
            <li>She has a hard time finding this shampoo in stores in her area, so it is great that I can order it from Amazon and have it delivered right to her door.</li>

            <li>I absolutely love this product and can not find it locally; therefore appreciate Amazon having it.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve used this Jhirmack shampoo for years and this is the first time we have seen what happens to it over time and improper storage --</li>
            <li>I am sure if it ever turns pure white like my Mom&#x27;s</li>
            <li>This is the only shampoo that keeps my white hair bright and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I have used this shampoo for a few years and am very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Not worth getting if you liked the formula fromn years ago.  </li>
            <li>It does NOT clean my hair anywhere as good as the old product</li>
            <li>probably years of intense heat.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>- really like it</li>
            <li>With my hair turning more white than gray these day, it&#x27;s important to maintain they white without a tinge of yellow.  </li>
            <li>It is hard to find locally so very pleased to find it on line.  </li>
            <li>Also these three bottles were placed in a white plastic bag that had a hole in it luckily the shipping box contained the spillage.  </li>
            <li>I wont persue this with the company only because I got it so quickly</li>
            <li>My hair is silver again and not dull.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this shampoo for several years, ever since my hair turned totally gray - it keeps it soft and easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>This is very old inventory.  </li>
            <li>Normanly the shampoo is  purple in color but this product is almost clear.</li>
            <li>leaves my hair soft and shiny and</li>
            <li>The color and density of the liquid appears the same as my older bottle purchased years ago.  </li>
            <li>Thus far, I can only find this product on the internet, so I appreciate the fact that Amazon.com provides me with a source.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this new Jhirmack shampoo to my worst enemy let alone my best friend.</li>
            <li>This hard to find shampoo must have been discontinued but lucky to find online since it works on silver hair.</li>

            <li> This hard to find shampoo must have been discontinued but lucky to find online since it works on silver hair.</li>
            <li> The color was pale blue instead of purple and was very slimmy and greasy.</li>
            <li> The color of the shampoo is a light shade of mauve not the deep violet/purple shade of previous purchases; the liquid is less viscous and feels almost slimy; even the slight scent is not the same.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products that are more expensive and always come back to Jhirmack.</li>
            <li> What we received was colorless, and the consistency of water left in bottom of a soap dish for a very long time.</li>
            <li> The outside of the bottles are identical to the previous ones that I bought from Amazon a couple of years ago, but the contents are very different.  </li>
            <li> I had a little left and compared the two, the one I had is thicker and a different color which made my hair brighter.  </li>
            <li> I used to buy it at local stores, but it has become harder and harder to find..  </li>
            <li> the  lids are loose on the bottles  </li>
            <li> Itâ€™s a huge disappointment.  </li>
            <li> Arrived careful wrapped in a pack of 3.  </li>
            <li> but...one of the bottles was 1/3 empty and leaked all over everything.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t use any other shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Due to EPA regulations the formula was changed and no it&#x27;s no better than generic dollar store shampoo.</li>
            <li> I am stuck with 3 bottles that I am pouring down the drain.  </li>
            <li> Nothing like my previous bottles.</li>
            <li> The one I purchased from Amazon was thinner and does not work on my hair like the previously purchased item.</li>
            <li> It seemed a little watered down</li>
            <li> messy  and wasteful  </li>
            <li> Almost appears to be watered down and the smell is not nice.</li>
            <li> It is watery and seems to separate: not satisfied with the results on my hair either .</li>
            <li> however, the product is like egg whites and not at all what I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for 15 plus years and have been ordering it online since it became unavailable in stores, but no more.</li>
            <li> Ill update this review after i actually use the product.</li>
            <li> Could of been a bad production run or product was very old.</li>
            <li> I was sorry to see that Jhirmack had changed the formula and it is watered down.  </li>
            <li> I was forced to use other shampoos and was totally disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I ordered 3 sets of 3 and two of the 3 sets had damaged wrappings and therefore there was leakage as  4 of the 9 containers had broken caps.  </li>
            <li> One cap was completely broken off and shampoo had leaked into the box.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in the last bottles I purchased.</li>
            <li> However, the product arrived in sorry shape.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo is difficult to purchase.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling dirty.  </li>
            <li> It was so bad, I had to throw it out.  </li>
            <li> The product we received was shockingly bad!</li>
            <li> However, I am very disappointed in this product.  </li>

We&#x27;ve placed another order with Amazon, using a different supplier, and are looking forward to erasing this one from our minds.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with order.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo for silver hair.  I had been using this for many years and all of the sudden it was no longer available at Wal-Mart.  I was forced to use other shampoos and was totally disappointed.  Thankfully I found Amazon is selling this.  My hair is silver again and not dull.  Thank you Amazon!!</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because the product has either been tampered with or it has degraded from time. I have been using this product for years and what I received was in the correct packaging however, the product is like egg whites and not at all what I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Jhirmack silver Brightening Shampoo for years and love the way it makes my gray hair shine and bounce</li>
            <li> The bottle is the same BUT the shampoo inside if different.  It is not the same color, viscosity, or odor.  It leaves my hair feeling dirty.  I am stuck with 3 bottles that I am pouring down the drain.  I have used this shampoo for 15 plus years and have been ordering it online since it became unavailable in stores, but no more.</li>
            <li> Was happy to find this shampoo that have used for 50 years.  My hair is very fine and now streaked gray.  It shines as advertised. Quick delivery is appreciated.</li>
            <li> I ordered this yesterday and received today so I&#x27;m happy about that but...one of the bottles was 1/3 empty and leaked all over everything. Also these three bottles were placed in a white plastic bag that had a hole in it luckily the shipping box contained the spillage.  The color and density of the liquid appears the same as my older bottle purchased years ago.  Ill update this review after i actually use the product. I wont persue this with the company only because I got it so quickly but I do wonder how things like tightening a cap slips through the cracks. They probably would charge restocking and id have to pay shipping anyway so why bother. Sometimes you just have to laugh and today is their lucky day I laughed for not paying attention to the other reviewers.  I so love this stuff  as well. Enjoy</li>
            <li> Thus far, I can only find this product on the internet, so I appreciate the fact that Amazon.com provides me with a source.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find Jhirmack shampoo online and ordered three as I have not been able to find this product at CVS, or Rite Aid.  I received the product within a couple of days which was great timing, but the product is not the same as I used to buy.  I had a little left and compared the two, the one I had is thicker and a different color which made my hair brighter.  The one I purchased from Amazon was thinner and does not work on my hair like the previously purchased item.</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
            <li> I used this product for years to help remove yellow from my white hair. Since I could no longer find it locally, I ordered it from Amazon.  I was sorry to see that Jhirmack had changed the formula and it is watered down.  I have to use more of it, and it does not work as well as the old formula.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for gray/silver hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other products but, they don&#x27;t compare.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my hair soft and shiny and I love the&lt;br /&gt;comments I receive from people that I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> So very glad that most any product can be found on line as this is a favorite of mine and I can not buy it locallly.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 3 stars because it was not as good as what I use to buy in the store. It seemed a little watered down BUT I would probably still buy it . I have not been able to find it in a store. The product worked fine but also not quite as \\&quot;creamy\\&quot; as the original. I&#x27;m glad I could find a substitute at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jhirmack Sliver Brightening Shampoo</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for a few years and am very satisfied.  It is hard to find locally so very pleased to find it on line.  I will be buying more when I need it.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Not worth getting if you liked the formula fromn years ago.  Due to EPA regulations the formula was changed and no it&#x27;s no better than generic dollar store shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is very old inventory.  The shampoo has separated.  The caps of all 3 bottles were cracked.  One cap was completely broken off and shampoo had leaked into the box.</li>
            <li> Contents had separated in all 6 bottles. Could of been a bad production run or product was very old. I have been using this product for 16 years and have never seen the contents actually look and feel like these did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years now and love it.  I was very pleased to find that I could purchase it online at Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;The convenience of having it come right to my door is priceless.  A very good product that I&#x27;ll certainly continue to use...</li>
            <li> It was so bad, I had to throw it out.  The color was pale blue instead of purple and was very slimmy and greasy.</li>
            <li> I have been using Jhirmack shampoo for a number of years.Ilove the way it keeps my hair white and shinny. I also love that I can order it on line because I can&#x27;t find it in any stores. PLEASE keepit in stock. I have tried all kinds of shampoo for white hair and and Jhirmack is the only one I like. I NEED PURPLE SHAMPOO.</li>
            <li> I have used jhrimack silver for over 12 years and what I received this time was a completely different formula. Normanly the shampoo is  purple in color but this product is almost clear. It does NOT clean my hair anywhere as good as the old product</li>
            <li> Iâ€™ve used Jhirmack Silver Brightening shampoo every day for many years.  I recently bought a set of 3 bottles from Amazon.  The outside of the bottles are identical to the previous ones that I bought from Amazon a couple of years ago, but the contents are very different.  The color of the shampoo is a light shade of mauve not the deep violet/purple shade of previous purchases; the liquid is less viscous and feels almost slimy; even the slight scent is not the same.  Here is photo of the original shampoo and the new version.  Itâ€™s a huge disappointment.  Iâ€™m now searching for another brand of sliver brightening shampoo.  I would not recommend this new Jhirmack shampoo to my worst enemy let alone my best friend.</li>
            <li> Keeps hair from yellowing as some gray or silver hair does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for couple of years now - retired - mostly gray hair - really like it - I searched for 30 minutes and the business I bought it from had the best price</li>
