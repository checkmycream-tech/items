            <li>Well what you pay for is what you get it works good but</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great, very good product definietly worth the price.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this for the price!</li>
            <li>My favorite brush head for the face is the one with the bristles.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Glad i bought it</li>
            <li>However, that brush head would be PERFECT for the heels, to remove dry skin and calluses.  </li>
            <li>how it sound is kinda</li>
            <li>Cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>For that price, wow, I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>i use it in the shower and it makes my skin feel so clean when i&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li>It was totally worth</li>
            <li>/&gt;this is just as good as Olay brush and less the cost.</li>
            <li>Love the different brush heads now my face feels so clean😊</li>
            <li>but um no! sorry for the downer comment</li>
            <li>Not as powerful , nd very plastic like a toy</li>
            <li>I LOVE my facial brush.</li>
            <li>but if you don&#x27;t know how to use it make sure that you order from a seller that&#x27;s speaks your language because the instructions are in Chinese.</li>
            <li>It seems like it will fall apart the first time you use it</li>
            <li>I use it several times a week, I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>It scrubs my skin really good and the different brushes that come with it all have different uses.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite good for such a low price.</li>
            <li>i really wanted this to work</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more than I expected for the price!</li>
            <li>I put my gentle facial cleanser right on the brush.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend you but it.</li>
            <li>Pretty small in size, but it comes with the 5 different heads, which are super easy to replace when needed.</li>
            <li>The only head that&#x27;s remotely useful is the brush.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s be honest, you usually get what you pay for, you know?!  </li>
            <li>I put new batteries in and it still doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>For the price, I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this facial brush.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hold much power/spin fast enough.</li>
            <li>I never expected much from it because of the price.</li>
            <li>Wow, this really surprised me.  </li>
            <li>Complete garbage.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that the high is not too fast than the low option.</li>
            <li>it also works really slow like the highest speed they have works exactly the same as the low one they just have a diffrent sound but work the exact same</li>
            <li>This brush, on high, has a lot of power and definitely deep cleans.  </li>
            <li>works exactly how I expected it to.</li>
            <li>Not super powerful</li>
            <li>If you have really sensitive skin like me, I suggest the low setting.</li>
            <li>These kinds of electronic facial brushes are very expensive, but this one is cheap and very useful.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product a few weeks ago and I love using it everyday.</li>

            <li> defintly not what i expected !</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> The pink one is definitely NOT for the face as it is way too hard and would damage your delicate skin.  </li>
            <li> Takes a little longer to ship, but it was not unreasonable and was within the time they said it would be delivered.</li>
            <li> mine broke within a few days and had to toss it.</li>
            <li> Very small, inexpensive and it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> water goes in the brush cleaning, not good ..</li>
            <li> Not too bad.</li>
            <li> disappointed and the shipping took forever</li>

            <li> Wow, this really surprised me.  For the price, I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this facial brush.  Let&#x27;s be honest, you usually get what you pay for, you know?!  My favorite brush head for the face is the one with the bristles.  The pink one is definitely NOT for the face as it is way too hard and would damage your delicate skin.  However, that brush head would be PERFECT for the heels, to remove dry skin and calluses.  This brush, on high, has a lot of power and definitely deep cleans.  I put my gentle facial cleanser right on the brush.  My husband is now hooked, too.  Highly recommend.  Takes a little longer to ship, but it was not unreasonable and was within the time they said it would be delivered.</li>
            <li> Low quality. Doesn&#x27;t hold much power/spin fast enough. Brushes are much smaller than you would expect, half-dollar size. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Love it. It&#x27;s great, very good product definietly worth the price. I highly recommend you but it. Buy it buy it buy it. 💁</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a few weeks ago and I love using it everyday. These kinds of electronic facial brushes are very expensive, but this one is cheap and very useful.</li>
            <li> ouch. this thing hurts! my skin broke out after using this about 2 times. defintly not what i expected ! i really wanted this to work but um no! sorry for the downer comment but i defintly give this a big thumbs down!!</li>
            <li> Cleans your skin good and has a buffer you can use on your feet heels or callus.&lt;br /&gt;I hope though I can find a replacement head when the brush wears out.  Ladies&lt;br /&gt;this is just as good as Olay brush and less the cost.</li>
            <li> water goes in the brush cleaning, not good ..</li>
            <li> Great product for the cost. Works well and these types of things at stores can be up to 200$ so this</li>
            <li> Well what you pay for is what you get it works good but the material and how it sound is kinda cheap.and it also works really slow like the highest speed they have works exactly the same as the low one they just have a diffrent sound but work the exact same</li>
            <li> I love it.I never expected much from it because of the price.I&#x27;ve had no problems with it since I started using it.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful , nd very plastic like a toy</li>
            <li> I LOVE my facial brush. It scrubs my skin really good and the different brushes that come with it all have different uses. Its a great product!</li>
            <li> Not super powerful but it gets the job done. Would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> Wonderful! works exactly how I expected it to. If you have really sensitive skin like me, I suggest the low setting. The high was a little to harsh to start with for me</li>
            <li> Great product but if you don&#x27;t know how to use it make sure that you order from a seller that&#x27;s speaks your language because the instructions are in Chinese.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite good for such a low price.</li>
            <li> Not too bad. It seems like it will fall apart the first time you use it but it has held up well. I use it several times a week, I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love it. Very small, inexpensive and it gets the job done. The item arrived earlier than I expected.  The con is that I wish it came in a case to store it in after use. Nevertheless, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> Complete garbage. The heads feel totally different than the Clarisonic and I had the impression that this was actually tearing up my skin. The only head that&#x27;s remotely useful is the brush. the others are total garbage. Save your money.</li>
            <li> I love it. Pretty small in size, but it comes with the 5 different heads, which are super easy to replace when needed. For that price, wow, I am very satisfied. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This works great...i use it in the shower and it makes my skin feel so clean when i&#x27;m done.  Glad i bought it</li>
            <li> Stopped working after 2 days...I put new batteries in and it still doesn&#x27;t work. The thing is junk</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this for the price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more than I expected for the price! I can see changes in my face after using it a couple of times. The only problem is that the high is not too fast than the low option.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work well. Cheaply made.  It&#x27;s like a kids cheep toy.</li>
            <li> It was totally worth it&#x27;s price. Only disadvantage is that set doesn&#x27;t include extra face brush</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t buy.. mine broke within a few days and had to toss it. disappointed and the shipping took forever</li>
