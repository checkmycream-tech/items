    <ol>
            <li>Great Product!</li>
            <li>They smell great!!</li>
            <li>This stuff is the best of the Charlies if you ask me...</li>
            <li>Depending upon the type of scent one prefers, Charlie Silver is a wonderful choice...especially in warmer weather.</li>
            <li>The smell is very nice!</li>
            <li>Very happy with purchase...not so happy about having to come up with a limit of words that I have to use.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>For example, Miss Marilyn Monroe was said to have favored Chanel No. 5, and Miss Audrey Hepburn is said to have favored L&#x27;Interdit.</li>
            <li>Great savings on a charming fragrance.</li>
            <li>but it still smells good.</li>
            <li>Wife liked this item, great price for the size, she said she will order again when she needs more.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>liked everything about this product.</li>
            <li>a beautiful, cool and breezy scent.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and packaging in great condition.</li>
            <li>This is a great smelling perfume not too strong, not too light.  </li>
            <li>More suitable for the summer months.</li>
            <li>Was not packed very securely for a bottle f perfume in a cardboard box but no damage was done.</li>
            <li>My favorite fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Love Charlie White-Red and now Silver.</li>
            <li>Charlie Silver is now one of my favorite Charlie scents.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s alright if you love a floral scent  </li>
            <li>but I love charlie fragrances anyway</li>
            <li>Will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li>I love Charlie Silver.</li>
            <li>thus becoming one&#x27;s signature scent.</li>
            <li>Since Estee Lauder has discontinued my favorite, DAZZLING SILVER, I discovered this version of CHARLIE, with a similar scent.</li>
            <li>This has become one of many favorites by Revlon and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It has a floral but not so sweet smell.</li>
            <li>Fine, Airy, Crisp...</li>
            <li>According to Mumzy, certain scents may be worn throughout the year...</li>
            <li>She really like it.</li>
            <li>Fast and well delivered afterall.</li>
            <li>A great gift that is under $10 and comes with a few little extras in the box.</li>
            <li>But it looks like new.</li>
            <li>In a word... WOW!</li>
            <li>Like Charlie-Gold and Blue almost as much.</li>
            <li>Not as subtle or flowery but lives up to its predecessor, the original CHARLIE.</li>

            <li> I buy it form Amazon and came with other 2 EDT.</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a watered down bottle?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is hardly any smell to this and 20 minutes after I apply it, even that is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This scent was inoffensive but weak and took a while to show up after perfume alcohol abated.</li>
            <li> Too bad it is not for pussycats...</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m disappointed...</li>

            <li> Great Product! Love it!</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance.  Price competitive and I didn&#x27;t have to go out to buy it.  Arrived quickly and packaging in great condition.</li>
            <li> This scent was inoffensive but weak and took a while to show up after perfume alcohol abated. Was not packed very securely for a bottle f perfume in a cardboard box but no damage was done.</li>
            <li> This is a great smelling perfume not too strong, not too light.  This has become one of many favorites by Revlon and at a reasonable price. I would recommend you try the Charlie Red and Charlie Blue my daughters&#x27; steal them from me all the time. They smell great!!</li>
            <li> My Mom still loves this stuff.</li>
            <li> Great product. Timely delivery.</li>
            <li> I have used Charlie for over 30 years. Love Charlie White-Red and now Silver. Like Charlie-Gold and Blue almost as much.</li>
            <li> Very happy with purchase...not so happy about having to come up with a limit of words that I have to use.</li>
            <li> liked everything about this product. WOULD BY THIS ANY TIME AND WEAR THIS PARFUM  ANY WHERE. WOULD TELL MY FRIENDS ABOUT THIS  PRODUCT. THANK YOU.</li>
            <li> Wife liked this item, great price for the size, she said she will order again when she needs more. Shipped with no damage.</li>

            <li> Charlie Silver is now one of my favorite Charlie scents. I like the fragrance and plan to buy it again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife. She really like it. It has a floral but not so sweet smell. The only down side is it didn&#x27;t came sealed. But it looks like new. Fast and well delivered afterall. I buy it form Amazon and came with other 2 EDT.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best of the Charlies if you ask me... Fine, Airy, Crisp... Long lasting! In a word... WOW!</li>

            <li> Great savings on a charming fragrance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright if you love a floral scent  I&#x27;m not really a floral woman but I love charlie fragrances anyway but it still smells good.</li>
            <li> Charlie Silver...a beautiful, cool and breezy scent. More suitable for the summer months. According to Mumzy, certain scents may be worn throughout the year...thus becoming one&#x27;s signature scent. For example, Miss Marilyn Monroe was said to have favored Chanel No. 5, and Miss Audrey Hepburn is said to have favored L&#x27;Interdit. Then again, there are some scents which may be worn according to the occasion one is attending. Depending upon the type of scent one prefers, Charlie Silver is a wonderful choice...especially in warmer weather. It is made in England, and it is not always found in retail shops. Too bad it is not for pussycats...Oh! Phffft!</li>
            <li> A great gift that is under $10 and comes with a few little extras in the box. Will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> I love Charlie Silver. The smell is very nice!</li>
