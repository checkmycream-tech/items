            <li>excellent results.</li>
            <li>Good product!</li>
            <li>this is a great width and a great value</li>
            <li>Good for a &amp;#34;spare&amp;#34;,</li>
            <li>Product is good</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>The plates are very smooth.</li>
            <li>So get one and you will love it.</li>
            <li>Came in quick and have no complaints!</li>
            <li>Its much heavier, seems to heat up more and it does a much better job at straightnening.</li>
            <li>In this particular case, you kind of get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li>but I will be purchasing a better quality one for my main flatiron.</li>
            <li>Heats up very fast and the width of the iron is a great size because you can buy the iron to wide</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>I love this straightener; I bought it when my old Revlon straightener started sparking whenever I turned it on.</li>
            <li>I love the Revlon iron and actually it is my second one.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as staticky as my old one, and it heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>A reasonably priced straightener that has temperature control and doesn&#x27;t pull on my hair.</li>
            <li>and you have to continue to go over your haor because you are trying to iron to much hair at one time</li>
            <li>I bought a Remington digital and so far I love it.  </li>
            <li>It definitely does the job, and at a very affordable price!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough and pulled out my hair.</li>
            <li>You need to pass several times to straight your hair.</li>

            <li> Very bad product! You need to pass several times to straight your hair.</li>
            <li> I love this straightener; I bought it when my old Revlon straightener started sparking whenever I turned it on. I bought this one because of the price &amp; the color, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as staticky as my old one, and it heats up quickly. It definitely does the job, and at a very affordable price!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for! A reasonably priced straightener that has temperature control and doesn&#x27;t pull on my hair. The plates are very smooth.</li>
            <li> Heats up very fast and the width of the iron is a great size because you can buy the iron to wide and you have to continue to go over your haor because you are trying to iron to much hair at one time this is a great width and a great value</li>
            <li> Not worth it. Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough and pulled out my hair. I gave it away to goodwill weeks after purchase.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t suggest , doesn&#x27;t stay heated up. Or at least mine doesn&#x27;t . Returning.</li>
            <li> This is &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;.  In this particular case, you kind of get what you pay for.  There are not many options for heat settings (basically high / low / or off).  Also, it does not have an auto shut off.  Good for a &amp;#34;spare&amp;#34;, but I will be purchasing a better quality one for my main flatiron.</li>
            <li> I love the Revlon iron and actually it is my second one. Nothing is wrong with my first one but I bought another one to have in case mine went out and they are sort of hard to find or at least I had a hard time. So get one and you will love it.</li>
            <li> Product is good but I received wrong color twice. Annoying.</li>
            <li> excellent results. Delivered on time. As par my expectations</li>
            <li> Bought this a few months ago and it already burned up.  I bought a Remington digital and so far I love it.  Its much heavier, seems to heat up more and it does a much better job at straightnening.</li>
            <li> I have used it a few times now and it works alright but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for anyone with hair like mine. I have the thick long and natural curl to mine.</li>
            <li> I love this! I use it everyday and it doesn&#x27;t rip my hair like the others.</li>
            <li> Does wonders for my hair! Came in quick and have no complaints! Good product!</li>
