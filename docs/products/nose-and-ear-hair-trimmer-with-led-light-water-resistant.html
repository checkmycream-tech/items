    <ol>
            <li> Good, solid product. This works well, removes hairs painlessly, I might add. Comes with a nice stand. And very good price.</li>
            <li> The product arrived as promised; however, the bottom would not go back on after the battery was inserted. Due to this malfunction, I returned the product to Amazon. This is the first product I purchased which needed to be returned.</li>
            <li> Does the job as advertised.  Trims the nose and straightens sideburns.  Does all these things easily.  Changing heads is simple.</li>
            <li> This nose(ear) trimmer with the little(but...good illumination)light,does an excellent job and even &amp;#34;holds&amp;#34; it&#x27;s charge on the inserted (rechargeable)battery. It even looks cool... on my vanity bathroom counter in it&#x27;s holder. Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT, great price, fast ship, would buy from seller again</li>
            <li> Great trimmer.  Does a really good job on nasal hairs.</li>
            <li> Works great and feels like it will last. Good build quality.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t think the built in light would make a difference but it really comes in handy!</li>
            <li> I like this trimmer better than the panasonic I bought a year or so ago.  The panasonic is on the fritz and won&#x27;t turn on most of the time.  This trimmer works much better and I like the light.  Still going strong 6 months later!</li>
            <li> seems to work fine, just used it once. Its lightweight and easy to store</li>
            <li> Works great for trimming the nose and the extra trimmer is great for around the ears and eyebrows.  I just wish it was electric and didn&#x27;t need batteries.  FYI:  When the battery gets low, the first thing to stop working is the trimmer and light.  The nose trimmer still works until it runs out of juice.</li>
            <li> Shaver attachment does not work.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with the performance and very helpful LED light. This product grooms unsightly hair perfectly without pain or inconvenience.</li>
            <li> Bought for husband and he likes.</li>
            <li> This works as stated but it&#x27;s a little bulky. I like the light which is an added benefit. Good for traveling as well.</li>
            <li> After less than two months stopped working altogether.  Also when it was working it heated up a lot.  Hot to the touch!</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with this purchase.  This was a replacement for a similar trimmer that wore out after years of use. It meets all of my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I question the need for the light as I haven&#x27;t found a real advantage for nose or ear trimming.</li>
            <li> Have used it just a few times but it seems to be the nicest one we have had in a long time.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried others that work well for eyebrows and ears, but this is the best for nose hairs.&lt;br /&gt;they itch all the time. its a nice relief that they are gone without having to mount a search and destroy mission.</li>
