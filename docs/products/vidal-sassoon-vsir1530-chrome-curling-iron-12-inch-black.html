            <li>It works great on all my hair, but especially those shorter areas closer to my head, and I don&#x27;t burn myself.  </li>
            <li>Cheap construction and assembly, must be out sourcing the product.</li>

            <li>The delivery time was super, also.</li>
            <li>She loves it and the pirce was a super value.</li>
            <li>Does not heat up quickly</li>
            <li>This is the best and longest lasting curling iron I have ever had and it is the reason I purchased the same brand and model again.&lt;br /&gt;Kudos to Vidal Sassoon!</li>
            <li>so worth the try.</li>

            <li>, really thought that would not bother me, it does!</li>
            <li>and/or does not get hot at all.</li>

            <li>The reason they broke is the swivel chord mechanism was nearly dis-functional.</li>
            <li>I had an old Vidal Sassoon curling iron that lasted for years.  </li>
            <li>Tried fixing it - ended up throwing it away.&lt;br /&gt;Could not be fixed.</li>
            <li>It works fine after it heats up but not for at least 15 mins.</li>

            <li> I have tried other curling irons, but have always come back to Vidal Sassoon.</li>
            <li> This is not hot enough to curl hair!  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s very hard to find this size, thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this curling in my local stores where I have previously purchased them.</li>
            <li> the barrel on this is very loose and will not stay tight enough around your hair how to make a curl.</li>
            <li> it was everything i expected</li>

            <li> Used the curling iron a few weeks</li>
            <li> It was hard to find this size anymore.</li>
            <li> My wife has looked for a 1/2&amp;#34; curling iron and it seems to be hard to find.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Serves purpose for me. Price is right too</li>
            <li> Love this curling iron, short hair it&#x27;s perfect for. But it&#x27;s very hard to find this size, thanks Amazon! Good job.</li>
            <li> I read reviews before buying, saw it was slow to heat up, really thought that would not bother me, it does! Slow is NOT the word. It works fine after it heats up but not for at least 15 mins. It&#x27;s crazy slow to heat.</li>
            <li> After four months the wires broke and it stopped function. The reason they broke is the swivel chord mechanism was nearly dis-functional.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS!! As soon as I got this I wanted to try it out, it took forever for it to warm up, and then after curling a couple strands of my daughters hair, it fell apart!!!!! I was so angry and upset that I wasted the money.</li>
            <li> Curling item does a good job. Compact, nice metal stand to prop it up for safety.Finally found the size curling iron I needed for my short hair.</li>
            <li> Finally found the size curling iron I needed for my short hair. Vidal Sassoon products have always served me well.</li>
            <li> Love vidal sassoon products. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good curling iron. this works well for me.</li>
            <li> I have tried other curling irons, but have always come back to Vidal Sassoon. I could not find this curling iron in the store anymore, so I went online to amazon.com and purchases three of them. This iron really is &amp;#34;tops&amp;#34; in my book. And the price just can&#x27;t be beat! The delivery time was super, also. My last Visal Sassoon iron must have lasted for several years (I can&#x27;t remember when I purchased it). Hats off to amazon.com and Vidal Sassoon! I highly recommend this curling iron to anyone who want the ease and reliability of a great curling iron!</li>
            <li> I had an old Vidal Sassoon curling iron that lasted for years.  I wouldn&#x27;t replace it with anything else.  I like it alot.  I need the smaller one for my short thin hair and you can&#x27;t find too many like this.</li>
            <li> I  do wish it would get hotter, but it still works,  so I would recommend it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> Opened package and all parts there but not together.  Handle clip and spring all fell apart.  not pinned together,  Unusable</li>
            <li> The shaft came apart after about two uses. It didn&#x27;t totally come apart  but separated at the seam. Very frustrating.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother as a gift. It was hard to find this size anymore. She loves it and the pirce was a super value.</li>
            <li> Perfect, just what I was looking for.  The handle is not too big, easy to grip.  Cord doesn&#x27;t wind up or get tangled</li>
            <li> Product is crap. You would think with the name Vidal Sassoon, it would be a well made product....NOT! I should have listened to the other reviews I read. You get what you pay for. This product was on the cheap and that is what I got...CHEAP! Does not heat up quickly and/or does not get hot at all. This product is a waste. If you want fine products, pay the extra dollars. I DO NOT recommend this product...in fact, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.  Have a nice day everyone. :)</li>
            <li> Very reasonably priced product. It performs very well. No bells and whistles, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> Works great and is the correct size.</li>
            <li> great curling iron I just love Vidal Sassoon curling irons they are the best that I have ever used.  Liz</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful curling iron.  It works great on all my hair, but especially those shorter areas closer to my head, and I don&#x27;t burn myself.  Vidal Sassoon makes quality products.  After much use when the spring breaks, they sell replacements for $1.00 each, which is a great bargain.  It saves money because you don&#x27;t have to purchase a new curling iron.</li>
            <li> I love this it was everything i expected</li>
            <li> Curling item does a good job. Compact, nice metal stand to prop it up for safety. Heats well, heats fast. Good value for the money.</li>
            <li> the barrel on this is very loose and will not stay tight enough around your hair how to make a curl. Don&#x27;t know how to tighten it and don&#x27;t feel I should have to. Not too happy</li>
            <li> Used the curling iron a few weeks and it literally came apart.  Tried fixing it - ended up throwing it away.&lt;br /&gt;Could not be fixed.</li>
            <li> It is what it says and does what it says. Very pleased with it and have to keep typing til it tells me I can submit lol</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my mother, it seemed great, but she said it did not get hot enough to give her the curls she desired.  Very low cost so worth the try.</li>
            <li> This takes a LONG time to heat up.  That&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
            <li> So happy and excited that I finally found this curling iron again!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this curling in my local stores where I have previously purchased them. The last iron I purchased locally was a complete failure, the cord tangles and no matter what I did, I could not stop the tangle. This issue I thought was due to a defective factory assembly. When I found the iron on Amazon I thought I had won the curling iron lottery, I bought two, both are in the trash, I will NEVER buy another Vidal Sassoon curling iron. Cheap construction and assembly, must be out sourcing the product. The no tangle cord did nothing but tangle, complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is not hot enough to curl hair!  I had to ruin the packaging to get it open ..  Otherwise I would return it!</li>
            <li> Great price for this curling iron!</li>
            <li> My wife has looked for a 1/2&amp;#34; curling iron and it seems to be hard to find.  Thank goodness this was available and it seems to work well.</li>
            <li> This is the best and longest lasting curling iron I have ever had and it is the reason I purchased the same brand and model again.&lt;br /&gt;Kudos to Vidal Sassoon!</li>
            <li> I bought two. you can not hardly find a good curling iron that is 1/2 &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It is a good curling iron if you don&#x27; mind waiting a bit for it to warm up. Perfect for fine hair.</li>
