            <li>until I found this item -- it&#x27;s the best heel buffer.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s absolutely perfect!</li>
            <li>The best buffer ever.</li>
            <li>One of the best beauty care products I own!</li>
            <li>and my feet look great.  </li>
            <li>i got one of this Panasonic Electric Pedicure Care Set years ago from Japan and it works great for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best heel buffer available in market, no doubt.  </li>
            <li>Not salon strength but good for touch ups.</li>
            <li>This thing works like a charm and in minutes, you will have beautiful smooth heels.</li>
            <li>The product does work, so I got my own.  </li>
            <li>Nice buffer.</li>
            <li>Does a nice job of buffing my callouses and corns in between my pedicure appointments.</li>
            <li>this item is made in Japan, really good quality in nice price, I use it more than 3 years to keep my heel smooth without rift and pain, now I introduce to all my friend and colleague, they all love it, even a man like me!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise, I love this product -</li>
            <li>I still go to a salon for pedicures, but now it&#x27;s more for a polish.  </li>
            <li>Much better that PedEgg and all of that.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re better off just going to the salon....</li>
            <li>This little gadget is absolutely wonderful!  </li>
            <li>I liked [[ASIN:B001AQMYQG Ped Egg ,Brand New Callous Remover]]</li>
            <li>And i will suggest to use powerful batteries with this machine(i use rechargeable ones), And remember don&#x27;t use cheap batteries</li>
            <li>I had high expectations, especially after reading a very enthusiastic review from a woman who said only great things about it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so powerful and quick.  </li>
            <li>so i got another two for my parents who also had the same problem, and they both love it!</li>
            <li>I really put this machine under a lot of pressure and it actually got quite hot, but I&#x27;m now the proud owner of two shiny and soft heels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly - even on free shipping! - and works a gem, getting through layer upon layer of dry, cracked skin on my heels.</li>
            <li>I too had higher expectations.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t see that it does anything!</li>
            <li>and till now I keep recommanding this product to my girl friends who wants to have smooth and soft feet.    </li>
            <li>I replaced an older Panasonic for this, the only issue is the battery must be strong and fresh for it to work</li>
            <li>Very practical.</li>
            <li>sent it back,,, pure junk!!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any success addressing till now, in spite of the various pumice stones, foot rasps and cracked heel repair creams I&#x27;ve tried over the years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice enough and works in tight spaces but the Emjoi is lightyears beyond this device!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>especially my large toes were in trouble</li>
            <li>No more embarrassing rough feet, I love this!</li>
            <li>For people like me who have very thick skin from wearing high heels, it will take you some time filing (i use it about once a week for 30 mins), but the result is just way much better than what i got from the salon.</li>
            <li>this machine is so easy to use and is well made, durable and hard</li>

            <li> this machine is so easy to use and is well made, durable and hard</li>
            <li> - my heels were as hard as concrete and after just the one session they are fixed!</li>
            <li> the people who leave one start reviews, I can only imagine your machine was faulty or you batteries were low powered / flat</li>
            <li> Actually the only product that really works for the thick skin under my feet.</li>
            <li> I cannot use pink divice in public.</li>
            <li> I got one long ago in Korea and was looking for another one</li>
            <li> Before, my process was: (1) use little metal foot file (2) smooth with a nail file (3) use exfoliating scrub (4) use tweezers to pick off whatever dead skin was left (5) smooth with nail file again</li>
            <li> /&gt;Batteries don&#x27;t last long and all together I think it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit expensive but definitely worth it.  </li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars but the battery cover keeps slipping off during use; this is a design flaw Panasonic would do well to correct.</li>
            <li> , the result is no comparison, it was not powerful and didn&#x27;t work as well as this unit.  </li>
            <li> This thing is not worth</li>
            <li> Forget having an arm workout trying to sandpaper down your callus.</li>
            <li> No more wasting money at the salon for my rough heels.</li>
            <li> I am diabetic and get very hard dry skin on my feet and this is a lifesaver for summer sandles</li>
            <li> I agree with the other poor review of this item.</li>
            <li> I used to be embarrassed by the hard calloused skin on my feet, no matter how often I went for a salon pedicure.  </li>
            <li> and as I man I didn&#x27;t do anything about my feet until I&#x27;d let hard skin on my heels build up to monumental levels.</li>
            <li> I used this machine and managed to carve off all the hard skin in one sitting.</li>
            <li> I  think its pure crap!</li>
            <li> VERY weak, doesn&#x27;t do everything it claims to do.....</li>

            <li> I replaced an older Panasonic for this, the only issue is the battery must be strong and fresh for it to work properly.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I love this product - I am diabetic and get very hard dry skin on my feet and this is a lifesaver for summer sandles</li>
            <li> I had high expectations, especially after reading a very enthusiastic review from a woman who said only great things about it. However, I must say,  that you have to spend an hour filing to see any results. (and I get a pedicure every 2 weeks)&lt;br /&gt;Batteries don&#x27;t last long and all together I think it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> My wife loves the product so I was using hers.  The product does work, so I got my own.  It&#x27;s the best heel buffer available in market, no doubt.  I wish it was in different color.  I cannot use pink divice in public.</li>
            <li> I liked [[ASIN:B001AQMYQG Ped Egg ,Brand New Callous Remover]] until I found this item -- it&#x27;s the best heel buffer.  It&#x27;s so powerful and quick.  I forgot this Panasonic Heel Buffer for my vacation so I bought [[ASIN:B001JYJLMY Artemis Woman HEEL SMOOTHER pedicure appliance]] at drug store, the result is no comparison, it was not powerful and didn&#x27;t work as well as this unit.  I bought second Panasonic Heel Buffer I came back from vacation so I will bring this one for my upcoming trip.  It&#x27;s a bit expensive but definitely worth it.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly - even on free shipping! - and works a gem, getting through layer upon layer of dry, cracked skin on my heels. It&#x27;s a problem I haven&#x27;t had any success addressing till now, in spite of the various pumice stones, foot rasps and cracked heel repair creams I&#x27;ve tried over the years. I would have given it 5 stars but the battery cover keeps slipping off during use; this is a design flaw Panasonic would do well to correct. Otherwise, it&#x27;s absolutely perfect!</li>
            <li> No more wasting money at the salon for my rough heels. No more embarrassing rough feet, I love this! So discreet and money saver!</li>
            <li> Forget having an arm workout trying to sandpaper down your callus. This thing works like a charm and in minutes, you will have beautiful smooth heels.</li>
            <li> This little gadget is absolutely wonderful!  I used to be embarrassed by the hard calloused skin on my feet, no matter how often I went for a salon pedicure.  Now I use this about once every two weeks and my feet look great.  I still go to a salon for pedicures, but now it&#x27;s more for a polish.  One of the best beauty care products I own!</li>
            <li> I tried this insteading of getting an Emjoi buffer tool. It&#x27;s nice enough and works in tight spaces but the Emjoi is lightyears beyond this device!</li>
            <li> i got one of this Panasonic Electric Pedicure Care Set years ago from Japan and it works great for me. Actually the only product that really works for the thick skin under my feet. so i got another two for my parents who also had the same problem, and they both love it! and till now I keep recommanding this product to my girl friends who wants to have smooth and soft feet.    For people like me who have very thick skin from wearing high heels, it will take you some time filing (i use it about once a week for 30 mins), but the result is just way much better than what i got from the salon. And i will suggest to use powerful batteries with this machine(i use rechargeable ones), And remember don&#x27;t use cheap batteries cuz that might be the reason it takes you longer to file.</li>
            <li> as soon as it touched my skin, it stopped rotating! sent it back,,, pure junk!! I  think its pure crap!</li>
            <li> I agree with the other poor review of this item. I too had higher expectations. I really don&#x27;t see that it does anything!</li>
            <li> this item is made in Japan, really good quality in nice price, I use it more than 3 years to keep my heel smooth without rift and pain, now I introduce to all my friend and colleague, they all love it, even a man like me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pharmacist and I actually use this to get calluses off my palms from opening and closing medicine bottles all day, every day.  Before, my process was: (1) use little metal foot file (2) smooth with a nail file (3) use exfoliating scrub (4) use tweezers to pick off whatever dead skin was left (5) smooth with nail file again (6) wash hands (7) lotion. This took almost an hour and I had to do it every week!! Now it only takes me 5 mins tops for both hands combined.</li>
            <li> Nice buffer. Not salon strength but good for touch ups.</li>
            <li> Very practical. Much better that PedEgg and all of that.</li>
            <li> Does a nice job of buffing my callouses and corns in between my pedicure appointments.</li>
            <li> This thing is not worth the box t came in. VERY weak, doesn&#x27;t do everything it claims to do.....you&#x27;re better off just going to the salon....and I&#x27;m a guy!</li>
            <li> Wow! this machine is so easy to use and is well made, durable and hard wearing - I&#x27;m a chap and as I man I didn&#x27;t do anything about my feet until I&#x27;d let hard skin on my heels build up to monumental levels. I used this machine and managed to carve off all the hard skin in one sitting. I really put this machine under a lot of pressure and it actually got quite hot, but I&#x27;m now the proud owner of two shiny and soft heels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the people who leave one start reviews, I can only imagine your machine was faulty or you batteries were low powered / flat - my heels were as hard as concrete and after just the one session they are fixed!</li>
            <li> Now I can take care of my needs and don&#x27;t need to spend extra money - especially my large toes were in trouble</li>
            <li> I have tried may different kinds of buffers and this is the strongest one I have ever found that is battery operated.  I got one long ago in Korea and was looking for another one and here I found it.  The best buffer ever.</li>
