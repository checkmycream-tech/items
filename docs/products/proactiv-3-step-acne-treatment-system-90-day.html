            <li> My daughter has been using it for a couple of weeks, and her face is clearing up nicely.</li>
            <li> Said it was a 90 day supply... But the bottles were a 60 day supply ounce size. Very disappointed :-(</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  Helps my granddaughter clear up her skin.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work half as well as people claim, so when I decided I had wasted enough money and stopped buying it that is when my skin really got messed up. Once I stopped using proactive my back flared into a whole new level of bad acne, I already had deep scars before proactive and now I can&#x27;t wear anything that shows the slightest bit of shoulder let alone my back because I&#x27;m covered in huge oozing pimples. No one has been able to give me answers as to why this happened and to be honest I don&#x27;t care, I just want these huge painful lumps to go away. It has been almost six months since I stopped using this product and I am still struggling to get my skin into a semi manageable state, my best advice would be not to stop use if it works and if you have any doubts of it working DO NOT TRY IT! I bought directly from proactive, they have since deleted my review of their product.</li>
            <li> Great value and size.</li>
            <li> There is no way this is three months worth, even if used sparingly.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t give it higher rating.  I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 20 years and even though I no longer have severe acne I still use it  as a good regime for my skin care.  I do not like the Proactive + (new Formula)  and I hope they continue to make the original. It truly works for me and I&#x27;m someone with very clear skin I owe to Proactive!</li>
            <li> Once my son started using it total satisfaction and great results, to the point that my niece is now useing it also with the same successful results.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping ! My husband uses it for years and the new product doesn&#x27;t work as good as this one.</li>
            <li> Helps my granddaughter</li>
            <li> Bought for my almost 15 year old daughter. She is SO much happier with clearer skin now! This product REALLY works as long as the directions are followed and no other products are used. Highly recommend using this before any prescription!</li>
            <li> Not effective for every1. didnt work for me, still tried it though after my dermatologist warned me  that it may not be effective. The prescription meds that worked for me beautifully.😊☺</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work and ruined my bed-sheets and t-shirts.</li>
            <li> Never works for my skim</li>
            <li> Summary: This product is very effective and has worked the best for me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personal Experience: I&#x27;ve used proactive for around a year now and seemed like it just neutralized and did not get rid of acne. I used it off and on but was never consistent. Finally after failure of all other acne treatment options I go back to proactive and do the steps 2 times a day if not more and within a week all acne is either not noticeable or completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips&lt;br /&gt;- Use sunscreen if in the sun after treatment&lt;br /&gt;- use atleast twice a day to get rid of acne at a faster rate</li>
            <li> I think this original formula works much better than the new formula. I have been using it for 8+ years with great results. Once in a blue moon I still may get a pimple, but my skin is clear with no blemishes. I stopped wearing base make up and powder years ago. I don&#x27;t think I need it. My skin looks that good.</li>
            <li> Really work From the first time you feel it</li>
            <li> Good product and service</li>
            <li> So proactive worked miracles for me in the past!! Now that im an adult, 31, i recently started suffering from adult acne on my chin the worst!! So i decided to buy proactive and have been using it for 3 weeks now....my chin actually got worse but the rest of my face looked fabulous and my nose pores almost unnoticeable!! Im using protege x-zit, also in amazon, on my chin and in 3 days im almost acne free!! Anywho, proactive is great, just not clearing my chin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 57 with very oily skin... it&#x27;s true that oily skin ages slower !  And PROACTIV keeps the oily skin under control... Don&#x27;t hesitate buying these products.  They work !  I use the Daily Wash, #1the Renewing Cleanser. And the Mask.  Buy with confidence... you will also join the faithful users of PROACTIV.</li>
            <li> Got it 3 days ago and the pimples that were on my face has started to disappear as well as old scars. Used it in conjunction with my clarisonic Mia brush....can&#x27;t wait to see my face within a couple of weeks</li>
            <li> Always the best. It works.</li>
            <li> Works better than any other product to clear skin</li>
            <li> The best product on the market! Cleared up my stubborn, cystic acne within a week!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this product for years now and it really goes well with my skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that really gets rid of pimples and keeps them away.</li>
            <li> It really worked for me!&lt;br /&gt;i had really bad acne and I tried everything until I bumped into this...it really saved my life. Defenitely give it a try.</li>
            <li> My wife hates it! Her face was better before she started using it. She has what looked like a red blotchy area on her face and the face never cleared or cleaned up. It was a waste of money and I DO NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE</li>
            <li> I have buy this products for my causing in Mexico, she has use them for years and she loves them.!!</li>
            <li> Our daughter swears by Proactiv, and purchasing on Amazon saves money as you only need to order what you need, when you need it. I personally don&#x27;t see any difference with her skin over products like Clearasil.</li>
