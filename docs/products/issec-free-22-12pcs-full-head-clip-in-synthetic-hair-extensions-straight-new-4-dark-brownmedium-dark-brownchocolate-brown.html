            <li>I got them today, and I&#x27;m actually very happy with them, they did shed but not a lot</li>
            <li>So in all they are perfect for the price and being synthetic.</li>
            <li>Blended it  in with my hair, fits perfect.</li>
            <li>PERFECT.</li>
            <li>Matched my hair color perfectly.</li>
            <li>they look so good!!</li>
            <li>If you are looking extensions for one or 2 nights for a party, these are perfect.</li>
            <li>This gets incredibly tangled, even when wearing.</li>
            <li>These are great.</li>
            <li>These were great for a one time use.</li>
            <li>Very cheap price for very good quality.</li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>These are good for maybe 3 or 4 uses max.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy my dog got a hold of it and put it to better use</li>
            <li>Over all they&#x27;re good, I&#x27;m kind of scared to apply heat to them though.</li>
            <li>They are more suitable for use.</li>
            <li>:) I don&#x27;t have any complaints on this one just yet, but give me some time</li>
            <li>One satisfied customer</li>
            <li>THEY ARE OK</li>
            <li>I love wearing these.</li>
            <li>Good for the price, texture didn&#x27;t feel like real hair.</li>
            <li>Easy to put in, color matched perfectly, hair did no shed for me as did for a previous customer.  </li>
            <li>Works just fine.</li>
            <li>But the color was a perfect fit to my dark brown, and I was happy I could curl them with just a regular curling iron.</li>
            <li>These are cheap, the hair falls out and you cannot curl them.  </li>
            <li>My girlfriend bought this because she loved her old hair extensions.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really hoping I don&#x27;t :) TY.</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>And the ends get super frizzy quite quickly.</li>
            <li>A better option for more use would be human hair extensions.</li>
            <li>Synthetic hair just isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I did however shape into a perfect, full messy bun for a quick updo, for the price it exceeded expectation but dig a lil&#x27; deeper in them pockets and go with human hair.</li>
            <li>Would only be able to use a handful of times, i.e special occastions, etc.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>definitleyy buying more in a different color(:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t like them at all</li>
            <li>I got the medium brown at 22 inch and the color was pretty and was a close match</li>
            <li>This actually helped making them more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; looking.</li>
            <li>Pretty decent for the price.</li>
            <li>The tangling is VERY high maintenance</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t have very high hopes to begin with.</li>
            <li>I am very displeased with this product.</li>
            <li>Will order another very soon.</li>
            <li>I only gotten 8 and a free pc that should have made it 13</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve used them a few times and they are holding up nicely.</li>
            <li>I toss after 6 months and get a new set,</li>
            <li>If you are a first time user just trying to find out if you like the way all the clips feel on your head before paying the big bucks</li>
            <li>Mostly because these are not for repetitive use.</li>
            <li>Although I find that a lot of other extensions priced from $20-$50 will still have some synthetic hair mixed in, its easy to manage and they can be worn for months.</li>
            <li>Received it a day early so that was a plus.</li>
            <li>The only down side is that they don&#x27;t seem to be easy to store.</li>
            <li>I definitley recommend these to everyone that wants long hair!</li>
            <li>Thick and full hair!</li>
            <li>I THINK THAT THEY GET TANGLED TO MUCH BUT OTHER THAN THAT</li>
            <li>They feel very thick and heavy in my hair which is good.</li>
            <li>They are so long and silky soft.</li>

            <li> They feel very thick and heavy in my hair which is good.</li>
            <li> They are so long and silky soft.</li>
            <li> these are very thin and cheap!  </li>
            <li> WOW what a waste of money, i bought this for my girl</li>
            <li> The only things is that its a little rubbery obviously its synthetic.</li>
            <li> I wash and dry them.</li>
            <li> I brush them with a wig comb and use dry shampoo in between washes.</li>
            <li> Initially, my hair went barely to my shoulders - and now its past my belly</li>
            <li> Recently dyed my hair black...and dyed these black to match.</li>
            <li> Hair is pretty thick and heavy which I like.</li>
            <li> and i hated the fact that she had to iron it and spray some stuff to keep it smooth and straight.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have time or patience to carefully detangle.</li>
            <li> Total waste of my money.</li>
            <li> This product did not hold up well after only a few uses.  </li>
            <li> They were a little too long, so I trimmed them.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t kink up or act like other synthetic hair extensions that I have seen.</li>
            <li> Thin so if you have short hair ( above the solder.)</li>
            <li> Would not recommend except for wearing a few times.</li>
            <li> I found by the end of the night they were extremely tangled up and after that they were hard to get straightened again.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find the flaws that others have, they are a little thin and where my hair is thicker I might have a problem, but I think I can make it work.</li>
            <li> They were very tangled,  and very bad quality .</li>
            <li> It is soooo thin AND its shedding everywhere.</li>
            <li> BUT it was just too thin and no matter</li>
            <li> Very poor quality.  </li>
            <li> as I tried to used them the tangled and was very difficult to untangle</li>
            <li> They do shed, but not the worst I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the worst part.</li>

            <li> They were very tangled,  and very bad quality .</li>
            <li> these are very thin and cheap!  as I tried to used them the tangled and was very difficult to untangle</li>
            <li> I got them today, and I&#x27;m actually very happy with them, they did shed but not a lot, I haven&#x27;t tried to style them yet or put them in. I will admit I was nervous as I didn&#x27;t read the comments before I ordered, but I have found that as others have had issues and those are what I was looking for I didn&#x27;t find the flaws that others have, they are a little thin and where my hair is thicker I might have a problem, but I think I can make it work. :) I don&#x27;t have any complaints on this one just yet, but give me some time and maybe I might. I&#x27;m really hoping I don&#x27;t :) TY.</li>
            <li> WOW what a waste of money, i bought this for my girl and i hated the fact that she had to iron it and spray some stuff to keep it smooth and straight. I&#x27;m happy my dog got a hold of it and put it to better use</li>
            <li> My girlfriend bought this because she loved her old hair extensions. These are great. They provide length and fullness without being too noticeable. They don&#x27;t kink up or act like other synthetic hair extensions that I have seen. The only down side is that they don&#x27;t seem to be easy to store.</li>
            <li> I definitley recommend these to everyone that wants long hair! Initially, my hair went barely to my shoulders - and now its past my belly button!&lt;br /&gt;Yes, they do tangle here and there, but if you actually take care of them, they will last!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitleyy buying more in a different color(:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- One satisfied customer</li>
            <li> I THINK THAT THEY GET TANGLED TO MUCH BUT OTHER THAN THAT THEY ARE OK</li>
            <li> These were great for a one time use. They are so long and silky soft. I found by the end of the night they were extremely tangled up and after that they were hard to get straightened again. Synthetic hair just isn&#x27;t worth it. Although I find that a lot of other extensions priced from $20-$50 will still have some synthetic hair mixed in, its easy to manage and they can be worn for months. Spend the extra money and get human hair!</li>
            <li> Received it a day early so that was a plus. Hair is pretty thick and heavy which I like. The only things is that its a little rubbery obviously its synthetic. Pretty decent for the price. Not bad.</li>
            <li> This gets incredibly tangled, even when wearing. I don&#x27;t like to put products in my extensions, as a leave in conditioner changes the appearance and texture. I am not a fan of these. I did however shape into a perfect, full messy bun for a quick updo, for the price it exceeded expectation but dig a lil&#x27; deeper in them pockets and go with human hair. My opinion. The tangling is VERY high maintenance and I don&#x27;t have time or patience to carefully detangle.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my sister. She loves em. Works just fine. She uses them just about every day. Good product</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t like them at all but I didn&#x27;t have very high hopes to begin with. Thin so if you have short hair ( above the solder.) Like I do, I&#x27;d suggest getting two packs. But the color was a perfect fit to my dark brown, and I was happy I could curl them with just a regular curling iron. They do shed, but not the worst I&#x27;ve ever seen. I don&#x27;t think they are intended for every day use. But I&#x27;ve used them a few times and they are holding up nicely. So in all they are perfect for the price and being synthetic. If you are a first time user just trying to find out if you like the way all the clips feel on your head before paying the big bucks it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality.  These are cheap, the hair falls out and you cannot curl them.  Waist of money...</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for</li>
            <li> Good for the price, texture didn&#x27;t feel like real hair. They feel very thick and heavy in my hair which is good. They shed a ton though. I recommend not brushing them a lot. Over all they&#x27;re good, I&#x27;m kind of scared to apply heat to them though.</li>
            <li> I am very displeased with this product. It is soooo thin AND its shedding everywhere. Total waste of my money. I got the medium brown at 22 inch and the color was pretty and was a close match BUT it was just too thin and no matter what i did it looked like a rat tail. Will definitely not be buying from again.</li>
            <li> They were a little too long, so I trimmed them. This actually helped making them more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; looking. Blended it  in with my hair, fits perfect. Still have them after several months. I wash and dry them. I brush them with a wig comb and use dry shampoo in between washes. Recently dyed my hair black...and dyed these black to match. PERFECT. Will order another very soon. I toss after 6 months and get a new set,</li>
            <li> It said I should get 12pc. I only gotten 8 and a free pc that should have made it 13 right that&#x27;s not what I have</li>
            <li> Thick and full hair! Very cheap price for very good quality.</li>
            <li> Matched my hair color perfectly. they look so good!! only problem is that the hair attached to the clips calls out a lot.</li>
            <li> Easy to put in, color matched perfectly, hair did no shed for me as did for a previous customer.  Would only be able to use a handful of times, i.e special occastions, etc. but for the price this works.</li>
            <li> This product did not hold up well after only a few uses.  Would not recommend except for wearing a few times.</li>
            <li> Rated these 2 stars. Mostly because these are not for repetitive use. These are good for maybe 3 or 4 uses max. They shed tons. And the ends get super frizzy quite quickly. If you are looking extensions for one or 2 nights for a party, these are perfect. A better option for more use would be human hair extensions. They are more suitable for use.</li>
            <li> These break off your hair</li>
            <li> I love wearing these. They blend so well with my hair! They get SO tangled though. That&#x27;s the worst part.</li>
