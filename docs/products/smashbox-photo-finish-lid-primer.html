    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years and it works perfectly</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>I was very impressed and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>:-D</li>
            <li>Best primer for the eyelids.  </li>
            <li>This site has the best price.</li>
            <li>its a very good primer &amp; I will continue to use it!!!</li>
            <li>So if you just need to throw on one color like on the lower lid, would probably be perfect.</li>
            <li>Makes my eyes look very bright just with mascara and no shadow.</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>Thought I would try this one, so happy I did .</li>
            <li>One of the best eyelid primers I&#x27;ve found and I&#x27;ve tried many.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful, easy to apply product.</li>
            <li>Good staying primer.</li>
            <li>always love smashbox products because they look and feel great</li>
            <li>I bought this because I liked a sample I received, and I didn&#x27;t realize until I forgot to wear it one day how good it is.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>My eye shadow has never looked better!</li>
            <li>Put it on before your eye shadow and no matter what kind of eye shadow you buy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice orange toned kind of primer.</li>
            <li>and honestly none of them can keep my shadows from sliding off my lids after 6-8 hours of wear.  </li>
            <li>Great transaction and arrived quickly and as promised.</li>
            <li>Too Faced offer much better ones.</li>
            <li>Although it is billed as a primer, those who do not use foundation will still be able to take advantage of it&#x27;s smoothing ability.</li>
            <li>The eye shadow lay nicely on top of it and it lasted all day.</li>
            <li>My shadows have been staying on soooo much better.</li>
            <li>Love anything made by Smashbox.</li>
            <li>this was definitely my favorite thing out of the box.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it three days in a row now, and I am in love.</li>
            <li>Even better than what Avon sells.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m okay with that.  </li>
            <li>and they blend better over this primer.  </li>
            <li>ok &amp;#34; .</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>does, however, look lovely if you are wearing NO shadow.  </li>
            <li>Makes you eyeshadow look better and stay on longer.</li>
            <li>The primer itself has a nice consistency and blends quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply</li>
            <li>Looks natural so you can wear it alone, or put shadow on and it stays nice all day!</li>
            <li>Hands down this is the best lid primer out there.</li>
            <li>Hands down, best eye lid primer</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite!</li>
            <li>This product is light weight and easily glides on to a smooth finish.  </li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel as smooth as glass.</li>
            <li>Works great and is way cheaper than Urban Decay</li>
            <li>This primer is perfect for everyday wear under eyeshadows of all types.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a necessity, in my opinion, and highly overpriced but a nice bonus to have around.</li>
            <li>so I was SUPER excited to try this.</li>
            <li>I have very oily lids and have tried many a \\&quot;primer\\&quot; product</li>
            <li>Thanks Smashbox, I love it.</li>
            <li>In the hot weather but seems to work fine if the temp is below 80 Â°.</li>
            <li>It nicely covers all veins and such on my lids and leaves a smooth canvas for eyeshadow application.  </li>
            <li>no matter what lighting any person is in, I really smashbox makeup products are very cool</li>
            <li>Really good for making shadow pop in color &amp; lasts all day long.</li>
            <li>My new favorite</li>
            <li>I actually just like wearing this without any eye color on top!</li>
            <li>I usually out powder to set it, and then I&#x27;m good for the day!</li>
            <li>Makes my eye shadow look fresh all day.</li>
            <li>The Smashbox eyeshadow primer is okay, but Urban Decay and</li>
            <li>Of course, I had doubts that it would not last through out the day, or crease like so many others do, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Wich I guess is exactly what its suppose to do.  </li>
            <li>Again, it doesn&#x27;t really make them last longer on the lids, but it does help them cling better, show truer color</li>
            <li>It really helps shadow stay on longer.</li>
            <li>and i am a very porcelain doll color.</li>
            <li>But if you are doing any &#x27;crease work&#x27; that would need blending, maybe not so much.  </li>
            <li>I had to end up using my fingers to blend and ended up pulling on my eye lid too much for my liking.  </li>
            <li>This eyelid primer really makes your eye pop.</li>
            <li>Seems to hold my eye shadow and liner on for a much longer period then having no primer on.</li>
            <li>I bought this thinking it would be a tad better than my other eyelid primer, &amp;#34;Put</li>
            <li>I received mine as a gift included in a kit and think it is highly overpriced.  </li>
            <li>This primer is a little more lightweight than I need</li>
            <li>So kind of sucks.</li>
            <li>I use MAC&#x27;s cream eye shadow as a base and that works best for me although maybe my skin is just too oily to ever find a real solution.</li>
            <li>My makeup does last longer when I use this than it would without a primer, but I think other eye primers work even better.</li>
            <li>As a professional makeup artist,I&#x27;ve tried a ton of primers.</li>
            <li>It is a tougher consistency, so it does feel pretty dry, but it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>My eye shawdow actually creased much more prematurely than usual.</li>
            <li>I have pale skin, and it&#x27;s always hard to get eyeshadow to show up well on my eyes, but with this, IT&amp;#34;S AMAZING!</li>
            <li>You will have to constantly buy a new  one, therefore overpriced in my opinion.</li>
            <li>The primer first came out a little thick, but I smoothed it with my finger for a more even result.</li>

            <li> I was having trouble keeping my eye shadow on throughout the day, especially because I have deep set eyes.</li>
            <li> In the future I learned that a little goes a long way and you do not need to apply a lot of it.</li>
            <li> Darker than i expected</li>
            <li> As expected of Smashbox.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to look for a drugstore substitute when this tube is empty because it has spoiled me a bit.</li>
            <li> This primer is thicker than the other two brands, which means it takes longer to blend.</li>
            <li> It is not too thick or thin, just the right amount of coverage.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time actually applying eye shadow.  </li>
            <li> Urban Decay is too thin and watery.</li>
            <li> This makes the eyelid a very, sort of &#x27;dry, matte&#x27; base for shadow.</li>
            <li> Very little in the tube.</li>
            <li> and you just need a small amount.  </li>
            <li> Works so well that it&#x27;s hard to get the makeup off--which I would prefer.</li>
            <li> Hard to blend, but does seem to help some to prevent smears.</li>
            <li> So it was hard to blend anything with my brushes.  </li>
            <li> Just wish it was less expensive.</li>
            <li> Makes blending eyeshadow a little difficult.</li>
            <li> : Very thick.</li>
            <li> I only wanted this for one thing, and since my eyeshadow still creased and melted, it was a completely worthless purchase.</li>
            <li> Maybe the other two reviewers got a bad batch, but it works like a charm for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not usually easily so impressed, but with this product, I am.</li>
            <li> Very expensive.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and it works perfectly</li>

            <li> I have oily skin so I was SUPER excited to try this. Based on the reviewes your eye shadows should last all day and for me this did not work at all. My eye shawdow actually creased much more prematurely than usual. I use MAC&#x27;s cream eye shadow as a base and that works best for me although maybe my skin is just too oily to ever find a real solution.</li>
            <li> I wear smash mouth lid primer just about every day.  Put it on before your eye shadow and no matter what kind of eye shadow you buy it will not crease, smear or rub off.  Easy to apply and you just need a small amount.  Hands down this is the best lid primer out there.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Looks natural so you can wear it alone, or put shadow on and it stays nice all day! Just wish it was less expensive.</li>
            <li> The Smashbox eyeshadow primer is okay, but Urban Decay and Too Faced offer much better ones. This primer is thicker than the other two brands, which means it takes longer to blend. My makeup does last longer when I use this than it would without a primer, but I think other eye primers work even better. I do not recommend this.</li>
            <li> As a professional makeup artist,I&#x27;ve tried a ton of primers. MAC&#x27;s primer goes on like cement and does NOT blend at all. Urban Decay is too thin and watery. Smashbox Photo Finish Eye primer is the only one that actually works for me. Works so well that it&#x27;s hard to get the makeup off--which I would prefer. No creasing, no oily eyelids. Maybe the other two reviewers got a bad batch, but it works like a charm for me.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. It makes your skin feel as smooth as glass. Although it is billed as a primer, those who do not use foundation will still be able to take advantage of it&#x27;s smoothing ability.</li>
            <li> Hands down, best eye lid primer I have tried. I was having trouble keeping my eye shadow on throughout the day, especially because I have deep set eyes. The primer first came out a little thick, but I smoothed it with my finger for a more even result. In the future I learned that a little goes a long way and you do not need to apply a lot of it. The eye shadow lay nicely on top of it and it lasted all day. I was very impressed and would recommend it to anyone. You can also purchase a smaller, sample version of it in a Smashbox sampler.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would be a tad better than my other eyelid primer, &amp;#34;Put a lid on it&amp;#34;.  Unfortunately, it does not last more than half a day. I tried lighter applications, double applications, but nothing seems to help.</li>
            <li> I am a middle 50&#x27;s woman with hotflashes.I have been using this product awhile now. My shadows have been staying on soooo much better.I At the end of the day there is still some left on my lids.</li>
            <li> I only wanted this for one thing, and since my eyeshadow still creased and melted, it was a completely worthless purchase.</li>
            <li> always love smashbox products because they look and feel great no matter what lighting any person is in, I really smashbox makeup products are very cool</li>
            <li> This primer is a little more lightweight than I need In the hot weather but seems to work fine if the temp is below 80 Â°.</li>
            <li> Darker than i expected and i am a very porcelain doll color. So kind of sucks. But adds definition to my eyelids if i just don&#x27;t feel like putting on eyeshadow. It&#x27;s a nice orange toned kind of primer. But for the price? I would expect the color to be what it says it is.</li>
            <li> Works great.Eyeshadow stays on longer. Evens out skin tone.</li>
            <li> This product is light weight and easily glides on to a smooth finish.  Never cakey.  After applying this lid primer, my shadow stays all day long!</li>
            <li> Love anything made by Smashbox. Enough said. :-D</li>
            <li> I ordered that Smashbox Trial kit, with the mascara, face primer, eyeliner...etc...this was definitely my favorite thing out of the box. I have pale skin, and it&#x27;s always hard to get eyeshadow to show up well on my eyes, but with this, IT&amp;#34;S AMAZING! Of course, I had doubts that it would not last through out the day, or crease like so many others do, but it didn&#x27;t. Hasn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve used it three days in a row now, and I am in love. I&#x27;m not usually easily so impressed, but with this product, I am.</li>
            <li> Hard to blend, but does seem to help some to prevent smears.</li>
            <li> Best primer for the eyelids.  Even better than what Avon sells.  My eye makeup stays in place all day when using this product.  This site has the best price.</li>
            <li> Good staying primer. As expected of Smashbox.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before its the only shadow primer that holds my eye shadow where I put it And not all of the creasing problems either.</li>
            <li> Works great and is way cheaper than Urban Decay</li>
            <li> Makes my eye shadow look fresh all day. It&#x27;s a wonderful, easy to apply product.</li>
            <li> I received mine as a gift included in a kit and think it is highly overpriced.  I have very oily lids and have tried many a \\&quot;primer\\&quot; product and honestly none of them can keep my shadows from sliding off my lids after 6-8 hours of wear.  I&#x27;ve been told that those with oily skin take longer to show their age and wrinkles so if that&#x27;s the price to pay I&#x27;m okay with that.  So, what does this \\&quot;primer\\&quot; do for me?  It nicely covers all veins and such on my lids and leaves a smooth canvas for eyeshadow application.  Again, it doesn&#x27;t really make them last longer on the lids, but it does help them cling better, show truer color and they blend better over this primer.  The primer itself has a nice consistency and blends quickly and easily.  It&#x27;s not a necessity, in my opinion, and highly overpriced but a nice bonus to have around. I&#x27;m going to look for a drugstore substitute when this tube is empty because it has spoiled me a bit.</li>
            <li> Really good for making shadow pop in color &amp; lasts all day long. I would have given 5 stars I took away one for blendability, its a very good primer &amp; I will continue to use it!!!</li>
            <li> I has gotten a different Primer from Smashbox that was just &amp;#34; ok &amp;#34; . Thought I would try this one, so happy I did . Makes your shadows pop. My new favorite</li>
            <li> One of the best eyelid primers I&#x27;ve found and I&#x27;ve tried many.  Will continue to buy this.  Great transaction and arrived quickly and as promised.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Helps my eyeshadow stay on longer.</li>
            <li> This primer is perfect for everyday wear under eyeshadows of all types. It is not too thick or thin, just the right amount of coverage. It helps even out the tone of my eyelids and makes my eyeshadow and liner last longer and stay in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I had a hard time actually applying eye shadow.  This makes the eyelid a very, sort of &#x27;dry, matte&#x27; base for shadow. Wich I guess is exactly what its suppose to do.  But the color will stay wherever you put it. So it was hard to blend anything with my brushes.  So if you just need to throw on one color like on the lower lid, would probably be perfect. But if you are doing any &#x27;crease work&#x27; that would need blending, maybe not so much.  I had to end up using my fingers to blend and ended up pulling on my eye lid too much for my liking.  So it definitely keeps shadow put?&lt;br /&gt;It does, however, look lovely if you are wearing NO shadow.  Hides any darker spots.  Makes my eyes look very bright just with mascara and no shadow.</li>
            <li> This eyelid primer really makes your eye pop. I actually just like wearing this without any eye color on top! I usually out powder to set it, and then I&#x27;m good for the day!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27; even know eyelid primer even existed. I was watching some make up video&#x27;s on You Tube and thought I would try it. Makes you eyeshadow look better and stay on longer. Thanks Smashbox, I love it.</li>
            <li> Seems to hold my eye shadow and liner on for a much longer period then having no primer on. would recommend.</li>
            <li> Pros: it covers darker spots on the eyes and does help make eyeshadow pop and stay on longer.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Very thick. Very expensive. Makes blending eyeshadow a little difficult.</li>
            <li> My eye shadow has never looked better!</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite! Keeps the crease out of my eye shadow at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Very little in the tube. You will have to constantly buy a new  one, therefore overpriced in my opinion.</li>
