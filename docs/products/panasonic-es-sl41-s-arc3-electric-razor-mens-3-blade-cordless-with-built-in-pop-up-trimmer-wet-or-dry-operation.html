            <li>This is really an excellent razor.</li>

            <li>i rate this razor at best average.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>Was hands-down the best razor I have owned.</li>
            <li>They have the best mens shavers out there.  </li>
            <li>It works perfect in or out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>On the plus side, the cleaning of the waterproof chamber works flawlessly, and you won&#x27;t find shaving debris under the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got the ES-SL41-S, but I think my dislike applies to all Panasonic after using this as best</li>
            <li>He has been very happy with it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s feel in the hand and against the skin is excellent.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t impressed with this device at all.</li>
            <li>Perfect.</li>
            <li>I seem to like the Panasonic models the best.  </li>
            <li>and it was time to replace the blades when I received an opportunity to get this razor through the Vine program - perfect timing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But the best thing is the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s usable but not the best design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean-up is a breeze.</li>
            <li>best shaver for the money</li>
            <li>and  I&#x27;m glad that I bought it!!!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!!!</li>

            <li>The handle of the shaver has good ergonomics as it fits perfectly into my hand.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>Works great.  </li>

            <li>Great Product, Just like the description.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li>This is a great razor, it \\&quot;fits\\&quot; in my hand like it was meant to be there.</li>
            <li>It does a great job, but could be improved with interchangeable foils.</li>
            <li>so shaving in the shower is a must, and a electric shaver that can be used in the shower is a great idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>one great variable is durability.</li>
            <li>one great variable is durability.</li>
            <li>If your a happy Norelco user, I recommend you stick with them.  </li>
            <li>I get a great shave with or without cream or soap, and the battery life has been 12-15 shaves per charge.  </li>
            <li>Great for taking on vacation without needing the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it,very reliable and build quality is awesome as we!! !!</li>
            <li>it has a pleasant, low-noise hum.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This razor does a good job.</li>
            <li>I have one and loved it</li>
            <li>the rasor is so good</li>
            <li>I am stuck with the razor.shave hair not that good.</li>
            <li>Built quality like plastic,metal is good.</li>
            <li>Does a good job when you have gotten your skin used to it</li>
            <li>Anyone wanting a good shave should definately try this razor.</li>
            <li>but i think this is not so good for my expectations</li>
            <li>Good product for the price.</li>
            <li>It looks good.</li>
            <li>Not as good as a rotary razor.</li>
            <li>The stand is good, the attachments are useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was inexpensive and surprisingly gave me one of the closest and smoothest  shaves</li>
            <li>I tried it on about four days growth and it give me a good close shave.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for everyone who shaves their face and needs a good electric razor.</li>
            <li>Use it every day good results.</li>
            <li>I thought this product was a good purchase, but my son says the shave isn&#x27;t as close as he likes.</li>
            <li>For that, it works good.</li>
            <li>The battery lasts for a good period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good battery, well constructed.  </li>
            <li>These are all good things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good razor.</li>
            <li>Before purchasing the shavers I read the reviews on them and they have been as good as the review</li>
            <li>use the Nivea shaving cream, it doesn&#x27;t foam up, with warm water, and this works great.  </li>
            <li>In the shower or out good to go</li>
            <li>Clean up with the ports (a wonderful idea btw!)</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is also a sideburn trimmer on the top part of the razor that works great.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>and I was very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>AND I&#x27;M VERY GLAD</li>
            <li>I have bought them for myself, my wife and my boys - everyone is very pleased.  </li>
            <li>Nice shaver that does a good job for the price.</li>
            <li>received the product and after about a week of use, I must say I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>It is really easy to use and works great.  </li>
            <li>great for cost, light touch work</li>
            <li>Still an amazing razor.</li>
            <li>i liked it</li>
            <li>It has a nice sideburn trimmer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gives a good shave that I am hoping will get a bit better over time as I get used to the razor</li>
            <li>I would  have liked a charger with&lt;br /&gt;only</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost as good as a razor for closeness, and much more convenient.</li>
            <li>This is a nice razor.</li>
            <li>but when I got out of the shower, it felt like I had a nice, close shave.</li>
            <li>comes with a nice storage/recharging stand&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>It cleans up nice also.</li>
            <li>This is a nice touch on a shaver in this price</li>
            <li>I liked the price....</li>
            <li>The wet-dry part is also nice, this can be run under water for cleaning and can also be used in the shower (if you want to).</li>
            <li>My first experience with using and electric razor with shaving cream was very good.</li>
            <li>This shaver is very light and compact, with an innovative guard that allows it to travel in a fairly compact footprint.  </li>
            <li>Form factor and design also gets positive points - its a very handsome device with great build quality.</li>
            <li>but it works fine and cuts good.</li>
            <li>This shaver is good if  you have nothing important or formal to go to.</li>
            <li>This is a good razor that is comfortable to use and shaves well.</li>
            <li>Very happy with it so far</li>
            <li>My Braun shaver is heavier and goes in its own case that prevents it from fitting in my toiletry bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far, I have found that Panasonic and Braun seem to have found the best spot regarding the closeness of the shave without the resulting irritation.  </li>
            <li>This is a good razor for those comfortable with electric razors.  </li>
            <li>Works great and this charger works perfect with the beard trimmer just in case one charger goes down</li>
            <li>One Panasonic or another of this series are on fantastically good special pricing over the holidays typically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It worked great, and it&#x27;s the first electric razor that EVER worked on my neck.</li>
            <li>Also very light weight.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still very smooth.</li>
            <li>He liked the model and it works fine.</li>
            <li>This feels like a very solid shaver and may be one of the best in this price range for all I know.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no comparison to the blades and multi-pivoting heads of the better shavers and the smoothness of the 63.</li>
            <li>I love panasonic shavers,  I have tried every brand of shaver out there and panasonic beats them hands</li>
            <li>there are definitely better options...</li>
            <li>and I think you may be more satisfied.</li>
            <li>Better than Gillette, though, in some ways-</li>
            <li>I have used an electric many years ago and this one is much better in both the closeness of the shave and the clean-up.  </li>
            <li>so I leave it plugged into an outlet most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works okay for the price.</li>
            <li>Maybe it doesn&#x27;t have as many blades?</li>
            <li>I like the razer for the most part, bus</li>
            <li>I tried it out before my son went to college, and it was better than my more-expensive razor.</li>
            <li>but it price was ok.</li>
            <li>makes it even better.</li>
            <li>Faces have regions and this does better for ME in some regions than others.</li>
            <li>I have been extremely pleased with this razor.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed that my shavers have not been able to shave neck hairs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been told that it takes a month to get your face acclimated to the shaver, so maybe it&#x27;ll get better in 2 more weeks</li>
            <li>I love it ....</li>
            <li>is a keeper, &amp; is now my favorite shaver.</li>
            <li>Five stars to Panasonic for this great &amp; reasonably priced shaver.</li>
            <li>Here are some comparison points I think are interesting about this shaver:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love Panasonic products, mostly their TV&#x27;s and cordless phones, and I&#x27;m sure this shaver is reliable because Panasonic builds reliable products.  </li>
            <li>I love Panasonic products, mostly their TV&#x27;s and cordless phones, and I&#x27;m sure this shaver is reliable because Panasonic builds reliable products.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It works best for me when I use a soap-lathered mixture on my face, but still leaves a big difference from a blade on the neck and chin.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps those with a soft-haired beard would have better results,</li>
            <li>It works ok w/o the cream</li>
            <li>Well, it works ok.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for 30 years and have tried many brands.</li>
            <li>Panasonic has always been my favorite.</li>
            <li>This means it takes more time to cover ground.</li>
            <li>--I think it works better this way, but the Wet/Dry capability makes it easier to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My beard is like nails, and it has cowlicks (for want of a better term) on my neck.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve found the cut to be better, but still not as close as my disposable.  </li>
            <li>I am going to keep using it for awhile and see if I can learn how maneuver it better and a get a closer, easier shave.  </li>
            <li>I can never get close enough to the skin to get a perfect shave.</li>
            <li>We love Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>They love them and the mother&#x27;s love them too because they don&#x27;t have to remind them to shave.  </li>
            <li>and so it becomes a more labored shave.  </li>
            <li>and I was confident.  </li>
            <li>Still, I am overall VERY happy with the product.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for one - couldn&#x27;t recommend this one more.</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t spend any more on it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li>I have had many electric shavers over the years.  </li>
            <li>It is these two differences that I attribute to the better shave over all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>there better razors out there?</li>
            <li>Sure.</li>
            <li>but they also cost a LOT more than the Panasonic ES-Sl41-S.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll get a good shave at a economical price.</li>
            <li>I will probably give this away to Goodwill and find a better manufactured razor.</li>
            <li>but like a good girlfriend I got the right one</li>
            <li>I know I like a nice clean shave on him every day.</li>
            <li>The rinse to clean feature is a nice touch.  </li>
            <li>I have used this for about a week now and think that it is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>But, for the money, this is a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li>It always does a pretty good job.</li>
            <li>You probably don&#x27;t want to take the charger on a long trip with you but for at home it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>but it does a pretty good job.</li>
            <li>I found the Panasonic Milano Men&#x27;s Rechargeable shaver to be a pretty good and durable product.  </li>
            <li>As to the close shave, it does a pretty good job.</li>
            <li>MY husband needed a new one and this was a great price.  </li>
            <li>Being able to put it under the tap makes cleaning easy.  </li>
            <li>This allows water to flow more easily between the loops and prevents caking of cut hair from gumming up the works when you try to rinse it.  </li>
            <li>It is also easy to snap the top off and on to get rid of the whisker debris.er debris.</li>
            <li>who travel frequently and like to use a wet-dry shaver may not be happy with the Panasonic ES-SI41-S Milano shaver.  </li>
            <li>: This shaver works best in the shower or when wet.</li>
            <li>My old shaver, a Panasonic ES-SA40K, was great.  </li>
            <li>- I genuinely feel that this is a better product.  </li>
            <li>in all this is a comfortable razor to shave with though the trimmer could be better positioned.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s attractive as far as razors go.</li>
            <li>It would be great for either an adolescent or an adult.  </li>
            <li>I have never found an electric razor that does as good of job as a real razor, so I was not expecting that.  </li>
            <li>you are looking for a reasonably priced wet-dry shaver that is reliable and provides a good shave, you may want to give the \\&quot;Panasonic ES-SI41-S Shaver, Milano Rechargeable with Nanotech Blades, 3-Blade Arc, 3 Wet-Dry\\&quot; a try.</li>
            <li>my shaver, its easy to clean and does a real&lt;br /&gt;good job, leaving a nice and smooth shave, would be happier</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t quite have all the bells and whistles of it&#x27;s higher line Panasonic cousins, but it does sport a lower price, is easy to clean, and gives a darn good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On the other hand, it fits perfectly on my bathroom countertop, and my razor is always fully-charged.</li>
            <li>It is easy to handle and grip he said.</li>
            <li>The on and off button is on the inside of the handle and easy to access with my thumb.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and trims my sideburns</li>
            <li>Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>but the induction charger makes this easy.</li>
            <li>I switched to Panasonic shavers about 8 years ago because I get a lot of irritation and the blade design is easy on my skin.</li>
            <li>of my favorite things about the shaver is how easy it is to clean it.</li>
            <li>Eventhough I&#x27;ll probably never use it in the shower again, I like that you are able to use water to clean off the blades rather than having to take it apart to brush it off.  </li>
            <li>The horizontal foil and blades just don&#x27;t glide that easy.  </li>
            <li>Gives a close shave  and cleans easily.</li>
            <li>I had an older model wet/dry from Panasonic about 10 years ago, and I loved it.  </li>
            <li>So conventional blade is a best method to do shave.</li>
            <li>Having owned Norelco, Braun &amp; Remington razors - this by far is the most comfortable electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used and gives a shave almost as good as a blade.</li>
            <li>the price, this is a quality electric shaver that gets a pretty nice close shave given 5 - 10 minutes of your time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best hands down.</li>
            <li>it works fine, keeps</li>
            <li>but again just fine.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;shaver water works just fine.</li>
            <li>Panasonic ES-S141-S is a fine midlevel electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>, this is a fine shave for an electric razor.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t give you too many more specifics, but every time I ask him about it, he says he really likes it!  </li>
            <li>and it seems to work fine.</li>
            <li>It was everything I hoped for in a razor, easy to use, easy to clean, and no monstrous charger contraption taking up room on my bathroom counter-space.</li>
            <li>He wanted something easy to use, easy to clean, and gives a close shave.</li>
            <li>Ergonomic, light weight, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean and goes for almost a week without charging.</li>
            <li>Since ther is no cord I can shave out side and enjoy a cup of joe.</li>
            <li>switched to this style of razor from the three circular foils variety and much prefer this kind.</li>
            <li>this gives his a close shave and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Overall I am happy with the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleaning:  This is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>and I like the way it leaves my skin feeling smooth afterwards.  </li>
            <li>cheap not a bargain at any price.</li>
            <li>It seems to shave well and no skin abrasion on my light beard.&lt;br /&gt;Package didn&#x27;t come with instructions.  </li>
            <li>Spend more and get something useful.</li>
            <li>It is light weight and fits both your hand and the curves of York face.</li>
            <li>But with this shaver&lt;br /&gt;he can use it in the shower with shower gel on his face and get a smooth, close shave without any irratation.</li>
            <li>it was cheap and could also use shaving cream but with this&lt;</li>
            <li>All these things allow water to flow through the shave head easily and clean out the clippings.</li>
            <li>The last shaver worked great</li>
            <li>This shaver being 100% foil only, greatly reduces irritation.</li>
            <li>The shape of it makes it comfortable to hold</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and to clean.</li>
            <li>I was hoping it would be my primary shaver</li>
            <li>and this gives a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Using the ES-SL41-S Arc 3 does not provide a smooth shave</li>
            <li>Panasonic&#x27;s water shutter technology lets water flow freely through the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, the Panasonic ES-SL41-S \\&quot;Milano\\</li>
            <li>And I have always wanted to be free of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I like the plastic cover, which is great for travel as it is solid, keeps the shaver from turning on, and also acts as a shaver stand.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>My beard is very fine when it first comes in</li>
            <li>Very nice works better in shower or wet</li>
            <li>the razor is okay, but the chugging cradle is very large.......</li>
            <li>It does not need water but it is great that it is so simple to clean.</li>
            <li>for maintenance and quick shaving, this thing does just fine.</li>
            <li>shutters are an interesting addition and seem to work pretty well.</li>
            <li>First time that I buy an electric razor and I have to say that after you get use to you will love it.</li>
            <li>think the charging stand and carrying holder are pluses and unique in its style.</li>
            <li>First, I must confess that I&#x27;ve been a blade shaver for most of my life, but I&#x27;m always looking for an electric substitute.</li>
            <li>so it was not giving a clean shave at all.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get  clean cut.</li>
            <li>Works great dry shaving.</li>
            <li>Forgets to plug in or clean his shaver.</li>
            <li>This model is easier to clean.  </li>
            <li>clean up&lt;br</li>
            <li>I experienced some skin irritation from shaving dry with this razor.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re all set to go again with a clean system!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Frequent travelers will appreciate that there&#x27;s no need to disassemble the shaver to clean it.</li>
            <li>makes clean up</li>
            <li>I had to \\&quot;do clean up\\&quot; with a disposable every day I used it.</li>
            <li>On the Pro side - it cleans easily, holds a charge for at least 8 shaves or more, and looks great.  </li>
            <li>It works specially well in the shower and the battery lasts about a week.</li>
            <li>like it, but works only with battery,not  with the electric cord,like the one I had before,but is good</li>
            <li>I use to have a Philips Shaver and that was much cheaper and better than this one</li>
            <li>In fact, it describes the &#x27;convenient carrying holder for storage or travel use&#x27; that is obviously good only if you travel within the U.S.  </li>
            <li>Noisy sound during the operation bothered me, but it is worth for the money.</li>
            <li>As others have said, had to go over and over the same area, still without a good result.  </li>
            <li>It is ergonomic enough for good visibility while shaving.  </li>
            <li>I even once bought a $250 Braun, but found that while it gave me a fairly close shave, it just couldn&#x27;t equal a blade.</li>
            <li>After giving it a full charge (took about 12 hours)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good back up razor</li>
            <li>/&gt;The shaver takes a while to charge (15 hours to reach full charge).</li>
            <li>maybe is not a bad razor</li>
            <li>but no where near as good as the higher end</li>
            <li>new Milano shaver addresses the first two points competently and convincingly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, nothing special about its proformance, cutz decent, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>(I charged it for about 5-6 hrs and have now used it for more than a week without a recharge), and it&#x27;s light, quiet, and easy to handle which shaving.  </li>
            <li>The product has a beautiful design, long battery holds and fast charging,</li>
            <li>it shaves quick clean n easy &amp; provides a VERY close shave without irritation.</li>
            <li>Quite lucky to get them on clearance</li>
            <li>Much closer shave, no issues with clogging and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>One reason is that I can grip the razor like an oversized pen when shaving the back of my mostly bald noggin; It&#x27;s faster and more efficient that way.</li>
            <li>Panasonic&#x27;s Men&#x27;s Wet/Dry Electric Cordless Shaver is second only to soap for the best pairing under running water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased this item as a gift for my husband hoping it would be the right one to help with the irritation and still give him a clean shave.</li>
            <li>First thing he said was that it gave a comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>First off let me say that I use this as a body shaver primarily.</li>
            <li>But more than any other razor I&#x27;ve tried over the years gives me the most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>It is better than the model it replaced which was almost 2x the price; not bad for a handy little wet/dry</li>
            <li>The head isn&#x27;t super easy to take off so it might be so they can secure the blades better than with previous models that quickly pop off foils of the past.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Time to shave and this makes it quick and easy for new shaver.  </li>
            <li>Very close comfortable shave and the price cannot be beat.  </li>
            <li>Light and very close shave for an electric</li>
            <li>told me that, since I have a fairly sensitive skin, electric shaving would be much better, quicker and softer.</li>
            <li>so I got my monies worth.  </li>
            <li>You should be able to skip a day and still have the shaver be able to cut through the stubble with minimal effort.  </li>
            <li>You should be able to skip a day and still have the shaver be able to cut through the stubble with minimal effort.  </li>
            <li>The nice thing about using a wet/dry electric shaver in the shower is that you can use your regular soap or gel</li>
            <li>The only problem so far is that we can&#x27;t figure out where the hairs went, lol.</li>
            <li>It was pretty cool looking</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I think the product is worth buying.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth making the switch.</li>
            <li>I liked the shape, sort of imitating the shape of a standard razor.</li>
            <li>I own several electric shavers that cost $200-$300 dollars that do not shave as&lt;br /&gt;well</li>
            <li>The relative compact sizing of the Milano suits it well for travel purposes and a handy plastic cover for the blade heads are provided to keep them intact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this because one of the reviews said that it shaves just as well and quick as Panasonic&#x27;s higher end Arc 4 shavers, it does not.</li>
            <li>It takes about twice as long to get a good shave with this compared to the ES8243A and especially the ES-LA63, which is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Right now it takes me three times before I feel like face</li>
            <li>this guy right here makes it 10x easier.  </li>
            <li>It gives you a blade-like shave right while you are taking your shower.</li>
            <li>It just feels right.</li>
            <li>Right off the bat</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s much lighter than any other model I&#x27;ve had and the charger is a very nice touch.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Panasonic wet-dry: These are fantastic razors for comfort, close shaves, and decently cleanable.</li>
            <li>The stand is also very minimalist and relatively easy to tip over, but it certainly does the job</li>
            <li>The stand is also very minimalist and relatively easy to tip over, but it certainly does the job</li>
            <li>I thought it was pretty cool at first, and I liked its versatility, but before long I was using it exclusively as a beard trimmer</li>
            <li>I was very hopeful that the new Milano shaver would ber even better.  </li>
            <li>and this is by far the best shave I have had in a long time without major irritation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for over a month and while it is good for keeping the scruff factor down, I still have to use a straight razor to clean up after the electric razor.</li>
            <li>Excellent razor for both wet and dry shaving.  </li>
            <li>As another reviewer mentioned it is not the most efficient razor and the cost of ownership makes purchasing razors of the most expensive kind inexpensive in comparison.</li>
            <li>Wish I could give it 4.5 stars, because those two issues don&#x27;t really warrant a full star off.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t comment as to whether these missing features may be worth more money to you, but to me, this shaver gives me a clean comfortable shave, and feels well-made.</li>

            <li>I feel the previous reviews that suggested this was a good value were right.  </li>
            <li>to clean easy to use!&lt;br /&gt;the only reason i didn&#x27;t give 5 starts is because of the trim blade the edges are rugged and doesn&#x27;t trim well but who cares!</li>
            <li>So far so good but time will be the ultimate test.</li>
            <li>At last, a smooth, comfortable shave from an electric.</li>
            <li>He prefers to use it dry and it gives him a nice close shave with no skin irritation or pulling.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is an excellent razor for everyday use or just for the occasional trim.</li>
            <li>This model is easy to hold and control, simple to clean and provides the quality shave touted by manufactures of $300 models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rating:</li>
            <li>Gets nice and close, very fast and love the option to use gel when im not running late</li>
            <li>The Milano shaves me about as cleanly as a Fusion five blade, high praise indeed.</li>
            <li>, I found the battery to be VERY VERY long-lasting</li>
            <li>The shave itself is fine if a tad bit slower than my old rotary.</li>
            <li>He was pretty excited about it since he hates shaving, but after a few days he wasn&#x27;t so thrilled.  </li>
            <li>If I were to buy again, I would purchase this razor before spending a lot more to learn what might be better with a more expensive razor.</li>
            <li>I called customer service with a question about how long to charge the razor and when the charge indicator light was supposed to light.</li>
            <li>stand-up carrying holder is the only way to charge the razor, yet it more than doubles the size of the razor if you are traveling with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>first time he used it he must have told me 20 times that day how close it shaved him - that he hadn&#x27;t had a shave that close in years</li>
            <li>Wish I could give it 4.5 stars, because those two issues don&#x27;t really warrant a full star off.n your trip, you have to bring the whole stand.  </li>
            <li>Works exactly as promised.</li>
            <li>First off...amazing.  </li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>It lacks all the bells and whistles of the higher line models, but still does the job.  </li>
            <li>love the extra 2 year waranty which adds confidence.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a year and works just as the first day.  </li>
            <li>So, I guess it works well enough, but doesn&#x27;t give that close shave that most men prefer.</li>
            <li>Since I shave in the shower, I first tried shaving with the Panasonic using the wet-shave option.  </li>
            <li>I have always used a standard razor, and I like the convenience of being able to shave in the shower with my shower mirror.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this razor a couple of times in the shower, and it performs better than its \\&quot;big brother\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I thought this Panasonic might be more convenient to the traditional razors</li>
            <li>This Panasonic model excels at smoothing out more than facial hair.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for sensitive skin :)  Clean,close and non irritating</li>
            <li>do (not quite sure what that is, nor quite sure that its absence matters), and does not have a pivoting head or digital display.</li>
            <li>do (not quite sure what that is, nor quite sure that its absence matters), and does not have a pivoting head or digital display.</li>
            <li>my face was not only stubble free....but super smooth.</li>
            <li>must say, this is a more comfortable and closer shave than my previous models.  </li>
            <li>The only reason for 4 stars is because no matter how many times you go over certain hairs</li>
            <li>Feels nice in the hand, and will give you a close shave with enough passes--this is the kind of thing I experience on all electric shavers, regardless of cost, and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few!</li>
            <li>the wet/dry function is good but to use as an everyday shaver..not so much.</li>
            <li>-Charging stand is very sleek, battery lasts long time, travel protection fits snug and blocks the on button, very close shave without having to go over the same area several times, durable (dropped it twice), ergonomically fits perfect in my hand, price is very reasonable for the market, no need to worry about the water shorting out circuits</li>
            <li>We do adult foster care for individuals with special needs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a fine razor that is comfortable to use, easy to clean and is small enough to leave on my vanity all the time.</li>
            <li>decided on this Panasonic Wet/Dry Razor after reading the positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m adding mine as a positive 5 star</li>
            <li>but obviously the most important thing was if it actually works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used in the past 30 years was good for 120-240v.  </li>
            <li>short, if you&#x27;re already an electric shaver user, you might find this an okay alternative to your current shaver, and the wet shave option is nice, but it sure wasn&#x27;t the right shaver for my face, and the closeness of the shave was similar to what my face is like about 7 or 8 hours after I shave with my Gillette Fusion Power blade.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and does a terrific job under my nose and at the sideburns.  </li>
            <li>easy cleaning&lt;br /&gt;Small enough to travel with&lt;br /&gt;Gets</li>
            <li>It does a slightly better job this way than it does with a dry shave.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleanup: Cleanup is easy as you can totally submerse this thing in water and wash it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is also supposed to work with shaving cream but doesn&#x27;t really do much better than dry.</li>
            <li>I am willing to pay a lot more for a shaver to get extra power (because I have very thick/dense stubble) and a stand that cleans the shaver (because I have a very sensitive complexion).  </li>
            <li>I am willing to pay a lot more for a shaver to get extra power (because I have very thick/dense stubble) and a stand that cleans the shaver (because I have a very sensitive complexion).  </li>
            <li>you are looking for a lightweight, efficient, reasonably-priced electric shaver which will give you as good a shave as the more expensive models, I highly recommend the Panasonic ES-S141.</li>
            <li>but at times lacking in knowledge when it comes to certain products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>result is a smooth clean shave that doesn&#x27;t pull at your hairs like some other</li>
            <li>I have owned 3 different electric razors in the past year, and so far this one is the best I have tried.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a quick and long lasting charge and it cleans up very easy.</li>
            <li>He uses it both wet and dry and is happy.</li>
            <li>It shaves close and the wet or dry option is great.</li>
            <li>The first, a Remington that cost more broke in a few months, the second a Braun still worked but never gave a close shave (that cost more too)....</li>
            <li>Will shave away short hair from mustache and chin area just fine.</li>
            <li>After you shave with this you will see a fine residue of tiny hairs on whatever surface you are nearby.</li>
            <li>Battery life is fine, will last three days on one charge, assuming you shave for 7 minutes once a day like I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would have liked it to be a little stiffer so that it didn&#x27;t collapse so often when using it.  </li>
            <li>First, there are two water inlets on the back side of the shaver that can be opened when you clean it.  </li>
            <li>Needed a little something with a charging stand and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Thus, you have more time to get to work or can set your alarm later and sleep a little more.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t run as fast and can&#x27;t handle a couple of days beard growth.  </li>
            <li>so much for electrical shaving.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s something about shaving with a wet face and close razor that feels like it does a better job.  </li>
            <li>I have yet to find an electric shaver capable of hitting that spot though with 100% satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s much easier to handle when shaving.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy the fact that you can shower in the shower, but as others had stated your beard needs to get used to this shaver as initially you leave some stubble.</li>
            <li>My husband really seems to like it.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Very efficient &amp; up to my expectations.  </li>
            <li>He seems to really like it</li>
            <li>This shaver is quiet, comfortable to hold, and can provide a close shave if you use it every day.  </li>
            <li>If you need to charge the shaver on your trip, you have to bring the whole stand.  </li>
            <li>Curved blades really make a difference.</li>
            <li>but it takes around 3 passes for each area to really get all the hair.</li>
            <li>Works really well if you have to skip a day between shaves.</li>
            <li>Now i have to find out how much replacement blades will be.</li>
            <li>i bought it for my dad, he said battery of this product really run fast even can&#x27;t handle one time</li>
            <li>The shaving experience is very Panasonic--they compromise just a bit on the closeness of the shave</li>
            <li>the whole</li>
            <li>this shaver can really shave.  </li>
            <li>My razor is always fully charged and fast.</li>
            <li>so can&#x27;t say much for the face</li>
            <li>HIghly recommended!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a reasonably priced electric razor.</li>
            <li>I asked if I could have it since he doesn&#x27;t really like it, but he wouldn&#x27;t give it up.</li>
            <li>It prevents irritation that I get sometimes from the regular safety blades yet provides a smooth and close shave.</li>
            <li>Another big bonus with this device is cleanup - which is about as smooth and painless as it gets.  </li>
            <li>this thing work well and is really convienient</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>The Milano&#x27;s aesthetic is very pleasing.  </li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t work from the first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like it because the cutter head is very bulky.  </li>
            <li>no International voltage adaptor available from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I also like the stand that is also a charger - very convenient.  </li>
            <li>I can still get a closer shave with a blade, but this is getting real close to that benchmark.</li>
            <li>Some cut much closer, hold a longer charge, do self cleaning</li>
            <li>I expected a much better shaver.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very quiet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My father-in-law said it really didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>The advertising for this razor is very misleading.</li>
            <li>It works well on many other body</li>
            <li>I am quite happy with my new Panasonic but it doesn&#x27;t seem to shave the hairs as close as the Norelco did, 5 o&#x27;clock shadow shows up a little earlier.</li>
            <li>High quality construction, with a smart battery</li>
            <li>(Look for the bright red light, hard to miss!)</li>
            <li>With the push of a button two shutters open on the shaver and he just holds it under the running water to clean it out.</li>
            <li>to clean simply by rinsing in water&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>with that in mind, Panasonic has actually innovated a bit so that you can really clean the shaver by rinsing it.  </li>
            <li>Not so much the case with my older model.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In particular, if you&#x27;ve used other electric razors and not been too happy with them, either due to skin irritation or to a not-especially-good shave, this might be for you.</li>
            <li>For shaving it took more time than conventional razor</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve given it now three weeks and have gone back to the blade two times in between because the shave was so irregular I wasn&#x27;t presentable for special occasions.</li>
            <li>shaver works fine with gel, foam, or dry.</li>
            <li>This electric razor to me is a pretty close feel to your old school foam/razor experience without the cuts and mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was the first razor I bought for my 15 yr old son.</li>
            <li>The hot water and steam helps get your beard soft and standing up.</li>
            <li>Pana makes a big deal over how convenient and quick this is, but realistically the old \\&quot;pop the head off and rinse\\&quot; system on prior Panas was just as easy and quick.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My current shaver is getting quite old (but still runs just fine)</li>
            <li>Oh well, live and learn!...........</li>
            <li>: I have now tried a water only shave and shaves with gel, clearly a disapointment, the \\&quot;5 o&#x27;clock shadow\\&quot; is evident somewhere between 10 and 11 AM, and to top it off, I see that Norelco&#x27;s shaver heads have gone back to having slots to get the longer whiskers</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lightweight, easy to hold and control, and sharp enough to cleanly zip through 3-5 days of beard growth, the Panasonic ES-SL41-S</li>
            <li>This model does not have all the whistles and bells; however, it does shave  better than previous models.  </li>
            <li>This one is a lot less, and does a respectable job.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t some company make a decent razor for under $100?</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten older, my skin seems to have gotten thinner</li>
            <li>This product gives a decent shave and prevents razor burn when used in the shower.</li>
            <li>My Braun shaver is waterproof, but is not really meant for a wet shave, so this one is superior in that</li>
            <li>As the battery grows older, 2 shaves will be the maximum.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ONLY used disposable razors (most recently the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent razor for the price</li>
            <li>My older one with more battery capacity is my travel unit (no charger if the travel is less than a week).</li>
            <li>The trimmer is decent as well.</li>
            <li>I had an older Panasonic Wet-Dry that I bought 15 years ago for under $40</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried more expensive brands and this one is a sure stand-out.  </li>
            <li>It has a VERY solid build quality, a long lasting battery, and good aesthetics.</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t charge to different voltage but a great product ended up buying one locally and it works great but due to different voltage no good .</li>
            <li>Milano is one of the more economical versions of Panasonic&#x27;s Wet-Dry series, but it uses the same blades and head as the more expensive ES-LT41.  </li>
            <li>that said I highly recommend this shaver as body groomer.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this device to men who shave.</li>
            <li>It leaves a lot to be desired and is highly over rated.</li>
            <li>Its fine if you want to just drag it across your face like a lawn mower, but it can&#x27;t do any edging or detail work.  </li>
            <li>knock a star off this shaver for lack of a brush, and it could use a little more power.  </li>
            <li>knock a star off this shaver for lack of a brush, and it could use a little more power.  </li>
            <li>so I have to spend some extra time there; but overall, it&#x27;s the best wet dry shaver so far.  </li>
            <li>I was happily surprised at just how well this shaver came clean with a simple rinse, even without removing the foil.  </li>
            <li>Men who have more sensitive skin will like the fact that the Panasonic ES-SI41-S Milano can be used with shaving cream for a more comfortable, less irritating shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t shave clean, and it takes so long to get any shave!</li>
            <li>The only thing I could recommend would be to make the system&#x27;s blades sensitive enough to be able to remove even the smallest or toughest hairs on my neck.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;d still rather just shave with a normal razor if I want that clean-cut look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Works well, and this is now my normal home razor that lives in the charger.</li>
            <li>normally don&#x27;t take time to write reviews, but at $50, this razor is a steal.</li>
            <li>Does a nice job wet or dry.  </li>
            <li>I like that it is light and that it shaves really close comfortably, and especially in the hard to get places--even for those with necks with angular planes.</li>
            <li>Cleaning is extremely easy with the clips that you pull down and run the shaver under the faucet.  </li>
            <li>Only issue, which is probably more due to the foil vs rotary make, is that it can sometimes be a bit tricky to get into certain places, near the nose, edges of the jawline.  </li>
            <li>It gets 5 stars from me due to its close, comfortable, and convenient shave.</li>
            <li>it works really good wet with a little bit of shave cream</li>
            <li>Being new to electric razors</li>
            <li>This shaver provides a decent shave and, with its \\&quot;water shutters\\&quot;, is easier to clean than other shavers which require you to pop off the cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I clean it using water but have yet to wet shave.</li>
            <li>I prefer shavers with much less bulky cutter heads that make it easy to visualize the line of cut.  </li>
            <li>it works very well and gives a nice shave without irritating the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;easy</li>
            <li>/&gt;If this one lasts as long as my first Panasonic wet-dry, I will not need another one until 2027!</li>
            <li>I have found their customer service/technical support people to be very professional</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shaver in place of the old fashioned razor blade.</li>
            <li>The shaving cream gets into the razor, of course, so I found myself opening the cleaning clips and rinsing the razor very frequently during a shave.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, so after reading some online reviews, I came across this electric razor.  </li>
            <li>Instead of popping up parallel to the handle (like most modern shavers) Pana has the trimmer blade pop up at a strange 60 degree angle off the back of the handle.</li>
            <li>Instead of popping up parallel to the handle (like most modern shavers) Pana has the trimmer blade pop up at a strange 60 degree angle off the back of the handle.</li>
            <li>This is a relatively small razor that easily fits on my crowded vanity without taking up much space.</li>
            <li>That being said,  skip this shaver and buy a higher end model such as http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B001DNE3KQ/ref&#x3D;mp_s_a_1_2?qid&#x3D;1382876923&amp;sr&#x3D;8-2&amp;pi&#x3D;AC_SX110_SY165_QL70&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After several days he&#x27;s mastered it and the only thing we have to do is make sure it&#x27;s cleaned well occasionally.  </li>
            <li>However, I am on my second one because the button on the first one gave out after 6 months.</li>
            <li>It is the first time he actually enjoys using an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are two inner blades and the foil itself has a cutter that trims longer hairs so that they are accessible to the inner blade.</li>
            <li>got my first electric razor recently,</li>
            <li>But only pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Prior to using this I used a regular razor and it would take one or two times to feel like my face was fully clean.  </li>
            <li>but he said he still prefers the regular shaver as he still has to go over the same spot 2-3 times to clean it...</li>
            <li>He says it&#x27;s good for a quick job (like when he&#x27;s running late) or for a Saturday shave when it doesn&#x27;t really matter, but it doesn&#x27;t get close enough for everyday use.  </li>
            <li>wear a long Van Dyke style beard and can shave right up to the edge without the Panasonic grabbing onto the longer hair like some razors like to</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the same Braun self cleaning shaver for over 5 years and wanted to try something new as I was temporarily relocating and didn&#x27;t want to lug around the large base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I must say that the Panasonic is easily on par with these two heavy industry hitters.  </li>
            <li>However, I still gave the shaver 3-stars as I thought the (dry) shave was pretty decent</li>
            <li>I own a top-of-the-line model, which I&#x27;ve used daily for the past two years.</li>
            <li>In my \\&quot;skip-a-day\\&quot; test, this shaver really struggled to knock down two days worth of stubble.  </li>
            <li>He was really pleased that the shaver could be used on both wet and dry skin!</li>
            <li>is fully clear of stubble.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a replacement for my old Remington razor in case it quit working.  </li>
            <li>Take a lot time to complete as compared to manual way of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sada</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll pass it through to my 16 year old son, so he can try it</li>
            <li>Bought this for a 50 year old man that had never shaved himself.  </li>
            <li>thought this thing would be convenient but my simple manual razor is so much</li>
            <li>If you take long hot showers this is the shaver for you.  </li>
            <li>The grip is not heavily textured and may be slippery if used in the shower with shaving</li>
            <li>That design was much easier to get into the curved throat area and just above the chin.</li>
            <li>So far, he loves it.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This razor is different however and he really likes it.  </li>
            <li>An electric razor isn&#x27;t a yearly purchase and it&#x27;s been at least five years, maybe more since I&#x27;ve bought one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very convenient too as I can shave while showering rather than standing above the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>problems with the old Pana shavers I used were these:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>loud buzzsaw noise&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li>If a trimmer matters that much to you, you may want to get a separate trimmer and think of this Milano model as only a shaver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If a trimmer matters that much to you, you may want to get a separate trimmer and think of this Milano model as only a shaver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was bought for my 96 year old dad.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nowhere near manual blade close.</li>
            <li>We purchased this for our 13 year old, yes I said 13.  </li>
            <li>Our water is so soft we did not need shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>The shaver comes with a nice charging stand that glows red at the base to let you know it is charging as well as a clear plastic protective cover for when you need to travel with it or for just keeping it handy laying around.</li>
            <li>and I was unable to get a good view of the lines with this shaver.  </li>
            <li>have thick and course facial hair and the Panasonic mow right through it leaving my face totally smooth and non</li>
            <li>the replacement foils aren&#x27;t much less than a whole new razor and this one is an absolute dream.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a dry shaver, it gives a slight bit of irritation--but nothing I notice for more than a minute or so.</li>
            <li>blades are a lot closer than the older models, but this might just be because my last one was getting old.</li>
            <li>far as shave quality goes - my overall impression is that it is &#x27;decent.&#x27;  </li>
            <li>It is small enough to fit on my bathroom vanity without taking up much space.</li>
            <li>The only drawback is that shavers that I have owned in the past were able to be wall mounted.  </li>
            <li>I use it as dry as wet with shaving lotion and has been working fine.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;Panasonic ES-SI41-S Shaver, Milano Rechargeable with Nanotech Blades, 3-Blade Arc, 3 Wet-Dry\\&quot; provides a close, comfortable shave for men with average facial hair.  </li>
            <li>Second, the blades have been reconfigured by Panasonic to loop higher and these loops are set wider apart then even their last year&#x27;s model.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It was different in one way: I did not get razor burn from the first use or any subsequent use.</li>
            <li>Panasonic&#x27;s Milano electric shaver is a good, all around electric shaver that I&#x27;ve been using for the past few weeks, 1 of which was on the road while I traveled for business.  </li>
            <li>the battery damage what can only be connected to 110V, who has softer chin harder will be shaved, not a bad product</li>
            <li>It can be cleaned easily, by sluicing water into the head with two little gates you can open to allow the water to flow out.</li>
            <li>I packed the Milano in my travel kit and gave it near daily use over 6 nights and did not need to re-charge it and was able to use it a few times back at home before the power drained out.  </li>
            <li>It only takes a few passes to get a complete shave, although 1 pass is fine if i shave often.</li>
            <li>This shaver being a little light on power, takes about twice the time for me to get the same shave I get with my Braun, so for me personally I would not use it in the shower because I feel like I&#x27;m draining my entire hot water heater.  </li>
            <li>I much prefer the single foil and one cutter that my old shaver had.  </li>
            <li>Still, this is a small price to pay considering the fact that I am pain and embracement free after each shave.</li>
            <li>This is a small and attractive wet/dry shaver with a small trimmer attachment on the back for sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a charging</li>
            <li>Wahls and Remmingtons seem to give a closer shave but are more irritating for me and those rotary headed types are gentle but not close enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I were limited to the $50-$60 range, I would certainly consider this shaver.  </li>
            <li>If I were limited to the $50-$60 range, I would certainly consider this shaver.  </li>
            <li>The blades don&#x27;t pivot front to back or right to left, but the shape of the foil is such that this doesn&#x27;t seem to hamper the shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll get the same razor when I need a new blade unit.  </li>
            <li>It was a bit more expensive, but not by much</li>
            <li>I got this for my husband and he wants a different one because this one doesn&#x27;t shave close enough</li>
            <li>and I have only had one razor that cuts it well, one with extra foils that can cut very close.</li>
            <li>He is already in the shower, it goes right down the drain.</li>
            <li>and I use that very frequent, but overall 2 out of 5 for me.</li>
            <li>When I first tried the unit dry and harkening back to my days using a Remington foil shaver, I didn&#x27;t think it gave me a close shave</li>
            <li>The Panasonic is not able to move around your face easy enough</li>
            <li>As I get older, my stubble seems to get more difficult to shave.  </li>
            <li>I actually prefer this shaver when I am traveling because it fits right in my toiletry bag along with my other things.  </li>
            <li>The shaver is a little more than six inches tall, two-and-a-half inches wide with a silver blue finish.</li>
            <li>Blades generally need replaced about every six months to ensure a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Generally, it takes a number of passes at a number of angles before my shave iscomplete, but that is par for the course with an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>Two parts, the Panasonic wet-dry razors in general, and this one specifically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>only clear miss here is the pop-up trimmer.</li>
            <li>only clear miss here is the pop-up trimmer.</li>
            <li>So far don&#x27;t like the way it shaves, to get a close shave u need to go over the same place over and over and no indication when it needs to be charged and when it is charged</li>
            <li>Same area again and again to complete, but</li>
            <li>Its harder to cut those pesky whiskers with this straight type unit.</li>
            <li>Third, the bottom of the shaver head beneath the foil is flatter, without the deep channels and valleys that are so common in most shavers.</li>
            <li>Now I just take my old Panasonic with its smaller charging cord along when I&#x27;m on the road, and use this sports car of an electric razor while I&#x27;m home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really give as close a shave as I expected.</li>
            <li>The only reason it doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because it didn&#x27;t make me say WOW.</li>
            <li>I try cutting my whiskers, I need to go over my face and neck repeatedly and still don&#x27;t get a good shave.  </li>
            <li>other problem I had, and a far more significant one, was that after a few days of shaving with this razor I started to develop hard, red nubbles on my upper cheeks and the sides of my neck.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it does not move easily on my face.</li>
            <li>but that means it is only worth half the value.</li>
            <li>other thing I like is the handle is more narrow and lighter overall.</li>
            <li>The charger is bulky and made of hard plastic; it takes up significant space in a shaving kit and, if subjected to pressure/weight, may crack.  </li>
            <li>Some of the other ones are the size of sledge hammer (really for shaving)?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Also making shaving more cumbersome, since I have a goatee, I&#x27;m forced to use my disposable anyway to cut in the edges of the goatee (as the small sideburn trimmer on the shaver doesn&#x27;t work very well for anything besides sideburns).  </li>
            <li>After shaving my skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight or hot and there are no tender or irritated spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The battery life is great and the fact that you can wet shave is another plus,  all of that being said I find that a rotary seems to be faster and less irritating.</li>
            <li>I never dry shave and have never tried with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The handle is smaller than other versions of Panasonic Wet-Dry Shavers and, for men with larger hands, may not be as comfortable to grip as other models.  </li>
            <li>motor is much quieter than other electrics I have used, especially the Braun 9500 series.</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;ve used it on my neck and it worked OK - leaves behind some hairs though that lay flat</li>
            <li>the trimmer flips back down a little too easily for my tastes.  </li>
            <li>but it also gives me a few extra minutes of standing under the hot water in the morning.</li>
            <li>I decided to purchase this one for my other residence simply due to the very positive reviews this shaver got on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I like the little charging stand, it doesn&#x27;t take up much counter space.</li>
            <li>your beard is a little long, use the trimmer first, then go over it with the screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can use shaving cream with it which I highly recommend as it cuts down on shaving irritation and bumps that I seem to only get with electric razors.&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I believe this model is the best one I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Seems like it was a very good purchase!</li>
            <li> This is really an excellent razor.</li>
            <li> The carrying holder is perfect as I can snap the shaver on it and place it on the side of the tub w.o</li>
            <li> &quot; promised the best of both worlds.</li>
            <li> If you are a fan of Panasonic razors, this one will keep you happy!</li>
            <li> i rate this razor at best average.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> Was hands-down the best razor I have owned.</li>
            <li> They have the best mens shavers out there.  </li>
            <li> It works perfect in or out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> On the plus side, the cleaning of the waterproof chamber works flawlessly, and you won&#x27;t find shaving debris under the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got the ES-SL41-S, but I think my dislike applies to all Panasonic after using this as best</li>
            <li> He has been very happy with it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s feel in the hand and against the skin is excellent.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed with this device at all.</li>
            <li> Perfect.</li>
            <li> I seem to like the Panasonic models the best.  </li>
            <li> and it was time to replace the blades when I received an opportunity to get this razor through the Vine program - perfect timing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But the best thing is the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s usable but not the best design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean-up is a breeze.</li>
            <li> best shaver for the money</li>
            <li> and  I&#x27;m glad that I bought it!!!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> Very good electric razor.  </li>
            <li> Got this for a gift for my father and he said that it works great and is very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> The handle of the shaver has good ergonomics as it fits perfectly into my hand.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> Works great.  </li>
            <li> great price.  </li>

            <li> Works great.  </li>
            <li> Works great in the shower.  </li>

            <li> Great Product, Just like the description.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor, it \\&quot;fits\\&quot; in my hand like it was meant to be there.</li>
            <li> It does a great job, but could be improved with interchangeable foils.</li>
            <li> so shaving in the shower is a must, and a electric shaver that can be used in the shower is a great idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> one great variable is durability.</li>
            <li> one great variable is durability.</li>
            <li> If your a happy Norelco user, I recommend you stick with them.  </li>
            <li> I get a great shave with or without cream or soap, and the battery life has been 12-15 shaves per charge.  </li>
            <li> Great for taking on vacation without needing the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love it,very reliable and build quality is awesome as we!! !!</li>
            <li> it has a pleasant, low-noise hum.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised!&lt;br</li>
            <li> This razor does a good job.</li>
            <li> I have one and loved it</li>
            <li> the rasor is so good</li>
            <li> I am stuck with the razor.shave hair not that good.</li>
            <li> Built quality like plastic,metal is good.</li>
            <li> Does a good job when you have gotten your skin used to it</li>
            <li> Anyone wanting a good shave should definately try this razor.</li>
            <li> but i think this is not so good for my expectations</li>
            <li> Good product for the price.</li>
            <li> It looks good.</li>
            <li> Not as good as a rotary razor.</li>
            <li> The stand is good, the attachments are useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was inexpensive and surprisingly gave me one of the closest and smoothest  shaves</li>
            <li> I tried it on about four days growth and it give me a good close shave.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for everyone who shaves their face and needs a good electric razor.</li>
            <li> Use it every day good results.</li>
            <li> I thought this product was a good purchase, but my son says the shave isn&#x27;t as close as he likes.</li>
            <li> For that, it works good.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts for a good period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good battery, well constructed.  </li>
            <li> These are all good things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good razor.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing the shavers I read the reviews on them and they have been as good as the review</li>
            <li> use the Nivea shaving cream, it doesn&#x27;t foam up, with warm water, and this works great.  </li>
            <li> In the shower or out good to go</li>
            <li> Clean up with the ports (a wonderful idea btw!)</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is also a sideburn trimmer on the top part of the razor that works great.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> and I was very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> AND I&#x27;M VERY GLAD</li>
            <li> I have bought them for myself, my wife and my boys - everyone is very pleased.  </li>
            <li> Nice shaver that does a good job for the price.</li>
            <li> received the product and after about a week of use, I must say I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> It is really easy to use and works great.  </li>
            <li> great for cost, light touch work</li>
            <li> Still an amazing razor.</li>
            <li> i liked it</li>
            <li> It has a nice sideburn trimmer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gives a good shave that I am hoping will get a bit better over time as I get used to the razor</li>
            <li> I would  have liked a charger with&lt;br /&gt;only</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost as good as a razor for closeness, and much more convenient.</li>
            <li> This is a nice razor.</li>
            <li> but when I got out of the shower, it felt like I had a nice, close shave.</li>
            <li> comes with a nice storage/recharging stand&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> It cleans up nice also.</li>
            <li> This is a nice touch on a shaver in this price</li>
            <li> I liked the price....</li>
            <li> The wet-dry part is also nice, this can be run under water for cleaning and can also be used in the shower (if you want to).</li>
            <li> My first experience with using and electric razor with shaving cream was very good.</li>
            <li> This shaver is very light and compact, with an innovative guard that allows it to travel in a fairly compact footprint.  </li>
            <li> Form factor and design also gets positive points - its a very handsome device with great build quality.</li>
            <li> but it works fine and cuts good.</li>
            <li> This shaver is good if  you have nothing important or formal to go to.</li>
            <li> This is a good razor that is comfortable to use and shaves well.</li>
            <li> Very happy with it so far</li>
            <li> My Braun shaver is heavier and goes in its own case that prevents it from fitting in my toiletry bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far, I have found that Panasonic and Braun seem to have found the best spot regarding the closeness of the shave without the resulting irritation.  </li>
            <li> This is a good razor for those comfortable with electric razors.  </li>
            <li> Works great and this charger works perfect with the beard trimmer just in case one charger goes down</li>
            <li> One Panasonic or another of this series are on fantastically good special pricing over the holidays typically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It worked great, and it&#x27;s the first electric razor that EVER worked on my neck.</li>
            <li> Also very light weight.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still very smooth.</li>
            <li> He liked the model and it works fine.</li>
            <li> This feels like a very solid shaver and may be one of the best in this price range for all I know.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no comparison to the blades and multi-pivoting heads of the better shavers and the smoothness of the 63.</li>
            <li> I love panasonic shavers,  I have tried every brand of shaver out there and panasonic beats them hands</li>
            <li> there are definitely better options...</li>
            <li> and I think you may be more satisfied.</li>
            <li> Better than Gillette, though, in some ways-</li>
            <li> I have used an electric many years ago and this one is much better in both the closeness of the shave and the clean-up.  </li>
            <li> so I leave it plugged into an outlet most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works okay for the price.</li>
            <li> Maybe it doesn&#x27;t have as many blades?</li>
            <li> I like the razer for the most part, bus</li>
            <li> I tried it out before my son went to college, and it was better than my more-expensive razor.</li>
            <li> but it price was ok.</li>
            <li> makes it even better.</li>
            <li> Faces have regions and this does better for ME in some regions than others.</li>
            <li> I have been extremely pleased with this razor.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed that my shavers have not been able to shave neck hairs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been told that it takes a month to get your face acclimated to the shaver, so maybe it&#x27;ll get better in 2 more weeks</li>
            <li> I love it ....</li>
            <li> is a keeper, &amp; is now my favorite shaver.</li>
            <li> Five stars to Panasonic for this great &amp; reasonably priced shaver.</li>
            <li> Here are some comparison points I think are interesting about this shaver:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love Panasonic products, mostly their TV&#x27;s and cordless phones, and I&#x27;m sure this shaver is reliable because Panasonic builds reliable products.  </li>
            <li> I love Panasonic products, mostly their TV&#x27;s and cordless phones, and I&#x27;m sure this shaver is reliable because Panasonic builds reliable products.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> It works best for me when I use a soap-lathered mixture on my face, but still leaves a big difference from a blade on the neck and chin.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps those with a soft-haired beard would have better results,</li>
            <li> It works ok w/o the cream</li>
            <li> Well, it works ok.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for 30 years and have tried many brands.</li>
            <li> Panasonic has always been my favorite.</li>
            <li> This means it takes more time to cover ground.</li>
            <li> --I think it works better this way, but the Wet/Dry capability makes it easier to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My beard is like nails, and it has cowlicks (for want of a better term) on my neck.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve found the cut to be better, but still not as close as my disposable.  </li>
            <li> I am going to keep using it for awhile and see if I can learn how maneuver it better and a get a closer, easier shave.  </li>
            <li> I can never get close enough to the skin to get a perfect shave.</li>
            <li> We love Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> They love them and the mother&#x27;s love them too because they don&#x27;t have to remind them to shave.  </li>
            <li> and so it becomes a more labored shave.  </li>
            <li> and I was confident.  </li>
            <li> Still, I am overall VERY happy with the product.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for one - couldn&#x27;t recommend this one more.</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t spend any more on it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li> I have had many electric shavers over the years.  </li>
            <li> It is these two differences that I attribute to the better shave over all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> there better razors out there?</li>
            <li> Sure.</li>
            <li> but they also cost a LOT more than the Panasonic ES-Sl41-S.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get a good shave at a economical price.</li>
            <li> I will probably give this away to Goodwill and find a better manufactured razor.</li>
            <li> but like a good girlfriend I got the right one</li>
            <li> I know I like a nice clean shave on him every day.</li>
            <li> The rinse to clean feature is a nice touch.  </li>
            <li> I have used this for about a week now and think that it is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> But, for the money, this is a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> It always does a pretty good job.</li>
            <li> You probably don&#x27;t want to take the charger on a long trip with you but for at home it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> but it does a pretty good job.</li>
            <li> I found the Panasonic Milano Men&#x27;s Rechargeable shaver to be a pretty good and durable product.  </li>
            <li> As to the close shave, it does a pretty good job.</li>
            <li> MY husband needed a new one and this was a great price.  </li>
            <li> Being able to put it under the tap makes cleaning easy.  </li>
            <li> This allows water to flow more easily between the loops and prevents caking of cut hair from gumming up the works when you try to rinse it.  </li>
            <li> It is also easy to snap the top off and on to get rid of the whisker debris.er debris.</li>
            <li> who travel frequently and like to use a wet-dry shaver may not be happy with the Panasonic ES-SI41-S Milano shaver.  </li>
            <li> : This shaver works best in the shower or when wet.</li>
            <li> My old shaver, a Panasonic ES-SA40K, was great.  </li>
            <li> - I genuinely feel that this is a better product.  </li>
            <li> in all this is a comfortable razor to shave with though the trimmer could be better positioned.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s attractive as far as razors go.</li>
            <li> It would be great for either an adolescent or an adult.  </li>
            <li> I have never found an electric razor that does as good of job as a real razor, so I was not expecting that.  </li>
            <li> you are looking for a reasonably priced wet-dry shaver that is reliable and provides a good shave, you may want to give the \\&quot;Panasonic ES-SI41-S Shaver, Milano Rechargeable with Nanotech Blades, 3-Blade Arc, 3 Wet-Dry\\&quot; a try.</li>
            <li> my shaver, its easy to clean and does a real&lt;br /&gt;good job, leaving a nice and smooth shave, would be happier</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t quite have all the bells and whistles of it&#x27;s higher line Panasonic cousins, but it does sport a lower price, is easy to clean, and gives a darn good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On the other hand, it fits perfectly on my bathroom countertop, and my razor is always fully-charged.</li>
            <li> It is easy to handle and grip he said.</li>
            <li> The on and off button is on the inside of the handle and easy to access with my thumb.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and trims my sideburns</li>
            <li> Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> but the induction charger makes this easy.</li>
            <li> I switched to Panasonic shavers about 8 years ago because I get a lot of irritation and the blade design is easy on my skin.</li>
            <li> of my favorite things about the shaver is how easy it is to clean it.</li>
            <li> Eventhough I&#x27;ll probably never use it in the shower again, I like that you are able to use water to clean off the blades rather than having to take it apart to brush it off.  </li>
            <li> The horizontal foil and blades just don&#x27;t glide that easy.  </li>
            <li> Gives a close shave  and cleans easily.</li>
            <li> I had an older model wet/dry from Panasonic about 10 years ago, and I loved it.  </li>
            <li> So conventional blade is a best method to do shave.</li>
            <li> Having owned Norelco, Braun &amp; Remington razors - this by far is the most comfortable electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used and gives a shave almost as good as a blade.</li>
            <li> the price, this is a quality electric shaver that gets a pretty nice close shave given 5 - 10 minutes of your time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best hands down.</li>
            <li> it works fine, keeps</li>
            <li> but again just fine.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;shaver water works just fine.</li>
            <li> Panasonic ES-S141-S is a fine midlevel electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> , this is a fine shave for an electric razor.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give you too many more specifics, but every time I ask him about it, he says he really likes it!  </li>
            <li> and it seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> It was everything I hoped for in a razor, easy to use, easy to clean, and no monstrous charger contraption taking up room on my bathroom counter-space.</li>
            <li> He wanted something easy to use, easy to clean, and gives a close shave.</li>
            <li> Ergonomic, light weight, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean and goes for almost a week without charging.</li>
            <li> Since ther is no cord I can shave out side and enjoy a cup of joe.</li>
            <li> switched to this style of razor from the three circular foils variety and much prefer this kind.</li>
            <li> this gives his a close shave and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Overall I am happy with the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning:  This is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> and I like the way it leaves my skin feeling smooth afterwards.  </li>
            <li> cheap not a bargain at any price.</li>
            <li> It seems to shave well and no skin abrasion on my light beard.&lt;br /&gt;Package didn&#x27;t come with instructions.  </li>
            <li> Spend more and get something useful.</li>
            <li> It is light weight and fits both your hand and the curves of York face.</li>
            <li> But with this shaver&lt;br /&gt;he can use it in the shower with shower gel on his face and get a smooth, close shave without any irratation.</li>
            <li> it was cheap and could also use shaving cream but with this&lt;</li>
            <li> All these things allow water to flow through the shave head easily and clean out the clippings.</li>
            <li> The last shaver worked great</li>
            <li> This shaver being 100% foil only, greatly reduces irritation.</li>
            <li> The shape of it makes it comfortable to hold</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and to clean.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would be my primary shaver</li>
            <li> and this gives a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Using the ES-SL41-S Arc 3 does not provide a smooth shave</li>
            <li> Panasonic&#x27;s water shutter technology lets water flow freely through the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, the Panasonic ES-SL41-S \\&quot;Milano\\</li>
            <li> And I have always wanted to be free of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I like the plastic cover, which is great for travel as it is solid, keeps the shaver from turning on, and also acts as a shaver stand.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> My beard is very fine when it first comes in</li>
            <li> Very nice works better in shower or wet</li>
            <li> the razor is okay, but the chugging cradle is very large.......</li>
            <li> It does not need water but it is great that it is so simple to clean.</li>
            <li> for maintenance and quick shaving, this thing does just fine.</li>
            <li> shutters are an interesting addition and seem to work pretty well.</li>
            <li> First time that I buy an electric razor and I have to say that after you get use to you will love it.</li>
            <li> think the charging stand and carrying holder are pluses and unique in its style.</li>
            <li> First, I must confess that I&#x27;ve been a blade shaver for most of my life, but I&#x27;m always looking for an electric substitute.</li>
            <li> so it was not giving a clean shave at all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get  clean cut.</li>
            <li> Works great dry shaving.</li>
            <li> Forgets to plug in or clean his shaver.</li>
            <li> This model is easier to clean.  </li>
            <li> clean up&lt;br</li>
            <li> I experienced some skin irritation from shaving dry with this razor.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re all set to go again with a clean system!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Frequent travelers will appreciate that there&#x27;s no need to disassemble the shaver to clean it.</li>
            <li> makes clean up</li>
            <li> I had to \\&quot;do clean up\\&quot; with a disposable every day I used it.</li>
            <li> On the Pro side - it cleans easily, holds a charge for at least 8 shaves or more, and looks great.  </li>
            <li> It works specially well in the shower and the battery lasts about a week.</li>
            <li> like it, but works only with battery,not  with the electric cord,like the one I had before,but is good</li>
            <li> I use to have a Philips Shaver and that was much cheaper and better than this one</li>
            <li> In fact, it describes the &#x27;convenient carrying holder for storage or travel use&#x27; that is obviously good only if you travel within the U.S.  </li>
            <li> Noisy sound during the operation bothered me, but it is worth for the money.</li>
            <li> As others have said, had to go over and over the same area, still without a good result.  </li>
            <li> It is ergonomic enough for good visibility while shaving.  </li>
            <li> I even once bought a $250 Braun, but found that while it gave me a fairly close shave, it just couldn&#x27;t equal a blade.</li>
            <li> After giving it a full charge (took about 12 hours)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good back up razor</li>
            <li> /&gt;The shaver takes a while to charge (15 hours to reach full charge).</li>
            <li> maybe is not a bad razor</li>
            <li> but no where near as good as the higher end</li>
            <li> new Milano shaver addresses the first two points competently and convincingly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, nothing special about its proformance, cutz decent, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> (I charged it for about 5-6 hrs and have now used it for more than a week without a recharge), and it&#x27;s light, quiet, and easy to handle which shaving.  </li>
            <li> The product has a beautiful design, long battery holds and fast charging,</li>
            <li> it shaves quick clean n easy &amp; provides a VERY close shave without irritation.</li>
            <li> Quite lucky to get them on clearance</li>
            <li> Much closer shave, no issues with clogging and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> One reason is that I can grip the razor like an oversized pen when shaving the back of my mostly bald noggin; It&#x27;s faster and more efficient that way.</li>
            <li> Panasonic&#x27;s Men&#x27;s Wet/Dry Electric Cordless Shaver is second only to soap for the best pairing under running water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased this item as a gift for my husband hoping it would be the right one to help with the irritation and still give him a clean shave.</li>
            <li> First thing he said was that it gave a comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> First off let me say that I use this as a body shaver primarily.</li>
            <li> But more than any other razor I&#x27;ve tried over the years gives me the most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> It is better than the model it replaced which was almost 2x the price; not bad for a handy little wet/dry</li>
            <li> The head isn&#x27;t super easy to take off so it might be so they can secure the blades better than with previous models that quickly pop off foils of the past.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Time to shave and this makes it quick and easy for new shaver.  </li>
            <li> Very close comfortable shave and the price cannot be beat.  </li>
            <li> Light and very close shave for an electric</li>
            <li> told me that, since I have a fairly sensitive skin, electric shaving would be much better, quicker and softer.</li>
            <li> so I got my monies worth.  </li>
            <li> You should be able to skip a day and still have the shaver be able to cut through the stubble with minimal effort.  </li>
            <li> You should be able to skip a day and still have the shaver be able to cut through the stubble with minimal effort.  </li>
            <li> The nice thing about using a wet/dry electric shaver in the shower is that you can use your regular soap or gel</li>
            <li> The only problem so far is that we can&#x27;t figure out where the hairs went, lol.</li>
            <li> It was pretty cool looking</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I think the product is worth buying.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth making the switch.</li>
            <li> I liked the shape, sort of imitating the shape of a standard razor.</li>
            <li> I own several electric shavers that cost $200-$300 dollars that do not shave as&lt;br /&gt;well</li>
            <li> The relative compact sizing of the Milano suits it well for travel purposes and a handy plastic cover for the blade heads are provided to keep them intact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this because one of the reviews said that it shaves just as well and quick as Panasonic&#x27;s higher end Arc 4 shavers, it does not.</li>
            <li> It takes about twice as long to get a good shave with this compared to the ES8243A and especially the ES-LA63, which is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Right now it takes me three times before I feel like face</li>
            <li> this guy right here makes it 10x easier.  </li>
            <li> It gives you a blade-like shave right while you are taking your shower.</li>
            <li> It just feels right.</li>
            <li> Right off the bat</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s much lighter than any other model I&#x27;ve had and the charger is a very nice touch.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Panasonic wet-dry: These are fantastic razors for comfort, close shaves, and decently cleanable.</li>
            <li> The stand is also very minimalist and relatively easy to tip over, but it certainly does the job</li>
            <li> The stand is also very minimalist and relatively easy to tip over, but it certainly does the job</li>
            <li> I thought it was pretty cool at first, and I liked its versatility, but before long I was using it exclusively as a beard trimmer</li>
            <li> I was very hopeful that the new Milano shaver would ber even better.  </li>
            <li> and this is by far the best shave I have had in a long time without major irritation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for over a month and while it is good for keeping the scruff factor down, I still have to use a straight razor to clean up after the electric razor.</li>
            <li> Excellent razor for both wet and dry shaving.  </li>
            <li> As another reviewer mentioned it is not the most efficient razor and the cost of ownership makes purchasing razors of the most expensive kind inexpensive in comparison.</li>
            <li> Wish I could give it 4.5 stars, because those two issues don&#x27;t really warrant a full star off.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment as to whether these missing features may be worth more money to you, but to me, this shaver gives me a clean comfortable shave, and feels well-made.</li>

            <li> I feel the previous reviews that suggested this was a good value were right.  </li>
            <li> to clean easy to use!&lt;br /&gt;the only reason i didn&#x27;t give 5 starts is because of the trim blade the edges are rugged and doesn&#x27;t trim well but who cares!</li>
            <li> So far so good but time will be the ultimate test.</li>
            <li> At last, a smooth, comfortable shave from an electric.</li>
            <li> He prefers to use it dry and it gives him a nice close shave with no skin irritation or pulling.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is an excellent razor for everyday use or just for the occasional trim.</li>
            <li> This model is easy to hold and control, simple to clean and provides the quality shave touted by manufactures of $300 models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rating:</li>
            <li> Gets nice and close, very fast and love the option to use gel when im not running late</li>
            <li> The Milano shaves me about as cleanly as a Fusion five blade, high praise indeed.</li>
            <li> , I found the battery to be VERY VERY long-lasting</li>
            <li> The shave itself is fine if a tad bit slower than my old rotary.</li>
            <li> He was pretty excited about it since he hates shaving, but after a few days he wasn&#x27;t so thrilled.  </li>
            <li> If I were to buy again, I would purchase this razor before spending a lot more to learn what might be better with a more expensive razor.</li>
            <li> I called customer service with a question about how long to charge the razor and when the charge indicator light was supposed to light.</li>
            <li> stand-up carrying holder is the only way to charge the razor, yet it more than doubles the size of the razor if you are traveling with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> first time he used it he must have told me 20 times that day how close it shaved him - that he hadn&#x27;t had a shave that close in years</li>
            <li> Wish I could give it 4.5 stars, because those two issues don&#x27;t really warrant a full star off.n your trip, you have to bring the whole stand.  </li>
            <li> Works exactly as promised.</li>
            <li> First off...amazing.  </li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> It lacks all the bells and whistles of the higher line models, but still does the job.  </li>
            <li> love the extra 2 year waranty which adds confidence.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a year and works just as the first day.  </li>
            <li> So, I guess it works well enough, but doesn&#x27;t give that close shave that most men prefer.</li>
            <li> Since I shave in the shower, I first tried shaving with the Panasonic using the wet-shave option.  </li>
            <li> I have always used a standard razor, and I like the convenience of being able to shave in the shower with my shower mirror.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this razor a couple of times in the shower, and it performs better than its \\&quot;big brother\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I thought this Panasonic might be more convenient to the traditional razors</li>
            <li> This Panasonic model excels at smoothing out more than facial hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for sensitive skin :)  Clean,close and non irritating</li>
            <li> do (not quite sure what that is, nor quite sure that its absence matters), and does not have a pivoting head or digital display.</li>
            <li> do (not quite sure what that is, nor quite sure that its absence matters), and does not have a pivoting head or digital display.</li>
            <li> my face was not only stubble free....but super smooth.</li>
            <li> must say, this is a more comfortable and closer shave than my previous models.  </li>
            <li> The only reason for 4 stars is because no matter how many times you go over certain hairs</li>
            <li> Feels nice in the hand, and will give you a close shave with enough passes--this is the kind of thing I experience on all electric shavers, regardless of cost, and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few!</li>
            <li> the wet/dry function is good but to use as an everyday shaver..not so much.</li>
            <li> -Charging stand is very sleek, battery lasts long time, travel protection fits snug and blocks the on button, very close shave without having to go over the same area several times, durable (dropped it twice), ergonomically fits perfect in my hand, price is very reasonable for the market, no need to worry about the water shorting out circuits</li>
            <li> We do adult foster care for individuals with special needs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a fine razor that is comfortable to use, easy to clean and is small enough to leave on my vanity all the time.</li>
            <li> decided on this Panasonic Wet/Dry Razor after reading the positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m adding mine as a positive 5 star</li>
            <li> but obviously the most important thing was if it actually works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used in the past 30 years was good for 120-240v.  </li>
            <li> short, if you&#x27;re already an electric shaver user, you might find this an okay alternative to your current shaver, and the wet shave option is nice, but it sure wasn&#x27;t the right shaver for my face, and the closeness of the shave was similar to what my face is like about 7 or 8 hours after I shave with my Gillette Fusion Power blade.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and does a terrific job under my nose and at the sideburns.  </li>
            <li> easy cleaning&lt;br /&gt;Small enough to travel with&lt;br /&gt;Gets</li>
            <li> It does a slightly better job this way than it does with a dry shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleanup: Cleanup is easy as you can totally submerse this thing in water and wash it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is also supposed to work with shaving cream but doesn&#x27;t really do much better than dry.</li>
            <li> I am willing to pay a lot more for a shaver to get extra power (because I have very thick/dense stubble) and a stand that cleans the shaver (because I have a very sensitive complexion).  </li>
            <li> I am willing to pay a lot more for a shaver to get extra power (because I have very thick/dense stubble) and a stand that cleans the shaver (because I have a very sensitive complexion).  </li>
            <li> you are looking for a lightweight, efficient, reasonably-priced electric shaver which will give you as good a shave as the more expensive models, I highly recommend the Panasonic ES-S141.</li>
            <li> but at times lacking in knowledge when it comes to certain products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> result is a smooth clean shave that doesn&#x27;t pull at your hairs like some other</li>
            <li> I have owned 3 different electric razors in the past year, and so far this one is the best I have tried.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a quick and long lasting charge and it cleans up very easy.</li>
            <li> He uses it both wet and dry and is happy.</li>
            <li> It shaves close and the wet or dry option is great.</li>
            <li> The first, a Remington that cost more broke in a few months, the second a Braun still worked but never gave a close shave (that cost more too)....</li>
            <li> Will shave away short hair from mustache and chin area just fine.</li>
            <li> After you shave with this you will see a fine residue of tiny hairs on whatever surface you are nearby.</li>
            <li> Battery life is fine, will last three days on one charge, assuming you shave for 7 minutes once a day like I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would have liked it to be a little stiffer so that it didn&#x27;t collapse so often when using it.  </li>
            <li> First, there are two water inlets on the back side of the shaver that can be opened when you clean it.  </li>
            <li> Needed a little something with a charging stand and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Thus, you have more time to get to work or can set your alarm later and sleep a little more.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t run as fast and can&#x27;t handle a couple of days beard growth.  </li>
            <li> so much for electrical shaving.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s something about shaving with a wet face and close razor that feels like it does a better job.  </li>
            <li> I have yet to find an electric shaver capable of hitting that spot though with 100% satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s much easier to handle when shaving.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy the fact that you can shower in the shower, but as others had stated your beard needs to get used to this shaver as initially you leave some stubble.</li>
            <li> My husband really seems to like it.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Very efficient &amp; up to my expectations.  </li>
            <li> He seems to really like it</li>
            <li> This shaver is quiet, comfortable to hold, and can provide a close shave if you use it every day.  </li>
            <li> If you need to charge the shaver on your trip, you have to bring the whole stand.  </li>
            <li> Curved blades really make a difference.</li>
            <li> but it takes around 3 passes for each area to really get all the hair.</li>
            <li> Works really well if you have to skip a day between shaves.</li>
            <li> Now i have to find out how much replacement blades will be.</li>
            <li> i bought it for my dad, he said battery of this product really run fast even can&#x27;t handle one time</li>
            <li> The shaving experience is very Panasonic--they compromise just a bit on the closeness of the shave</li>
            <li> the whole</li>
            <li> this shaver can really shave.  </li>
            <li> My razor is always fully charged and fast.</li>
            <li> so can&#x27;t say much for the face</li>
            <li> HIghly recommended!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a reasonably priced electric razor.</li>
            <li> I asked if I could have it since he doesn&#x27;t really like it, but he wouldn&#x27;t give it up.</li>
            <li> It prevents irritation that I get sometimes from the regular safety blades yet provides a smooth and close shave.</li>
            <li> Another big bonus with this device is cleanup - which is about as smooth and painless as it gets.  </li>
            <li> this thing work well and is really convienient</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The Milano&#x27;s aesthetic is very pleasing.  </li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t work from the first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like it because the cutter head is very bulky.  </li>
            <li> no International voltage adaptor available from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I also like the stand that is also a charger - very convenient.  </li>
            <li> I can still get a closer shave with a blade, but this is getting real close to that benchmark.</li>
            <li> Some cut much closer, hold a longer charge, do self cleaning</li>
            <li> I expected a much better shaver.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very quiet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My father-in-law said it really didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> The advertising for this razor is very misleading.</li>
            <li> It works well on many other body</li>
            <li> I am quite happy with my new Panasonic but it doesn&#x27;t seem to shave the hairs as close as the Norelco did, 5 o&#x27;clock shadow shows up a little earlier.</li>
            <li> High quality construction, with a smart battery</li>
            <li> (Look for the bright red light, hard to miss!)</li>
            <li> With the push of a button two shutters open on the shaver and he just holds it under the running water to clean it out.</li>
            <li> to clean simply by rinsing in water&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> with that in mind, Panasonic has actually innovated a bit so that you can really clean the shaver by rinsing it.  </li>
            <li> Not so much the case with my older model.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In particular, if you&#x27;ve used other electric razors and not been too happy with them, either due to skin irritation or to a not-especially-good shave, this might be for you.</li>
            <li> For shaving it took more time than conventional razor</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve given it now three weeks and have gone back to the blade two times in between because the shave was so irregular I wasn&#x27;t presentable for special occasions.</li>
            <li> shaver works fine with gel, foam, or dry.</li>
            <li> This electric razor to me is a pretty close feel to your old school foam/razor experience without the cuts and mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was the first razor I bought for my 15 yr old son.</li>
            <li> The hot water and steam helps get your beard soft and standing up.</li>
            <li> Pana makes a big deal over how convenient and quick this is, but realistically the old \\&quot;pop the head off and rinse\\&quot; system on prior Panas was just as easy and quick.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My current shaver is getting quite old (but still runs just fine)</li>
            <li> Oh well, live and learn!...........</li>
            <li> : I have now tried a water only shave and shaves with gel, clearly a disapointment, the \\&quot;5 o&#x27;clock shadow\\&quot; is evident somewhere between 10 and 11 AM, and to top it off, I see that Norelco&#x27;s shaver heads have gone back to having slots to get the longer whiskers</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lightweight, easy to hold and control, and sharp enough to cleanly zip through 3-5 days of beard growth, the Panasonic ES-SL41-S</li>
            <li> This model does not have all the whistles and bells; however, it does shave  better than previous models.  </li>
            <li> This one is a lot less, and does a respectable job.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t some company make a decent razor for under $100?</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older, my skin seems to have gotten thinner</li>
            <li> This product gives a decent shave and prevents razor burn when used in the shower.</li>
            <li> My Braun shaver is waterproof, but is not really meant for a wet shave, so this one is superior in that</li>
            <li> As the battery grows older, 2 shaves will be the maximum.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ONLY used disposable razors (most recently the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent razor for the price</li>
            <li> My older one with more battery capacity is my travel unit (no charger if the travel is less than a week).</li>
            <li> The trimmer is decent as well.</li>
            <li> I had an older Panasonic Wet-Dry that I bought 15 years ago for under $40</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried more expensive brands and this one is a sure stand-out.  </li>
            <li> It has a VERY solid build quality, a long lasting battery, and good aesthetics.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t charge to different voltage but a great product ended up buying one locally and it works great but due to different voltage no good .</li>
            <li> Milano is one of the more economical versions of Panasonic&#x27;s Wet-Dry series, but it uses the same blades and head as the more expensive ES-LT41.  </li>
            <li> that said I highly recommend this shaver as body groomer.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this device to men who shave.</li>
            <li> It leaves a lot to be desired and is highly over rated.</li>
            <li> Its fine if you want to just drag it across your face like a lawn mower, but it can&#x27;t do any edging or detail work.  </li>
            <li> knock a star off this shaver for lack of a brush, and it could use a little more power.  </li>
            <li> knock a star off this shaver for lack of a brush, and it could use a little more power.  </li>
            <li> so I have to spend some extra time there; but overall, it&#x27;s the best wet dry shaver so far.  </li>
            <li> I was happily surprised at just how well this shaver came clean with a simple rinse, even without removing the foil.  </li>
            <li> Men who have more sensitive skin will like the fact that the Panasonic ES-SI41-S Milano can be used with shaving cream for a more comfortable, less irritating shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave clean, and it takes so long to get any shave!</li>
            <li> The only thing I could recommend would be to make the system&#x27;s blades sensitive enough to be able to remove even the smallest or toughest hairs on my neck.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;d still rather just shave with a normal razor if I want that clean-cut look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Works well, and this is now my normal home razor that lives in the charger.</li>
            <li> normally don&#x27;t take time to write reviews, but at $50, this razor is a steal.</li>
            <li> Does a nice job wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> I like that it is light and that it shaves really close comfortably, and especially in the hard to get places--even for those with necks with angular planes.</li>
            <li> Cleaning is extremely easy with the clips that you pull down and run the shaver under the faucet.  </li>
            <li> Only issue, which is probably more due to the foil vs rotary make, is that it can sometimes be a bit tricky to get into certain places, near the nose, edges of the jawline.  </li>
            <li> It gets 5 stars from me due to its close, comfortable, and convenient shave.</li>
            <li> it works really good wet with a little bit of shave cream</li>
            <li> Being new to electric razors</li>
            <li> This shaver provides a decent shave and, with its \\&quot;water shutters\\&quot;, is easier to clean than other shavers which require you to pop off the cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I clean it using water but have yet to wet shave.</li>
            <li> I prefer shavers with much less bulky cutter heads that make it easy to visualize the line of cut.  </li>
            <li> it works very well and gives a nice shave without irritating the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;easy</li>
            <li> /&gt;If this one lasts as long as my first Panasonic wet-dry, I will not need another one until 2027!</li>
            <li> I have found their customer service/technical support people to be very professional</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shaver in place of the old fashioned razor blade.</li>
            <li> The shaving cream gets into the razor, of course, so I found myself opening the cleaning clips and rinsing the razor very frequently during a shave.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, so after reading some online reviews, I came across this electric razor.  </li>
            <li> Instead of popping up parallel to the handle (like most modern shavers) Pana has the trimmer blade pop up at a strange 60 degree angle off the back of the handle.</li>
            <li> Instead of popping up parallel to the handle (like most modern shavers) Pana has the trimmer blade pop up at a strange 60 degree angle off the back of the handle.</li>
            <li> This is a relatively small razor that easily fits on my crowded vanity without taking up much space.</li>
            <li> That being said,  skip this shaver and buy a higher end model such as http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B001DNE3KQ/ref&#x3D;mp_s_a_1_2?qid&#x3D;1382876923&amp;sr&#x3D;8-2&amp;pi&#x3D;AC_SX110_SY165_QL70&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After several days he&#x27;s mastered it and the only thing we have to do is make sure it&#x27;s cleaned well occasionally.  </li>
            <li> However, I am on my second one because the button on the first one gave out after 6 months.</li>
            <li> It is the first time he actually enjoys using an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are two inner blades and the foil itself has a cutter that trims longer hairs so that they are accessible to the inner blade.</li>
            <li> got my first electric razor recently,</li>
            <li> But only pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Prior to using this I used a regular razor and it would take one or two times to feel like my face was fully clean.  </li>
            <li> but he said he still prefers the regular shaver as he still has to go over the same spot 2-3 times to clean it...</li>
            <li> He says it&#x27;s good for a quick job (like when he&#x27;s running late) or for a Saturday shave when it doesn&#x27;t really matter, but it doesn&#x27;t get close enough for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> wear a long Van Dyke style beard and can shave right up to the edge without the Panasonic grabbing onto the longer hair like some razors like to</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the same Braun self cleaning shaver for over 5 years and wanted to try something new as I was temporarily relocating and didn&#x27;t want to lug around the large base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I must say that the Panasonic is easily on par with these two heavy industry hitters.  </li>
            <li> However, I still gave the shaver 3-stars as I thought the (dry) shave was pretty decent</li>
            <li> I own a top-of-the-line model, which I&#x27;ve used daily for the past two years.</li>
            <li> In my \\&quot;skip-a-day\\&quot; test, this shaver really struggled to knock down two days worth of stubble.  </li>
            <li> He was really pleased that the shaver could be used on both wet and dry skin!</li>
            <li> is fully clear of stubble.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a replacement for my old Remington razor in case it quit working.  </li>
            <li> Take a lot time to complete as compared to manual way of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sada</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll pass it through to my 16 year old son, so he can try it</li>
            <li> Bought this for a 50 year old man that had never shaved himself.  </li>
            <li> thought this thing would be convenient but my simple manual razor is so much</li>
            <li> If you take long hot showers this is the shaver for you.  </li>
            <li> The grip is not heavily textured and may be slippery if used in the shower with shaving</li>
            <li> That design was much easier to get into the curved throat area and just above the chin.</li>
            <li> So far, he loves it.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This razor is different however and he really likes it.  </li>
            <li> An electric razor isn&#x27;t a yearly purchase and it&#x27;s been at least five years, maybe more since I&#x27;ve bought one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very convenient too as I can shave while showering rather than standing above the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> problems with the old Pana shavers I used were these:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> loud buzzsaw noise&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> If a trimmer matters that much to you, you may want to get a separate trimmer and think of this Milano model as only a shaver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If a trimmer matters that much to you, you may want to get a separate trimmer and think of this Milano model as only a shaver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was bought for my 96 year old dad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nowhere near manual blade close.</li>
            <li> We purchased this for our 13 year old, yes I said 13.  </li>
            <li> Our water is so soft we did not need shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> The shaver comes with a nice charging stand that glows red at the base to let you know it is charging as well as a clear plastic protective cover for when you need to travel with it or for just keeping it handy laying around.</li>
            <li> and I was unable to get a good view of the lines with this shaver.  </li>
            <li> have thick and course facial hair and the Panasonic mow right through it leaving my face totally smooth and non</li>
            <li> the replacement foils aren&#x27;t much less than a whole new razor and this one is an absolute dream.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a dry shaver, it gives a slight bit of irritation--but nothing I notice for more than a minute or so.</li>
            <li> blades are a lot closer than the older models, but this might just be because my last one was getting old.</li>
            <li> far as shave quality goes - my overall impression is that it is &#x27;decent.&#x27;  </li>
            <li> It is small enough to fit on my bathroom vanity without taking up much space.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that shavers that I have owned in the past were able to be wall mounted.  </li>
            <li> I use it as dry as wet with shaving lotion and has been working fine.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Panasonic ES-SI41-S Shaver, Milano Rechargeable with Nanotech Blades, 3-Blade Arc, 3 Wet-Dry\\&quot; provides a close, comfortable shave for men with average facial hair.  </li>
            <li> Second, the blades have been reconfigured by Panasonic to loop higher and these loops are set wider apart then even their last year&#x27;s model.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It was different in one way: I did not get razor burn from the first use or any subsequent use.</li>
            <li> Panasonic&#x27;s Milano electric shaver is a good, all around electric shaver that I&#x27;ve been using for the past few weeks, 1 of which was on the road while I traveled for business.  </li>
            <li> the battery damage what can only be connected to 110V, who has softer chin harder will be shaved, not a bad product</li>
            <li> It can be cleaned easily, by sluicing water into the head with two little gates you can open to allow the water to flow out.</li>
            <li> I packed the Milano in my travel kit and gave it near daily use over 6 nights and did not need to re-charge it and was able to use it a few times back at home before the power drained out.  </li>
            <li> It only takes a few passes to get a complete shave, although 1 pass is fine if i shave often.</li>
            <li> This shaver being a little light on power, takes about twice the time for me to get the same shave I get with my Braun, so for me personally I would not use it in the shower because I feel like I&#x27;m draining my entire hot water heater.  </li>
            <li> I much prefer the single foil and one cutter that my old shaver had.  </li>
            <li> Still, this is a small price to pay considering the fact that I am pain and embracement free after each shave.</li>
            <li> This is a small and attractive wet/dry shaver with a small trimmer attachment on the back for sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a charging</li>
            <li> Wahls and Remmingtons seem to give a closer shave but are more irritating for me and those rotary headed types are gentle but not close enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I were limited to the $50-$60 range, I would certainly consider this shaver.  </li>
            <li> If I were limited to the $50-$60 range, I would certainly consider this shaver.  </li>
            <li> The blades don&#x27;t pivot front to back or right to left, but the shape of the foil is such that this doesn&#x27;t seem to hamper the shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll get the same razor when I need a new blade unit.  </li>
            <li> It was a bit more expensive, but not by much</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband and he wants a different one because this one doesn&#x27;t shave close enough</li>
            <li> and I have only had one razor that cuts it well, one with extra foils that can cut very close.</li>
            <li> He is already in the shower, it goes right down the drain.</li>
            <li> and I use that very frequent, but overall 2 out of 5 for me.</li>
            <li> When I first tried the unit dry and harkening back to my days using a Remington foil shaver, I didn&#x27;t think it gave me a close shave</li>
            <li> The Panasonic is not able to move around your face easy enough</li>
            <li> As I get older, my stubble seems to get more difficult to shave.  </li>
            <li> I actually prefer this shaver when I am traveling because it fits right in my toiletry bag along with my other things.  </li>
            <li> The shaver is a little more than six inches tall, two-and-a-half inches wide with a silver blue finish.</li>
            <li> Blades generally need replaced about every six months to ensure a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Generally, it takes a number of passes at a number of angles before my shave iscomplete, but that is par for the course with an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> Two parts, the Panasonic wet-dry razors in general, and this one specifically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> only clear miss here is the pop-up trimmer.</li>
            <li> only clear miss here is the pop-up trimmer.</li>
            <li> So far don&#x27;t like the way it shaves, to get a close shave u need to go over the same place over and over and no indication when it needs to be charged and when it is charged</li>
            <li> Same area again and again to complete, but</li>
            <li> Its harder to cut those pesky whiskers with this straight type unit.</li>
            <li> Third, the bottom of the shaver head beneath the foil is flatter, without the deep channels and valleys that are so common in most shavers.</li>
            <li> Now I just take my old Panasonic with its smaller charging cord along when I&#x27;m on the road, and use this sports car of an electric razor while I&#x27;m home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really give as close a shave as I expected.</li>
            <li> The only reason it doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because it didn&#x27;t make me say WOW.</li>
            <li> I try cutting my whiskers, I need to go over my face and neck repeatedly and still don&#x27;t get a good shave.  </li>
            <li> other problem I had, and a far more significant one, was that after a few days of shaving with this razor I started to develop hard, red nubbles on my upper cheeks and the sides of my neck.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it does not move easily on my face.</li>
            <li> but that means it is only worth half the value.</li>
            <li> other thing I like is the handle is more narrow and lighter overall.</li>
            <li> The charger is bulky and made of hard plastic; it takes up significant space in a shaving kit and, if subjected to pressure/weight, may crack.  </li>
            <li> Some of the other ones are the size of sledge hammer (really for shaving)?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also making shaving more cumbersome, since I have a goatee, I&#x27;m forced to use my disposable anyway to cut in the edges of the goatee (as the small sideburn trimmer on the shaver doesn&#x27;t work very well for anything besides sideburns).  </li>
            <li> After shaving my skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight or hot and there are no tender or irritated spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The battery life is great and the fact that you can wet shave is another plus,  all of that being said I find that a rotary seems to be faster and less irritating.</li>
            <li> I never dry shave and have never tried with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The handle is smaller than other versions of Panasonic Wet-Dry Shavers and, for men with larger hands, may not be as comfortable to grip as other models.  </li>
            <li> motor is much quieter than other electrics I have used, especially the Braun 9500 series.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;ve used it on my neck and it worked OK - leaves behind some hairs though that lay flat</li>
            <li> the trimmer flips back down a little too easily for my tastes.  </li>
            <li> but it also gives me a few extra minutes of standing under the hot water in the morning.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this one for my other residence simply due to the very positive reviews this shaver got on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I like the little charging stand, it doesn&#x27;t take up much counter space.</li>
            <li> your beard is a little long, use the trimmer first, then go over it with the screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can use shaving cream with it which I highly recommend as it cuts down on shaving irritation and bumps that I seem to only get with electric razors.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This works well enough for me and was about the right price, but after only one year of use, the battery hardly holds a charge anymore.</li>
            <li> ES-S141S, nicknamed \\&quot;Milano\\&quot; for some unknown reason, is much lighter and easier to handle than my other Panasonic.</li>
            <li> adjust,\\&quot; since I&#x27;m not sure how much face I&#x27;d have left after that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can go over the same spot of skin 10 times and you just can&#x27;t get it clear which leaves you with messed up spots with beard on your face after trying to shave for half an hour.</li>
            <li> well im not sure about this product&#x27;s brand really panasonic?</li>
            <li> It does take a little getting use to a new razor</li>
            <li> I now shave prior to my shower with completely dry skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although it&#x27;s wet/dry, I&#x27;d recommend using it dry, unless you&#x27;re using an electric-shaver gel, which acts differently from shaving cream (it stands the hair up instead of softening it).</li>
            <li> I personally can&#x27;t comment on using it in the shower, because I just use it dry.</li>
            <li> Additionally, if you are running low on power, there is no real way to use the shaver without giving it an extra charge.  </li>
            <li> Not only is it a standard electric shaver, but I could also use it wet in the shower with shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Taking a small motorized device into a hot shower every day and running wet shaving gel through it is quite the test, and I hope this mid-priced Milano will dispel my worries.</li>
            <li> Taking a small motorized device into a hot shower every day and running wet shaving gel through it is quite the test, and I hope this mid-priced Milano will dispel my worries.</li>
            <li> I do use it as a wet shaver (never dry) using a pre-shave skin oil and gel shave creme.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given it 3+ months, finally gave up and ordered a new Norelco AT830.....foil shavers have not worked for me in the past and still don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Close shave &amp; holds charge long time, goodbye Norelco...</li>
            <li> I hope this razor works for him for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> My disabled Adult child has the coarsest beard ever, and I have to shave him every day.</li>
            <li> If it lasts as long as advertised it will be cost saving, too.</li>
            <li> I also only wet shave in the shower using shaving cream with this.</li>
            <li> I have owned three different Panasonic wet / drys before now.</li>
            <li> The rechargeable battery can be replaced at a service center (USA only).</li>
            <li> Although the shaver head is smaller, it delivers a shave of equal quality, in slightly less time.</li>
            <li> Panasonic is usually such a great brand -- very disappointed in this.</li>
            <li> will require a few passes to finish but the overall sensation is very gentle and have yet to experience any negative post shave effects on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Usually failure right after warranty expires would sour me on a given product /</li>
            <li> lower powered, has a smaller shaving surface and does not shave as close as the other panasonics I have</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although the Panasonic ES-SI41-S Milano operates at a lower RPM than other Panasonic Wet-Dry models, the lesser speed does not impact its utility.  </li>
            <li> It shaves with no irritation and no cuts, and the shave lasts as long or longer than a Fusion shave (i.e. no five o&#x27;clock shadow until maybe eight or nine o&#x27;clock!).</li>
            <li> I have very rough facial hair, and it took about a week to get used to using this, but now I can shave daily in just a couple of minutes, compared to every other day with a blade.</li>
            <li> The problem may be that I have very course facial hair, but this is just a guess - either way, I can clearly not use this alone on a daily basis as it would be vary obvious in the office how poor and uneven the shave</li>
            <li> No more of him opening up his electric shaver and using that little brush to clean it and leaving all those little hairs on the sink that he never quite gets all cleaned up.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this shaver very long</li>
            <li> It takes a very long time to shave dry</li>
            <li> i gave the SI41 a dry test run.... &amp; was duly impressed.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> : It works well dry</li>
            <li> I tend to use the shaver dry</li>
            <li> I usually dry shave on the go (it is my travel razor)</li>
            <li> I have tried two dry electronic razors and one wet/dry like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Downloaded them off the web - but diagrams were small and it wasn&#x27;t immediately clear to me who to operate the cleaning shutter.</li>
            <li> It works well and the battery lasts as long as expected.  </li>
            <li> of course you loose some fancy things like a battery meter and stuff like that with this one</li>
            <li> And the charger is 120 v only, so don&#x27;t plan on taking it overseas without a step down transformer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always dry shaved, so that&#x27;s the way I&#x27;ve been using it, comparing apples to apples!..............</li>
            <li> used dry and wet without irritation</li>
            <li> It works dry &amp; wet  and cleans with a flush of tap water.</li>
            <li> and that you can use it wet or dry</li>
            <li> The Norelcos used to have slots in their cutters, but the last 2 only have had small holes for the whiskers to go through.</li>
            <li> I am already looking forward to trying it in the shower as it is both a wet &amp; dry</li>
            <li> work as well dry as it does wet</li>
            <li> Never gave a close shave whether wet or dry, even when using shave gels specifically designed for electric razors.</li>
            <li> Quiet, with considerably less vibration than Remington.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a trimmer on the back of the shaver that pops up at a slight angle.  </li>
            <li> It once was said Panasonic was only slightly ahead of their time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the razor both wet and dry.</li>
            <li> If you buy this razor, plan on having an extra half hour to shave.</li>
            <li> it takes a long time to charge up.&lt;br /&gt;Its lite but hasint the power of other razers.</li>
            <li> I bought it due to its small size and modest foil area.</li>
            <li> I found the little pop-out sideburn shaver attachment worked well for finishing up,  But all-in-all it lacked the versatility of a standard bladed razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I paid $30 a few years back for my Remington.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband who has to be careful not to cut himself as he is on blood thinners.</li>
            <li> The razor is a bit heavier than I expected</li>
            <li> I always keep the face or the shaver head wet when shaving.  </li>
            <li> My aging dad is getting uh a bit forgetful and cranky.</li>
            <li> Almost works with wet shave.</li>
            <li> I havent tried wet shaving yet.</li>
            <li> shave wet or in the shower&lt;br /&gt;Unit</li>
            <li> I continue to use it from time to time and recommend it to people who like to shave wet or in the shower but want the convenience (and no nicks) of an electric.</li>
            <li> it slipping and</li>
            <li> Because I have owned the higher-end models, I was curious to see how this less-expensive version would perform.</li>
            <li> The battery on the razor goes dead in a short amount of time ,I have to make a lot of passes in ordered to get shaved.</li>
            <li> It does not cut the hair in the neck area like i expected .</li>
            <li> So when I saw that this Panasonic shaver could be used wet, and even with shaving cream, I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot.</li>
            <li> I will stick with the Panasonic for a while longer because I don&#x27;t want to totally waste my money, but I will go back to a Norelco sometime soon.</li>
            <li> It is an electric razor that does what is expected from an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> beard is rough and thick after shaving still considerable hair still there</li>
            <li> I opted to buy a less expensive model, and as I read the reviews here, I concur that this bad boy gave me an amazingly close shave the first time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> if you know what I mean... that area is only for a regular razor...</li>
            <li> I like the ability to use it in the shower, but it just does not shave as closely as my other electric razors.</li>
            <li> I have to charge this up about every other day now.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Every other razor</li>
            <li> This shaver has no bells or whistles, compared to Panasonics other razors.</li>
            <li> I have bought my husband other electric shavers, and at some point they all end up under the bathroom sink.</li>
            <li> , I use it every other day).</li>
            <li> I have used an electric shaver in the past, for years I used a Rototrack but stopped because it was screwing up my facial hairs, but for app.</li>
            <li> and my skin has never been irritated like other razors.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I use this with shaving cream and at other times i take it in to the shower and use nothing but running water while running the blade.  </li>
            <li> It runs at a slower RPM, does not use a linear system like some other Panas</li>
            <li> It runs at a slower RPM, does not use a linear system like some other Panas</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re using it dry, do it over the sink to catch those little hair remnants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The missing features, like soft or hard adjustments are pretty much useless anyways.</li>
            <li> I have very thick coarse facial hair, and this razor does not cut it and it takes longer to shave with this vs a manual razor.</li>
            <li> A wet dry electric razor has been what I&#x27;ve been using for the past five years.  </li>
            <li> And not a single failure to cut/hair pull</li>
            <li> closeness of the shave doesn&#x27;t approach even the Braun, let alone blades, and while shaving wet did get the shave a little closer, and shaving cream closer still, I found the process problematic.</li>
            <li> I have a tough beard and sensitive skin</li>
            <li> not real good dry</li>
            <li> the charging cradle ruins this for travel.....</li>
            <li> i am not sure why i waited so long to use an electric razor...</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s okay, I suppose, if you plop the shaver on the base every day when you&#x27;re done shaving, but is a problem if you are the type that likes to run the shaver down before you</li>
            <li> but this allows for a shave that is far less irritating.  </li>
            <li> I bought this razor hoping it would help cut down the time I have to spend shaving on my neck.</li>
            <li> all comes down to what you&#x27;re looking for in a shaver.  </li>
            <li> all comes down to what you&#x27;re looking for in a shaver.  </li>
            <li> when I realized that my beard had been standing up when I was in the shower and after the shower, it laid down and felt smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now for the down side.</li>
            <li> Just keep up on your shave because this can&#x27;t \\&quot;hack\\&quot; down a forest of hair</li>
            <li> The handle is made of plastic and is slightly curved.</li>
            <li> less than 2 minutes</li>
            <li> Replacement blades cost about $28 on Amazon; less if you \\&quot;subscribe and save.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> : 1) it is narrower than I&#x27;d like it--less than half the size of the shave head itself.  </li>
            <li> Unlike the previous models that I didn&#x27;t keep charged all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What used to take me 3-5 minutes to do (with needed lather), now takes me less than a minute.  </li>
            <li> bulky charger makes this model less functional for travel.</li>
            <li> &quot; Men&#x27;s 3-Blade Wet-Dry Shaver with Nanotech Blades exceeded all previous electric shaver experiences.</li>
            <li> The head does not pivot, so you will have to go over a few trouble spots carefully and sometimes repeatedly (like the chin, and jawline)</li>
            <li> Previous I had owned a rotary shaver but decided to give this model a try.</li>
            <li> My Braun shaver doesn&#x27;t get bogged down at all.  </li>
            <li> These work easily with the provided charging base but do pose a problem</li>
            <li> This tool works well if you use it wet with shaving cream but labors on a dry face with a tough beard .  </li>
            <li> Both have worked exceedingly well with little maintenance.</li>
            <li> and he still has a little stubble.</li>
            <li> Gave a close shave with little to no irritation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other electrics in the past - Braun, Philips -</li>
            <li> have tried other electric razors in the past, but they have all been disappointments.</li>
            <li> Put a little liquid soap on the foils, splash on some water and run for a minute.</li>
            <li> The charging stand holds the razor vertically so it takes up little counter</li>
            <li> It is close enough for me and still less irritating than my Remmington.  </li>
            <li> I have very carefully groomed and maintained sideburns and a small mustache</li>
            <li> It also does not have any of those idiotic gimmicks like modern Brauns have (the alcohol auto cleaning systems that quintuples the cost of ownership by requiring endless amounts of \\&quot;QuikEvap\\&quot; alcohol cartridges).</li>
            <li> It also does not have any of those idiotic gimmicks like modern Brauns have (the alcohol auto cleaning systems that quintuples the cost of ownership by requiring endless amounts of \\&quot;QuikEvap\\&quot; alcohol cartridges).</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it takes three times longer to shave with than my old Remington razor.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday on my head and face</li>
            <li> No I&#x27;ve decided it was just a waste of money and will return definitively to the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He was having trouble seeing and using a razor.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard.</li>
            <li> Even though this razor is inexpensive, it is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> but He is a firm believer in Panasonic.</li>
            <li> But the Panasonic ES-Sl41-S has the three things needed that will keep him using it everyday.</li>
            <li> Frustrating, I am going to  go back to Gillette!</li>
            <li> I was out a few weeks ago and saw this model, ES-SL41-S</li>
            <li> Keep in mind this is a few hairs</li>
            <li> So I was on a trip with a few friends and I noticed one of them had this shaver.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottomline is I like it, but it looks like for me I am unable to completely give up the disposable in order to cut in around my goatee and remove the hair that the Panazonic missed.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t produce a heavy beard.</li>
            <li> I have charged overnight and after two and a half week, it still runs!</li>
            <li> For whatever reason, I found the wet shave option to be pretty worthless.  </li>
            <li> , the shaver has a dry shave mode, although it is unlikely you&#x27;ll abandon the wet shave after you and your spouse appreciate the closeness that can be achieved in the shower.</li>
            <li> the down side, as compared say with the Panasonic ES8103, it&#x27;s hard to tell when this razor is fully charged in its cradle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m moving to China next month, this device is useless to me.</li>
            <li> Usual Amazon prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> I usually stick to the Remington products but decided to give this one a shot.  </li>
            <li> And no more cords to plug in to recharge.</li>
            <li> : If you want to shave in the car or office with this I would warn you about lots of small hairs that fall out of the shaver onto your clothes/desk.</li>
            <li> Overall you can&#x27;t go wrong with this shaver.</li>
            <li> In fact, the shave was closer than the usual blade shave.</li>
            <li> The shaver seems sturdy and Pana now gives you a 2 year warranty, versus the 1 year they gave buyers on models in the past.</li>
            <li> The shaver seems sturdy and Pana now gives you a 2 year warranty, versus the 1 year they gave buyers on models in the past.</li>
            <li> I was desperate to find a replacement for a 5 year old Norelco and fixated on a Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by slick advertising.</li>
            <li> I have a very heavy beard.</li>
            <li> If the shave has one flaw its that I found it to be very irritating and had mixed results when shaving lower on my neck.</li>
            <li> However, I soon gave this us as I found that the shaver gave me an very uneven cut - which forced me to try again at the sink once I had finished showering.  </li>
            <li> If in the car that would mean small hairs on your clothes and in your car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And, &#x27;convenient?&amp;#34;  Hardly: the hard plastic,</li>
            <li> Switched from a four year old rotary to this bad boy.  </li>
            <li> I can use a gel shaving cream, but don&#x27;t be in a rush to get done.&lt;br /&gt;You will be shaving areas at least twice.</li>
            <li> Just go slow and let the shaver do&lt;br /&gt;the work.</li>
            <li> After having stopped using the razor, they&#x27;re slowly going away.</li>
            <li> poor durability - dies a few months after warranty.</li>
            <li> That said, I was still a little disappointed that they didn&#x27;t supply the traditional cleaning brush...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s neat, there are no more hairs all over the sink!</li>
            <li> I mean groin/pubic area, etc.</li>
            <li> It runs to slow, and is a very small shaver.</li>
            <li> The only reason for 4 star rating is I would still like to compare it to the very expensive razors to see the difference.  </li>
            <li> Im in the Army and hate using a normal razor everymorning and</li>
            <li> The cutter head is so bulky with the frame of the shaving foil extending so far beyond the cutting area that I had a difficult time seeing where I was shaving.  </li>
            <li> not a good shaver.amazon will not take the return.</li>
            <li> When I tried it wet, it felt like it wasn&#x27;t cutting as close as my rotary electric</li>
            <li> And even then its not a good shave.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using an electric shaver in the past but had bad experiences as it caused bad irritation on my skin but this shaver doesn&#x27;t give me any irritation yet provides a very close shave.</li>
            <li> Dry shave almost impossible.</li>
            <li> All of the razors made now are poor in quality and performance but not inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> total crap you will spend 15 minutes and still need a shave..</li>
            <li> Even worse, the shaver has no indicator, so you have no clue when it needs to be charged.</li>
            <li> That means that if you travel, you will have to take the larger base along with you.  </li>
            <li> poor shave&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am very disappointed and since I don&#x27;t live in the US, I can&#x27;t return.</li>
            <li> This odd angle makes using the trimmer inconvenient and awkward.</li>
            <li> This odd angle makes using the trimmer inconvenient and awkward.</li>
            <li> This is my third electric razor and it is the worst of the bunch.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my husband did not like it and we returned it.</li>
            <li> My husband says it doesn&#x27;t seem to cut as well as his Remington, but then again the Remington was 3 times as expensive and cannot be taken in the shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s useless to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s unfair to expect this shaver to match the features and power of my Braun 7-760cc that costs $175.  </li>
            <li> maybe fake product or something,.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> problem is, after owning the razor for just six months, the motor has failed.</li>
            <li> Try it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was disappointed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I&#x27;m not going to continue shaving with it for 30 days to \\&quot;let my face</li>
            <li> Pound for pound and $ for $, you absolutely can&#x27;t go wrong with this shaver.</li>
            <li> I wsa stuck on Remington for the longest time...; afraid to try anything else.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The trimmer is in an awkward spot It pops up perpendicular to the shaving head on the reverse side of the handle.</li>
            <li> Pop off the foils to thoroughly rinse the cutting blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But i functioning is so bad.</li>
            <li> , this bad boy has the speed &amp; power to get the job done.</li>
            <li> I used Remington&#x27;s for 15+ years and resided to an understanding that electric razors resulted in bad shave.  </li>
            <li> I use to use the philips/norelco body groomer but had bad irritation from the trimmers on each end of  the foil.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re like me and have tried all the \\&quot;body groomer\\&quot; shavers out there and had bad irritation from them - buy this thing.</li>
            <li> This is way safer then the philips/norelco body groomer line of products because of the lack of trimmers which cut/cause bad irritation.</li>
            <li> For $29 this wasn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> (I suppose you could try plugging it in and using the shaver base and all, but that would be quite awkward.)  </li>
            <li> a charging base</li>
            <li> /&gt;Inside the package you will find the shaver itself, a charging base, and the cord.</li>
            <li> The shaver does not have a place for a cord to connect at the base.  </li>
            <li> but I had a beard for 12 years because I hate to shave.</li>
            <li> Pathetic performance.</li>
            <li> (Terrible shaving experience!)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Worst shaver ever.</li>
            <li> This is probably the worst electric shaver I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> .. Horrible.  </li>
            <li> The shave is awful!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have a very heavy beard. This razor does a good job. It is easy to clean and goes for almost a week without charging. Since ther is no cord I can shave out side and enjoy a cup of joe.</li>
            <li> This is my third electric razor and it is the worst of the bunch. I like the ability to use it in the shower, but it just does not shave as closely as my other electric razors. I&#x27;ve used it for over a month and while it is good for keeping the scruff factor down, I still have to use a straight razor to clean up after the electric razor. I&#x27;ve tried using it in and out of the shower with the same results - it just doesn&#x27;t cut that closely.</li>
            <li> This shaver is good if  you have nothing important or formal to go to. I have very thick coarse facial hair, and this razor does not cut it and it takes longer to shave with this vs a manual razor. The trimmer is the best part of the razor and I use that very frequent, but overall 2 out of 5 for me.</li>
            <li> I have one and loved it but the razor somehow got a hole in it and I can&#x27;t find a replacement blade. Do they make one?</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my husband did not like it and we returned it. It did not shave close enough and had to re-shave with a regular razor.</li>
            <li> like it, but works only with battery,not  with the electric cord,like the one I had before,but is good</li>
            <li> This works well enough for me and was about the right price, but after only one year of use, the battery hardly holds a charge anymore. I have to charge this up about every other day now.&lt;br /&gt;I switched to this style of razor from the three circular foils variety and much prefer this kind.</li>
            <li> Totally dissatisfied...returned product for refund.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift for my husband. First thing he said was that it gave a comfortable shave.  The trimmer portion of the razor works well also.</li>
            <li> Having owned Norelco, Braun &amp; Remington razors - this by far is the most comfortable electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used and gives a shave almost as good as a blade.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my Son and it stopped working 30 days after purchase.  Now I have to pay to send it to Panasonic for repair.  Biggest piece of Junk ever. I have a Braun series 5,  never and issue in 10 yrs.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son in February thinking it would last and save money on razor blades. Well, it stopped working this week meaning the cost of ownership is over $8 a month. As another reviewer mentioned it is not the most efficient razor and the cost of ownership makes purchasing razors of the most expensive kind inexpensive in comparison. This may be an exception but I doubt it because I have used Panasonic women&#x27;s razors with similar results. After reflecting on their history, it makes me wonder why I even purchased this item!</li>
            <li> The razor is very quiet.  Unfortunately, it takes three times longer to shave with than my old Remington razor.  It doesn&#x27;t run as fast and can&#x27;t handle a couple of days beard growth.  I have to go over and over each area to eventually get it shaved.  All of the razors made now are poor in quality and performance but not inexpensive.  I was looking for a replacement for my old Remington razor in case it quit working.  I paid $30 a few years back for my Remington.  I did find the same Remington razor on-line for over $300.  Can&#x27;t some company make a decent razor for under $100?</li>
            <li> I use it everyday on my head and face</li>
            <li> So far don&#x27;t like the way it shaves, to get a close shave u need to go over the same place over and over and no indication when it needs to be charged and when it is charged</li>
            <li> I bought this because one of the reviews said that it shaves just as well and quick as Panasonic&#x27;s higher end Arc 4 shavers, it does not. This feels like a very solid shaver and may be one of the best in this price range for all I know. It takes about twice as long to get a good shave with this compared to the ES8243A and especially the ES-LA63, which is my favorite. I ordered another ES-LA63 from amazon and took my ES-SL41-3 back to Target when it arrived. There&#x27;s no comparison to the blades and multi-pivoting heads of the better shavers and the smoothness of the 63.</li>
            <li> I love panasonic shavers,  I have tried every brand of shaver out there and panasonic beats them hands down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick and course facial hair and the Panasonic mow right through it leaving my face totally smooth and non irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; That being said,  skip this shaver and buy a higher end model such as http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B001DNE3KQ/ref&#x3D;mp_s_a_1_2?qid&#x3D;1382876923&amp;sr&#x3D;8-2&amp;pi&#x3D;AC_SX110_SY165_QL70&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver I am reviewing is slower,  lower powered, has a smaller shaving surface and does not shave as close as the other panasonics I have owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if you read the charging instructions it says not to charge the shaver in the bathroom or shower room????&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where should I charge it? In the garage?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need the highest end model all the bells and whistles and cleaning station,  but spend the extra $30 for the model in the link.</li>
            <li> Got this for a gift for my father and he said that it works great and is very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> This model does not have all the whistles and bells; however, it does shave  better than previous models.  It is smaller and lighter, which makes it easier to use.  I have charged overnight and after two and a half week, it still runs!</li>
            <li> Works great.  It was a gift and the recipient was very happy with the razor.  He uses it both wet and dry and is happy.</li>
            <li> Another perfect buy. Works great and this charger works perfect with the beard trimmer just in case one charger goes down</li>
            <li> there are definitely better options...no reason to be stuck to this brand.  try a Norelco/Philips and I think you may be more satisfied.</li>
            <li> Very good electric razor.  Does a nice job wet or dry.  Easy to use and does a terrific job under my nose and at the sideburns.  Only can give it a 4 out of 5 since the shave isn&#x27;t as close as a Gillette razor.  Better than Gillette, though, in some ways- I&#x27;ve never had a nick or cut with my Panasonic ES.  Holds a charge well.</li>
            <li> the rasor is so good i liked it it works very well and gives a nice shave without irritating the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;easy to clean easy to use!&lt;br /&gt;the only reason i didn&#x27;t give 5 starts is because of the trim blade the edges are rugged and doesn&#x27;t trim well but who cares!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband who has to be careful not to cut himself as he is on blood thinners. This was my 3rd razor I bought for him. The first, a Remington that cost more broke in a few months, the second a Braun still worked but never gave a close shave (that cost more too)....this gives his a close shave and is easy to clean. He is very happy with it. I would recommend this to anyone needing an electric razor. Just remember an electric razor does not give quite the close shave as a regular razor.</li>
            <li> My brother likes it. I gave this for a gift. It is easy to handle and grip he said. Great!</li>
            <li> pulled my hair on my face. not a good shaver.amazon will not take the return.I am stuck with the razor.shave hair not that good.</li>
            <li> I wanted to have an electric as a change of pace.  I have used an electric many years ago and this one is much better in both the closeness of the shave and the clean-up.  Being able to put it under the tap makes cleaning easy.  This review is based on 3 weeks of use and one charge.  I feel the previous reviews that suggested this was a good value were right.  The only reason for 4 star rating is I would still like to compare it to the very expensive razors to see the difference.  My shave is close so perhaps the difference is a faster shave.  If I were to buy again, I would purchase this razor before spending a lot more to learn what might be better with a more expensive razor.</li>
            <li> Shaver as described.  Works with ease and comfort.  The only drawback is that shavers that I have owned in the past were able to be wall mounted.  This shaver takes up room on my counter.</li>
            <li> Built quality like plastic,metal is good.But i functioning is so bad.For shaving it took more time than conventional razor/blade.&lt;br /&gt;My beard is rough and thick after shaving still considerable hair still there so it was not giving a clean shave at all.I think all electric razor having same problem.So conventional blade is a best method to do shave.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get  clean cut. Same area again and again to complete, but still there are some areas left over. Take a lot time to complete as compared to manual way of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sada</li>
            <li> This is a good razor that is comfortable to use and shaves well. It is small enough to fit on my bathroom vanity without taking up much space. It has a nice sideburn trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comfort:  This is designed well. The on and off button is on the inside of the handle and easy to access with my thumb.  The handle is made of plastic and is slightly curved. When I hold the razor my hand covers the entire handle. The razor is a bit heavier than I expected but it feels fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving Ability:  I use the razor after I take a shower. I don&#x27;t use any shaving cream.  Right now it takes me three times before I feel like face is fully clear of stubble. Prior to using this I used a regular razor and it would take one or two times to feel like my face was fully clean.  I understand as my face gets used to this razor the shaving time should decrease.  Overall I am happy with the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also a sideburn trimmer on the top part of the razor that works great. It is easy to use and trims my sideburns perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Size/charging time:  This is a relatively small razor that easily fits on my crowded vanity without taking up much space. It takes 15 hours to charge so I leave it plugged into an outlet most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning:  This is easy to clean. Basically all you need to do is run it under the faucet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer Service: I called customer service with a question about how long to charge the razor and when the charge indicator light was supposed to light. I was given incorrect information about the charge time. Thankfully I figured this out by finding the information while I was on hold with the agent. Panasonic is a big company that makes a lot of products. I have found their customer service/technical support people to be very professional but at times lacking in knowledge when it comes to certain products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a fine razor that is comfortable to use, easy to clean and is small enough to leave on my vanity all the time. It gives a good shave that I am hoping will get a bit better over time as I get used to the razor and it gets used to my face.</li>
            <li> Works okay for the price. My husband says it doesn&#x27;t seem to cut as well as his Remington, but then again the Remington was 3 times as expensive and cannot be taken in the shower. Maybe it doesn&#x27;t have as many blades?</li>
            <li> I like the razer for the most part, bus it takes a long time to charge up.&lt;br /&gt;Its lite but hasint the power of other razers. I would  have liked a charger with&lt;br /&gt;only the wier connector not the stand. I am not accustomed to it yet, but I would recomend it.&lt;br /&gt;BW</li>
            <li> Pathetic performance. It does not work at all. I use to have a Philips Shaver and that was much cheaper and better than this one</li>
            <li> After 30 something years shaving traditionally, I wanted to get rid of the blades and go electrical.&lt;br /&gt;They told me that, since I have a fairly sensitive skin, electric shaving would be much better, quicker and softer. the advertisement of Panasonic said the same, boy are they wrong.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve given it now three weeks and have gone back to the blade two times in between because the shave was so irregular I wasn&#x27;t presentable for special occasions. No I&#x27;ve decided it was just a waste of money and will return definitively to the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed and since I don&#x27;t live in the US, I can&#x27;t return. I&#x27;ll pass it through to my 16 year old son, so he can try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well so much for electrical shaving.</li>
            <li> Works just like it says. You can use it in the shower which is what I wanted, but this razor in no way shape or form gives you a close shave!</li>
            <li> I got this for my son (for college).  I think I&#x27;ll get the same razor when I need a new blade unit.  I tried it out before my son went to college, and it was better than my more-expensive razor.</li>
            <li> We do adult foster care for individuals with special needs. Bought this for a 50 year old man that had never shaved himself.  After several days he&#x27;s mastered it and the only thing we have to do is make sure it&#x27;s cleaned well occasionally.  I would recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Good charger base&lt;br /&gt;Cleans well&lt;br /&gt;Nice design&lt;br /&gt;Effective on head and face&lt;br /&gt;Have used dry and wet without irritation</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the same Braun self cleaning shaver for over 5 years and wanted to try something new as I was temporarily relocating and didn&#x27;t want to lug around the large base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided on this Panasonic Wet/Dry Razor after reading the positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now been shaving with this razor for over a month and am now a fan of the &amp;#34;Wet&amp;#34; shave.  I went out and purchased some men&#x27;s shaving foam (DOVE) and I like the way it leaves my skin feeling smooth afterwards.  My wife likes it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s something about shaving with a wet face and close razor that feels like it does a better job.  This electric razor to me is a pretty close feel to your old school foam/razor experience without the cuts and mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Super easy cleaning&lt;br /&gt;Small enough to travel with&lt;br /&gt;Gets a close enough shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I still have to work at getting the nagging tiny hairs by my Adams apple.  I have yet to find an electric shaver capable of hitting that spot though with 100% satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> total crap you will spend 15 minutes and still need a shave..wont work period. cheap not a bargain at any price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item as a gift for my husband hoping it would be the right one to help with the irritation and still give him a clean shave. This was not the case. He liked the model and it works fine.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older, my skin seems to have gotten thinner so I kept nicking my skin and bleeding whenever I used a razor blade.  A wet dry electric razor has been what I&#x27;ve been using for the past five years.  I had a Panasonic ES-RT51-S but it recently died after water entered the case and damaged the battery.  It lasted over two years so I got my monies worth.  I was going to replace it with the same model, but the Panasonic ES-SL41-S looked enticing.  It was a bit more expensive, but not by much and  I&#x27;m glad that I bought it!!!  It&#x27;s lighter than the ES-RT51-S so it&#x27;s much easier to handle when shaving.  I still have problems with whiskers under the chin so I have to spend some extra time there; but overall, it&#x27;s the best wet dry shaver so far.  I do use it as a wet shaver (never dry) using a pre-shave skin oil and gel shave creme.  I always keep the face or the shaver head wet when shaving.  If not, you can get a razor burn.</li>
            <li> This razor does not shave well at all. You can go over the same spot of skin 10 times and you just can&#x27;t get it clear which leaves you with messed up spots with beard on your face after trying to shave for half an hour. (Terrible shaving experience!)&lt;br /&gt;I thought this thing would be convenient but my simple manual razor is so much better.&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended!</li>
            <li> Enjoy the fact that you can shower in the shower, but as others had stated your beard needs to get used to this shaver as initially you leave some stubble. Does a good job when you have gotten your skin used to it</li>
            <li> Best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s almost as good as a razor for closeness, and much more convenient. High quality construction, with a smart battery so overcharging isn&#x27;t a risk.</li>
            <li> This is a nice razor. It shaves close and the wet or dry option is great.Anyone wanting a good shave should definately try this razor.</li>
            <li> maybe is not a bad razor but i think this is not so good for my expectations but it price was ok.</li>
            <li> Close shave &amp; holds charge long time, goodbye Norelco...&lt;br /&gt;No problems using or cleaning, great price.  A+++++&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor hoping it would help cut down the time I have to spend shaving on my neck. I found this electric razor to be slower and the shave to be comparable to my rotary. The battery life is great and the fact that you can wet shave is another plus,  all of that being said I find that a rotary seems to be faster and less irritating.</li>
            <li> it works fine, keeps it&#x27;s charge , but rinse and shave sprays somewhat. great for cost, light touch work well</li>
            <li> My husband really seems to like it. I know I like a nice clean shave on him every day. Thanks</li>
            <li> Very efficient &amp; up to my expectations.  It works dry &amp; wet  and cleans with a flush of tap water.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift and he loves it...  He was having trouble seeing and using a razor.  Switching to this was perfect</li>
            <li> Excellent razor for both wet and dry shaving.  My first experience with using and electric razor with shaving cream was very good.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommand these rasor</li>
            <li> Meets my expectations as an electric razor but not as close a shave a I was used to getting with my blade</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband. He tried it and likes it but he said he still prefers the regular shaver as he still has to go over the same spot 2-3 times to clean it...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s useless to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every other razor I&#x27;ve used in the past 30 years was good for 120-240v.  But, upon receipt, I learned that this one is only for the U.S. 120v system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nowhere in the product description does it say it&#x27;s only for 120v.  In fact, it describes the &#x27;convenient carrying holder for storage or travel use&#x27; that is obviously good only if you travel within the U.S.  And, &#x27;convenient?&amp;#34;  Hardly: the hard plastic, stand-up carrying holder is the only way to charge the razor, yet it more than doubles the size of the razor if you are traveling with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I&#x27;m moving to China next month, this device is useless to me.</li>
            <li> Have only had this for a week.  It seems to shave well and no skin abrasion on my light beard.&lt;br /&gt;Package didn&#x27;t come with instructions.  Downloaded them off the web - but diagrams were small and it wasn&#x27;t immediately clear to me who to operate the cleaning shutter.</li>
            <li> After 21 years I replaced my razor. Thought I would give this Panasonic a try. Have not had a shave this close from an electric razor ever. Just as close as a razor blade. Very happy with it so far and that you can use it wet or dry makes it even better. I clean it using water but have yet to wet shave. Works great dry shaving.</li>
            <li> My aging dad is getting uh a bit forgetful and cranky. Forgets to plug in or clean his shaver. Needed a little something with a charging stand and is easy to clean. It&#x27;s been around 6 months and its been perfect. Good product for the price.</li>
            <li> Took an adjustment period but it does what I want it to. Faces have regions and this does better for ME in some regions than others. I like the fact that I can rinse it out.</li>
            <li> This is the second Panasonic wet/dry electric shaver that I&#x27;ve bought. Both have worked exceedingly well with little maintenance. A great buy for the price!</li>
            <li> He hasn&#x27;t used it yet. It looks good. 17cm height include charger, it is big. Need buy compact size for travel use.</li>
            <li> Noisy sound during the operation bothered me, but it is worth for the money.</li>
            <li> This was the first razor I bought for my 15 yr old son. I hope this razor works for him for a long time to come. He seems to really like it</li>
            <li> Worst shaver ever. Almost works with wet shave. Dry shave almost impossible. I would not recommend this shaver to anybody.</li>
            <li> I do not like it, It does not shave close enough, I wish I had sent it back. I lost my money.</li>
            <li> I have been extremely pleased with this razor.  It was everything I hoped for in a razor, easy to use, easy to clean, and no monstrous charger contraption taking up room on my bathroom counter-space.</li>
            <li> This product gives a decent shave and prevents razor burn when used in the shower. However, I am on my second one because the button on the first one gave out after 6 months.</li>
            <li> The product has a beautiful design, long battery holds and fast charging, the battery damage what can only be connected to 110V, who has softer chin harder will be shaved, not a bad product</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my husband for Christmas - he loves it..first time he used it he must have told me 20 times that day how close it shaved him - that he hadn&#x27;t had a shave that close in years - he is happy so I am happy!</li>
            <li> This a perfect example of getting what you paid for.  I needed something to use when traveling.  This is probably the worst electric shaver I have ever used.  It just does not work well.  No matter which way I try cutting my whiskers, I need to go over my face and neck repeatedly and still don&#x27;t get a good shave.  I have had to shave twice a day and I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard. Even though this razor is inexpensive, it is a waste of money. Spend more and get something useful.</li>
            <li> Every product was as advertised and the delivery on time.. I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have used this for about a week now and think that it is pretty good.  I have never found an electric razor that does as good of job as a real razor, so I was not expecting that.  But, for the money, this is a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> Not as good as a rotary razor. Its harder to cut those pesky whiskers with this straight type unit. Go with a rotary!!</li>
            <li> Love it,very reliable and build quality is awesome as we!! !!</li>
            <li> This shaver has no bells or whistles, compared to Panasonics other razors. It is light weight and fits both your hand and the curves of York face. The missing features, like soft or hard adjustments are pretty much useless anyways. You do have to keep the charge on it but the induction charger makes this easy.</li>
            <li> Greatest shaver owned. Will shave away short hair from mustache and chin area just fine. Longer hairs from sideburns will only be cut with the trimmer but again just fine. I use it as dry as wet with shaving lotion and has been working fine. Also very light weight.</li>
            <li> This model is easier to clean.  It does take a little getting use to a new razor but He is a firm believer in Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco shavers for the last 40+ years. Lately (my last 2 shavers) I have noticed that my shavers have not been able to shave neck hairs. I shave daily, but the neck kept getting shaggy. This Panasonic has slots to cut the longer hairs. The Norelcos used to have slots in their cutters, but the last 2 only have had small holes for the whiskers to go through. I am quite happy with my new Panasonic but it doesn&#x27;t seem to shave the hairs as close as the Norelco did, 5 o&#x27;clock shadow shows up a little earlier. I&#x27;ve been told that it takes a month to get your face acclimated to the shaver, so maybe it&#x27;ll get better in 2 more weeks....................PS: I&#x27;ve always dry shaved, so that&#x27;s the way I&#x27;ve been using it, comparing apples to apples!..............PPS: I have now tried a water only shave and shaves with gel, clearly a disapointment, the \\&quot;5 o&#x27;clock shadow\\&quot; is evident somewhere between 10 and 11 AM, and to top it off, I see that Norelco&#x27;s shaver heads have gone back to having slots to get the longer whiskers......Oh well, live and learn!...........PPS #2....I&#x27;ve given it 3+ months, finally gave up and ordered a new Norelco AT830.....foil shavers have not worked for me in the past and still don&#x27;t. Going back to something that&#x27;ll shave the hair on my neck!</li>
            <li> After charging for the recommended 15 hours &amp; letting my face get scruffy i gave the SI41 a dry test run.... &amp; was duly impressed.&lt;br /&gt;In less than 2 minutes my face was not only stubble free....but super smooth. And not a single failure to cut/hair pull, this bad boy has the speed &amp; power to get the job done. The shaver comes with a nice charging stand that glows red at the base to let you know it is charging as well as a clear plastic protective cover for when you need to travel with it or for just keeping it handy laying around. The handle of the shaver has good ergonomics as it fits perfectly into my hand.&lt;br /&gt;All in all ... I love it .... it shaves quick clean n easy &amp; provides a VERY close shave without irritation. I am already looking forward to trying it in the shower as it is both a wet &amp; dry shaver.&lt;br /&gt;This is a keeper, &amp; is now my favorite shaver. Five stars to Panasonic for this great &amp; reasonably priced shaver.</li>
            <li> I struggled with how to review this shaver, since I am a life-long Braun electric shaving customer.  I think it&#x27;s unfair to expect this shaver to match the features and power of my Braun 7-760cc that costs $175.  While I would never trade-in my Braun shaver for this Panasonic shaver, I do like this shaver enough to make use of it as my travel shaver.  Here are some comparison points I think are interesting about this shaver:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) This shaver is quiet, comfortable to hold, and can provide a close shave if you use it every day.  In my \\&quot;skip-a-day\\&quot; test, this shaver really struggled to knock down two days worth of stubble.  My Braun shaver doesn&#x27;t get bogged down at all.  I would expect that to be the case because the Braun is much more expensive and powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) This shaver can be used in the shower, with shaving cream.  It does a slightly better job this way than it does with a dry shave.  This shaver being a little light on power, takes about twice the time for me to get the same shave I get with my Braun, so for me personally I would not use it in the shower because I feel like I&#x27;m draining my entire hot water heater.  If you take long hot showers this is the shaver for you.  I jump in the shower and am back out in 5 minutes.  My Braun shaver is waterproof, but is not really meant for a wet shave, so this one is superior in that respect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) This shaver is very light and compact, with an innovative guard that allows it to travel in a fairly compact footprint.  I actually prefer this shaver when I am traveling because it fits right in my toiletry bag along with my other things.  I actually tested it in this fashion on a trip and I was very satisfied.  My Braun shaver is heavier and goes in its own case that prevents it from fitting in my toiletry bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) This shaver is very basic, as it&#x27;s price would suggest.  No case, no brush, and no ability to take just the power cord on a trip with you.  If you need to charge the shaver on your trip, you have to bring the whole stand.  My Braun allows you to unplug the power cord from the stand and take it along to plug the shaver into.  This isn&#x27;t a big issue, just a difference.  The stand is also very minimalist and relatively easy to tip over, but it certainly does the job just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It all comes down to what you&#x27;re looking for in a shaver.  I am willing to pay a lot more for a shaver to get extra power (because I have very thick/dense stubble) and a stand that cleans the shaver (because I have a very sensitive complexion).  If I were limited to the $50-$60 range, I would certainly consider this shaver.  I love Panasonic products, mostly their TV&#x27;s and cordless phones, and I&#x27;m sure this shaver is reliable because Panasonic builds reliable products.  I will in fact continue to use this shaver for my travel shaver, so it won me over in that respect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knock a star off this shaver for lack of a brush, and it could use a little more power.  You should be able to skip a day and still have the shaver be able to cut through the stubble with minimal effort.  Wish I could give it 4.5 stars, because those two issues don&#x27;t really warrant a full star off.n your trip, you have to bring the whole stand.

            <li> I love this product. The only thing I could recommend would be to make the system&#x27;s blades sensitive enough to be able to remove even the smallest or toughest hairs on my neck. I find myself having to reapply some circulating effort around the same areas every time until I get all the hairs out of the way. Still, this is a small price to pay considering the fact that I am pain and embracement free after each shave. A great gift idea.</li>
            <li> I like everything about this razor, except the closeness of the shave.  It works best for me when I use a soap-lathered mixture on my face, but still leaves a big difference from a blade on the neck and chin.  Perhaps those with a soft-haired beard would have better results,</li>
            <li> Great razor. Curved blades really make a difference. Usual Amazon prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> the wet/dry function is good but to use as an everyday shaver..not so much. If I had to use this one shaver only, I would probably just go with a beard</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, nothing special about its proformance, cutz decent, you get what you pay for. I havent tried wet shaving yet.</li>
            <li> I like to shave in the shower. The hot water and steam helps get your beard soft and standing up. When I shave with a blade, it&#x27;s in the shower with some lathered soap and I get a great shave. The thing is, I ususally shave with a rotary electric. Now, with the Panasonic ES-SL41-S electric shaver, I can bring electric shave convenience into the shower. When I first tried the unit dry and harkening back to my days using a Remington foil shaver, I didn&#x27;t think it gave me a close shave but since it is wet/dry, I decided to give it a try in the shower. The nice thing about using a wet/dry electric shaver in the shower is that you can use your regular soap or gel so I lathered up and gave the ES-SL41-S another try. When I tried it wet, it felt like it wasn&#x27;t cutting as close as my rotary electric but when I got out of the shower, it felt like I had a nice, close shave. That&#x27;s when I realized that my beard had been standing up when I was in the shower and after the shower, it laid down and felt smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO&lt;br /&gt;Good shave wet or in the shower&lt;br /&gt;Unit comes with a nice storage/recharging stand&lt;br /&gt;Easy clean up&lt;br /&gt;Basic pop up trimmer for beards or sideburns&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the down side. It still didn&#x27;t feel like it shaved as close as my rotary electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON&lt;br /&gt;Did not shave as close as my rotary&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t work as well dry as it does wet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like this unit. I continue to use it from time to time and recommend it to people who like to shave wet or in the shower but want the convenience (and no nicks) of an electric.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t charge to different voltage but a great product ended up buying one locally and it works great but due to different voltage no good .</li>
            <li> Works exactly as promised. The stand is good, the attachments are useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, this is a quality electric shaver that gets a pretty nice close shave given 5 - 10 minutes of your time. I think I&#x27;d still rather just shave with a normal razor if I want that clean-cut look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for maintenance and quick shaving, this thing does just fine.</li>
            <li> First off...amazing.  I usually stick to the Remington products but decided to give this one a shot.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be going back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros-Charging stand is very sleek, battery lasts long time, travel protection fits snug and blocks the on button, very close shave without having to go over the same area several times, durable (dropped it twice), ergonomically fits perfect in my hand, price is very reasonable for the market, no need to worry about the water shorting out circuits but I have not used in the shower.  I&#x27;d rather not risk it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons-charging stand is bulky for traveling but for short trips the battery makes up for it.  You cannot charge it without the stand.  That&#x27;s about it for cons.</li>
            <li> I have bought my husband other electric shavers, and at some point they all end up under the bathroom sink. But the Panasonic ES-Sl41-S has the three things needed that will keep him using it everyday. Comfort, convenience, and a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;Other electric shavers irratate and chafe my husband&#x27;s face. But with this shaver&lt;br /&gt;he can use it in the shower with shower gel on his face and get a smooth, close shave without any irratation. The convenience of the cleaning and charging of this product are one of it&#x27;s selling points. With the push of a button two shutters open on the shaver and he just holds it under the running water to clean it out. He is already in the shower, it goes right down the drain. No more of him opening up his electric shaver and using that little brush to clean it and leaving all those little hairs on the sink that he never quite gets all cleaned up. And no more cords to plug in to recharge. Just drop the Panasonic ES-Sl41-S into it&#x27;s holder and it will be charged when he picks it up next. It is the first time he actually enjoys using an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Panasonic ES-SI41-S Shaver, Milano Rechargeable with Nanotech Blades, 3-Blade Arc, 3 Wet-Dry\\&quot; provides a close, comfortable shave for men with average facial hair.  Men who have more sensitive skin will like the fact that the Panasonic ES-SI41-S Milano can be used with shaving cream for a more comfortable, less irritating shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic ES-SI41-S Milano is one of the more economical versions of Panasonic&#x27;s Wet-Dry series, but it uses the same blades and head as the more expensive ES-LT41.  Replacement blades cost about $28 on Amazon; less if you \\&quot;subscribe and save.\\&quot;  Blades generally need replaced about every six months to ensure a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the Panasonic ES-SI41-S Milano operates at a lower RPM than other Panasonic Wet-Dry models, the lesser speed does not impact its utility.  The handle is smaller than other versions of Panasonic Wet-Dry Shavers and, for men with larger hands, may not be as comfortable to grip as other models.  The grip is not heavily textured and may be slippery if used in the shower with shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Men who travel frequently and like to use a wet-dry shaver may not be happy with the Panasonic ES-SI41-S Milano shaver.  The charger is bulky and made of hard plastic; it takes up significant space in a shaving kit and, if subjected to pressure/weight, may crack.  The on-off switch of this shaver does not have a locking function and might accidently be turned on and fully discharged.  It is for these reasons I deducted one star from the Panasonic ES-SI41-S shaver&#x27;s rating.  Those who do not travel will likely rate this a 5-star product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a reasonably priced wet-dry shaver that is reliable and provides a good shave, you may want to give the \\&quot;Panasonic ES-SI41-S Shaver, Milano Rechargeable with Nanotech Blades, 3-Blade Arc, 3 Wet-Dry\\&quot; a try.</li>
            <li> This is a small and attractive wet/dry shaver with a small trimmer attachment on the back for sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a charging dock/cradle included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wet: This shaver works best in the shower or when wet. You can use shaving cream with it which I highly recommend as it cuts down on shaving irritation and bumps that I seem to only get with electric razors.&lt;br /&gt;The result is a smooth clean shave that doesn&#x27;t pull at your hairs like some other razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry: It works well dry but it takes around 3 passes for each area to really get all the hair. I experienced some skin irritation from shaving dry with this razor. Using aftershave helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleanup: Cleanup is easy as you can totally submerse this thing in water and wash it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: If you want to shave in the car or office with this I would warn you about lots of small hairs that fall out of the shaver onto your clothes/desk. After you shave with this you will see a fine residue of tiny hairs on whatever surface you are nearby. If in the car that would mean small hairs on your clothes and in your car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you found this review helpful please give it a thumbs up below! thanks!</li>
            <li> can shave in the shower now without having to worry about&lt;br /&gt;breaking my shaver, its easy to clean and does a real&lt;br /&gt;good job, leaving a nice and smooth shave, would be happier&lt;br /&gt;if it was cheap and could also use shaving cream but with this&lt;br /&gt;shaver water works just fine.</li>
            <li> You can not use electric shaving cream when using this shaver. It will not trim the hair. I don&#x27;t get it. It works ok w/o the cream but that means it is only worth half the value.</li>
            <li> Well, it works ok.  But the charger has no indicator so u have no clue when it is charged.  Even worse, the shaver has no indicator, so you have no clue when it needs to be charged.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for 30 years and have tried many brands. Panasonic has always been my favorite. I believe this model is the best one I&#x27;ve tried. I especially like the middle blade that shaves the longer hairs. Works really well if you have to skip a day between shaves. Ergonomic, light weight, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Never gave a close shave whether wet or dry, even when using shave gels specifically designed for electric razors. As others have said, had to go over and over the same area, still without a good result.  Then after two months, the thing stopped holding a charge altogether and won&#x27;t even turn on.  Panasonic is usually such a great brand -- very disappointed in this.</li>
            <li> My disabled Adult child has the coarsest beard ever, and I have to shave him every day.It always does a pretty good job. I think Ive changed the blade once.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this shaver very long but it works fine and cuts good. It cleans up nice also. So far so good but time will be the ultimate test. Now i have to find out how much replacement blades will be.</li>
            <li> I did not know what shaver he wanted but like a good girlfriend I got the right one and he loves it.</li>
            <li> My old shaver, a Panasonic ES-SA40K, was great.  It was inexpensive and surprisingly gave me one of the closest and smoothest  shaves I have ever had.  I was very hopeful that the new Milano shaver would ber even better.  Not even close.  On the Pro side - it cleans easily, holds a charge for at least 8 shaves or more, and looks great.  However, it takes forever to get the job done.  I much prefer the single foil and one cutter that my old shaver had.  That design was much easier to get into the curved throat area and just above the chin.</li>
            <li> This is a great idea. I can use a gel shaving cream, but don&#x27;t be in a rush to get done.&lt;br /&gt;You will be shaving areas at least twice. Just go slow and let the shaver do&lt;br /&gt;the work. If you want faster results, go back to the blade.</li>
            <li> Im in the Army and hate using a normal razor everymorning and this guy right here makes it 10x easier.  Gets nice and close, very fast and love the option to use gel when im not running late</li>
            <li> i bought it for my dad, he said battery of this product really run fast even can&#x27;t handle one time shaving,..well im not sure about this product&#x27;s brand really panasonic? maybe fake product or something,.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave clean, and it takes so long to get any shave! Frustrating, I am going to  go back to Gillette!</li>
            <li> I used Remington&#x27;s for 15+ years and resided to an understanding that electric razors resulted in bad shave.  I lived with that dismal opinion until I ditched Remington and bought a Panasonic ES-RT51 that was clearance priced at $40 a couple years ago.  I was out a few weeks ago and saw this model, ES-SL41-S on clearance at $30.  Both models have made me a Panasonic fan for life.  Quiet, with considerably less vibration than Remington.  I get 3 shaves before the need to recharge.  As the battery grows older, 2 shaves will be the maximum.  Quite lucky to get them on clearance however that luck will run out and when it does, I won&#x27;t think twice about paying retail.</li>
            <li> I wsa stuck on Remington for the longest time...; afraid to try anything else.  I&#x27;ve tried Norelco.. Horrible.  This is a great product for sensitive skin :)  Clean,close and non irritating</li>
            <li> PROS&lt;br /&gt;Close shave for an electric razor with low&lt;br /&gt;Good build quality&lt;br /&gt;Wet-dry capability&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean simply by rinsing in water&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;No charge cord, only a charging base&lt;br /&gt;No charge indicator on the shaver itself&lt;br /&gt;Small beard trimmer&lt;br /&gt;No cleaning brush included&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic ES-S141-S is a fine midlevel electric shaver.  It doesn&#x27;t quite have all the bells and whistles of it&#x27;s higher line Panasonic cousins, but it does sport a lower price, is easy to clean, and gives a darn good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inside the package you will find the shaver itself, a charging base, and the cord. The shaver does not have a place for a cord to connect at the base.  Rather, there are two metal contacts on the sides of the shaver for charging.  These work easily with the provided charging base but do pose a problem: there is no way to get a charge cord for this shaver.  That means that if you travel, you will have to take the larger base along with you.  Additionally, if you are running low on power, there is no real way to use the shaver without giving it an extra charge.  (I suppose you could try plugging it in and using the shaver base and all, but that would be quite awkward.)  Additionally, the shaver itself has no power meter/charge indicator.  That&#x27;s okay, I suppose, if you plop the shaver on the base every day when you&#x27;re done shaving, but is a problem if you are the type that likes to run the shaver down before you recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two inner blades and the foil itself has a cutter that trims longer hairs so that they are accessible to the inner blade. This is a nice touch on a shaver in this price range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you turn on the shaver it has a pleasant, low-noise hum.  The shaving experience is very Panasonic--they compromise just a bit on the closeness of the shave but this allows for a shave that is far less irritating.  Generally, it takes a number of passes at a number of angles before my shave iscomplete, but that is par for the course with an electric razor.  The blades don&#x27;t pivot front to back or right to left, but the shape of the foil is such that this doesn&#x27;t seem to hamper the shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the whole, this is a fine shave for an electric razor. It is close enough for me and still less irritating than my Remmington.  So far, I have found that Panasonic and Braun seem to have found the best spot regarding the closeness of the shave without the resulting irritation.  Wahls and Remmingtons seem to give a closer shave but are more irritating for me and those rotary headed types are gentle but not close enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a trimmer on the back of the shaver that pops up at a slight angle.  It is ergonomic enough for good visibility while shaving.  There are two problems though: 1) it is narrower than I&#x27;d like it--less than half the size of the shave head itself.  This means it takes more time to cover ground. 2) the trimmer flips back down a little too easily for my tastes.  I would have liked it to be a little stiffer so that it didn&#x27;t collapse so often when using it.  Neither problem is insurmountable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is Wet/Dry and can be used in water.  I wouldn&#x27;t submerge it, but in theory it could be used in the shower.  I tend to use the shaver dry--I think it works better this way, but the Wet/Dry capability makes it easier to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And with that in mind, Panasonic has actually innovated a bit so that you can really clean the shaver by rinsing it.  First, there are two water inlets on the back side of the shaver that can be opened when you clean it.  Second, the blades have been reconfigured by Panasonic to loop higher and these loops are set wider apart then even their last year&#x27;s model.  This allows water to flow more easily between the loops and prevents caking of cut hair from gumming up the works when you try to rinse it.  Third, the bottom of the shaver head beneath the foil is flatter, without the deep channels and valleys that are so common in most shavers. All these things allow water to flow through the shave head easily and clean out the clippings. I was happily surprised at just how well this shaver came clean with a simple rinse, even without removing the foil.  That said, I was still a little disappointed that they didn&#x27;t supply the traditional cleaning brush...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this shaver can really shave.  It lacks all the bells and whistles of the higher line models, but still does the job.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my son for Christmas.  So far, he loves it.  I can&#x27;t give you too many more specifics, but every time I ask him about it, he says he really likes it!  Seems like it was a very good purchase!</li>
            <li> I have always had rotary shavers, so I thought I would try this and it seems to work fine. I tried it on about four days growth and it give me a good close shave.</li>
            <li> MY husband needed a new one and this was a great price.  He will not use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I reccomend!</li>
            <li> Works great.  Switched from a four year old rotary to this bad boy.  Much closer shave, no issues with clogging and easy to clean.  Cuts through hair even after not saving for a couple days.  Works great in the shower.  Only issue, which is probably more due to the foil vs rotary make, is that it can sometimes be a bit tricky to get into certain places, near the nose, edges of the jawline.  Still an amazing razor.</li>
            <li> Great quality, prompt delivery</li>
            <li> Great razor I gave it 4 stars it works really good wet with a little bit of shave cream not real good dry I have sensitive skin and this is by far the best shave I have had in a long time without major irritation.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s neat, there are no more hairs all over the sink! I would recommend this for everyone who shaves their face and needs a good electric razor. I like the little charging stand, it doesn&#x27;t take up much counter space. The only problem so far is that we can&#x27;t figure out where the hairs went, lol.</li>
            <li> I switched to Panasonic shavers about 8 years ago because I get a lot of irritation and the blade design is easy on my skin. The last shaver worked great but it was finally time to upgrade. AND I&#x27;M VERY GLAD I DID!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the replacement foils aren&#x27;t much less than a whole new razor and this one is an absolute dream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s much lighter than any other model I&#x27;ve had and the charger is a very nice touch. You probably don&#x27;t want to take the charger on a long trip with you but for at home it&#x27;s perfect. My razor is always fully charged and fast. Unlike the previous models that I didn&#x27;t keep charged all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shutters are an interesting addition and seem to work pretty well. The head isn&#x27;t super easy to take off so it might be so they can secure the blades better than with previous models that quickly pop off foils of the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are a lot closer than the older models, but this might just be because my last one was getting old. It&#x27;s a great shave and I&#x27;m writing this about 6 hours after I last shaved and it&#x27;s still very smooth. Not so much the case with my older model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the extra 2 year waranty which adds confidence. Overall you can&#x27;t go wrong with this shaver.</li>
            <li> Use it every day good results. It works specially well in the shower and the battery lasts about a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used an electric razor but I had a beard for 12 years because I hate to shave. This one works great and does the job in the shower or out. If it lasts as long as advertised it will be cost saving, too.</li>
            <li> Great Product, Just like the description.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend it to everyone. Thank you !!!</li>
            <li> He loves because he can use it in the shower</li>
            <li> I thought I would test this baby out on a worst case scenario, and it worked great! My beard is like nails, and it has cowlicks (for want of a better term) on my neck. I used foaming hand soap, and went for it. It worked great, and it&#x27;s the first electric razor that EVER worked on my neck. In fact, the shave was closer than the usual blade shave. I think that tha curved blades did the trick for my neck. And I have NO RAZOR BURN! I had much more expensive electrics than this, and finally found one that works! I think it will be easier in the future, because I won&#x27;t be torturing it with a 3-day bed of nails on my face. At last, a smooth, comfortable shave from an electric. Please Panasonic, don&#x27;t stop making this razor. I LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> I thought this product was a good purchase, but my son says the shave isn&#x27;t as close as he likes. It does work, though, and he uses it from time to time to prevent razor burn and sensitivity that comes with a closer shave.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband and he wants a different one because this one doesn&#x27;t shave close enough and he still has a little stubble.</li>
            <li> First off let me say that I use this as a body shaver primarily. (I&#x27;m a male). By body I mean groin/pubic area, etc. For that, it works good. I use to use the philips/norelco body groomer but had bad irritation from the trimmers on each end of  the foil. This shaver being 100% foil only, greatly reduces irritation. I do not use this on my \\&quot;boys/sack\\&quot; if you know what I mean... that area is only for a regular razor... Just wanted to get that out there. I also only wet shave in the shower using shaving cream with this. I never dry shave and have never tried with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said I highly recommend this shaver as body groomer. I bought it due to its small size and modest foil area. Some of the other ones are the size of sledge hammer (really for shaving)?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a beard so can&#x27;t say much for the face - I&#x27;ve used it on my neck and it worked OK - leaves behind some hairs though that lay flat (the neck is the hardest part for electric shavers but it is acceptable and I would not go back to a regular razor over it). No matter what this shaver will never get 100% of the hairs your&#x27;re going after but it does a pretty good job. I liked the price.... of course you loose some fancy things like a battery meter and stuff like that with this one but that&#x27;s how the price is low. I don&#x27;t care about any of those options - just the shave. I always put it back on the charger when done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re like me and have tried all the \\&quot;body groomer\\&quot; shavers out there and had bad irritation from them - buy this thing. It&#x27;s the best hands down. I don&#x27;t know why they don&#x27;t market it towards that as well. This is way safer then the philips/norelco body groomer line of products because of the lack of trimmers which cut/cause bad irritation. Just keep up on your shave because this can&#x27;t \\&quot;hack\\&quot; down a forest of hair (meaning if you only shave weekly, as it has no trimmers). I body shave about 3 times a week so have no problems of the hair ever being to long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it 4 out of 5 stars. I would purchase this again. The only reason for 4 stars is because no matter how many times you go over certain hairs it just can&#x27;t cut them. Keep in mind this is a few hairs I&#x27;m talking about - not enough to compromise the shave to point this as an unacceptable shave.</li>
            <li> Over the years my husband has tried a lot of different electric razors all with varying degrees of satisfaction.  This razor is different however and he really likes it.  He prefers to use it dry and it gives him a nice close shave with no skin irritation or pulling.  The shape of it makes it comfortable to hold and it&#x27;s easy to clean.  HIghly recommended!</li>
            <li> This is really an excellent razor. I like that it is light and that it shaves really close comfortably, and especially in the hard to get places--even for those with necks with angular planes. The battery lasts for a good period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the down side, as compared say with the Panasonic ES8103, it&#x27;s hard to tell when this razor is fully charged in its cradle. Also, the 8103 display tells you what percentage of charge is left, while the S141-S doesn&#x27;t have that feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, my experience of the closeness and comfort rate this razor Five Stars. And I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Nice shaver that does a good job for the price.</li>
            <li> First time that I buy an electric razor and I have to say that after you get use to you will love it. It is easy to use and to clean. I have a lot of beard and my wife loves my aftershave look. I have been using it for a year and works just as the first day.  The battery last forever (recharge once a month, I use it every other day).</li>
            <li> Good battery, well constructed.  This tool works well if you use it wet with shaving cream but labors on a dry face with a tough beard .  It takes a very long time to shave dry and I&#x27;m not business presentable .  I was hoping it would be my primary shaver but it truly is my backup to a safety razor</li>
            <li> An electric razor isn&#x27;t a yearly purchase and it&#x27;s been at least five years, maybe more since I&#x27;ve bought one. I like the compact and sleek design and this gives a smooth shave. It&#x27;s also a reasonably priced electric razor.</li>
            <li> It once was said Panasonic was only slightly ahead of their time. This shaver is the future of electric shaving. It gives you a blade-like shave right while you are taking your shower. Thus, you have more time to get to work or can set your alarm later and sleep a little more. The shave lasts all day; no 5 O&#x27;clock shadow with this device. It gets 5 stars from me due to its close, comfortable, and convenient shave. I highly recommend this device to men who shave.</li>
            <li> I got this razor for my husband to try.  He was pretty excited about it since he hates shaving, but after a few days he wasn&#x27;t so thrilled.  He says it&#x27;s good for a quick job (like when he&#x27;s running late) or for a Saturday shave when it doesn&#x27;t really matter, but it doesn&#x27;t get close enough for everyday use.  I asked if I could have it since he doesn&#x27;t really like it, but he wouldn&#x27;t give it up. :)  So, I guess it works well enough, but doesn&#x27;t give that close shave that most men prefer.</li>
            <li> So I was on a trip with a few friends and I noticed one of them had this shaver. It was pretty cool looking but obviously the most important thing was if it actually works. I asked my friend how was it and he recommended it, which led to my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product and after about a week of use, I must say I LOVE it! I&#x27;ve tried using an electric shaver in the past but had bad experiences as it caused bad irritation on my skin but this shaver doesn&#x27;t give me any irritation yet provides a very close shave. It only takes a few passes to get a complete shave, although 1 pass is fine if i shave often. It&#x27;s very convenient too as I can shave while showering rather than standing above the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my favorite things about the shaver is how easy it is to clean it. Instead of breaking apart the foil and blades, all you have to do is click the water shutters open and let running water go through it. Switch the water shutters close and you&#x27;re all set to go again with a clean system!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the charging stand and carrying holder are pluses and unique in its style. The carrying holder is perfect as I can snap the shaver on it and place it on the side of the tub w.o it slipping and falling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think the product is worth buying. It prevents irritation that I get sometimes from the regular safety blades yet provides a smooth and close shave. What used to take me 3-5 minutes to do (with needed lather), now takes me less than a minute.  Definitely worth making the switch.</li>
            <li> I found the Panasonic Milano Men&#x27;s Rechargeable shaver to be a pretty good and durable product.  I have used an electric shaver in the past, for years I used a Rototrack but stopped because it was screwing up my facial hairs, but for app. 17-18 yrs I&#x27;ve ONLY used disposable razors (most recently the [[ASIN:B000065AB0 Gillette Mach3 Turbo Razor]].  Since I shave in the shower, I first tried shaving with the Panasonic using the wet-shave option.  However, I soon gave this us as I found that the shaver gave me an very uneven cut - which forced me to try again at the sink once I had finished showering.  I now shave prior to my shower with completely dry skin and I&#x27;ve found the cut to be better, but still not as close as my disposable.  Also making shaving more cumbersome, since I have a goatee, I&#x27;m forced to use my disposable anyway to cut in the edges of the goatee (as the small sideburn trimmer on the shaver doesn&#x27;t work very well for anything besides sideburns).  The problem may be that I have very course facial hair, but this is just a guess - either way, I can clearly not use this alone on a daily basis as it would be vary obvious in the office how poor and uneven the shave was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottomline is I like it, but it looks like for me I am unable to completely give up the disposable in order to cut in around my goatee and remove the hair that the Panazonic missed.  For whatever reason, I found the wet shave option to be pretty worthless.  However, I still gave the shaver 3-stars as I thought the (dry) shave was pretty decent, I found the battery to be VERY VERY long-lasting (I charged it for about 5-6 hrs and have now used it for more than a week without a recharge), and it&#x27;s light, quiet, and easy to handle which shaving.  Eventhough I&#x27;ll probably never use it in the shower again, I like that you are able to use water to clean off the blades rather than having to take it apart to brush it off.  It is also easy to snap the top off and on to get rid of the whisker debris.er debris.</li>
            <li> I have always used a standard razor, and I like the convenience of being able to shave in the shower with my shower mirror. Not only does it give a closer shave with no worries about clean-up but it also gives me a few extra minutes of standing under the hot water in the morning. These are all good things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got my first electric razor recently, the [[ASIN:B007VB50VA Philips Norelco QS6140/41 StyleRazor]]. I thought it was pretty cool at first, and I liked its versatility, but before long I was using it exclusively as a beard trimmer and I was back to my standard razor in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This \\&quot;Panasonic ES-Sl41-S Shaver\\&quot; promised the best of both worlds. Not only is it a standard electric shaver, but I could also use it wet in the shower with shaving cream. That takes care of issues two and three on my list. It has a charging cradle, which is a must for me because I don&#x27;t want to fiddle about with power cords and batteries. I liked the shape, sort of imitating the shape of a standard razor. As to the close shave, it does a pretty good job. But only pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part of the problem is that I have a shaped beard/goatee, and this Panasonic shaver has all the finesse of a club. Its fine if you want to just drag it across your face like a lawn mower, but it can&#x27;t do any edging or detail work.  I found the little pop-out sideburn shaver attachment worked well for finishing up,  But all-in-all it lacked the versatility of a standard bladed razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This might have something to do with skill--the Panasonic is bulky, and take awhile to get used to.  I am going to keep using it for awhile and see if I can learn how maneuver it better and a get a closer, easier shave.  But I suspect that after awhile this will retire to its cradle in favor of the ease and versatility of a standard bladed razor.</li>
            <li> I have owned 3 different electric razors in the past year, and so far this one is the best I have tried. I have very rough facial hair, and it took about a week to get used to using this, but now I can shave daily in just a couple of minutes, compared to every other day with a blade. Still have to shave with that once a week though. Good razor.</li>
            <li> I prefer Panasonic electric shavers for their ease of use, reliability, and quality of shave. I own a top-of-the-line model, which I&#x27;ve used daily for the past two years. It replaced a similarly-priced Panasonic razor, which ALMOST survived a combat tour in Iraq. Because I have owned the higher-end models, I was curious to see how this less-expensive version would perform. I was pleasantly surprised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ES-S141S, nicknamed \\&quot;Milano\\&quot; for some unknown reason, is much lighter and easier to handle than my other Panasonic. Although the shaver head is smaller, it delivers a shave of equal quality, in slightly less time. One reason is that I can grip the razor like an oversized pen when shaving the back of my mostly bald noggin; It&#x27;s faster and more efficient that way. I&#x27;ve used this razor a couple of times in the shower, and it performs better than its \\&quot;big brother\\&quot;. The ports which click open to allow efficient rinsing of the shaver head post-shower are a neat feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bulky charger makes this model less functional for travel. On the other hand, it fits perfectly on my bathroom countertop, and my razor is always fully-charged. Now I just take my old Panasonic with its smaller charging cord along when I&#x27;m on the road, and use this sports car of an electric razor while I&#x27;m home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a lightweight, efficient, reasonably-priced electric shaver which will give you as good a shave as the more expensive models, I highly recommend the Panasonic ES-S141. If you are a fan of Panasonic razors, this one will keep you happy!</li>
            <li> The battery on the razor goes dead in a short amount of time ,I have to make a lot of passes in ordered to get shaved. It does not cut the hair in the neck area like i expected . i rate this razor at best average.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You&lt;br /&gt;Bruce Martin</li>
            <li> This is a great razor, it \\&quot;fits\\&quot; in my hand like it was meant to be there. It just feels right. It does a great job, but could be improved with interchangeable foils. My beard is very fine when it first comes in and I have only had one razor that cuts it well, one with extra foils that can cut very close. This razor does get it, but it requires going over it several times from several different angles to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a quick and long lasting charge and it cleans up very easy. Just open the two slides on the back and stick it under your faucet. The water flows thru and flushes out all the trimmings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has a pop up trimmer for beard and sideburns that works well. It also comes with a charging stand and carrying holder that keeps it from turning on in your luggage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is an excellent razor for everyday use or just for the occasional trim.</li>
            <li> Being new to electric razors I thought this Panasonic might be more convenient to the traditional razors I&#x27;m used to. I was wrong. This takes four times longer to finish shaving compared to a razor and still leaves a stubble. I can never get close enough to the skin to get a perfect shave. I&#x27;m going back to a regular razor and can&#x27;t understand the purpose of this product&#x27;s existence.</li>
            <li> I used to be a Braun Shaver guy until I used this Panasonic shaver.  Very close comfortable shave and the price cannot be beat.  I have been using this shaver for weeks and my skin has never been irritated like other razors.</li>
            <li> Was hands-down the best razor I have owned. Gave a close shave with little to no irritation. If I had written this review a month ago, it would have been 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is, after owning the razor for just six months, the motor has failed. I realize that this isn&#x27;t the highest end razor in the world, but this is the type of life I&#x27;d expect from a $10 razor, not a $50 one.</li>
            <li> the razor is okay, but the chugging cradle is very large.......I bought this as a compact travel razor&lt;br /&gt;but the charging cradle ruins this for travel.....needs just a charging cord/transformer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent razor for the price but I wish I had purchased the next model up. Using the ES-SL41-S Arc 3 does not provide a smooth shave and I don&#x27;t produce a heavy beard.</li>
            <li> We love Panasonic.  They have the best mens shavers out there.  Why pay hundreds of dollars for a brand that may not perform as well as Panasonic.  Try it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> This shaver lives up to the expectations.  It works perfect in or out of the shower.  In the shower I use a gel shaving cream and I get an even closer shave then using a razor blade.  Cleaning is extremely easy with the clips that you pull down and run the shaver under the faucet.  I highly recommend this shaver in place of the old fashioned razor blade.</li>
            <li> Two parts, the Panasonic wet-dry razors in general, and this one specifically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic wet-dry: These are fantastic razors for comfort, close shaves, and decently cleanable. In particular, if you&#x27;ve used other electric razors and not been too happy with them, either due to skin irritation or to a not-especially-good shave, this might be for you. The wet-dry part is also nice, this can be run under water for cleaning and can also be used in the shower (if you want to). The disadvantage that I&#x27;ve had is that I&#x27;ve lost a razor (left in hotel room) and the next one I had was cheaper to replace than replace the blades and foil. One Panasonic or another of this series are on fantastically good special pricing over the holidays typically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor: The Panasonic wet-dry razors come in a variety of models with varying features (and pseudo-features). This is from the middle of the range with lower battery capacity. If the battery capacity (longer charge-free shaving) matters, you can upgrade that with another model. Works well, and this is now my normal home razor that lives in the charger. My older one with more battery capacity is my travel unit (no charger if the travel is less than a week).</li>
            <li> Panasonic&#x27;s Men&#x27;s Wet/Dry Electric Cordless Shaver is second only to soap for the best pairing under running water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight, easy to hold and control, and sharp enough to cleanly zip through 3-5 days of beard growth, the Panasonic ES-SL41-S \\&quot;Milano\\&quot; Men&#x27;s 3-Blade Wet-Dry Shaver with Nanotech Blades exceeded all previous electric shaver experiences. The shaver is a little more than six inches tall, two-and-a-half inches wide with a silver blue finish. It comes with an AC charging stand for the bathroom counter and a shaver holder for the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the shaver has a dry shave mode, although it is unlikely you&#x27;ll abandon the wet shave after you and your spouse appreciate the closeness that can be achieved in the shower. This Panasonic model excels at smoothing out more than facial hair. It works well on many other body parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frequent travelers will appreciate that there&#x27;s no need to disassemble the shaver to clean it. Panasonic&#x27;s water shutter technology lets water flow freely through the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, the Panasonic ES-SL41-S \\&quot;Milano\\&quot; is a vast improvement for in-shower shaving, especially if your prior experience involves only rotary-type shavers. This model is easy to hold and control, simple to clean and provides the quality shave touted by manufactures of $300 models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rating: Five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please see the product photos I submitted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE: This review is courtesy of the Amazon Vine program, which provides products at no cost in exchange for my independent and unbiased feedback. My objective is to provide you with helpful information that improves your shopping experience.</li>
            <li> I own several electric shavers that cost $200-$300 dollars that do not shave as&lt;br /&gt;well as this Panasonic does.  I have been using it for several weeks without any&lt;br /&gt;shaving cream and the results are what I was looking for.  It seems like all the brands&lt;br /&gt;being sold in the US are no longer made in their respective countries so at some&lt;br /&gt;point when you either replace the blade/trimmer assembly it will be junk.  If they&lt;br /&gt;offered Grundig here in the US I would go back and purchase that brand.  However,&lt;br /&gt;since that is not an option, Panasonic has me as their customer for this product.</li>
            <li> This shaver provides a decent shave and, with its \\&quot;water shutters\\&quot;, is easier to clean than other shavers which require you to pop off the cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it&#x27;s wet/dry, I&#x27;d recommend using it dry, unless you&#x27;re using an electric-shaver gel, which acts differently from shaving cream (it stands the hair up instead of softening it). If you&#x27;re using it dry, do it over the sink to catch those little hair remnants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your beard is a little long, use the trimmer first, then go over it with the screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depending on your face contours, you may need to go over the area a couple of times. This is standard for these kinds of shavers.</li>
            <li> First, I must confess that I&#x27;ve been a blade shaver for most of my life, but I&#x27;m always looking for an electric substitute. I even once bought a $250 Braun, but found that while it gave me a fairly close shave, it just couldn&#x27;t equal a blade. So when I saw that this Panasonic shaver could be used wet, and even with shaving cream, I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. Unfortunately, I was disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The closeness of the shave doesn&#x27;t approach even the Braun, let alone blades, and while shaving wet did get the shave a little closer, and shaving cream closer still, I found the process problematic. The shaving cream gets into the razor, of course, so I found myself opening the cleaning clips and rinsing the razor very frequently during a shave. With a blade, you just swirl the razor around in the water, but you have to let water pour through the shaver to get out the shaving cream, so every time you rinse, it&#x27;s unclip, turn on faucet, rinse, clip, and shave again. On the plus side, the cleaning of the waterproof chamber works flawlessly, and you won&#x27;t find shaving debris under the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other problem I had, and a far more significant one, was that after a few days of shaving with this razor I started to develop hard, red nubbles on my upper cheeks and the sides of my neck. After having stopped using the razor, they&#x27;re slowly going away. Needless to say, I&#x27;m not going to continue shaving with it for 30 days to \\&quot;let my face adjust,\\&quot; since I&#x27;m not sure how much face I&#x27;d have left after that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, if you&#x27;re already an electric shaver user, you might find this an okay alternative to your current shaver, and the wet shave option is nice, but it sure wasn&#x27;t the right shaver for my face, and the closeness of the shave was similar to what my face is like about 7 or 8 hours after I shave with my Gillette Fusion Power blade.</li>
            <li> Panasonic&#x27;s Milano electric shaver is a good, all around electric shaver that I&#x27;ve been using for the past few weeks, 1 of which was on the road while I traveled for business.  After giving it a full charge (took about 12 hours) I packed the Milano in my travel kit and gave it near daily use over 6 nights and did not need to re-charge it and was able to use it a few times back at home before the power drained out.  The relative compact sizing of the Milano suits it well for travel purposes and a handy plastic cover for the blade heads are provided to keep them intact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as shave quality goes - my overall impression is that it is &#x27;decent.&#x27;  I&#x27;ve had closer electric shaves and the Milano will require a few passes to finish but the overall sensation is very gentle and have yet to experience any negative post shave effects on my skin.  Another big bonus with this device is cleanup - which is about as smooth and painless as it gets.  Sometimes I use this with shaving cream and at other times i take it in to the shower and use nothing but running water while running the blade.  Form factor and design also gets positive points - its a very handsome device with great build quality.</li>
            <li> I have owned three different Panasonic wet / drys before now. I have a tough beard and sensitive skin so shaving in the shower is a must, and a electric shaver that can be used in the shower is a great idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My problems with the old Pana shavers I used were these:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) poor shave&lt;br /&gt;2) loud buzzsaw noise&lt;br /&gt;3) poor durability - dies a few months after warranty. ( I bought one and got two as gifts. Usually failure right after warranty expires would sour me on a given product / brand.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new Milano shaver addresses the first two points competently and convincingly. The Milano shaves me about as cleanly as a Fusion five blade, high praise indeed. It shaves with no irritation and no cuts, and the shave lasts as long or longer than a Fusion shave (i.e. no five o&#x27;clock shadow until maybe eight or nine o&#x27;clock!). The head does not pivot, so you will have to go over a few trouble spots carefully and sometimes repeatedly (like the chin, and jawline) but I have to do this with a regular blade anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The motor is much quieter than other electrics I have used, especially the Braun 9500 series. The motor spins at only 7.800 rpm, which may account for the lower noise. (Though the shave as mentioned is fine.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver works fine with gel, foam, or dry. It can be cleaned easily, by sluicing water into the head with two little gates you can open to allow the water to flow out. Pana makes a big deal over how convenient and quick this is, but realistically the old \\&quot;pop the head off and rinse\\&quot; system on prior Panas was just as easy and quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor charges using an induction system, meaning it does not need to have a charging cable plugged into the handle. Instead you place the shaver in the cradle and it charges once placed, assuming you placed it properly. (Look for the bright red light, hard to miss!) Battery life is fine, will last three days on one charge, assuming you shave for 7 minutes once a day like I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model is mid-priced in the Pansaonic wet/dry line. It runs at a slower RPM, does not use a linear system like some other Panas do (not quite sure what that is, nor quite sure that its absence matters), and does not have a pivoting head or digital display. It also does not have any of those idiotic gimmicks like modern Brauns have (the alcohol auto cleaning systems that quintuples the cost of ownership by requiring endless amounts of \\&quot;QuikEvap\\&quot; alcohol cartridges). I can&#x27;t comment as to whether these missing features may be worth more money to you, but to me, this shaver gives me a clean comfortable shave, and feels well-made. I don&#x27;t think one needs to spend more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only clear miss here is the pop-up trimmer. Instead of popping up parallel to the handle (like most modern shavers) Pana has the trimmer blade pop up at a strange 60 degree angle off the back of the handle. This odd angle makes using the trimmer inconvenient and awkward. If a trimmer matters that much to you, you may want to get a separate trimmer and think of this Milano model as only a shaver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one great variable is durability. The shaver seems sturdy and Pana now gives you a 2 year warranty, versus the 1 year they gave buyers on models in the past. This suggests confidence on the mfgr&#x27;s part, but only time will tell. Taking a small motorized device into a hot shower every day and running wet shaving gel through it is quite the test, and I hope this mid-priced Milano will dispel my worries. If it breaks anytime soon, I will be back to amend the review.I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model is mid-priced in the Pansaonic wet/dry line.

            <li> i am not sure why i waited so long to use an electric razor...this thing work well and is really convienient</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it does not move easily on my face.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 of these for teenage grandsons. They love them and the mother&#x27;s love them too because they don&#x27;t have to remind them to shave.  Before purchasing the shavers I read the reviews on them and they have been as good as the review so I&#x27;m adding mine as a positive 5 star</li>
            <li> This was a x-mas gift for my father-in-law.  He was really pleased that the shaver could be used on both wet and dry skin!</li>
            <li> I was desperate to find a replacement for a 5 year old Norelco and fixated on a Panasonic.  I got the ES-SL41-S, but I think my dislike applies to all Panasonic after using this as best I could for 3 months. If your a happy Norelco user, I recommend you stick with them.  The Panasonic is not able to move around your face easy enough and so it becomes a more labored shave.  The horizontal foil and blades just don&#x27;t glide that easy.  Shaving with this to satisfaction takes about 5 minutes for me,  With the Norelco, it would take around 3 and I was confident.  The panasonic still leaves me checking and concerned.  I will stick with the Panasonic for a while longer because I don&#x27;t want to totally waste my money, but I will go back to a Norelco sometime soon.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. This was bought for my 96 year old dad. He wanted something easy to use, easy to clean, and gives a close shave. It does it all. He has been very happy with it.</li>
            <li> It takes me 5 times  longer to shave with the ES-sl41-s . And even then its not a good shave.  I tried to get my money back was told they don&#x27;t do returns on personal products . What a ripoff !!</li>
            <li> Panasonic delivers with this electric shaver.  The Milano&#x27;s aesthetic is very pleasing.  It&#x27;s sized well for ease of use and it&#x27;s feel in the hand and against the skin is excellent.  I&#x27;ve used other electrics in the past - Braun, Philips - but I must say that the Panasonic is easily on par with these two heavy industry hitters.  Pound for pound and $ for $, you absolutely can&#x27;t go wrong with this shaver.</li>
            <li> Previous I had owned a rotary shaver but decided to give this model a try. It has a VERY solid build quality, a long lasting battery, and good aesthetics. I usually dry shave on the go (it is my travel razor) and sometimes in a shower. The shave itself is fine if a tad bit slower than my old rotary. If the shave has one flaw its that I found it to be very irritating and had mixed results when shaving lower on my neck. Still, I am overall VERY happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I decided to move back to an electric razor. I have very sensitive skin, so after reading some online reviews, I came across this electric razor.  I had an older model wet/dry from Panasonic about 10 years ago, and I loved it.  I opted to buy a less expensive model, and as I read the reviews here, I concur that this bad boy gave me an amazingly close shave the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Nivea shaving cream, it doesn&#x27;t foam up, with warm water, and this works great.  Clean up with the ports (a wonderful idea btw!) makes clean up easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally don&#x27;t take time to write reviews, but at $50, this razor is a steal. If you&#x27;re looking for one - couldn&#x27;t recommend this one more.</li>
            <li> I have used a disposable razor for years. And I have always wanted to be free of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other electric razors in the past, but they have all been disappointments. Turns out this is no different. I have tried two dry electronic razors and one wet/dry like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was different in one way: I did not get razor burn from the first use or any subsequent use. That&#x27;s why this gets two stars instead of one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor just did not work. I had to \\&quot;do clean up\\&quot; with a disposable every day I used it. Each day I tried to hold it at a different angle or press harder, but it just did not shave near my jaw line or on my cheeks. I won&#x27;t be doing the \\&quot;30 days\\&quot; to get used to it. It really didn&#x27;t work from the first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Caveat: another factor in my dropping it is that I have to shave my head a couple times a week and there&#x27;s no way I could use this. So I&#x27;ll have to keep buying disposables any way).</li>
            <li> Light and very close shave for an electric</li>
            <li> So far so good. Gives a close shave  and cleans easily.Follow up later....</li>
            <li> For $29 this wasn&#x27;t bad but I wouldn&#x27;t spend any more on it.  It&#x27;s a good back up razor but no where near as good as the higher end Panasonic&#x27;s.  It is quiet but it takes 24 hours to charge!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers since the age of 16 for almost 20 years now.  I&#x27;m a Braun guy but have a couple of non-Braun shavers as back ups and for travel.  I decided to purchase this one for my other residence simply due to the very positive reviews this shaver got on Amazon.  I had it for about a week and then returned it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like it because the cutter head is very bulky.  I have very carefully groomed and maintained sideburns and a small mustache and I was unable to get a good view of the lines with this shaver.  The cutter head is so bulky with the frame of the shaving foil extending so far beyond the cutting area that I had a difficult time seeing where I was shaving.  I prefer shavers with much less bulky cutter heads that make it easy to visualize the line of cut.  I wasn&#x27;t impressed with this device at all.</li>
            <li> no International voltage adaptor available from Amazon.  only supports 110-120v.&lt;br /&gt;not recommended.</li>
            <li> Gave this shaver to my nephew as a gift and he loves it.  He says he uses it every day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ok. It doesn&#x27;t really give as close a shave as I expected. It is also supposed to work with shaving cream but doesn&#x27;t really do much better than dry.</li>
            <li> Does not work! The shave is awful!</li>
            <li> Perfect. Just what was needed</li>
            <li> Cannot comment, was a Christmas gift</li>
            <li> Time to shave and this makes it quick and easy for new shaver.  In the shower or out good to go</li>
            <li> I have had many electric shavers over the years.  I seem to like the Panasonic models the best.  I have bought them for myself, my wife and my boys - everyone is very pleased.  My current shaver is getting quite old (but still runs just fine) and it was time to replace the blades when I received an opportunity to get this razor through the Vine program - perfect timing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say, this is a more comfortable and closer shave than my previous models.  I am trying not to let the \\&quot;newness\\&quot; taint my review - I genuinely feel that this is a better product.  The foil is noticeably thinner than the model it replaced and the blades have an altered bevel to them.  It is these two differences that I attribute to the better shave over all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing I like is the handle is more narrow and lighter overall. This makes it easier to hold and maneuver.  I also like the stand that is also a charger - very convenient.  But the best thing is the price. It is better than the model it replaced which was almost 2x the price; not bad for a handy little wet/dry shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why not 5 stars???  There is always room for improvement. As I get older, my stubble seems to get more difficult to shave.  As I sit here and write this I can already feel the 5:00 shadow creeping in.  I can still get a closer shave with a blade, but this is getting real close to that benchmark.</li>
            <li> Right off the bat let me say this razor doesn&#x27;t give the closest shave. It&#x27;s nowhere near manual blade close. But more than any other razor I&#x27;ve tried over the years gives me the most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had. After shaving my skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight or hot and there are no tender or irritated spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the razor both wet and dry. The results are so similar that it is really personal preference; do you want to shave in front of the mirror or in the shower? I like using the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear a long Van Dyke style beard and can shave right up to the edge without the Panasonic grabbing onto the longer hair like some razors like to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is in an awkward spot It pops up perpendicular to the shaving head on the reverse side of the handle. It&#x27;s usable but not the best design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean-up is a breeze. Put a little liquid soap on the foils, splash on some water and run for a minute. Then open the slide under the shaving head and run water through the unit. Pop off the foils to thoroughly rinse the cutting blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this is a comfortable razor to shave with though the trimmer could be better positioned. It&#x27;s attractive as far as razors go. It holds enough of a charge for several shaving sessions. The charging stand holds the razor vertically so it takes up little counter space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are there better razors out there? Sure. Some cut much closer, hold a longer charge, do self cleaning but they also cost a LOT more than the Panasonic ES-Sl41-S. You&#x27;ll get a good shave at a economical price. To me, that&#x27;s all I need in a razor.</li>
            <li> This shaver is takes forever to shave my face. It runs to slow, and is a very small shaver. I expected a much better shaver.</li>
            <li> Electric shavers can run upwards of $300. This one is a lot less, and does a respectable job. Feels nice in the hand, and will give you a close shave with enough passes--this is the kind of thing I experience on all electric shavers, regardless of cost, and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few! I personally can&#x27;t comment on using it in the shower, because I just use it dry. As a dry shaver, it gives a slight bit of irritation--but nothing I notice for more than a minute or so. The trimmer is decent as well. It&#x27;s very quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver takes a while to charge (15 hours to reach full charge). And the charger is 120 v only, so don&#x27;t plan on taking it overseas without a step down transformer. I like the plastic cover, which is great for travel as it is solid, keeps the shaver from turning on, and also acts as a shaver stand. The rechargeable battery can be replaced at a service center (USA only). Blades and foil are also replaceable--you can buy those from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall conclusion--good shaver for the price!</li>
            <li> It is an electric razor that does what is expected from an electric razor.  It works well and the battery lasts as long as expected.  This is a good razor for those comfortable with electric razors.  The rinse to clean feature is a nice touch.  I have recommended it to friends.  The only reason it doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because it didn&#x27;t make me say WOW.</li>
            <li> I had an older Panasonic Wet-Dry that I bought 15 years ago for under $40 and it was still working after purchasing this one.  With regular care these razors last for years.  I&#x27;ve tried more expensive brands and this one is a sure stand-out.  I get a great shave with or without cream or soap, and the battery life has been 12-15 shaves per charge.  Great for taking on vacation without needing the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this one lasts as long as my first Panasonic wet-dry, I will not need another one until 2027!</li>
            <li> Very nice works better in shower or wet&lt;br /&gt;but best shaver for the money</li>
            <li> Bought this shaver for both myself and my father-in-law. My father-in-law said it really didn&#x27;t work very well. I thought perhaps it was because his beard was longer than mine, but then I tried it and got the same results -- it wouldn&#x27;t cut.  I ran that thing on my face over and over and it still wouldn&#x27;t shave all the hairs.  I ended up returning them both.  I&#x27;ll probably go back to a rotating head shaver.</li>
            <li> We purchased this for our 13 year old, yes I said 13.  It is really easy to use and works great.  It would be great for either an adolescent or an adult.  Our water is so soft we did not need shaving cream.  It does not need water but it is great that it is so simple to clean.</li>
            <li> If you buy this razor, plan on having an extra half hour to shave. It is definitely not designed for the working man. It leaves a lot to be desired and is highly over rated. My wife has tried it and her opinion is the same as mine. I will probably give this away to Goodwill and find a better manufactured razor. The advertising for this razor is very misleading. Don&#x27;t be fooled by slick advertising.</li>
