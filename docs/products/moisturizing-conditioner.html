            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with these products!</li>
            <li>This conditioner is fantastic!</li>
            <li>You do have to use more than one pump so the bottle goes faster than you think it will (although I do have a lot of hair).</li>
            <li>My absolutely favorite conditioner.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this product line after trying it together with the conditioner and hair oil treatment.</li>
            <li>Argan Magic Conditioner</li>
            <li>I also noticed my hair gets oilier and gets dandruff more often on days that I don&#x27;t shampoo with Vidal Sassoon Repair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used 3 bottles of Vidal Sassoon Repair Shampoo with its conditioner before Argan Magic Conditioner and never had these problems with my hair before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t very impressed, but I also didn&#x27;t use it with the Argan Magic Shampoo, so it might be different if I had used them</li>

            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It competes with all the top of the line salon conditioners.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels a million times better.  </li>
            <li>I must admit that she has gotten a lot more compliments from me since she started using this product.</li>
            <li>My hair and scalp look very clean and healthy after use.</li>
            <li>I got the whole bottle of what I paid for!!!!</li>
            <li>At first, I thought, &amp;#34;good shampoo, nice lather, nice smell.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>There was a good amount of tangle, which was the first sign of the conditioner being average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I take 1500 mg of coral calcium too which helps keep hair and nails strong and healthy along with bones and joints!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such</li>
            <li>price on Amazon for the combo is a fantastic bargain, I paid much more somewhere else.  </li>
            <li>It feels like it provides some sort of truly magic coating that sticks around after the shower that makes my hair straighten easier and stay frizz free.</li>
            <li>My hair is softer , tangle-free, beautifully conditioned, and actually looks really healthy for once.</li>
            <li>Conditioner doesn&#x27;t have to be really think to be good.</li>
            <li>This is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used, hands down.</li>
            <li>The consistency is like pouring water into a shampoo and conditioner bottle when you&#x27;re about to run out and are being really cheap.</li>
            <li>It is so rich and it realy detangles my hair.</li>
            <li>I love this product, since then I have been using it for 5 months now, and it has not fail me.</li>
            <li>I thought this product would be of great help to my dry hair...</li>
            <li>I didnt get the feeling my hair was clean.</li>
            <li>Was not what I expected but turned out to be great product.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes after reading reviews, but was neither highly satisfied, nor dissatisfied after using this.</li>
            <li>I completely recommend it!! :)</li>
            <li>I love how clean and soft it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>My hair didn&#x27;t feel soft when I got out of the shower like my good shampoos normally do.</li>
            <li>Holy Moly does it dry your hair out and mine is fairly oily.</li>
            <li>Amazon delivers again thanks!!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t pick up the shampoo since I have so many others at home already that I&#x27;m trying to clear</li>
            <li>I loved the smell and had such high hopes</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s for African American hair, but it works great on Caucasian hair.  </li>
            <li>First time using it</li>
            <li>I love buying on Amazon, especially through Prime if I can.</li>
            <li>FIRST IMPRESSIONS ----&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have chemical treated hair and this worked better than big salon names.</li>
            <li>Will be ordering more when she is getting low on this supply</li>
            <li>It felt clean, silky and soft for 4 days!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I might not purchase this again when the bottle runs out -- which, it&#x27;s running out really quickly since I normally have to use around 20 pumps just to cover all my hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;I might not purchase this again when the bottle runs out -- which, it&#x27;s running out really quickly since I normally have to use around 20 pumps just to cover all my hair alone.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t think the conditioner would do anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You have to put tons of conditioner to actually feel your hair smooth.</li>
            <li>No matter what I do or how much I use, it doesn&#x27;t foam.</li>
            <li>that more so than the other stuff.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m finding my hair is very smooth and a lot less frizzy</li>
            <li>You have to use triple what you normally would because the formula does not lather very well.</li>
            <li>: I&#x27;m also finding that my normal wavey curly full of body hair is completely flat...  </li>
            <li>settling for 3 stars for Argan Magic Conditioner, which I feel is a little generous.</li>
            <li>settling for 3 stars for Argan Magic Conditioner, which I feel is a little generous.</li>
            <li>Although my hair is pretty healthy, it gets very frizzy and dried out in the Southern California summer</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t feel anything like normal conditioner in your hair.</li>
            <li>next day, my hair was pretty frizzy and my hand gets caught in it when I run my hand through it.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and this conditioner has made my hair the softest it has ever been!</li>
            <li>When I used this product for the first time, I thought it would be some cheap conditioner, because the texture of the conditioner wasn&#x27;t thick.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After shampooing, I put 20 pumps of Argan Magic into my hair, starting halfway down my hair and spread it out to the roots</li>
            <li>It just won&#x27;t get down into your scalp to clean without any suds.</li>
            <li>I have fine blonde hair (which shows oil when I don&#x27;t wash it, but gets dried out when I wash it too much</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so upset when I got my package the whole bottle of conditioner was spilled everywhere and open</li>
            <li>made it soft just witch</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair really soft and shinny.</li>
            <li>like I nearly cried.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>The conditioner hydrated my curls and kept my curls soft for the rest of the week.</li>
            <li>The ends are soft and so is the rest.  </li>
            <li>My hair has never been so thick and healthy</li>
            <li>The conditioner is just OK, not different from other similar conditioners.</li>
            <li>Many shampoo and conditioners I&#x27;ve tried seem to either leave my hair too dry or weighed down</li>
            <li>For natural curls I use the conditioning mask and let it dry by itself, or if I want it straight</li>
            <li>Overall happy with this, but sadly can&#x27;t say the same for the shampoo from this brand.</li>
            <li>My hair is very thick and curly and it is so soft, healthy and manageable after I&#x27;m done using the conditioner.</li>
            <li>and it actually leaves my hair really soft .</li>
            <li>My hair is strawberry blonde with a thick yet fine texture.</li>
            <li>I am African American and it works wonders on my natural hair.</li>
            <li>After rinsing and drying my hair, my hair seems clean and soft, not weighed down or dried</li>
            <li>This conditioner does the job well: keeping it moisturized but not weighed down too much.</li>
            <li>have naturally curly hair and have been just letting it dry and sort of style itself for a while.  </li>

            <li> have naturally curly hair and have been just letting it dry and sort of style itself for a while.  </li>

            <li> I use it on mine and my daughters long blonde fragile hair</li>
            <li> My hair normally has 1-2 strands come out, but when 5 would get pulled out, that was a little bit too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> that hasn&#x27;t happened in a long time.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly/frizzy hair that is pretty thin, and this doesn&#x27;t weigh it down at all.</li>
            <li> I only have like half the bottle left this</li>
            <li> and then whatever&#x27;s left goes to the upper half of my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased the combo (sorry Amazon, not here!), Argan Magic Moisturizing Shampoo and Conditioner</li>
            <li> Like other people who bought the product, I ended up using a bigger amount of it in every wash, cause it always felt like it was doing nothing to my hair.</li>

            <li> This product is not for black women with relaxers!</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair and hate to have it dirty with oil OR clean but frizzy dry and damaged.  </li>
            <li> I usually use a leave - in  conditioner afterwards to maintain the softness.</li>

            <li> This product is not for black women with relaxers! DO NOT BUY IT!  My hair felt dry, rough and tangled afterward.</li>
            <li> First time using it and it actually leaves my hair really soft .</li>
            <li> Hair looks great, manageable, and color is brighter! Check prices online and at local TJMaxx or Marshals for best buy.</li>
            <li> Save your money and buy something else.  You have to use triple what you normally would because the formula does not lather very well. The conditioner is no different. You have to use a ton to cover your head.</li>
            <li> I purchased the combo (sorry Amazon, not here!), Argan Magic Moisturizing Shampoo and Conditioner and I love the balance it gives my hair!  At first, I thought, &amp;#34;good shampoo, nice lather, nice smell.&amp;#34;  However, after rinsing out the shampoo, I put the conditioner on and it seemed to disappear and I thought, &amp;#34;another dud!&amp;#34;  I went ahead and let the conditioner sit on my hair through the remainder of my shower, about 3 minutes and then rinsed my hair in cooler water so as not to rinse out the conditioner totally.  I really didn&#x27;t think the conditioner would do anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally curly hair and have been just letting it dry and sort of style itself for a while.  I didn&#x27;t think much more about my hair.  After it dried, I ran my fingers through the hair and it actually felt silky and soft!  I was amazed and thought, &amp;#34;Wow, that hasn&#x27;t happened in a long time.&amp;#34;  Day two, the same feel.  It felt clean, silky and soft for 4 days!  Even the 5th day my hair wasn&#x27;t bad and the style stayed in pretty well (my natural curl).  I hated washing again because I was afraid the effects wouldn&#x27;t happen again, I actually liked my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve washed it three times now and am still getting the same results.  If you buy these products, give yourself a good shampoo and then rinse with warm water to make sure all the soap is out.  Put in about 10 pumps of the conditioner starting on the longer part of your hair, but don&#x27;t be afraid to apply to the scalp as it doesn&#x27;t make it the scalp greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price on Amazon for the combo is a fantastic bargain, I paid much more somewhere else.  But I will purchase on Amazon next time I buy!  I love buying on Amazon, especially through Prime if I can.</li>
            <li> Argan Magic Shampoo/Conditioner is AWWWWWFUL. This water piece of crap formula causes dry scalp, makes hair fall out, and is the WORST I have ever used on my hair. Even worse than the crap they give in travel size containers in hotels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, don&#x27;t be fooled. There are argan oils that CAN do wonders but this is NO MAGIC and is NOT worth the expense of your hair.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes after reading reviews, but was neither highly satisfied, nor dissatisfied after using this. The consistency is like pouring water into a shampoo and conditioner bottle when you&#x27;re about to run out and are being really cheap. I have long thick hair and normally use 2 quarter sized dabs of shampoo and conditioner.. For this brand, I had to use 6-7 pumps in order to fully lather my hair, if the watery substance didn&#x27;t fall onto the shower floor before making it to my hair. My hair didn&#x27;t feel soft when I got out of the shower like my good shampoos normally do. However, when my hair dried, all my curls were more defined, less frizzy, my hair felt lighter, and less tangled. I used a product called &amp;#34;Bed Head&amp;#34; as a conditioning cream when my hair was damp which also helped.</li>
            <li> I purchased this conditioner, along with the shampoo, at a local store within the last week. My hair is strawberry blonde with a thick yet fine texture. Many shampoo and conditioners I&#x27;ve tried seem to either leave my hair too dry or weighed down - there&#x27;s no balance. After shampooing, I&#x27;ll apply the conditioner and leave it in for a few minutes. After rinsing and drying my hair, my hair seems clean and soft, not weighed down or dried out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is that the shampoo seems to be difficult to pump out of the bottle, while the conditioner is a breeze to pump out. With the shampoo bottle, I typically just unscrew the pump and retrieve the desired amount that way. The shampoo does lather quite well.  Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with these products!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is fantastic! I have fine blonde hair (which shows oil when I don&#x27;t wash it, but gets dried out when I wash it too much and definitely when I blow dry it) so finding a conditioner that doesn&#x27;t weigh it down, but allows me to wash and condition it everyday is a challenge.  This conditioner does the job well: keeping it moisturized but not weighed down too much. You do have to use more than one pump so the bottle goes faster than you think it will (although I do have a lot of hair). Overall happy with this, but sadly can&#x27;t say the same for the shampoo from this brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so upset when I got my package the whole bottle of conditioner was spilled everywhere and open I can&#x27;t believe I paid for that I only have like half the bottle left this is ridiculous I want my money back very unhappy the product itself is not bad worked good on my hair made it soft just witch I got the whole bottle of what I paid for!!!!</li>
            <li> My absolutely favorite conditioner. I use the shampoo and conditioner weekly &amp; it leaves my hair so moisturized. I am African American and it works wonders on my natural hair.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair and hate to have it dirty with oil OR clean but frizzy dry and damaged.  I fell in love with this product line after trying it together with the conditioner and hair oil treatment. I wash and condition once every five days but I shower and just use the conditioner every day followed by the oil every day before styling.  For natural curls I use the conditioning mask and let it dry by itself, or if I want it straight I blow dry or use the straightening product.  My hair has never been so thick and healthy (I take 1500 mg of coral calcium too which helps keep hair and nails strong and healthy along with bones and joints!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such a great bargain when you look at salon product prices!</li>
            <li> Was not what I expected but turned out to be great product. It leaves your hair really soft and shinny.</li>
            <li> I picked this up at TJ Maxx since I was out of conditioner. I didn&#x27;t pick up the shampoo since I have so many others at home already that I&#x27;m trying to clear out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About my hair: I have really thick Filipino hair, that&#x27;s never been dyed before. It&#x27;s almost down to my belly button. I hardly ever put heat to it and I air dry it every night. Although my hair is pretty healthy, it gets very frizzy and dried out in the Southern California summer heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---- FIRST IMPRESSIONS ----&lt;br /&gt;My regimen with this conditioner:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Vidal Sasson Pro Series Repair Shampoo&lt;br /&gt;2. Argan Magic Conditioner&lt;br /&gt;3. Garnier Fructis Moroccan Oil Treatment&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After shampooing, I put 20 pumps of Argan Magic into my hair, starting halfway down my hair and spread it out to the roots and then whatever&#x27;s left goes to the upper half of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner&#x27;s consistency is way too watery. I didn&#x27;t like that it was so watery because I feel like once water gets on it, the conditioner just slides off my hair. I normally leave conditioner in for at least 3-5 minutes when I shower, but I felt like by the time I rinsed off, some of the conditioner already slid off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I towel dried it, added the Garnier Moroccan oil from my ends on up and wrapped my hair in the towel for 5 minutes. After removing the towel and letting it air dry to 80% dry, I used a wide-tooth comb to untangle it. There was a good amount of tangle, which was the first sign of the conditioner being average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I braided my hair when it was dry and slept on satin pillows and bed sheets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day, my hair was pretty frizzy and my hand gets caught in it when I run my hand through it. Sometimes I would pull out 2-5 strands of hair at a time because they got tangled and fell out. My hair normally has 1-2 strands come out, but when 5 would get pulled out, that was a little bit too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair felt brittle and dry, too. I also noticed my hair gets oilier and gets dandruff more often on days that I don&#x27;t shampoo with Vidal Sassoon Repair. I&#x27;ve used 3 bottles of Vidal Sassoon Repair Shampoo with its conditioner before Argan Magic Conditioner and never had these problems with my hair before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m settling for 3 stars for Argan Magic Conditioner, which I feel is a little generous. I wasn&#x27;t very impressed, but I also didn&#x27;t use it with the Argan Magic Shampoo, so it might be different if I had used them together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might not purchase this again when the bottle runs out -- which, it&#x27;s running out really quickly since I normally have to use around 20 pumps just to cover all my hair alone.oilier and gets dandruff more often on days that I don&#x27;t shampoo with Vidal Sassoon Repair.

            <li> Great product. Bought from a local store. I love how clean and soft it makes my hair feel. I have chemical treated hair and this worked better than big salon names. Will keep using this product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It competes with all the top of the line salon conditioners.  Amazon delivers again thanks!!</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used, hands down. I have naturally curly/frizzy hair that is pretty thin, and this doesn&#x27;t weigh it down at all. It feels like it provides some sort of truly magic coating that sticks around after the shower that makes my hair straighten easier and stay frizz free. I will never use another kind of conditioner and won&#x27;t travel without it! Seriously people, try it!!!!</li>
            <li> I just purchased the shampoo and conditioner and oh my goodness did it ever not work! I loved the smell and had such high hopes but unfortunately I was so disappointed :( After one use my hair was so dry and straw like I nearly cried. Back to my faithful TRESemmé.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing for damaged hair. I&#x27;ve recommended it and sold it before. BUT I must warn you, this product works best on CAUCASIAN HAIR. Damaged African American hair does not mix well with this. It can feel and appear dry. Be careful!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is amazing!!  I already had the shampoo and so when I purchased the condtioner, I knew what to expect. It is so rich and it realy detangles my hair. My hair is very thick and curly and it is so soft, healthy and manageable after I&#x27;m done using the conditioner. The smell is also great. My hair and scalp look very clean and healthy after use. It definitely is a good quality product. I usually use a leave - in  conditioner afterwards to maintain the softness.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair. When I used this product for the first time, I thought it would be some cheap conditioner, because the texture of the conditioner wasn&#x27;t thick. I was totally wrong! The conditioner hydrated my curls and kept my curls soft for the rest of the week. I love this product, since then I have been using it for 5 months now, and it has not fail me.</li>
            <li> I thought this product would be of great help to my dry hair... but it turned out to be everything but helpful. I didnt get the feeling my hair was clean. Like other people who bought the product, I ended up using a bigger amount of it in every wash, cause it always felt like it was doing nothing to my hair.</li>
            <li> I have had chemical burns from an allergic reaction to this conditioner for over a week now. There are two chemicals that are outlawed in Europe in this and it should be pulled off of the shelves.</li>
            <li> Leaves the hair very dry.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and this conditioner has made my hair the softest it has ever been!</li>
            <li> You have to put tons of conditioner to actually feel your hair smooth.</li>
            <li> I bought the shampoo/conditioner from winners for 20 bucks in a combo pack. I&#x27;m finding my hair is very smooth and a lot less frizzy HOWEVER: I&#x27;m also finding that my normal wavey curly full of body hair is completely flat...  So not worth it for me .</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this on amazon, but got the shampoo &amp; conditioner combo for around $20 at a local Marshall&#x27;s .. I use it on mine and my daughters long blonde fragile hair and it it absolutely fabulous !!! I even made a detangler out of the conditioner in a spray bottle with water for in the mornings to detangler my six year olds hair.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s for African American hair, but it works great on Caucasian hair.  My hair is softer , tangle-free, beautifully conditioned, and actually looks really healthy for once. I completely recommend it!! :)</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff at TJ Maxx and I&#x27;m headed back to return it now. Holy Moly does it dry your hair out and mine is fairly oily. It feels watery, like someone added water to thicker conditioner. After you apply it it while it&#x27;s still wet it doesn&#x27;t feel anything like normal conditioner in your hair. Once your hair is dry it feels stiff. I can&#x27;t even run my fingers through my hair. YUCK! I used it twice and it has really dried my hair out in just two uses.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is just OK, not different from other similar conditioners. About average. The matching shampoo is terrible though. It will not suds at all. No matter what I do or how much I use, it doesn&#x27;t foam. Instructions say to put some in your hand and add water and rub together to make suds, but it doesn&#x27;t. (And what other shampoo requires that?) It just won&#x27;t get down into your scalp to clean without any suds. I had to throw it out.</li>
            <li> I bought the shampoo, condition, and the matching leave in conditioner at Marshall&#x27;s recently.  I&#x27;m shocked people are saying it dried their hair out.  My hair was very dry to start (I can&#x27;t go to sleep without washing my hair every night).  My friend recommended I try something with oils in it to compensate for all the oil-stripping I do with excessive washing.  Tried this stuff and its great!!  My hair feels a million times better.  The ends are soft and so is the rest.  Only been about 1.5 weeks on this stuff.  I think the leave in treatment is a big part of it so I would recommend you get that more so than the other stuff.  Also, someone said its watery but its not the &amp;#34;cheap watery&amp;#34; that you would get from the dollar store.  Conditioner doesn&#x27;t have to be really think to be good.</li>
            <li> My wife loves the way her hair looks and feels after using this product. I must admit that she has gotten a lot more compliments from me since she started using this product. Will be ordering more when she is getting low on this supply</li>
