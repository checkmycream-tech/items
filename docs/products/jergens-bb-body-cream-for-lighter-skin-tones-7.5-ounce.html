    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li>best part?</li>
            <li>Just impressed.</li>
            <li>An excellent product; through a friends help and suggestion</li>
            <li>(For instance, my scar tissue I&#x27;ve been rubbing the lotion over is still perfectly visible.)  </li>
            <li>The best part of this is that I&#x27;m not ORANGE!  </li>
            <li>But on the plus side the cream did feel wonderful when applied.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is great!</li>
            <li>i have very fair skin</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
            <li>Add to this beautiful combination</li>
            <li>great item, great price</li>
            <li>But a great product.</li>
            <li>The BB cream for lighter skin tones is great for me, I am in the ivory spectrum of makeup.</li>
            <li>I used this BB Cream for two weeks and while it does a great job moisturizing, I did not find it to lighten and even out my skin tones as it was supposed to.</li>
            <li>so eh....but after almost a week of use my skin is in way better condition!!</li>
            <li>it makes my skin look wonderful and healthy.  </li>
            <li>I am just thrilled to have found this product and will continue to use it!</li>
            <li>I did like the pleasant scent this lotion has.</li>
            <li>a moisturizer, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>Not as much as I&#x27;d liked, but it did what any REALLY GREAT MOISTURIZER would</li>
            <li>will use this for special evenings when I want to look my best.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my order.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I really love it!</li>
            <li>Somewhat; it works best if you exfoliate first</li>
            <li>lovely lotion!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite body lotion!</li>
            <li>; sample and I was pretty impressed.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Having said that, this cream does an okay job of moisturizing and has a pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li>and I found this effect quite attractive, perfectly fine for the day time, not at all disco.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a blond and find most tinted moisturizers don&#x27;t look very good on light skin tones...</li>
            <li>My skin doesn&#x27;t feel any firmer, but the moisturizer does make it feel nice and smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was thrilled with this product until I looked up the ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find the cream to be particularly effective in this area.  </li>
            <li>It smells kind of like Moroccan Argan Oil to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I think this product is hydrating and looks nice when applied.  </li>
            <li>All in all, nice product.  </li>
            <li>I love this cream and been using this a year and result is good.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stain, smells nice and my skin has a nice healthy sheen after I use it.</li>
            <li>cream has a light tint to it, smells pleasant, and is hydrating.</li>
            <li>I also burn very easily.</li>
            <li>This is amazing, it&#x27;s not a tanner, but leaves your skin with a nice slightly-sunkissed glow, applies easily, and does not rub off on clothing.</li>
            <li>After 5 days I was able to go to a wedding with no pantyhose and be happy with my legs,which is why I got it in the first place.</li>
            <li>I love the smell though.</li>
            <li>i love this stuff.</li>
            <li>i actually use it on my face instead of my skin because my face needs more moisture and this works great!</li>
            <li>Okay, this body cream lives up to the hype.</li>
            <li>and I love the way my skin looks after I use this product.</li>
            <li>From a distance, the skin looks more even, so</li>
            <li>/&gt;Directions: For best results, use daily as your body lotion.</li>
            <li>There are so many possibilities.</li>
            <li>Too many, for me to make this my duly &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>But yeah, really nice, light moisturizing self tanner.</li>
            <li>My skin also looks radiant :)</li>
            <li>As the first BB cream I tried for my body, I liked it!  </li>
            <li>It has a nice fragrance, and goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li>It does hydrate, so I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars for that, but so do most moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>and my skin just looks better.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a more even tone on my legs and increased moisture and softness everywhere I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li>love it.  </li>
            <li>i will be buying more to keep up my skin being moisturized.</li>
            <li>I think this does all that it says and more.</li>
            <li>and my legs looked better.</li>
            <li>The smell is NOT too strong,it&#x27;s a light nice smell.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying this one.</li>
            <li>However, I love the way this cream makes my skin feel and smell.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Would hope for more truth in advertising from one of the oldest skin lotion brands.</li>
            <li>I use this on my face and love it.</li>
            <li>I plan on continuing to use this product just on my legs, since that is the body part that bothers me most.</li>
            <li>They also have a lot of scars from surgery, so I can&#x27;t use most self tanning products.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>better.</li>
            <li>I do wish it had a better scent or no scent at all.</li>
            <li>Am using it on my arms and legs mostly.  </li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>and I love the size of the bottle.</li>
            <li>Nice light  fragrance.</li>
            <li>But a self-confident teen is a very good thing!</li>
            <li>My skin looks better having used this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The color and tone was more even.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel great and moisturizes much longer than the cream I had been using prior.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So as a moisturizer it is great, but donâ€™t expect too much in the Blemish/Beauty Balm department.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to wash between your fingers after applying.</li>
            <li>But there is one downside, it doesn&#x27;t minimize the appearance of imperfections, but that is ok.</li>
            <li>body glow does a better job of minimizing imperfections on my legs.  </li>
            <li>The way it evens your skin tone and minor imperfections will look wonderful, great product in that aspect as well :) Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Great for older skin.</li>
            <li>My husband refers to the scent as &amp;#34;stripper lotion scent.&amp;#34; Because I&#x27;m happy with the results of the product, I&#x27;ll continue to use it, I just wish it came in an unscented or more natural scented variety.</li>
            <li>I love the way this looks and feels, but the smell is SO strong so be warned.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fine with the price, it&#x27;s a bit more than the Eucerin Cream I was using, but it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy/sticky like that one does.</li>
            <li>The bottle is large and provides a good number of uses.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li>It blends with all the skin tones in a light to medium range to give a brighter, healthy look to skin.&lt;br /&gt;Reasonably priced...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fragrance preference is subjective, so the most important consideration is whether the cream worked -- on me it did not.</li>
            <li>I wish they could make this stuff fragrance free or make the fragrance more sporty....</li>
            <li>It has a slight tint to make skin more radiant and smells delicious.</li>
            <li>will be picking up the full size asap!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a very light sweet perfume scent, nothing strong, so on the plus side, it probably would not compete with perfume.  </li>
            <li>i like the fact it is lightly scented,creamy and also good for the whole body and face.</li>
            <li>It smells like a tanner but not as strong.</li>
            <li>Also, it is not mentioned on the bottle, but there is a strong scent.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t find the fragrance to be too strong.  </li>
            <li>It has a light fragrance and applies easily.  </li>
            <li>She used it every day the week and a half before prom and her arms looked great!</li>
            <li>, the smell is light and smells great-not too strong.</li>
            <li>It has a mild, lingering fragrance that was more noticeable when I was applying it but faded soon</li>
            <li>or if it&#x27;s all in my head, but my skin all over really does seem to look better!  </li>
            <li>I chose to rate this four stars because it smells amazing, is very moisturizing, easy to apply, is not greasy.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this Skin Cream, it is a sweet and clean smell.    </li>
            <li>It smells very good, and really made my skin feel soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>This is too light for me.</li>
            <li>I applied the product primarily after showers and it ;lasted about a month.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light tanner.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, it didn&#x27;t give me a splotchy look that some self-tanners do.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I liked it so much I bought a full-sized bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Will continue buying though cause nothing else makes my legs this smooth.</li>
            <li>Jergens BB Body Cream is supposed to Hydrate and Smooth, Brightens and Illuminates,</li>
            <li>I am cheap.  </li>
            <li>enjoy this product</li>
            <li>important point to mention is that it does not contain sun screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried the light version</li>
            <li>In five days the cream will 1) Hydrate and Smooth, 2) Brighten &amp; Illuminate, 3)</li>
            <li>This is not a heavy duty moisturizer for damaged skin, it is a hydrating skin enhancer for skin that is in basically good condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of BB Cream for my face, so I was excited to try this BB Body Cream.</li>
            <li>Smooth and not a bad smell.</li>
            <li>I did not notice any significant improvements to appearance in skin tone after use,  </li>
            <li>I was excited to purchase when I saw the ads.</li>
            <li>Jergens has never disappointed me with their products.</li>
            <li>its rich and creamy.</li>
            <li>This large tube of lightly scented skin cream has hydrating qualities and evens out your skin making it look better than before.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m sure there are other good lotions too.</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>my special skin needs.  </li>
            <li>It had a nice subtle scent and felt great on the skin.</li>
            <li>Here is my full review  </li>
            <li>is a good option for when you throw on a dress and realize that your legs are white as hell.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, my  skin got hydrated .</li>
            <li>one thing I&#x27;d point out is that it has a more potent smell than most other moisturizers.</li>
            <li>Just wish they mentioned it was a mild self tanner.</li>
            <li>It has a light floral scent which surprised me but is not at all overwhelming.</li>
            <li>everything absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>you are going to go through it quickly.</li>
            <li>The cream dries quickly and the tint did not rub off on my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>quickly and won&#x27;t rub off on clothes</li>
            <li>and gives a pretty and light glow.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite moisturizer for my legs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My new favorite moisturizer, though.</li>
            <li>Works good as moisturizer and I sense no feeling of dry skin when wearing it .</li>
            <li>Pretty excited about using this over the summer when I start wearing shorts and dresses.</li>
            <li>My mom even told me my back is looking much better!</li>
            <li>This is a worthwhile product, especially during the summer or if you live in a warm climate.</li>
            <li>I am extremely light skinned, so imperfections are very noticable on me.</li>
            <li>It feels silky smooth and dries up fast once you apply it.</li>
            <li>However I don&#x27;t think the cost of this lotion is worth that</li>
            <li>After getting a sample of Jergens BB Body Cream in my monthly Birchbox, I was surprised by how much I liked it, and, even better, the 2nd ingredient was shea butter!</li>
            <li>definitely one of the lotions i&#x27;ve truly liked.</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>I rarely wait to get dressed, as the product recommends, but have never had any staining.</li>
            <li>I think it is worth the money...</li>
            <li>This cream has a nice fragrance, and though I can&#x27;t say it does all the things it claims to, it does leave my skin moisturized and with a nice, subtle sheen.</li>
            <li>I applied it on my hands, just to try it out, right when I received it.  </li>
            <li>Since this is the depth of winter in the Midwest I don&#x27;t think this was the right time of year</li>
            <li>There is a bit on my hands, but I wash them right away.</li>
            <li>It is a nice thick lotion that goes on smoothly and absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li>The Jergens BB cream is 7.5 ounce, very economical and works almost as good if not better.</li>
            <li>So if you want a sure fire product to turn to to smooth out dry bumpy skin this will help.</li>
            <li>I generally do like Jergens products, but I really love this BB Body Cream.  </li>
            <li>I really gave this stuff a full try.  </li>
            <li>Although I didn&#x27;t purchase this (was sent a sample by mail), I certainly wouldn&#x27;t recommend or buy it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how much it actually firms the skin, but it does make my legs feel great and sexy.</li>
            <li>I like this BB Body Cream very much.</li>
            <li>Smells much nicer than self tanners but does eventually start to smell less pleasant.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t exactly an equivalent of what bb creams do for the face.</li>
            <li>After 30 days, same results, so more applications does not make skin tone any darker.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s really thick and makes my skin feel great.</li>
            <li>Better than generic lotions.  </li>
            <li>I was able to test the product on one leg as a comparision test to just the regular Nivea lotion I had been using.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel there is an obvious difference in the coloring of my legs versus the rest of my body since the coloring is more of a highlighting than darkening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>being said, I love this cream and will purchase this in the future.  </li>
            <li>and i wouldn&#x27;t say it looks more perfected as a facial bb creme</li>
            <li>While I love the cream, I don&#x27;t think I could bring myself to pay the current price of $24.95.</li>
            <li>Works pretty darn well.</li>
            <li>and this is pretty perfumey so it may not work for me.</li>
            <li>My back feels smoother, softer, and looks more even toned.</li>
            <li>I used to try to use self-tanners to achieve a healthy glow, but they just left me orange and streaky, no matter what I did.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion, using it everyday gives you a nice natural glow.</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing and it sank in my skin right away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried tanning lotions, but they aren&#x27;t for me since you have to apply it consistently to your whole body to make sure that you remain the same color</li>
            <li>great subtle smell and very lightweight but also moisturizes pretty darn</li>
            <li>Enough to go out and buy the full size!</li>
            <li>fragrance is strong initially, but it fades eventually.  </li>
            <li>And frankly, any pigment strong enough to show up on your skin and/or even out your skin tone would probably just stain your clothes anyway.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t last very long, but it&#x27;s fairly inexpensive for the quality, so it works out.</li>
            <li>That might not be considered a negative to many, but it is quite strong.</li>
            <li>The real downside, however, was that it was not as moisturizing or smoothing as my current body lotion (&amp;#34;Amazing Grace&amp;#34; by Philosophy - makes my skin really smooth and moisturized all day long, and since I don&#x27;t wear perfume, I love the smell).</li>
            <li>This product gave me a nice little boost.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it really perfects or covers imperfections though.</li>
            <li>works very well under my makeup too</li>
            <li>I will probably go through the tube too fast.</li>
            <li>: this was what really sold it for me.</li>
            <li>The color is very sheer&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think any drugstore-priced moisturizer really can, though.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are seeking something that will address imperfections, I cannot really recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>SO, this product doesn&#x27;t advertise what it really is.</li>
            <li>I just wanted to share that you can get this MUCH cheaper at Target.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin look great but not happy about the price.  </li>
            <li>The price is reasonable for a tube this size, and I would recommend this to friends and family.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my skin even out as much as I would like, but I guess there isn&#x27;t much you can do about freckles.</li>
            <li>Much more than I expected.</li>
            <li>The lotion really doesn&#x27;t do what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li>For me it absorbed quickly but I do have very dry skin and pretty much</li>
            <li>I am not sure I would buy this product as I think there are many good moisturizers out there for less money.</li>
            <li>Pretty good - been using a smaller tube yet more expensive BB cream for months.</li>
            <li>I really love this stuff, it gives me just the color I need, other self tanners</li>
            <li>My skin tends to be light in the winter and dark in the summer, but this cream gives my skin an overall healthy look foor the winter.</li>
            <li>On the plus side, the product is quickly absorbed in the skin and not at all oily, in fact it is powdery, but it did not deliver any better results than my usual lotion.</li>
            <li>Since there is a tint, it is important to smooth the product over the entire area rather than just apply it to dry spots.</li>
            <li>Nothing special enough for me to keep using it.</li>
            <li>They have 2 oz trial sizes for $3, and the full size product is only $11.39 there as well.  </li>
            <li>I started using; The dark spots are beginning to fade; I am pleased I listened to my friend and her suggestion.</li>
            <li>For number 2, I would say my skin looks more illuminated after I apply it because there&#x27;s a slight pearlescence to the lotion.  </li>
            <li>and I am glad I found it for less elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I just bought this at BJs whole sale club for $10 , big and small bottle, GREAT DEAL, i used it for the first time and definitely noticed smoother skin,</li>
            <li>I imagined this being a bit different and more like actual bb cream</li>
            <li>Obviously since it&#x27;s a BB cream it is going to cost more than a traditional lotion.</li>
            <li>I was particularly wanting this for my legs and my chest.</li>
            <li>My legs not only feel incredibly soft and silky with this cream, but they look fantastic.</li>
            <li>but I will be able to decrease my dependence by one more expensive product in the summer and use this BB cream instead.  </li>
            <li>it really smooths out your legs and leaves them feeling very soft...</li>
            <li>Nothing new, special, different.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very surprised at how long it hydrated and made my skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li>But i just  wish it got a little more coverage.</li>
            <li>I have been using the cream for a little more than five days now.  </li>
            <li>cream comes out of the tube quite thick but smoothes quickly and easily on the skin.</li>
            <li>This lotion really won&#x27;t help cover any imperfections, it rubs on clear.</li>
            <li>But if your schedule allows for the extra time, and you&#x27;re a fan of BB Creams for the face, it&#x27;s worth checking this out to see if it will work for your skin.ow what the ingredient is</li>
            <li>But if your schedule allows for the extra time, and you&#x27;re a fan of BB Creams for the face, it&#x27;s worth checking this out to see if it will work for your skin.</li>
            <li>only thing though, is that it goes pretty fast.  </li>
            <li>My skin felt and appeared more firm.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a very rich, long lasting cream.</li>
            <li>I love this product and now have a subscription to get a new tube every few months.</li>
            <li>I used the cream on my left arm, and used nothing on my right.  </li>
            <li>I feel like this is a nice final touch to even out my skin tone in the summer months when I already have a little tan.</li>
            <li>It is something i am new to,and I will keep using.</li>
            <li>Those looking to try a new moisturizer should give it a try.</li>
            <li>I have super dry skin.</li>
            <li>I love wearing dresses but often feel self conscious about my &amp;#34;bright&amp;#34; pale legs.</li>
            <li>The look is very natural, not too orange whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to perfumes though</li>
            <li>In other words, it is great on one&#x27;s arms and legs but not for dry, rough heels or winter-ravaged cuticles.</li>
            <li>And it mostly got rid of the small bumps on my thighs.</li>
            <li>Smoother, younger, and pretty.</li>
            <li>I received two samples of this cream one for light skin tones and one for dark skin tones.  </li>
            <li>I was worried that it might irritate my sensitive skin or stain my clothes, but it does neither!</li>
            <li>She wanted to bare her arms for prom but was very nervous.</li>
            <li>First, this product is only $11.99 at target</li>
            <li>I only gave it four stars because the fragrance isn&#x27;t that great, but that&#x27;s my only complaint</li>
            <li>It smells like some old woman&#x27;s funky perfume!</li>
            <li>My skin is light with slightly olive undertones.</li>
            <li>My daughter, who does have rather sensitive skin, broke out in a large rash on her arm on the fourth day</li>
            <li>Back to natural lotions from Whole Foods for me.</li>
            <li>Covers evenly and does not turn out streaky/orange like Jergens Natural Glow</li>
            <li>Also my sensitive skin did not react well to some of the ingredients.</li>
            <li>I really wanted something that would fix all the red blotches on my legs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a person who likes natural ingredients in my lotion â€“Â </li>
            <li>Jergens is not a brand I would associate with using natural ingredients).</li>
            <li>I have sensitive  </li>
            <li>So far I do like this product</li>
            <li>So I tried it on my butt and legs, after the third day, I have to say I absolutely noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple weeks, and so far-</li>
            <li>really did all of the above....</li>
            <li>I recently started using moisturizer more heavily as my swimming regime leads to drier skin than I would like.</li>
            <li>you can not go wrong with jergens , this type is good and works well.</li>
            <li>Since I have pretty significant acne on my back, it left me with dark spots all over.</li>
            <li>She is very sensitive about the scars on her arms and usually wears a light sweatshirt to hide them.</li>
            <li>It does take a minute or two to dry after application, and since I used another moisturizer first this drying time was even longer.  </li>
            <li>It does take a minute or two to dry after application, and since I used another moisturizer first this drying time was even longer.  </li>
            <li>For the past few weeks, I have been using the Jergens BB Body Cream and have noticed great improvements on my back skin!</li>
            <li>My skin runs between dry and very dry, so hydration is an important factor for me.  </li>
            <li>The BB cream goes on smoothly and quickly evens out my skin tone, makes me glowy but not greasy or weirdly shiny.</li>
            <li>It was not greasy and my dry skin absorbed it instantly.</li>
            <li>This is a body cream that moisturizes, smoothes the texture and evens out the color of the skin, imparting a soft, barely there, pearlescent glow.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much difference in my actual skin&#x27;s appearance, but maybe I didn&#x27;t give it enough time.</li>
            <li>This is consistent amongst other Jergens lotion products, like the self tanner.</li>
            <li>like super pale.</li>
            <li>slight shimmer/ faint like a light glow and LOVE IT</li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;m older and jergens has come a long way.</li>
            <li>Which is most likely due to the slight tint in the cream.</li>
            <li>If you use it only for the face it will lasts a long time (yet it is labeled to be used for your whole body as well).</li>
            <li>Because of this I&#x27;m not showing my bare legs.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is soft, floral, and powdery and once applied to the skin, of short duration.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Creates a sheer and natural</li>
            <li>As for evening the skin tone (3), yes my skin looks a little more even after I apply it because the lotion is slightly tinted, but that also fades.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for several days and couldn&#x27;t see a difference in my skin other than normal hydrating that any decent lotion or cream will do.  </li>
            <li>It comes in two versions: one for light skin tones and the other for dark skin tones.</li>
            <li>While it made my skin feel smooth initially, after an hour or so it started to feel rather dry and tight.  </li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve only applied it once, I can&#x27;t say too much yet other than I like the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Its strength definitely lies in illuminating and brightening the skin - my skin did look better, but the results were nearly as dramatic as I&#x27;d hoped.  </li>

            <li>They get a slight sheen to them and appear less pale than normal and more sleek.</li>
            <li>The scars weren&#x27;t noticeable and the slight lift in color was very flattering.</li>
            <li>for the texture, I&#x27;ve been describing it as lotion rather than cream because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s thick enough to really be a true cream.  </li>
            <li>My skin is not particularly sensitive, but I developed a rash between and above my eyebrows on the third day I used this product.</li>
            <li>this did what it seems to think it can do, it would be worth the price, but as a mediocre moisturizing cream, it certainly does not.  </li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> best part?</li>
            <li> Just impressed.</li>
            <li> An excellent product; through a friends help and suggestion</li>
            <li> (For instance, my scar tissue I&#x27;ve been rubbing the lotion over is still perfectly visible.)  </li>
            <li> The best part of this is that I&#x27;m not ORANGE!  </li>
            <li> But on the plus side the cream did feel wonderful when applied.  </li>
            <li> This lotion is great!</li>
            <li> i have very fair skin</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
            <li> Add to this beautiful combination</li>
            <li> great item, great price</li>
            <li> But a great product.</li>
            <li> The BB cream for lighter skin tones is great for me, I am in the ivory spectrum of makeup.</li>
            <li> I used this BB Cream for two weeks and while it does a great job moisturizing, I did not find it to lighten and even out my skin tones as it was supposed to.</li>
            <li> so eh....but after almost a week of use my skin is in way better condition!!</li>
            <li> it makes my skin look wonderful and healthy.  </li>
            <li> I am just thrilled to have found this product and will continue to use it!</li>
            <li> I did like the pleasant scent this lotion has.</li>
            <li> a moisturizer, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> Not as much as I&#x27;d liked, but it did what any REALLY GREAT MOISTURIZER would</li>
            <li> will use this for special evenings when I want to look my best.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my order.</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I really love it!</li>
            <li> Somewhat; it works best if you exfoliate first</li>
            <li> lovely lotion!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite body lotion!</li>
            <li> ; sample and I was pretty impressed.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Having said that, this cream does an okay job of moisturizing and has a pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> and I found this effect quite attractive, perfectly fine for the day time, not at all disco.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a blond and find most tinted moisturizers don&#x27;t look very good on light skin tones...</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t feel any firmer, but the moisturizer does make it feel nice and smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was thrilled with this product until I looked up the ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find the cream to be particularly effective in this area.  </li>
            <li> It smells kind of like Moroccan Argan Oil to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I think this product is hydrating and looks nice when applied.  </li>
            <li> All in all, nice product.  </li>
            <li> I love this cream and been using this a year and result is good.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stain, smells nice and my skin has a nice healthy sheen after I use it.</li>
            <li> cream has a light tint to it, smells pleasant, and is hydrating.</li>
            <li> I also burn very easily.</li>
            <li> This is amazing, it&#x27;s not a tanner, but leaves your skin with a nice slightly-sunkissed glow, applies easily, and does not rub off on clothing.</li>
            <li> After 5 days I was able to go to a wedding with no pantyhose and be happy with my legs,which is why I got it in the first place.</li>
            <li> I love the smell though.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff.</li>
            <li> i actually use it on my face instead of my skin because my face needs more moisture and this works great!</li>
            <li> Okay, this body cream lives up to the hype.</li>
            <li> and I love the way my skin looks after I use this product.</li>
            <li> From a distance, the skin looks more even, so</li>
            <li> /&gt;Directions: For best results, use daily as your body lotion.</li>
            <li> There are so many possibilities.</li>
            <li> Too many, for me to make this my duly &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> But yeah, really nice, light moisturizing self tanner.</li>
            <li> My skin also looks radiant :)</li>
            <li> As the first BB cream I tried for my body, I liked it!  </li>
            <li> It has a nice fragrance, and goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li> It does hydrate, so I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars for that, but so do most moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> and my skin just looks better.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a more even tone on my legs and increased moisture and softness everywhere I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li> love it.  </li>
            <li> i will be buying more to keep up my skin being moisturized.</li>
            <li> I think this does all that it says and more.</li>
            <li> and my legs looked better.</li>
            <li> The smell is NOT too strong,it&#x27;s a light nice smell.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this one.</li>
            <li> However, I love the way this cream makes my skin feel and smell.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Would hope for more truth in advertising from one of the oldest skin lotion brands.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face and love it.</li>
            <li> I plan on continuing to use this product just on my legs, since that is the body part that bothers me most.</li>
            <li> They also have a lot of scars from surgery, so I can&#x27;t use most self tanning products.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> better.</li>
            <li> I do wish it had a better scent or no scent at all.</li>
            <li> Am using it on my arms and legs mostly.  </li>
            <li> I love this cream.</li>
            <li> and I love the size of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Nice light  fragrance.</li>
            <li> But a self-confident teen is a very good thing!</li>
            <li> My skin looks better having used this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The color and tone was more even.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel great and moisturizes much longer than the cream I had been using prior.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So as a moisturizer it is great, but donâ€™t expect too much in the Blemish/Beauty Balm department.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to wash between your fingers after applying.</li>
            <li> But there is one downside, it doesn&#x27;t minimize the appearance of imperfections, but that is ok.</li>
            <li> body glow does a better job of minimizing imperfections on my legs.  </li>
            <li> The way it evens your skin tone and minor imperfections will look wonderful, great product in that aspect as well :) Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Great for older skin.</li>
            <li> My husband refers to the scent as &amp;#34;stripper lotion scent.&amp;#34; Because I&#x27;m happy with the results of the product, I&#x27;ll continue to use it, I just wish it came in an unscented or more natural scented variety.</li>
            <li> I love the way this looks and feels, but the smell is SO strong so be warned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fine with the price, it&#x27;s a bit more than the Eucerin Cream I was using, but it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy/sticky like that one does.</li>
            <li> The bottle is large and provides a good number of uses.  </li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li> It blends with all the skin tones in a light to medium range to give a brighter, healthy look to skin.&lt;br /&gt;Reasonably priced...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fragrance preference is subjective, so the most important consideration is whether the cream worked -- on me it did not.</li>
            <li> I wish they could make this stuff fragrance free or make the fragrance more sporty....</li>
            <li> It has a slight tint to make skin more radiant and smells delicious.</li>
            <li> will be picking up the full size asap!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a very light sweet perfume scent, nothing strong, so on the plus side, it probably would not compete with perfume.  </li>
            <li> i like the fact it is lightly scented,creamy and also good for the whole body and face.</li>
            <li> It smells like a tanner but not as strong.</li>
            <li> Also, it is not mentioned on the bottle, but there is a strong scent.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t find the fragrance to be too strong.  </li>
            <li> It has a light fragrance and applies easily.  </li>
            <li> She used it every day the week and a half before prom and her arms looked great!</li>
            <li> , the smell is light and smells great-not too strong.</li>
            <li> It has a mild, lingering fragrance that was more noticeable when I was applying it but faded soon</li>
            <li> or if it&#x27;s all in my head, but my skin all over really does seem to look better!  </li>
            <li> I chose to rate this four stars because it smells amazing, is very moisturizing, easy to apply, is not greasy.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this Skin Cream, it is a sweet and clean smell.    </li>
            <li> It smells very good, and really made my skin feel soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> This is too light for me.</li>
            <li> I applied the product primarily after showers and it ;lasted about a month.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light tanner.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, it didn&#x27;t give me a splotchy look that some self-tanners do.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I liked it so much I bought a full-sized bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Will continue buying though cause nothing else makes my legs this smooth.</li>
            <li> Jergens BB Body Cream is supposed to Hydrate and Smooth, Brightens and Illuminates,</li>
            <li> I am cheap.  </li>
            <li> enjoy this product</li>
            <li> important point to mention is that it does not contain sun screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried the light version</li>
            <li> In five days the cream will 1) Hydrate and Smooth, 2) Brighten &amp; Illuminate, 3)</li>
            <li> This is not a heavy duty moisturizer for damaged skin, it is a hydrating skin enhancer for skin that is in basically good condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of BB Cream for my face, so I was excited to try this BB Body Cream.</li>
            <li> Smooth and not a bad smell.</li>
            <li> I did not notice any significant improvements to appearance in skin tone after use,  </li>
            <li> I was excited to purchase when I saw the ads.</li>
            <li> Jergens has never disappointed me with their products.</li>
            <li> its rich and creamy.</li>
            <li> This large tube of lightly scented skin cream has hydrating qualities and evens out your skin making it look better than before.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m sure there are other good lotions too.</li>
            <li> Nothing special.</li>
            <li> my special skin needs.  </li>
            <li> It had a nice subtle scent and felt great on the skin.</li>
            <li> Here is my full review  </li>
            <li> is a good option for when you throw on a dress and realize that your legs are white as hell.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, my  skin got hydrated .</li>
            <li> one thing I&#x27;d point out is that it has a more potent smell than most other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Just wish they mentioned it was a mild self tanner.</li>
            <li> It has a light floral scent which surprised me but is not at all overwhelming.</li>
            <li> everything absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> you are going to go through it quickly.</li>
            <li> The cream dries quickly and the tint did not rub off on my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> quickly and won&#x27;t rub off on clothes</li>
            <li> and gives a pretty and light glow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my new favorite moisturizer for my legs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My new favorite moisturizer, though.</li>
            <li> Works good as moisturizer and I sense no feeling of dry skin when wearing it .</li>
            <li> Pretty excited about using this over the summer when I start wearing shorts and dresses.</li>
            <li> My mom even told me my back is looking much better!</li>
            <li> This is a worthwhile product, especially during the summer or if you live in a warm climate.</li>
            <li> I am extremely light skinned, so imperfections are very noticable on me.</li>
            <li> It feels silky smooth and dries up fast once you apply it.</li>
            <li> However I don&#x27;t think the cost of this lotion is worth that</li>
            <li> After getting a sample of Jergens BB Body Cream in my monthly Birchbox, I was surprised by how much I liked it, and, even better, the 2nd ingredient was shea butter!</li>
            <li> definitely one of the lotions i&#x27;ve truly liked.</li>
            <li> Well worth it.</li>
            <li> I rarely wait to get dressed, as the product recommends, but have never had any staining.</li>
            <li> I think it is worth the money...</li>
            <li> This cream has a nice fragrance, and though I can&#x27;t say it does all the things it claims to, it does leave my skin moisturized and with a nice, subtle sheen.</li>
            <li> I applied it on my hands, just to try it out, right when I received it.  </li>
            <li> Since this is the depth of winter in the Midwest I don&#x27;t think this was the right time of year</li>
            <li> There is a bit on my hands, but I wash them right away.</li>
            <li> It is a nice thick lotion that goes on smoothly and absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li> The Jergens BB cream is 7.5 ounce, very economical and works almost as good if not better.</li>
            <li> So if you want a sure fire product to turn to to smooth out dry bumpy skin this will help.</li>
            <li> I generally do like Jergens products, but I really love this BB Body Cream.  </li>
            <li> I really gave this stuff a full try.  </li>
            <li> Although I didn&#x27;t purchase this (was sent a sample by mail), I certainly wouldn&#x27;t recommend or buy it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much it actually firms the skin, but it does make my legs feel great and sexy.</li>
            <li> I like this BB Body Cream very much.</li>
            <li> Smells much nicer than self tanners but does eventually start to smell less pleasant.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t exactly an equivalent of what bb creams do for the face.</li>
            <li> After 30 days, same results, so more applications does not make skin tone any darker.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s really thick and makes my skin feel great.</li>
            <li> Better than generic lotions.  </li>
            <li> I was able to test the product on one leg as a comparision test to just the regular Nivea lotion I had been using.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel there is an obvious difference in the coloring of my legs versus the rest of my body since the coloring is more of a highlighting than darkening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> being said, I love this cream and will purchase this in the future.  </li>
            <li> and i wouldn&#x27;t say it looks more perfected as a facial bb creme</li>
            <li> While I love the cream, I don&#x27;t think I could bring myself to pay the current price of $24.95.</li>
            <li> Works pretty darn well.</li>
            <li> and this is pretty perfumey so it may not work for me.</li>
            <li> My back feels smoother, softer, and looks more even toned.</li>
            <li> I used to try to use self-tanners to achieve a healthy glow, but they just left me orange and streaky, no matter what I did.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, using it everyday gives you a nice natural glow.</li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing and it sank in my skin right away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried tanning lotions, but they aren&#x27;t for me since you have to apply it consistently to your whole body to make sure that you remain the same color</li>
            <li> great subtle smell and very lightweight but also moisturizes pretty darn</li>
            <li> Enough to go out and buy the full size!</li>
            <li> fragrance is strong initially, but it fades eventually.  </li>
            <li> And frankly, any pigment strong enough to show up on your skin and/or even out your skin tone would probably just stain your clothes anyway.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last very long, but it&#x27;s fairly inexpensive for the quality, so it works out.</li>
            <li> That might not be considered a negative to many, but it is quite strong.</li>
            <li> The real downside, however, was that it was not as moisturizing or smoothing as my current body lotion (&amp;#34;Amazing Grace&amp;#34; by Philosophy - makes my skin really smooth and moisturized all day long, and since I don&#x27;t wear perfume, I love the smell).</li>
            <li> This product gave me a nice little boost.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it really perfects or covers imperfections though.</li>
            <li> works very well under my makeup too</li>
            <li> I will probably go through the tube too fast.</li>
            <li> : this was what really sold it for me.</li>
            <li> The color is very sheer&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think any drugstore-priced moisturizer really can, though.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are seeking something that will address imperfections, I cannot really recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> SO, this product doesn&#x27;t advertise what it really is.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to share that you can get this MUCH cheaper at Target.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin look great but not happy about the price.  </li>
            <li> The price is reasonable for a tube this size, and I would recommend this to friends and family.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my skin even out as much as I would like, but I guess there isn&#x27;t much you can do about freckles.</li>
            <li> Much more than I expected.</li>
            <li> The lotion really doesn&#x27;t do what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li> For me it absorbed quickly but I do have very dry skin and pretty much</li>
            <li> I am not sure I would buy this product as I think there are many good moisturizers out there for less money.</li>
            <li> Pretty good - been using a smaller tube yet more expensive BB cream for months.</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff, it gives me just the color I need, other self tanners</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be light in the winter and dark in the summer, but this cream gives my skin an overall healthy look foor the winter.</li>
            <li> On the plus side, the product is quickly absorbed in the skin and not at all oily, in fact it is powdery, but it did not deliver any better results than my usual lotion.</li>
            <li> Since there is a tint, it is important to smooth the product over the entire area rather than just apply it to dry spots.</li>
            <li> Nothing special enough for me to keep using it.</li>
            <li> They have 2 oz trial sizes for $3, and the full size product is only $11.39 there as well.  </li>
            <li> I started using; The dark spots are beginning to fade; I am pleased I listened to my friend and her suggestion.</li>
            <li> For number 2, I would say my skin looks more illuminated after I apply it because there&#x27;s a slight pearlescence to the lotion.  </li>
            <li> and I am glad I found it for less elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I just bought this at BJs whole sale club for $10 , big and small bottle, GREAT DEAL, i used it for the first time and definitely noticed smoother skin,</li>
            <li> I imagined this being a bit different and more like actual bb cream</li>
            <li> Obviously since it&#x27;s a BB cream it is going to cost more than a traditional lotion.</li>
            <li> I was particularly wanting this for my legs and my chest.</li>
            <li> My legs not only feel incredibly soft and silky with this cream, but they look fantastic.</li>
            <li> but I will be able to decrease my dependence by one more expensive product in the summer and use this BB cream instead.  </li>
            <li> it really smooths out your legs and leaves them feeling very soft...</li>
            <li> Nothing new, special, different.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very surprised at how long it hydrated and made my skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li> But i just  wish it got a little more coverage.</li>
            <li> I have been using the cream for a little more than five days now.  </li>
            <li> cream comes out of the tube quite thick but smoothes quickly and easily on the skin.</li>
            <li> This lotion really won&#x27;t help cover any imperfections, it rubs on clear.</li>
            <li> But if your schedule allows for the extra time, and you&#x27;re a fan of BB Creams for the face, it&#x27;s worth checking this out to see if it will work for your skin.ow what the ingredient is</li>
            <li> But if your schedule allows for the extra time, and you&#x27;re a fan of BB Creams for the face, it&#x27;s worth checking this out to see if it will work for your skin.</li>
            <li> only thing though, is that it goes pretty fast.  </li>
            <li> My skin felt and appeared more firm.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a very rich, long lasting cream.</li>
            <li> I love this product and now have a subscription to get a new tube every few months.</li>
            <li> I used the cream on my left arm, and used nothing on my right.  </li>
            <li> I feel like this is a nice final touch to even out my skin tone in the summer months when I already have a little tan.</li>
            <li> It is something i am new to,and I will keep using.</li>
            <li> Those looking to try a new moisturizer should give it a try.</li>
            <li> I have super dry skin.</li>
            <li> I love wearing dresses but often feel self conscious about my &amp;#34;bright&amp;#34; pale legs.</li>
            <li> The look is very natural, not too orange whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sensitive to perfumes though</li>
            <li> In other words, it is great on one&#x27;s arms and legs but not for dry, rough heels or winter-ravaged cuticles.</li>
            <li> And it mostly got rid of the small bumps on my thighs.</li>
            <li> Smoother, younger, and pretty.</li>
            <li> I received two samples of this cream one for light skin tones and one for dark skin tones.  </li>
            <li> I was worried that it might irritate my sensitive skin or stain my clothes, but it does neither!</li>
            <li> She wanted to bare her arms for prom but was very nervous.</li>
            <li> First, this product is only $11.99 at target</li>
            <li> I only gave it four stars because the fragrance isn&#x27;t that great, but that&#x27;s my only complaint</li>
            <li> It smells like some old woman&#x27;s funky perfume!</li>
            <li> My skin is light with slightly olive undertones.</li>
            <li> My daughter, who does have rather sensitive skin, broke out in a large rash on her arm on the fourth day</li>
            <li> Back to natural lotions from Whole Foods for me.</li>
            <li> Covers evenly and does not turn out streaky/orange like Jergens Natural Glow</li>
            <li> Also my sensitive skin did not react well to some of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I really wanted something that would fix all the red blotches on my legs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a person who likes natural ingredients in my lotion â€“Â </li>
            <li> Jergens is not a brand I would associate with using natural ingredients).</li>
            <li> I have sensitive  </li>
            <li> So far I do like this product</li>
            <li> So I tried it on my butt and legs, after the third day, I have to say I absolutely noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple weeks, and so far-</li>
            <li> really did all of the above....</li>
            <li> I recently started using moisturizer more heavily as my swimming regime leads to drier skin than I would like.</li>
            <li> you can not go wrong with jergens , this type is good and works well.</li>
            <li> Since I have pretty significant acne on my back, it left me with dark spots all over.</li>
            <li> She is very sensitive about the scars on her arms and usually wears a light sweatshirt to hide them.</li>
            <li> It does take a minute or two to dry after application, and since I used another moisturizer first this drying time was even longer.  </li>

            <li> For the past few weeks, I have been using the Jergens BB Body Cream and have noticed great improvements on my back skin!</li>
            <li> My skin runs between dry and very dry, so hydration is an important factor for me.  </li>
            <li> The BB cream goes on smoothly and quickly evens out my skin tone, makes me glowy but not greasy or weirdly shiny.</li>
            <li> It was not greasy and my dry skin absorbed it instantly.</li>
            <li> This is a body cream that moisturizes, smoothes the texture and evens out the color of the skin, imparting a soft, barely there, pearlescent glow.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much difference in my actual skin&#x27;s appearance, but maybe I didn&#x27;t give it enough time.</li>
            <li> This is consistent amongst other Jergens lotion products, like the self tanner.</li>
            <li> like super pale.</li>
            <li> slight shimmer/ faint like a light glow and LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m older and jergens has come a long way.</li>
            <li> Which is most likely due to the slight tint in the cream.</li>
            <li> If you use it only for the face it will lasts a long time (yet it is labeled to be used for your whole body as well).</li>
            <li> Because of this I&#x27;m not showing my bare legs.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is soft, floral, and powdery and once applied to the skin, of short duration.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Creates a sheer and natural</li>
            <li> As for evening the skin tone (3), yes my skin looks a little more even after I apply it because the lotion is slightly tinted, but that also fades.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for several days and couldn&#x27;t see a difference in my skin other than normal hydrating that any decent lotion or cream will do.  </li>
            <li> It comes in two versions: one for light skin tones and the other for dark skin tones.</li>
            <li> While it made my skin feel smooth initially, after an hour or so it started to feel rather dry and tight.  </li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve only applied it once, I can&#x27;t say too much yet other than I like the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Its strength definitely lies in illuminating and brightening the skin - my skin did look better, but the results were nearly as dramatic as I&#x27;d hoped.  </li>
            <li> Its strength definitely lies in illuminating and brightening the skin - my skin did look better, but the results were nearly as dramatic as I&#x27;d hoped.  </li>
            <li> They get a slight sheen to them and appear less pale than normal and more sleek.</li>
            <li> The scars weren&#x27;t noticeable and the slight lift in color was very flattering.</li>
            <li> for the texture, I&#x27;ve been describing it as lotion rather than cream because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s thick enough to really be a true cream.  </li>
            <li> My skin is not particularly sensitive, but I developed a rash between and above my eyebrows on the third day I used this product.</li>
            <li> this did what it seems to think it can do, it would be worth the price, but as a mediocre moisturizing cream, it certainly does not.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The color of this cream blended in very well with my skin, and I am incredibly pale.  </li>
            <li> It even calms down some new acne that is growing on my back.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a whole lot at once, a little goes a long way with this cream.</li>
            <li> I particularly like it for my legs, which are pale and a bit unevenly-colored.  </li>
            <li> Massage this sheer formula over body, allowing time to dry prior to dressing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it is not going to last long.</li>
            <li> It contains a sheer tint that evens out minor imperfections and leave the skin a bit luminous.</li>
            <li> I love this product!I can understand why others might review this badly because if u do not have very pale,sun damaged,dry skin or other problems</li>
            <li> , it does not have a bad smell (its quite pleasing actually) and gives my skin a nice even tone even before i put my makeup on  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually battling a really intense dry skin rash on my legs, and I haven&#x27;t been bothered by the condition since using it.</li>
            <li> The skin tone, and other anti-aging effects are hard to see until a product has been used for a while, for me at least a month or more, and I&#x27;ve only used this for about 3 weeks now.  </li>
            <li> &amp;#34;enhanced&amp;#34; my skin  tone, only made it orangish and highlighted my rough patches.&lt;br</li>
            <li> would recommend this product as long as you remember you are using thisas a BB cream, not a tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> Previously, the only option for showing skin was a powder that is usually sparkly, or a heavy full coverage body make-</li>
            <li> I have seen a slight difference in skin tone, just an overall evening in tone, which is why I only rate it 4 stars.  </li>
            <li> For that reason alone, I&#x27;ll probably look for other alternatives before I come back to this product.</li>
            <li> was a fail, and the strong fragrance made the five days seem endless.</li>
            <li> but this lotion I don&#x27;t, my skin isn&#x27;t as dry as it used to be after I started using it.</li>
            <li> I am a diabetic with ultra dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Wait 5 minutes for it to dry before dressing</li>
            <li> I was not anticipating a miraculous transformation but do expect a product to, at least in part, live up to it&#x27;s claims.</li>
            <li> They may have been less obvious than before, but I couldn&#x27;t see a difference</li>
            <li> The smell is alright, maybe a tiny bit grandma-ish and after a while it slightly smells like tanning products....</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice anything at all with the first application, and nothing dramatic after 5 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use daily for my face... a little dissapointed , but do prefer the lightness of it.</li>
            <li> After five days I saw absolutely no improvement in any of the areas touted to be positively affected, and the scent, normally not something I am particularly sensitive to, was so unpleasant and overpowering</li>
            <li> (Which surprised me to say the least.</li>
            <li> arroved before time expected</li>
            <li> I am unsure of it&#x27;s firming capabilities, as this is not really an issue for me.</li>
            <li> I have to be careful not to brush up against anything, because the color may rub off.  </li>
            <li> Which ones, I&#x27;m not certain.</li>
            <li> It also helps to brighten the skin, which can sometimes look dull, especially after the long winter we&#x27;ve had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> 5 falls under the same category as 2 and 3, but a little less.  </li>
            <li> I wish it were a little less expensive and that the claims were less exaggerated, but I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> There are a few tiny patches of skin on my arms that are slightly darker than the rest, and after applying the cream they were still visible.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a very big tube for body lotion, and it&#x27;s expensive, so if it becomes a regular product to use, it&#x27;ll be relatively costly.  </li>
            <li> fragrance that is mentioned in the other reviews ?</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Fresh scent&amp;#34; smells like it is trying to cover some other ingredient up.  </li>
            <li> The scent was overwhelming :(</li>
            <li> The other thing I like is that I never notice any color residue or streaks.  </li>
            <li> Because it has self tanner ingredients, and I didn&#x27;t know until I noticed my legs and tummy getting dark, thus so my knees are orange.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t do much of anything else</li>
            <li> (its not SUPER noticeable</li>
            <li> I did notice a subtle change in color on my arms when compared to the back of my hands, where I did not apply any of the cream.</li>
            <li> I saw results in less than 5 days</li>
            <li> - The slight sheen does make skin imperfections, like the darker patches mentioned in #3, less noticeable by distracting the eye.  </li>
            <li> Still, throughout the day there was a slight odor that I associate with self-tanning creams -</li>
            <li> My spider veins are less noticeable, my razor bumps are taken care off and my scars are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> After trying this for about a week and a half they started to be less noticeable.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for am ample sized container of moisturizer with a slight fragrance, than this product is for you.  </li>
            <li> One half with the cream, one half without.  </li>
            <li> The slight tint helps to hide some of the skin imperfections and gives you a glowing complexion.</li>
            <li> I like it a little less on my chest.</li>
            <li> I did notice my skin seemed to be a little bit brighter and had almost a &amp;#34;finished&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> When I chose this product, I didn&#x27;t realize that it was supposed to have a little bit of self-tanning capability, but it does have a tint to it.  </li>
            <li> So I tried a little experiment, using this stuff where the sun don&#x27;t shine.  </li>
            <li> I can remember her giving me little squeezes of it to rub on.</li>
            <li> The price could be a little lower though, thus the four stars and not five.</li>
            <li> days\\&quot; I used the cream on one arm and my usual body lotion on the other.</li>
            <li> I also have white chicken legs during the entire summer.  </li>
            <li> The Jergens BB Body Cream is a moisturizer that claims to also firm up and even skin tone.</li>
            <li> It seems since i have started it that a few skin pores are redder than before.</li>
            <li> The JergensÂ® BB Body Perfecting Skin Cream made my hands feel hydrated, even and firm.  </li>
            <li> If I didn&#x27;t reapply the lotion frequently, I would have been quite uncomfortable by the end of the day.  </li>

            <li> I have been using it for a few months</li>
            <li> Not a huge change but did blend and make a difference.</li>

            <li> My legs are PALE...</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers have said, this is not a tanning cream, but a tinted moisturizer that minimizes the appearance of subtle imperfections/splotches on your skin.</li>
            <li> My knees look funny. :(</li>
            <li> I usually finish off with an Aloe Vera cream to give my skin some moisture.</li>
            <li> Usually after a week you start to see results.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the purpose of putting color in a body cream would be.</li>
            <li> The illuminating factor is subtle - there aren&#x27;t obvious chunks of mica or glitter, but the lotion does create a very subtle, dewy surface on the skin.  </li>
            <li> During summer months, I feel extraordinarily insecure because I find it difficult to wear certain types of clothes.</li>
            <li> at least, it didn&#x27;t make a lick of difference for the small spots on my arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t used jergens products in a long time, and I was definitely skeptical.  </li>
            <li> i have acne scars on my shoulders that were hard to cover up.</li>
            <li> It does have a fragrance, but compared to other overly perfume-y products I have tested in the past, it&#x27;s really not that bad.</li>
            <li> Well, at least not on my body.  </li>
            <li> negative is the price of this cream in comparision to a lotion.</li>
            <li> As a result, I have been saving it for nights that I dress up (which is at least once every week or two).</li>
            <li> and it isn&#x27;t even really a complaint.</li>
            <li> texture of the moisturizer is thick and creamy.</li>
            <li> It was thick and creamy, and disappeared into my skin without leaving any residue or greasiness.  </li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t mean that I don&#x27;t think this product works, because in my opinion it does.</li>
            <li> I like this product, but the claims are fairly ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> Which sucks!</li>
            <li> it was like a relic from the past and unfortunately it lingered for what seemed like forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It got rid of the little chicken bumps I had, ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to even out skin tone, the change was very subtle.</li>
            <li> I bought the wrong shade, I must be the darker shade.</li>
            <li> but the user would notice it, but I found it vaguely distracting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> This so called BB cream is just another fake tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> Sorry, Jergens BB Cream, I wanted to like you.</li>
            <li> This is just too expensive for me to continue buying when it doesn&#x27;t even do what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> What a rip off this should be illegal.</li>
            <li> fake either.&lt;br /&gt;You put it on like a lotion, but with a lighter touch.</li>
            <li> He guessed wrong.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it will not</li>
            <li> Needless to say, we both had to toss this expensive product in the trash.</li>
            <li> once in the morning and once at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And sadly after 5 days I saw no difference between the arms.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed.  </li>
            <li> I think a fake tanner or Bath and Body Works</li>
            <li> Adds a little tint without the nasty fragrance from self-tanners.  </li>
            <li> The product itself works well, but the side of the plastic on the bottle I received was coming apart, which was disappointing.</li>
            <li> I would suggest to anyone who suffers from &amp;#34;backne&amp;#34; to give this product a try.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this stuff moisturizes well because I cant get past the awful smell!</li>
            <li> Again, it&#x27;s very faint, and I doubt anyone</li>

            <li> I threw out the bottle but was disappointed and upset that it made me break out in a rash.</li>
            <li> should add that I have been using the product during a very cold and snowy February; I have no idea how it will react during a steamy, tropical summer day.</li>
            <li> In the summer I hate showing my legs because of the noticeable veins, bruises, etc.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought the wrong shade, I must be the darker shade. This is too light for me. It isn&#x27;t exactly an equivalent of what bb creams do for the face. It doesn&#x27;t make my body look even tone. I love the smell though.</li>
            <li> The self tanner smell is too yucky.</li>
            <li> I just bought this at BJs whole sale club for $10 , big and small bottle, GREAT DEAL, i used it for the first time and definitely noticed smoother skin, slight shimmer/ faint like a light glow and LOVE IT, the smell is light and smells great-not too strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, my  skin got hydrated . But i just  wish it got a little more coverage.</li>
            <li> This product rules! I have horrible stretch marks all over my belly,  while it doesn&#x27;t take them away,  it does make my skin look evenly toned all over. I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves skin soft. I don&#x27;t know if it really perfects or covers imperfections though.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff. i actually use it on my face instead of my skin because my face needs more moisture and this works great! works very well under my makeup too, it does not have a bad smell (its quite pleasing actually) and gives my skin a nice even tone even before i put my makeup on  (its not SUPER noticeable but i see it.. ) best part? it does not break me out!</li>
            <li> great item, great price</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff, it gives me just the color I need, other self tanners I noticed a smell but this lotion I don&#x27;t, my skin isn&#x27;t as dry as it used to be after I started using it. I love it!</li>
            <li> Covers evenly and does not turn out streaky/orange like Jergens Natural Glow can at times if you use too often.</li>
            <li> I imagined this being a bit different and more like actual bb cream I use daily for my face... a little dissapointed , but do prefer the lightness of it.</li>
            <li> The Jergens BB Body Cream is a moisturizer that claims to also firm up and even skin tone. After about 10 days of use I did notice a subtle change in color on my arms when compared to the back of my hands, where I did not apply any of the cream. After 30 days, same results, so more applications does not make skin tone any darker. On my legs I cannot detect a change. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel any firmer, but the moisturizer does make it feel nice and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture of the moisturizer is thick and creamy. It is beige in color but transparent when rubbed into the skin. It was not greasy and my dry skin absorbed it instantly. It has a mild, lingering fragrance that was more noticeable when I was applying it but faded soon after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a moisturizer, it&#x27;s a good product. If you&#x27;re looking to even out skin tone, the change was very subtle.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled with this product until I looked up the ingredients.  Am very disappointed to find &#x27;parabens&#x27; twice in the list.  Jergens makes a sunless tanning product sans parabens.  Why not this?  I avoid parabens.</li>
            <li> Okay, this body cream lives up to the hype. I saw results in less than 5 days and I love the way my skin looks after I use this product. It doesn&#x27;t stain, smells nice and my skin has a nice healthy sheen after I use it. I really love it!</li>
            <li> Smooth and not a bad smell.</li>
            <li> This large tube of lightly scented skin cream has hydrating qualities and evens out your skin making it look better than before.I am a guy and i never tried a skin cream like this.It is something i am new to,and I will keep using.I have only one issue.It seems since i have started it that a few skin pores are redder than before. i like the fact it is lightly scented,creamy and also good for the whole body and face. I will probably go through the tube too fast.</li>
            <li> I received a JergensÂ® BB Body Perfecting Skin Cream Sample.  I applied it on my hands, just to try it out, right when I received it.  It is very moisturizing and it sank in my skin right away. It did not leave a greasy film or anything, just softness.  The JergensÂ® BB Body Perfecting Skin Cream made my hands feel hydrated, even and firm.  I love the smell of this Skin Cream, it is a sweet and clean smell.    Here is my full review  [...]</li>
            <li> According to the packaging, Jergens BB Body Cream will achieve the following five results:&lt;br /&gt;1) Hydrates and smoothes&lt;br /&gt;2) Brightens and Illuminates&lt;br /&gt;3) Evens skin tone&lt;br /&gt;4) Visibly firms skin&lt;br /&gt;5) Minimizes the appearance of imperfections&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How does it score on each point?  Well...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 - Does it hydrate?  Well enough, I suppose.  My skin runs between dry and very dry, so hydration is an important factor for me.  The Jergens BB Cream didn&#x27;t quite cut it.  While it made my skin feel smooth initially, after an hour or so it started to feel rather dry and tight.  If I didn&#x27;t reapply the lotion frequently, I would have been quite uncomfortable by the end of the day.  So I took to layering the BB Cream over another body lotion, and this worked well enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 - Does it brighten and illuminate?  Yes, yes it does.  The illuminating factor is subtle - there aren&#x27;t obvious chunks of mica or glitter, but the lotion does create a very subtle, dewy surface on the skin.  This does make the skin look smoother and healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 - Does it even skin tone?  I didn&#x27;t find the cream to be particularly effective in this area.  There are a few tiny patches of skin on my arms that are slightly darker than the rest, and after applying the cream they were still visible.  They may have been less obvious than before, but I couldn&#x27;t see a difference myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 - I saw no difference in skin firmness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 - The slight sheen does make skin imperfections, like the darker patches mentioned in #3, less noticeable by distracting the eye.  From a distance, the skin looks more even, so I guess that it&#x27;s working!  If you have moles or freckles, I don&#x27;t think it can cover those up - at least, it didn&#x27;t make a lick of difference for the small spots on my arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is strong initially, but it fades eventually.  Still, throughout the day there was a slight odor that I associate with self-tanning creams - I don&#x27;t know what the ingredient is but it reminds me of a blend of coconut and cardboard.  Again, it&#x27;s very faint, and I doubt anyone but the user would notice it, but I found it vaguely distracting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this product does have its merits.  Its strength definitely lies in illuminating and brightening the skin - my skin did look better, but the results were nearly as dramatic as I&#x27;d hoped.  It does take a minute or two to dry after application, and since I used another moisturizer first this drying time was even longer.  But if your schedule allows for the extra time, and you&#x27;re a fan of BB Creams for the face, it&#x27;s worth checking this out to see if it will work for your skin.ow what the ingredient is but it reminds me of a blend of coconut and cardboard.

            <li> Jergens BB Body Cream for lighter skin tones promises &amp;#34;visible&amp;#34; results within 5 days in these areas:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Hydrates and smoothes&lt;br /&gt;2. Brightens and illuminates&lt;br /&gt;3. Evens skin tone&lt;br /&gt;4. Visibly firms skin&lt;br /&gt;5. Minimizes the appearance of imperfections&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions: For best results, use daily as your body lotion. Massage this sheer formula over body, allowing time to dry prior to dressing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;WATER, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII (SHEA BUTTER), GLYCERIN, PETROLATUM, DIMETHICONE, ETHYLHEXYL ISONONANOATE, TAPIOCA STARCH, CETEARETH-20, STEARETH-2, STEARIC ACID, CETYL ESTERS, MINERAL OIL, OCTYLDODECYL MYRISTATE, HYDROGENATED POLYDECENE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, DIHYDROXYACETONE, HYDROXYETHYL ACRYLATE/SODIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYL TAURATE COPOLYMER, ISOHEXADECANE, FRAGRANCE, MANGIFERA INDICA (MANGO) SEED BUTTER, METHYLPARABEN, THEOBROMA CACAO (COCOA) SEED BUTTER, DIMETHICONOL, PROPYLPARABEN, ERYTHRULOSE, PHENOXYETHANOL, POLYSORBATE 60, CITRIC ACID, ALOE BARBADENSIS LEAF JUICE POWDER, ETHYLPARABEN, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, COCOS NUCIFERA (COCONUT) WATER, HYDROLYZED COLLAGEN, PANTHENOL, WITHANIA SOMNIFERA ROOT EXTRACT, CENTELLA ASIATICA EXTRACT, HYDROLYZED ELASTIN, FUCUS VESICULOSUS EXTRACT, YELLOW 5, ORANGE 4, RED 33, BLUE 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience is that the Jergens BB Body Cream hydrates well. The scent is over-powering. Also my sensitive skin did not react well to some of the ingredients. Which ones, I&#x27;m not certain. There are so many possibilities. Too many, for me to make this my duly &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; body lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, it is an over-priced moisturizer. I was not anticipating a miraculous transformation but do expect a product to, at least in part, live up to it&#x27;s claims.</li>
            <li> This so called BB cream is just another fake tanning lotion. Smells just like all of Jergens self tanners. But it&#x27;s really thick and makes my skin feel great. I&#x27;m usually battling a really intense dry skin rash on my legs, and I haven&#x27;t been bothered by the condition since using it. My spider veins are less noticeable, my razor bumps are taken care off and my scars are less noticeable. Because it has self tanner ingredients, and I didn&#x27;t know until I noticed my legs and tummy getting dark, thus so my knees are orange. Which sucks! But yeah, really nice, light moisturizing self tanner. Nothing new, special, different. But a great product. Just wish they mentioned it was a mild self tanner. My knees look funny. :(</li>
            <li> I like this BB Body Cream very much. It is a nice thick lotion that goes on smoothly and absorbs very quickly. You don&#x27;t need a whole lot at once, a little goes a long way with this cream. It has a light floral scent which surprised me but is not at all overwhelming. I did notice my skin seemed to be a little bit brighter and had almost a &amp;#34;finished&amp;#34; look (the way my face looks after I have applied foundation) after 5 or 6 days of use. However I don&#x27;t think the cost of this lotion is worth that so it&#x27;s not something I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> i have acne scars on my shoulders that were hard to cover up. After trying this for about a week and a half they started to be less noticeable. My skin also looks radiant :)</li>
            <li> 1. Hydrates and smoothes: YES. It&#x27;s my new favorite moisturizer for my legs.&lt;br /&gt;2. Brightens and illuminates: Somewhat; it works best if you exfoliate first (I always use it after exfoliating in the shower, so not a problem).&lt;br /&gt;3. Evens skin tone: this was what really sold it for me. I really wanted something that would fix all the red blotches on my legs. This did it without being a self tanner, which I like. The color is very sheer&lt;br /&gt;4. Visibly firms skin: Bull. I don&#x27;t think any drugstore-priced moisturizer really can, though.&lt;br /&gt;5. Minimizes appearance of imperfections: Well, it took care of the aforementioned red blotches. And it mostly got rid of the small bumps on my thighs. Not as much as I&#x27;d liked, but it did what any REALLY GREAT MOISTURIZER would do.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s basically just a moisturizer with a tiny bit of color. My new favorite moisturizer, though. You don&#x27;t have to worry about matching your skin tone, as it&#x27;s very sheer color anyway. Didn&#x27;t last very long, but it&#x27;s fairly inexpensive for the quality, so it works out.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for am ample sized container of moisturizer with a slight fragrance, than this product is for you.  If you are seeking something that will address imperfections, I cannot really recommend this product.  I did not notice any significant improvements to appearance in skin tone after use,  The bottle is large and provides a good number of uses.  I applied the product primarily after showers and it ;lasted about a month.</li>
            <li> SO, this product doesn&#x27;t advertise what it really is. It&#x27;s a light tanner. It smells like a tanner but not as strong. It does moisturize well. Has a shine, has some shimmer. But leaves greasy spots. It also leaves a tan color that can be wiped off. I&#x27;ll use it up but won&#x27;t buy again. It gives color correcting but as a makeup in the way it can be wiped off. So it&#x27;s temporary until it&#x27;s washed off.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Visible results in five days!\\&quot;  \\&quot;Hydrates - Illuminates - Evens - Firms - Corrects\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Uh-uh.  When I chose this product, I didn&#x27;t realize that it was supposed to have a little bit of self-tanning capability, but it does have a tint to it.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t have chosen it if I had known that, because self-tanners for me have not worked well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It never calls itself a tanner, but I&#x27;m thinking that is what the \\&quot;evens\\&quot; and \\&quot;corrects\\&quot; claims are about.  Fortunately, it didn&#x27;t give me a splotchy look that some self-tanners do.  Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t do much of anything else either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for several days and couldn&#x27;t see a difference in my skin other than normal hydrating that any decent lotion or cream will do.  So I tried a little experiment, using this stuff where the sun don&#x27;t shine.  Well, at least not on my body.  One half with the cream, one half without.  After about two weeks, I still could not see a difference in the two patches of skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this did what it seems to think it can do, it would be worth the price, but as a mediocre moisturizing cream, it certainly does not.  I would not get it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a person who likes natural ingredients in my lotion â€“Â I like seeing things like shea butter in the ingredients list. After getting a sample of Jergens BB Body Cream in my monthly Birchbox, I was surprised by how much I liked it, and, even better, the 2nd ingredient was shea butter! (Which surprised me to say the least. Jergens is not a brand I would associate with using natural ingredients). Anyway, I liked it so much I bought a full-sized bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it a night or two, though (lotioning after I got out of the shower), both my arms broke out in a prickly rash. I got a rash on my neck, too. I threw out the bottle but was disappointed and upset that it made me break out in a rash. Sorry, Jergens BB Cream, I wanted to like you. But I won&#x27;t be buying this product again â€“ nor would I recommend it to anyone. Back to natural lotions from Whole Foods for me.</li>
            <li> As the first BB cream I tried for my body, I liked it!  I hadn&#x27;t used jergens products in a long time, and I was definitely skeptical.  But after a while of use, I did notice a change in my skin ton!  It has a nice fragrance, and goes on smooth.  It also helps to brighten the skin, which can sometimes look dull, especially after the long winter we&#x27;ve had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing though, is that it goes pretty fast.  It&#x27;s not a very big tube for body lotion, and it&#x27;s expensive, so if it becomes a regular product to use, it&#x27;ll be relatively costly.  For that reason alone, I&#x27;ll probably look for other alternatives before I come back to this product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference whatsoever in my skin tone, with firming, or with imperfections.  I was excited to purchase when I saw the ads. What a letdown.  It does hydrate, so I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars for that, but so do most moisturizers.  This is just too expensive for me to continue buying when it doesn&#x27;t even do what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> I love this I looked here to see if I could get a deal and I found the opposite. Same size 7.5 ounces is only $12.99 at Walgreens. Go there and get it don&#x27;t buy it for $20 here. What a rip off this should be illegal.</li>
            <li> This stuff WORKS. I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 days and my age spots are FADING! and my skin just looks better. Smoother, younger, and pretty. It brought some glow back. Imperfections aren&#x27;t invisible, but they are blurred. Nicer. Just impressed.</li>
            <li> Its been 3 weeks Im using it and I havent realized any difference. I dont know.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a couple of weeks now. I have noticed a more even tone on my legs and increased moisture and softness everywhere I&#x27;ve used it. Like other reviewers have said, this is not a tanning cream, but a tinted moisturizer that minimizes the appearance of subtle imperfections/splotches on your skin. It will not even out a farmer&#x27;s tan. I&#x27;m fine with the price, it&#x27;s a bit more than the Eucerin Cream I was using, but it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy/sticky like that one does. The only problem I have is with the scent. I&#x27;m not a big scent person and this has a a very obvious scent. My husband refers to the scent as &amp;#34;stripper lotion scent.&amp;#34; Because I&#x27;m happy with the results of the product, I&#x27;ll continue to use it, I just wish it came in an unscented or more natural scented variety.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive  and I don&#x27;t react to this</li>
            <li> love it.  thank you.  it makes my skin look wonderful and healthy.  i will be buying more to keep up my skin being moisturized.</li>
            <li> I love this product!I can understand why others might review this badly because if u do not have very pale,sun damaged,dry skin or other problems you probably won&#x27;t get it.I think this does all that it says and more.It also adds a shine to my legs that others have had but I never did.Within 20 mins of putting it on I knew it was working and my legs looked better.After 5 days I was able to go to a wedding with no pantyhose and be happy with my legs,which is why I got it in the first place.Not a huge change but did blend and make a difference.The smell is NOT too strong,it&#x27;s a light nice smell.Gonna get more..could stand to be a bigger tube.</li>
            <li> i have very fair skin and this adds just enough color to my legs,  I am enjoying this one. no orange color...yea.</li>
            <li> Nothing special. Better than generic lotions.  Has a bit of an almost shimmer to it.  I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> Previously, the only option for showing skin was a powder that is usually sparkly, or a heavy full coverage body make-up.&lt;br /&gt;This product is fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;It does not cover imperfections totally, but doesn&#x27;t look all made up and fake either.&lt;br /&gt;You put it on like a lotion, but with a lighter touch. It blends with all the skin tones in a light to medium range to give a brighter, healthy look to skin.&lt;br /&gt;Reasonably priced...thank goodness because I&#x27;ll be using it by the bucketfull!</li>
            <li> My mom used jergens. I can remember her giving me little squeezes of it to rub on. Well, I&#x27;m older and jergens has come a long way. The BB cream for lighter skin tones is great for me, I am in the ivory spectrum of makeup. The BB cream goes on smoothly and quickly evens out my skin tone, makes me glowy but not greasy or weirdly shiny. For me it absorbed quickly but I do have very dry skin and pretty much everything absorbs quickly. I like the scent and the feel and look of my skin after using the BB cream.</li>
            <li> I generally do like Jergens products, but I really love this BB Body Cream.  It smells very good, and really made my skin feel soft and smooth.  I have seen a slight difference in skin tone, just an overall evening in tone, which is why I only rate it 4 stars.  The skin tone, and other anti-aging effects are hard to see until a product has been used for a while, for me at least a month or more, and I&#x27;ve only used this for about 3 weeks now.  However, I love the way this cream makes my skin feel and smell.  I would definitely recommend it to all and will continue to use this product myself!</li>
            <li> I just bought this product this evening at my local Target.  They have 2 oz trial sizes for $3, and the full size product is only $11.39 there as well.  Since I&#x27;ve only applied it once, I can&#x27;t say too much yet other than I like the fragrance.  I just wanted to share that you can get this MUCH cheaper at Target.</li>
            <li> So disapointed !  I  believed the ad claims and purchased the BB body cream.&lt;br /&gt;Nowhere did it tell me that it was just another &amp;#34;fake tanning&amp;#34; cream.&lt;br /&gt;It has Not &amp;#34;enhanced&amp;#34; my skin  tone, only made it orangish and highlighted my rough patches.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance that is mentioned in the other reviews ? to me it was the smell of self tanner.&lt;br /&gt;Would hope for more truth in advertising from one of the oldest skin lotion brands.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face and love it.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin look great but not happy about the price.  Will continue buying though cause nothing else makes my legs this smooth.</li>
            <li> This is not a tanning lotion, it is a BB cream. I am extremely light skinned, so imperfections are very noticable on me. I also burn very easily. So I use sunscreen to avoid burning, which leaves me pale. In the summer I hate showing my legs because of the noticeable veins, bruises, etc. I&#x27;ve tried tanning lotions, but they aren&#x27;t for me since you have to apply it consistently to your whole body to make sure that you remain the same color all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream has a light tint to it, smells pleasant, and is hydrating. It&#x27;s winter turning to spring where I am and temperatures had been in the twenties. Because of this I&#x27;m not showing my bare legs.  I was able to test the product on one leg as a comparision test to just the regular Nivea lotion I had been using.  After the five day period, I asked my husband to guess which leg I had been using the product on. He guessed wrong. That doesn&#x27;t mean that I don&#x27;t think this product works, because in my opinion it does. My skin remained just as hydrated as the leg that I used just lotion on. I don&#x27;t know if I consider my skin any firmer, but I do think it lessened some of my imperfections. Which is most likely due to the slight tint in the cream. I wouldn&#x27;t say that they were concealed. For that I would probably need to use a tanning lotion. But again, this is a BB cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The negative is the price of this cream in comparision to a lotion. Obviously since it&#x27;s a BB cream it is going to cost more than a traditional lotion. But based on the 7 oz. size, if you used this product everyday all over yout body: legs, arms, chest you are going to go through it quickly. I plan on continuing to use this product just on my legs, since that is the body part that bothers me most. I don&#x27;t feel there is an obvious difference in the coloring of my legs versus the rest of my body since the coloring is more of a highlighting than darkening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product as long as you remember you are using thisas a BB cream, not a tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> I received two samples of this cream one for light skin tones and one for dark skin tones.  I am reviewing both at the same time because although I applied one to each arm there was literally no difference in color.  For that reason I have subtracted a star.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I love this cream and will purchase this in the future.  It has a light fragrance and applies easily.  The price is reasonable for a tube this size, and I would recommend this to friends and family.</li>
            <li> I used this for 2-3 weeks. It had a nice subtle scent and felt great on the skin. I didn&#x27;t notice much difference in my actual skin&#x27;s appearance, but maybe I didn&#x27;t give it enough time. I would definitely recommend it though.</li>
            <li> Smells bad.  &amp;#34;Fresh scent&amp;#34; smells like it is trying to cover some other ingredient up.  This is consistent amongst other Jergens lotion products, like the self tanner.</li>
            <li> Pretty good - been using a smaller tube yet more expensive BB cream for months. The Jergens BB cream is 7.5 ounce, very economical and works almost as good if not better. If you use it only for the face it will lasts a long time (yet it is labeled to be used for your whole body as well). It feels silky smooth and dries up fast once you apply it. Works good as moisturizer and I sense no feeling of dry skin when wearing it . The slight tint helps to hide some of the skin imperfections and gives you a glowing complexion.</li>
            <li> An excellent product; through a friends help and suggestion I started using; The dark spots are beginning to fade; I am pleased I listened to my friend and her suggestion. Thank you Mayra. I hope everyone gets the same results as I have.</li>
            <li> you can not go wrong with jergens , this type is good and works well. i just used it for 3 days now and can see the difference</li>
            <li> i got a travel sized amount to try in the mail and used it up within about 4 days. it does leave skin feeling supple but not greasy, but it has that self tanner smell to it. it didn&#x27;t smell too bad until an hour or so after applying it. oddly enough, i never did see a change in color to my skin and i wouldn&#x27;t say it looks more perfected as a facial bb creme would do. i wouldn&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> Jergens BB Body Cream states that there are five visible results in five days.  I have been using the cream for a little more than five days now.  Those five results are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Hydrates and smoothes&lt;br /&gt;2) Brightens and Illuminates&lt;br /&gt;3) Evens skin tone&lt;br /&gt;4) Visibly firms skin&lt;br /&gt;5) Minimizes the appearance of imperfections&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it achieve these results?  I would say yes for 1, which is what any lotion does.  For number 2, I would say my skin looks more illuminated after I apply it because there&#x27;s a slight pearlescence to the lotion.  That effect doesn&#x27;t last.  As for evening the skin tone (3), yes my skin looks a little more even after I apply it because the lotion is slightly tinted, but that also fades.  I haven&#x27;t noticed 4 at all.  5 falls under the same category as 2 and 3, but a little less.  (For instance, my scar tissue I&#x27;ve been rubbing the lotion over is still perfectly visible.)  I like this product, but the claims are fairly ridiculous.  It&#x27;s tinted lotion, not a miracle in a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the texture, I&#x27;ve been describing it as lotion rather than cream because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s thick enough to really be a true cream.  Also, it is not mentioned on the bottle, but there is a strong scent.  It smells kind of like Moroccan Argan Oil to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color of this cream blended in very well with my skin, and I am incredibly pale.  So I don&#x27;t think anyone has to worry about turning orange.  Do wait a minute before dressing to let the lotion sink in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this product is hydrating and looks nice when applied.  I wish it were a little less expensive and that the claims were less exaggerated, but I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of BB Cream for my face, so I was excited to try this BB Body Cream. I was particularly wanting this for my legs and my chest. My legs are PALE...like super pale. They also have a lot of scars from surgery, so I can&#x27;t use most self tanning products. I love wearing dresses but often feel self conscious about my &amp;#34;bright&amp;#34; pale legs. I also wanted to try this on my chest because I have a lot of freckles and I have uneven skin color there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Jergens BB Body Cream is supposed to Hydrate and Smooth, Brightens and Illuminates, Even skin tone, Visibly firm skin and minimize the appearance of imperfections. It works like a charm! My legs not only feel incredibly soft and silky with this cream, but they look fantastic. They get a slight sheen to them and appear less pale than normal and more sleek. I&#x27;m not sure how much it actually firms the skin, but it does make my legs feel great and sexy. I like it a little less on my chest. It doesn&#x27;t make my skin even out as much as I would like, but I guess there isn&#x27;t much you can do about freckles. After using it twice on my chest I decided to save it for my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish that this body cream was cheaper. I have to use quite a bit of it to do my legs and it is not going to last long. As a result, I have been saving it for nights that I dress up (which is at least once every week or two). While I love the cream, I don&#x27;t think I could bring myself to pay the current price of $24.95.</li>
            <li> lovely lotion! definitely one of the lotions i&#x27;ve truly liked. great subtle smell and very lightweight but also moisturizes pretty darn well. will be picking up the full size asap!</li>
            <li> Great for older skin. It makes me feel &amp;#34;silky&amp;#34; all day. When I get in the shower at the end of the day, it&#x27;s still there. All of this without feeling greasy. Love it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it works or if it&#x27;s all in my head, but my skin all over really does seem to look better!  This was an Allure breakthrough and that&#x27;s why I purchased it. My skin just looks.....better. I do wish it had a better scent or no scent at all.</li>
            <li> Works pretty darn well. Much more than I expected. Jergens has never disappointed me with their products.</li>
            <li> I love the way this looks and feels, but the smell is SO strong so be warned.</li>
            <li> I bought a travel size at a garage sale and have used the last of it this morning.  Am using it on my arms and legs mostly.  The best part of this is that I&#x27;m not ORANGE!  Yahoo!!!  Am using the lighter one, but may try the darker one or even mix the two for an in-between shade.  So far I do like this product and I don&#x27;t find the fragrance to be too strong.  All in all, nice product.  The price could be a little lower though, thus the four stars and not five.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my order. Well worth it.</li>
            <li> I used this BB Cream for two weeks and while it does a great job moisturizing, I did not find it to lighten and even out my skin tones as it was supposed to. I did like the pleasant scent this lotion has. I am not sure I would buy this product as I think there are many good moisturizers out there for less money.</li>
            <li> This has been my daily go to product before going out. From what I&#x27;ve noticed, tt doesn&#x27;t necessarily hydrates your skin, but it does hide out some imperfections in your skin by evening out the skin tones.I usually finish off with an Aloe Vera cream to give my skin some moisture. Give it a try</li>
            <li> The scent was overwhelming :(</li>
            <li> I got this product after reading about it in several beauty magazines. I was worried that it might irritate my sensitive skin or stain my clothes, but it does neither! I love this product and now have a subscription to get a new tube every few months. The look is very natural, not too orange whatsoever.</li>
            <li> arroved before time expected</li>
            <li> This is my favorite body lotion! It has a slight tint to make skin more radiant and smells delicious. I am unsure of it&#x27;s firming capabilities, as this is not really an issue for me.</li>
            <li> The product itself works well, but the side of the plastic on the bottle I received was coming apart, which was disappointing.</li>
            <li> I hate the smell of the tanner</li>
            <li> I love this cream and been using this a year and result is good. I am using this to my face even  it smoothens the skin.</li>
            <li> The lotion really doesn&#x27;t do what it says it will do.  I put it on.  Usually after a week you start to see results.  I didn&#x27;t notice any.  I will keep using my amlactin.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. My skin tends to be light in the winter and dark in the summer, but this cream gives my skin an overall healthy look foor the winter. It feels silky on my skin and I love the size of the bottle. I&#x27;ll buy this again!</li>
            <li> I am a diabetic with ultra dry skin.  I also have white chicken legs during the entire summer.  Add to this beautiful combination I am cheap.  I had hoped this Jergens product would eliminate my need for the much more expensive body moisturizer.  Unfortunately it will not but I will be able to decrease my dependence by one more expensive product in the summer and use this BB cream instead.  Since this is the depth of winter in the Midwest I don&#x27;t think this was the right time of year let alone my special skin needs.  Will be looking forward to using it again this summer.  Nice light  fragrance.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter for prom. She is very sensitive about the scars on her arms and usually wears a light sweatshirt to hide them. She wanted to bare her arms for prom but was very nervous. I spotted this on sale at a local store. It had a &amp;#34;try me&amp;#34; sample and I was pretty impressed. She used it every day the week and a half before prom and her arms looked great! The scars weren&#x27;t noticeable and the slight lift in color was very flattering. I might buy some for myself. I&#x27;m very sensitive to perfumes though and this is pretty perfumey so it may not work for me. But a self-confident teen is a very good thing!</li>
            <li> My preferred product.</li>
            <li> To test the claim \\&quot;five visible results in five days\\&quot; I used the cream on one arm and my usual body lotion on the other. After five days I saw absolutely no improvement in any of the areas touted to be positively affected, and the scent, normally not something I am particularly sensitive to, was so unpleasant and overpowering I decided to not finish the tube. The cream smelled so flowery and old-fashioned it was like a relic from the past and unfortunately it lingered for what seemed like forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance preference is subjective, so the most important consideration is whether the cream worked -- on me it did not. On the plus side, the product is quickly absorbed in the skin and not at all oily, in fact it is powdery, but it did not deliver any better results than my usual lotion. And, the tint pigment is so diluted there is not enough there to affect a change in appearance on the skin. Both my arms looked the same throughout the test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to like the product but my five day side-by-side comparison was a fail, and the strong fragrance made the five days seem endless.</li>
            <li> My skin is not particularly sensitive, but I developed a rash between and above my eyebrows on the third day I used this product. My daughter, who does have rather sensitive skin, broke out in a large rash on her arm on the fourth day she used it. Needless to say, we both had to toss this expensive product in the trash.</li>
            <li> I recently started using moisturizer more heavily as my swimming regime leads to drier skin than I would like. After giving this one a try, I&#x27;ve found it works quite well. My skin looks better having used this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I&#x27;d point out is that it has a more potent smell than most other moisturizers. That might not be considered a negative to many, but it is quite strong. For people who use deodorant or anything else that also gives off a smell, this may be something to watch out for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy this product and I recommend it. Those looking to try a new moisturizer should give it a try.</li>
            <li> This is a worthwhile product, especially during the summer or if you live in a warm climate. This is a body cream that moisturizes, smoothes the texture and evens out the color of the skin, imparting a soft, barely there, pearlescent glow. In other words, it is great on one&#x27;s arms and legs but not for dry, rough heels or winter-ravaged cuticles. This is not a heavy duty moisturizer for damaged skin, it is a hydrating skin enhancer for skin that is in basically good condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An important point to mention is that it does not contain sun screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is basically a tinted moisturizer for the body. It comes in two versions: one for light skin tones and the other for dark skin tones. It contains a sheer tint that evens out minor imperfections and leave the skin a bit luminous. I tried the light version and I found this effect quite attractive, perfectly fine for the day time, not at all disco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream comes out of the tube quite thick but smoothes quickly and easily on the skin. The fragrance is soft, floral, and powdery and once applied to the skin, of short duration. Since there is a tint, it is important to smooth the product over the entire area rather than just apply it to dry spots. The cream dries quickly and the tint did not rub off on my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should add that I have been using the product during a very cold and snowy February; I have no idea how it will react during a steamy, tropical summer day.</li>
            <li> First, this product is only $11.99 at target and I am glad I found it for less elsewhere. I got this as a sample in Birchbox. I decided to use it only on the body part I wanted to improve the tone, texture, etc on. So I tried it on my butt and legs, after the third day, I have to say I absolutely noticed a difference. My skin felt and appeared more firm. The color and tone was more even. It got rid of the little chicken bumps I had, ingrown hairs etc. I am in my 20s, athletic etc. My skin is light with slightly olive undertones. This product gave me a nice little boost. Enough to go out and buy the full size! It does have a fragrance, but compared to other overly perfume-y products I have tested in the past, it&#x27;s really not that bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple weeks, and so far- I love it. I only gave it four stars because the fragrance isn&#x27;t that great, but that&#x27;s my only complaint and it isn&#x27;t even really a complaint. I don&#x27;t mind the smell at all... After I am finished with this tube, I will be buying another! It makes my skin feel great and moisturizes much longer than the cream I had been using prior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very rich, long lasting cream. I&#x27;m very surprised at how long it hydrated and made my skin feel smooth. I have super dry skin. The advertising also claims that it does the following:&lt;br /&gt;-Illuminates, firms, brightens, hydrates and smooths skin&lt;br /&gt;-Helps to reduce the appearance of imperfections&lt;br /&gt;-Absorbs quickly and won&#x27;t rub off on clothes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really did all of the above.... shocking, I know. I noticed a difference immediately. Pretty excited about using this over the summer when I start wearing shorts and dresses. The way it evens your skin tone and minor imperfections will look wonderful, great product in that aspect as well :) Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Makes skin look smoother and younger.  Adds a little tint without the nasty fragrance from self-tanners.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This BB Cream claims that you will see results after just 5 days.  In five days the cream will 1) Hydrate and Smooth, 2) Brighten &amp; Illuminate, 3) Even Skin Tone, 4) Visibly Firm Skin, 5) Minimize appearance of imperfections.  That is a lot to expect from a tube of cream, so I decided to perform a side-by-side comparison.  I used the cream on my left arm, and used nothing on my right.  I applied twice a day: once in the morning and once at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And sadly after 5 days I saw no difference between the arms.  No even skin tone or firmer skin.  No reduction in imperfections.  Even after 10 days I saw no difference.  For the premium price I would expect premium results, and Iâ€™m just not seeing them with this BB Cream.  But on the plus side the cream did feel wonderful when applied.  It was thick and creamy, and disappeared into my skin without leaving any residue or greasiness.  So as a moisturizer it is great, but donâ€™t expect too much in the Blemish/Beauty Balm department.</li>
            <li> I really gave this stuff a full try.  I used it as directed every day for a week and I gotta say, I&#x27;m not impressed.  I didn&#x27;t notice anything at all with the first application, and nothing dramatic after 5 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a very light sweet perfume scent, nothing strong, so on the plus side, it probably would not compete with perfume.  The real downside, however, was that it was not as moisturizing or smoothing as my current body lotion (&amp;#34;Amazing Grace&amp;#34; by Philosophy - makes my skin really smooth and moisturized all day long, and since I don&#x27;t wear perfume, I love the smell).</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, using it everyday gives you a nice natural glow. Just be sure to wash between your fingers after applying.</li>
            <li> This product is a tinted body moisturizer.  I particularly like it for my legs, which are pale and a bit unevenly-colored.  The BB Body Cream does improve the look of my skin a touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it feels like wearing make-up on my legs, it feels like there is a &amp;#34;coating&amp;#34;.  I have to be careful not to brush up against anything, because the color may rub off.  (The instructions call for waiting a few minutes before dressing, but I found that color would rub off all day.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use this for special evenings when I want to look my best.  But for me, it won&#x27;t be a daily-use product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the purpose of putting color in a body cream would be. The pigment is enough to show up on the cream,  but not enough to show on your skin. And frankly, any pigment strong enough to show up on your skin and/or even out your skin tone would probably just stain your clothes anyway. Having said that, this cream does an okay job of moisturizing and has a pleasant fragrance. Nothing special enough for me to keep using it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this stuff moisturizes well because I cant get past the awful smell! It smells like some old woman&#x27;s funky perfume! I wish they could make this stuff fragrance free or make the fragrance more sporty....Although I didn&#x27;t purchase this (was sent a sample by mail), I certainly wouldn&#x27;t recommend or buy it!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a product that would somehow even my skin tone on my back. Since I have pretty significant acne on my back, it left me with dark spots all over. During summer months, I feel extraordinarily insecure because I find it difficult to wear certain types of clothes. For the past few weeks, I have been using the Jergens BB Body Cream and have noticed great improvements on my back skin! My back feels smoother, softer, and looks more even toned. It even calms down some new acne that is growing on my back. My mom even told me my back is looking much better! I am just thrilled to have found this product and will continue to use it! I would suggest to anyone who suffers from &amp;#34;backne&amp;#34; to give this product a try. It worked wonders for me! I am looking forward to summer this year!</li>
            <li> This lotion really won&#x27;t help cover any imperfections, it rubs on clear. But even after 1 or 2 uses my skin has smoothed quite a bit. The smell is alright, maybe a tiny bit grandma-ish and after a while it slightly smells like tanning products....so eh....but after almost a week of use my skin is in way better condition!! So if you want a sure fire product to turn to to smooth out dry bumpy skin this will help. But I&#x27;m sure there are other good lotions too.</li>
            <li> I chose to rate this four stars because it smells amazing, is very moisturizing, easy to apply, is not greasy. and gives a pretty and light glow. But there is one downside, it doesn&#x27;t minimize the appearance of imperfections, but that is ok.</li>
            <li> Not enough coverage.  I think a fake tanner or Bath and Body Works body glow does a better job of minimizing imperfections on my legs.  Very disappointed.  I will use this to finish it up, but definitely will not buy again.</li>
            <li> This cream has a nice fragrance, and though I can&#x27;t say it does all the things it claims to, it does leave my skin moisturized and with a nice, subtle sheen. The other thing I like is that I never notice any color residue or streaks.  There is a bit on my hands, but I wash them right away. I rarely wait to get dressed, as the product recommends, but have never had any staining. I feel like this is a nice final touch to even out my skin tone in the summer months when I already have a little tan.</li>
            <li> I got this in my birchbox.&lt;br /&gt;This is a good option for when you throw on a dress and realize that your legs are white as hell.&lt;br /&gt;It smells good.&lt;br /&gt;Creates a sheer and natural finish.&lt;br /&gt;No messing with gross smelling gradual tanner!</li>
            <li> Smells much nicer than self tanners but does eventually start to smell less pleasant.</li>
            <li> I adore this product! I used to try to use self-tanners to achieve a healthy glow, but they just left me orange and streaky, no matter what I did. This is amazing, it&#x27;s not a tanner, but leaves your skin with a nice slightly-sunkissed glow, applies easily, and does not rub off on clothing. Wait 5 minutes for it to dry before dressing and you&#x27;re good to go! It hides a lot of imperfections in my skin and I won&#x27;t ever be without this. PLEASE Jergens, never stop making this~!</li>
            <li> This lotion is great! I think it is worth the money...it really smooths out your legs and leaves them feeling very soft...I have been using it for a few months and i&#x27;m going to continue using it...not watery at all ...its rich and creamy.</li>
            <li> I am a blond and find most tinted moisturizers don&#x27;t look very good on light skin tones... This one does... especially to even out decollete area.</li>
