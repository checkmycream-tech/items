            <li>FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>This is the BEST cleaner for Sigma&#x27;s Flat Angled Kabuki Brushes, any brush and the Beauty Blender.</li>
            <li>I just wish this was more readily available in the states.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and doesn&#x27;t leave a film on my brushes or sponges/puffs.</li>
            <li>Love this product, will never stop using it and would recommend to anyone who wants their makeup brushes very clean!</li>
            <li>Amazing results with first wash.</li>
            <li>I tried so many things to clean my beauty blender and never had much success.  </li>
            <li>but it was worth the wait!</li>
            <li>i use it to clean my makeup brushes and beauty blender.</li>
            <li>U have a clean brush.</li>
            <li>I got a $15 dense Sonia Kashuk flat-top brush that had years-old residue and foundation completely clean with this.</li>
            <li>Clean.</li>
            <li>the bottle wasn&#x27;t even full</li>
            <li>Oh and the bottle wasn&#x27;t full</li>
            <li>and I tried many different types of cleansers, but nothing would fully clean it and it would take 10 minutes or more to clean.  </li>
            <li>Cleans my Beauty Blenders quickly.</li>
            <li>I think I still get my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t feel that was right.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing to clean makeup brushes and even cleaned my most difficult brushes to clean, but DO NOT buy it from here.</li>
            <li>I like it very much and was able to find these two times in my local Daiso.</li>
            <li>Far better than high end cleansers I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>i love this, 2nd bottle already.</li>
            <li>This cleans soooo much makeup off my brushes!</li>
            <li>I can only find it here and one more place online.  </li>
            <li>I love this and will forever be purchasing it for my future brush care.</li>
            <li>I pour a small amount of this into my palm and swirl my brushes through it, then rinse with warm water and swirl them on my palm through water to ensure they&#x27;re clean.</li>
            <li>I used half water/half detergent, swirled my brush in it for able 30 seconds and my brush is PERFECTLY clean again.</li>
            <li>Put a small amount in a cup of hot water, swish brush around and it&#x27;s good as new!</li>
            <li>Worked well on eyeliner brushes, smudge brushes, large powder brushes, dense foundation brushes, blush and eyeshadow brushes.</li>
            <li>Honesty, these might as well worth $6 bucks, or even more, but faking the original price to be ten times more to attract potential buyers is just plain shameful.</li>
            <li>Melted all the gunk off my F80 really well.</li>
            <li>It acts fast and cleans my brushes thoroughly.</li>
            <li>It is very concentrated so all you need is just a drop and swirl your makeup brush in the soap and rinse and voila..</li>
            <li>It works SO WELL for brushes that are very dense.</li>
            <li>Worked really well.</li>
            <li>, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>So much cheaper that the beauty blender soap.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This works fast</li>
            <li>It would be better if you made the bottle clear so we could see how much we have left!</li>
            <li>I have several smudge brushes that I could never get entirely clean, even after soaking in shampoo or brush cleaner.  </li>
            <li>Not good for brushes because it is way too drying &amp; if you have good quality brushes you really want to take care of them.  </li>
            <li>They look brand new after I wash them with this cleaner!</li>
            <li>but ehh I can live with that!</li>
            <li>My new holy grail brush cleaner!</li>
            <li>Daiso sold these for $1.50 plus tax a bottle, if you are lucky enough to find them in the store.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Really gets all the makeup out of brushes, even the old buildup you didn&#x27;t know you had.  </li>
            <li>If they are available ALL the time I wouldn&#x27;t even go for other brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received the bottle and it was sealed and brand new.</li>
            <li>but I have a practically new brush now.</li>
            <li>The problem is, it was half full!</li>
            <li>Overall, I gave it 2 stars because I loved the product, but I only received half a bottle of it.</li>
            <li>Heard that it was one of the hot sale items in Asian Daiso.</li>
            <li>my bottle came half filled.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t leak or spill in the box, it was just filled up half way.</li>
            <li>but it won&#x27;t take out old makeup stains.</li>
            <li>IN JAPAN,THE PRICE OF THIS ITEM IS NOT SO EXPENSIVE, BUT THE ITEM IS SO GOOD</li>
            <li>The bottle came half full.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this relatively inexpensive product.</li>
            <li>Ô∏èORL advise the buyer the bottle is only half filled.</li>
            <li>But like others said, the bottle came with only half full.</li>
            <li>I poured a tiny amount of Daiso into my palm, wished around the brushes in it for a few seconds, and was rewarded by squeaky clean brushes.  </li>
            <li>Try a different site or directly from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>I had a flat top brush that was impossible to clean all the foundation off of it not</li>

            <li> Some people complains that the bottle comes half empty, but the soap is very concentrated.</li>
            <li> but I think its easy to waste this product on small sponges!</li>
            <li> No clue what&#x27;s in it, but my flat kabuki has never been cleaner!</li>
            <li> It completely cleans heavy foundation make-up off my brush in no time at all.</li>
            <li> Anyone who uses a makeup sponge like the beautyblender knows just how difficult is it to get it clean.  </li>
            <li> With this cleanser, I just rub a quarter-sized amount into the dirty part of the sponge (when its dry) for about 30 seconds and rinse, and voila, the beautyblender is completely clean!  </li>
            <li> You just rub this stuff on a dry sponge (or brush), rinse, and BAM!</li>
            <li> My only issue is that the bottle was not full when I received it.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, as well.</li>
            <li> They usually take all night long to dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, due to dishonesty I would give zero star for the LISTING here in Amazon -- on the List Price</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> It also cleans my Beauty Blender sponge in seconds, returning it to its very pink color.  </li>
            <li> Plus, my brushes were dry within just a few hours.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m knocking a star off though because it did leave my brushes feeling a little rough.</li>
            <li> Where is the other half????</li>
            <li> Got months of ground in foundation out of a tight Sigma F80 kibuki brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s opened and just half bottle!&lt;br /&gt;BE WARE!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d advise using sparingly as it is a harsh detergent and conditioning afterwards!</li>
            <li> my brushes dried quicker!</li>
            <li> YOU WILL ONLY GET A DISAPPOINTING HALF BOTTLE.</li>
            <li> I was shocked at how dirty my eyeshadow brushes were!</li>

            <li> This is the BEST cleaner for Sigma&#x27;s Flat Angled Kabuki Brushes, any brush and the Beauty Blender. I&#x27;ve tried all the tricks baby shampoo, olive oil, soap and water... nothing works better than this.</li>
            <li> i love this, 2nd bottle already. i use it to clean my makeup brushes and beauty blender.</li>
            <li> Melted all the gunk off my F80 really well. I&#x27;m knocking a star off though because it did leave my brushes feeling a little rough. I&#x27;d advise using sparingly as it is a harsh detergent and conditioning afterwards!</li>

            <li> Best makeup brush cleaner I have ever used!  No clue what&#x27;s in it, but my flat kabuki has never been cleaner!</li>
            <li> my bottle came half filled. I&#x27;d send it back but it came from China</li>
            <li> This product is really good and it came on time and everything but the bottle wasn&#x27;t even full and I didn&#x27;t feel that was right. I love it I just wish I got ALL of what I paid for.</li>
            <li> For the brush cleaner (this product), totally 5-star!! It acts fast and cleans my brushes thoroughly. A little bit goes a long way, as well. Heard that it was one of the hot sale items in Asian Daiso. I like it very much and was able to find these two times in my local Daiso. If they are available ALL the time I wouldn&#x27;t even go for other brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, due to dishonesty I would give zero star for the LISTING here in Amazon -- on the List Price it states $14.99, which is utterly untrue. Daiso sold these for $1.50 plus tax a bottle, if you are lucky enough to find them in the store. Honesty, these might as well worth $6 bucks, or even more, but faking the original price to be ten times more to attract potential buyers is just plain shameful.</li>
            <li> This cleans soooo much makeup off my brushes! They look brand new after I wash them with this cleaner! I was shocked at how dirty my eyeshadow brushes were! I pour a small amount of this into my palm and swirl my brushes through it, then rinse with warm water and swirl them on my palm through water to ensure they&#x27;re clean.</li>
            <li> Best makeup brush soap. It is very concentrated so all you need is just a drop and swirl your makeup brush in the soap and rinse and voila.. U have a clean brush. Some people complains that the bottle comes half empty, but the soap is very concentrated. I think I still get my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> This makeup brush cleaner is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever tried. It works SO WELL for brushes that are very dense. I had a flat top brush that was impossible to clean all the foundation off of it not but anymore with this detergent. I used half water/half detergent, swirled my brush in it for able 30 seconds and my brush is PERFECTLY clean again. I highly recommend this. Shipping time was reasonable and it arrived to me in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Cleans all my makeup sponges/puffs and even brushes wonderfully! Easy to use and doesn&#x27;t leave a film on my brushes or sponges/puffs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s opened and just half bottle!&lt;br /&gt;BE WARE!</li>
            <li> I received the bottle and it was sealed and brand new. The problem is, it was half full! It didn&#x27;t leak or spill in the box, it was just filled up half way. Either this company needs to get smaller bottles Ô∏èORL advise the buyer the bottle is only half filled.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Far better than high end cleansers I&#x27;ve used.  Really gets all the makeup out of brushes, even the old buildup you didn&#x27;t know you had.  Added benefit - my brushes dried quicker!</li>
            <li> Worked really well. My only issue is that the bottle was not full when I received it.</li>
            <li> I had never heard of this, but bought it after reading a magazine recommendation and online reviews.  I have several smudge brushes that I could never get entirely clean, even after soaking in shampoo or brush cleaner.  There would always be a waxy residue from my eyeliner.  I poured a tiny amount of Daiso into my palm, wished around the brushes in it for a few seconds, and was rewarded by squeaky clean brushes.  It also cleans my Beauty Blender sponge in seconds, returning it to its very pink color.  I highly recommend this relatively inexpensive product.</li>

Before I discovered this, I dreaded cleaning the sponge and I tried many different types of cleansers, but nothing would fully clean it and it would take 10 minutes or more to clean.  With this cleanser, I just rub a quarter-sized amount into the dirty part of the sponge (when its dry) for about 30 seconds and rinse, and voila, the beautyblender is completely clean!  No muss, no fuss.  I just wish this was more readily available in the states.  I can only find it here and one more place online.  Other than that, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great for cleaning make up brushes!</li>
            <li> Good product.  Cleans my Beauty Blenders quickly.</li>
            <li> Works Great! So much cheaper that the beauty blender soap.</li>
            <li> Works perfect for my sigma f80 brush. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Amazing brush cleaner! I got a $15 dense Sonia Kashuk flat-top brush that had years-old residue and foundation completely clean with this. I had resigned myself to replacing it but I have a practically new brush now. This works fast so I cleaned ~18 brushes last night in 17 minutes. Worked well on eyeliner brushes, smudge brushes, large powder brushes, dense foundation brushes, blush and eyeshadow brushes. I&#x27;m so happy I found this and can be confident in the cleanliness of my brushes from here on out.</li>
            <li> Put a small amount in a cup of hot water, swish brush around and it&#x27;s good as new! This cleaned my stubborn foundation cakes brushes like it was nothing.</li>
            <li> The bottle came half full.  I could have bought this in eBay for $3.00 but I bought it for much more on Amazon because it is a trusted source.  I could not believe it.... Regarding the product itself, it is great to use on makeup sponges &amp; the beauty blender - gets all the makeup &amp; stains out!!!  Not good for brushes because it is way too drying &amp; if you have good quality brushes you really want to take care of them.  For brushes I recommend Mona Lisa Brush Cleaner &amp; Conditioner which can be purchased at any arts &amp; crafts store like Michaels with a 50% coupon.</li>
            <li> This is the best sponge and brush cleaner EVER!!!!  I tried so many things to clean my beauty blender and never had much success.  You just rub this stuff on a dry sponge (or brush), rinse, and BAM! Clean. Plus, my brushes were dry within just a few hours.  They usually take all night long to dry. I love this and will forever be purchasing it for my future brush care.</li>
            <li> I think this product just takes the color out but it won&#x27;t take out old makeup stains. I will definitely repurchase only for my sponges though! It does work for brushes but I think its easy to waste this product on small sponges! I will stick to my sonia kashuk cleaner for my brushes. Overall it did take about three weeks to get here but it was worth the wait! Oh and the bottle wasn&#x27;t full but ehh I can live with that! It would be better if you made the bottle clear so we could see how much we have left!</li>
            <li> Amazing results with first wash. Got months of ground in foundation out of a tight Sigma F80 kibuki brush. My new holy grail brush cleaner!</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle. It completely cleans heavy foundation make-up off my brush in no time at all. FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> Only thing that fully cleans my beauty blender with no fragrance leftover or leaving of stains/marks</li>
