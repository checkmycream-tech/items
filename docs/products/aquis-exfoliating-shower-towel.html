            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>I replaced my \\&quot;bath poof\\&quot; with one of these Aquis Exfoliating Shower Towels, and have been very pleased.  </li>
            <li>ordered 5 more to give to friends!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>I love this!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I am happy!;)</li>
            <li>This cloth has a great exfoliating side and a smooth side.</li>
            <li>I never use fabric softener of any kind on towels, so, if you do, that might impact its performance after washing.  </li>
            <li>Both side has their own purposes.  </li>
            <li>I take each end to rub it across my shoulders and it is a nice exfoliation I do wish it had handles or something you could hold onto because it slips from my hands sometimes, but once I get a grip I like the texture of the cloth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying Aquis towels for many years and have always been very pleased with their quality and usefulness.  </li>
            <li>Great product, great price and super fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>Effective but easy on skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s the best of both worlds: Back scrubber and exfoliating washcloth.</li>
            <li>The exfoliating side feels a lot like plastic and is really more scratchy than exfoliating in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been so pleased with mine that I&#x27;ve bought them for friends who also love them.  </li>
            <li>I love this one.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love, love , love this towel, I will buy a dozen.</li>
            <li>I need to get more of these towels</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s machine washable.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t easy after many years in the sun.  </li>
            <li>The cloth is washable, which I love and it dries very quickly.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>It is amazingly refreshing, and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>This product dries quickly, can be washed, and hasn&#x27;t stopped working in 12 months!</li>
            <li>The soft side provides a good grip.</li>
            <li>(be sure to wring it out a LOT to prevent a mildew-y smell), and has the right amount of \\&quot;scratch\\&quot; for my taste.  </li>
            <li>and I get out of the shower feeling really clean.  </li>
            <li>This is a great exfoliator that makes my skin smooth without being too rough on it.  </li>
            <li>Lathers very well, really good scrub yet gentle.</li>
            <li>The other side, however, is very nice, and it is like having a super sized washcloth that dries very quickly.</li>
            <li>(I can wash my entire body without re-squirting), rinses fairly well</li>
            <li>it exfoliates incredibly well no dead skin after a shower  my feet actually feel smother and just an all day sense of clean</li>
            <li>Awesome Cloth it would be nice according to my Wife if they came in other colors other than Army Drab olive colored or whatever the color is</li>
            <li>Good material but too long.</li>
            <li>they are lite weight and easy to maneuver especially ability to clean the back and the abrasive side is mild but very effective...............</li>
            <li>so I have fresh ones on hand at all times.</li>
            <li>Just as nice as the back scrubber...</li>
            <li>I expected to be just as thrilled with this exfoliating towel but am not, it&#x27;s just okay - kind of a waste of money for me and rarely used, even though it hangs in my shower.</li>
            <li>The length makes it easy to scrub my back and it keeps my skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>exfoliates great on my back especially.</li>
            <li>and it was exactly what I had been looking for.</li>
            <li>I have several Aquis microfiber towels and washcloths that I love.</li>
            <li>If I were to make a list of my favorite things like Oprah used to do, this product would definitely be on it.</li>
            <li>I love this product it really massages the back while circulating the blood, I use it every-time I&#x27;m in the shower!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as close as I&#x27;ve found to sandpaper for the skin, which is exactly what I want, but I could certainly see how someone might not appreciate the texture.  </li>
            <li>One side is smooth other side is rough and scrubs really good.</li>
            <li>I was very hesitant to buy this wash cloth mainly because I haven&#x27;t been able to find one to my liking since my local store stopped carrying my brand.</li>
            <li>This towel allows you to easily wash your back....</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s much heavier than the leyijie</li>
            <li>It really does do the job.  </li>
            <li>So the Aquis exfoliating towel is a real gift.  </li>
            <li>The soft side is excellent for cleaning tender areas such as ears, and the rough side is a terrific defoliator for skin.</li>
            <li>really helpful.</li>
            <li>Arrived in a reasonable time.</li>
            <li>Seems to really lather up well when using body washes.  </li>
            <li>Also I can scrub my whole body with just a change of pressure.</li>
            <li>well while I scrub, but it rinses out easily and wrings quite dry.  </li>
            <li>I feel extra clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>within just a week of using this with my normal soap it&#x27;s gone, and my fiancee just loves that my back is smooth.</li>
            <li>Now my back feels really clean.  </li>
            <li>Great for the hard to reach back areas.</li>
            <li>I am 70 and, like all my women friends who are of the same age, have to put some effort into maintaining soft, smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>as well because of it is highly absorbent.      </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t so scratchy that it is uncomfortable, in fact it feels great</li>
            <li>It is better than a plain wash cloth since it has both a rough and a smooth surface.</li>
            <li>I get a new one every four months as it softens with time.</li>
            <li>- still looks new after two years of use.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll need to buy a new one for some time, but</li>
            <li>It easily make bubble with less soap.</li>
            <li>I first bought this product about 8 months ago, I have since given several to family members as gifts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a pretty big guy</li>
            <li>I finally can say my back feels clean after using this towel.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I feel cleaner all over using the rough side of the towel, I&#x27;ve got a decent amount of hair on my legs and chest and it gets right through all of that.</li>
            <li>When you are done using it, you just get with your gal and tell her softly that you just, \\&quot;exfoliamated with your man towel\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you prefer something soft, this is NOT for you.  </li>
            <li>Boy was I surprised.</li>
            <li>soft side speaks for itself..</li>
            <li>Overall highly recommended.</li>
            <li>but then again it is far too big unless you want to reach for you back</li>
            <li>It aint no small washcloth that hangs on the towel holder and for some reason takes two minutes to get wet...</li>

            <li> It aint no small washcloth that hangs on the towel holder and for some reason takes two minutes to get wet...</li>
            <li> I have a stiff shoulder and this is much easier to use than a traditional loofah scrubber.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also long enough to serve as a back scrubber, with either side.</li>
            <li> I had a problem with back acne for a long time because I just couldn&#x27;t reach.</li>
            <li> I have used the Aquis Back Scrubber for a long time and when I saw this item I had to have it.  </li>
            <li> will find out how long they last.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells, and often products of this nature start to smell \\&quot;off\\&quot; after a few months.  </li>
            <li> Too small, light, cheesy and not rough enough to actually do any of the exfoliating it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> It is long, but all you need to do to use as a &amp;#34;washcloth is to fold it up</li>
            <li> I just wish it weren&#x27;t as long</li>
            <li> I use the other towels and washcloths when I travel; I couldn&#x27;t be happier with them and plan to buy another in a larger size.</li>
            <li> and I thought I could use the other side for regular washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> With the soft side downward, I drape it down my propped up leg, apply lots of liquid soap, then I turn it over and use it with two hands up and down one leg</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve got some pretty wide shoulders, and any guy (or gal) with big shoulders knows it&#x27;s hard to reach all of your back, really hard.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, i can use my bare hands and rub vigorously on my skin, and i can get dirt or dead skin to come off in the shower.</li>
            <li> It is quite long and wide.  </li>
            <li> I figured this towel would get the same job done with less effort.</li>
            <li> i cut it in half and now have an extra.</li>

            <li> It seems like it could be great. I mean, it&#x27;s really rough, so it should exfoliate and remove the dead skin (or whatever it&#x27;s supposed to do).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, i can use my bare hands and rub vigorously on my skin, and i can get dirt or dead skin to come off in the shower. I figured this towel would get the same job done with less effort. It doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it scratches the heck out of my skin, so i suppose if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re into, grab two of these like i did.</li>
            <li> This thing scrapes off dead skin you didn&#x27;t know you had.</li>
            <li> The ex-foliating side is not as rough as the leyijie towels, which is a plus because the leyijie usable but a bit like sandpaper.  But it&#x27;s much heavier than the leyijie as well because of it is highly absorbent.      I tend to use the cloth (folded into a 4x4 square), so after trying it out for a week, I had cut it but it was still heavy and it became awkward to grip and use.    I just bought and tried the Cure Japanese bath cloth and it was exactly what I had been looking for. It&#x27;s not too rough and not too heavy while using.    [...]</li>
            <li> The exfoliating side is the perfect roughness and your skin will feel cleaner after using it. It is long, but all you need to do to use as a &amp;#34;washcloth is to fold it up and it&#x27;s fine. Otherwise, it&#x27;s the best of both worlds: Back scrubber and exfoliating washcloth. Perfect for travel too. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Your skin will thank you for using this product.  It is amazingly refreshing, and dries quickly.  I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells, and often products of this nature start to smell \\&quot;off\\&quot; after a few months.  This product dries quickly, can be washed, and hasn&#x27;t stopped working in 12 months!</li>
            <li> Best duty towel for a dude.  It really does do the job.  Big enough.  It aint no small washcloth that hangs on the towel holder and for some reason takes two minutes to get wet... you know what I mean?  Two sides:  One soft, and one a bit rough.  When you are done using it, you just get with your gal and tell her softly that you just, \\&quot;exfoliamated with your man towel\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My job is done here.</li>
            <li> Good material but too long.</li>
            <li> I have several Aquis microfiber towels and washcloths that I love. I use the hair towel every day and have had it for years - it&#x27;s still in great shape. I use the other towels and washcloths when I travel; I couldn&#x27;t be happier with them and plan to buy another in a larger size. I expected to be just as thrilled with this exfoliating towel but am not, it&#x27;s just okay - kind of a waste of money for me and rarely used, even though it hangs in my shower. The quality and effectiveness feel mediocre and something I would expect from a drugstore version, definitely not as stellar as my other products from Aquis. The exfoliating side feels a lot like plastic and is really more scratchy than exfoliating in my opinion. I wanted to love it but sadly, I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this towel for a few years now; needless to say I really like it.  I use the rough side always.  The soft side provides a good grip. It is quite long and wide.  With the soft side downward, I drape it down my propped up leg, apply lots of liquid soap, then I turn it over and use it with two hands up and down one leg and then the other and so on, then I grab it by the ends and do my back.  I&#x27;ll empathize that the rough side is quite rough.  It lasts longer than a loofah and is washable.  I get a new one every four months as it softens with time.</li>
            <li> I replaced my \\&quot;bath poof\\&quot; with one of these Aquis Exfoliating Shower Towels, and have been very pleased.  It holds a good amount of body wash (I can wash my entire body without re-squirting), rinses fairly well (be sure to wring it out a LOT to prevent a mildew-y smell), and has the right amount of \\&quot;scratch\\&quot; for my taste.  It&#x27;s been through several runs in the laundry, and it has not lost any absorbency or roughness.  I never use fabric softener of any kind on towels, so, if you do, that might impact its performance after washing.  If you prefer something soft, this is NOT for you.  It&#x27;s as close as I&#x27;ve found to sandpaper for the skin, which is exactly what I want, but I could certainly see how someone might not appreciate the texture.  Overall highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I finally can say my back feels clean after using this towel.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered 5 more to give to friends!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying Aquis towels for many years and have always been very pleased with their quality and usefulness.  The exfoliating shower towel is no exception.  I love it!  The length makes it easy to scrub my back and it keeps my skin feeling smooth. I am 70 and, like all my women friends who are of the same age, have to put some effort into maintaining soft, smooth skin.  It isn&#x27;t easy after many years in the sun.  So the Aquis exfoliating towel is a real gift.  It isn&#x27;t so scratchy that it is uncomfortable, in fact it feels great and I get out of the shower feeling really clean.  It holds soap well while I scrub, but it rinses out easily and wrings quite dry.  It washes &amp; dries beautifully - still looks new after two years of use.  I&#x27;ve been so pleased with mine that I&#x27;ve bought them for friends who also love them.  If I were to make a list of my favorite things like Oprah used to do, this product would definitely be on it.</li>
            <li> I love this product it really massages the back while circulating the blood, I use it every-time I&#x27;m in the shower! I feel extra clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> This is my second towel and I ordered one for my husband as well.</li>
            <li> I love this one.  It easily make bubble with less soap. Both side has their own purposes.  Effective but easy on skin.&lt;br /&gt;I actually purchased another one for myself.  We have 2 houses and I keep one at each home.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I first bought this product about 8 months ago, I have since given several to family members as gifts. Everyone uses them and loves them. [[ASIN:B000I248SU Aquis Exfoliating Shower Towel]]</li>
            <li> I take each end to rub it across my shoulders and it is a nice exfoliation I do wish it had handles or something you could hold onto because it slips from my hands sometimes, but once I get a grip I like the texture of the cloth.</li>
            <li> Too small, light, cheesy and not rough enough to actually do any of the exfoliating it is supposed to do. Might work for a girl... or a boy who thinks he is a girl.</li>
            <li> This towel works beautifully. The soft side is excellent for cleaning tender areas such as ears, and the rough side is a terrific defoliator for skin. It&#x27;s also long enough to serve as a back scrubber, with either side.</li>
            <li> really helpful. I&#x27;m a pretty big guy and I&#x27;ve got some pretty wide shoulders, and any guy (or gal) with big shoulders knows it&#x27;s hard to reach all of your back, really hard. So it&#x27;s impossible to clean your back the way it should be. I had a problem with back acne for a long time because I just couldn&#x27;t reach. within just a week of using this with my normal soap it&#x27;s gone, and my fiancee just loves that my back is smooth. I feel cleaner all over using the rough side of the towel, I&#x27;ve got a decent amount of hair on my legs and chest and it gets right through all of that. It&#x27;s a little too rough to use on my face but then I just flip it over and use the softer side and thats just perfect. I wish I had found this sooner</li>
            <li> Arrived in a reasonable time. Towels are as described. I am happy with the service I have received. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Awesome Cloth it would be nice according to my Wife if they came in other colors other than Army Drab olive colored or whatever the color is but besides that I like other reviewers refused to use anything else I actually use my former wash rag as just that a Rag it exfoliates incredibly well no dead skin after a shower  my feet actually feel smother and just an all day sense of clean I purchased a few for family and friends and an additional one for travel</li>
            <li> I love this!  I have used the Aquis Back Scrubber for a long time and when I saw this item I had to have it.  I found the back scrubber almost impossible to use on anything other than my back and now I can use this.  It is better than a plain wash cloth since it has both a rough and a smooth surface.</li>
            <li> The exfoliating side is a bit like sandpaper.  Very harsh.  I won&#x27;t be using that any time soon.  The other side, however, is very nice, and it is like having a super sized washcloth that dries very quickly.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price and super fast shipping.  This is a great exfoliator that makes my skin smooth without being too rough on it.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I love, love , love this towel, I will buy a dozen. Lathers very well, really good scrub yet gentle. Does the job!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant to buy this wash cloth mainly because I haven&#x27;t been able to find one to my liking since my local store stopped carrying my brand. I figured that it would be just like all the others, exfoliate for a few weeks and then \\&quot;nothing\\&quot;. Boy was I surprised. This cloth has a great exfoliating side and a smooth side. I&#x27;ve been using mine for months now and my skin still feels refreshed after each use. The cloth is washable, which I love and it dries very quickly.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll need to buy a new one for some time, but when I do I will definitely buy this one again. It&#x27;s a great buy and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This towel allows you to easily wash your back....exfoliating dead skin.....very helpful for persons with limited range of motion.  Also, I use it to wash my entire body (except face/neck); thus, saving time for me  and it is helpful for those with larger bodies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought several  and have given 2 as presents.  Both of the recipients of the towel....cannot praise them enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are a perfect gift for others and a MUST HAVE for purchaser.</li>
            <li> I need to get more of these towels so I have fresh ones on hand at all times. I use this towel each time I shower. It does a superb job of exfoliating, leaving my skin very smooth. I also used it on my feet, worked great. Love it.</li>
            <li> Had this for a couple months now.  Works great.  Seems to really lather up well when using body washes.  Leaves my skin feeling softer and fresher.  Would not recommend using it on your face though.</li>
            <li> exfoliates great on my back especially. i cut it in half and now have an extra. will find out how long they last.</li>
            <li> The texture is great. I just wish it weren&#x27;t as long and there was a loop at both ends</li>
            <li> i like these cloths, towels. they are lite weight and easy to maneuver especially ability to clean the back and the abrasive side is mild but very effective...............soft side speaks for itself..</li>
            <li> Thick and exfoliating side not very rough.</li>
            <li> This is a really great product. I am currently using this to speed up the process of getting an even skin tone for my psoriasis. It is really great product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think it would make a difference but it did. Smoother skin! There are two sides to the cloth so you can choose the amount of roughness or exfoliation you want.</li>
            <li> I have a stiff shoulder and this is much easier to use than a traditional loofah scrubber.  Now my back feels really clean.  Also I can scrub my whole body with just a change of pressure.</li>
            <li> I like it. One side is smooth other side is rough and scrubs really good.</li>
            <li> I like it! I am happy!;)</li>
            <li> Good exfoliating tool. I like the fact that it has two levels of coarseness.</li>
            <li> I know it says exfoliating but I think it mentioned it was supposed to be double sided and I thought I could use the other side for regular washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For an exfoliator it is good but then again it is far too big unless you want to reach for you back</li>
            <li> Actually I tried to cancel this order, but it was not working. They still shipped them. When I received them, I though they look good, so I decided to keep them.</li>
            <li> Just as nice as the back scrubber... Really does the job without irritating.</li>
            <li> Great for the hard to reach back areas. Love that it&#x27;s machine washable.</li>
