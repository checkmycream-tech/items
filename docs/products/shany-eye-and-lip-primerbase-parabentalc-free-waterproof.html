            <li>and it is better then</li>
            <li>I ordered it with an eyeshadow palette I ordered from the same company, and it works awesome.</li>
            <li>Need I say more?</li>
            <li>It is OK.</li>
            <li>At 1st I wasnt sure</li>
            <li>This primer feels and looks more like makeup than primer.</li>
            <li>It works well to help mattify a cream shadow and put on top of undereye concealer to help brighten the under eye area.</li>
            <li>It is ok, but I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li>love this product.  </li>
            <li>But  the price was right and the stats looked good</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very smooth and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>It makes any eyeshadow a bajillion times more pigmented and brilliant, and it works with any shade of shadow without changing the colour of the final look.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a good product.</li>
            <li>its goes on easy and seems to stay on well.</li>
            <li>looked good and did not run or wear off like normal.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and enhances eye shadow colors well.  </li>
            <li>Primer Makes Eye shadow vibrant, holds up nicely, makes eyes pop, no creases.  </li>
            <li>I found my new favorite beauty product!</li>
            <li>I wore this last night for the first time and my man loved it!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t crease, as far as I have experienced, but I can tell it would if you put too much on at one time.</li>
            <li>I wonder if those who have experienced creasing are applying it more heavily than I do.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The true test,  LIPSTICK.  </li>
            <li>and this really works... much better than</li>
            <li>It helps keep my eyeshadow vibrant and stay on all day.&lt;br /&gt;the delivery process was quick and smooth, too!</li>
            <li>I rarely use the stick shadow because it wears off so quickly, but when using the Shany Eye Primer, it stayed on all day.  </li>
            <li>It made my eyeshadow so much more vibrant and made my eyes really pop!</li>
            <li>This is definitely my favorite primer by far.</li>
            <li>They feel good, no harsh chemical smells, and do not irritate my somewhat sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I am in my mid thirties and my daughter is entering her teen years and makeup is becoming more appealing.</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable so it is not a problem.</li>
            <li>This came in fast!</li>
            <li>I ordered this not knowing exactly what to expect.</li>
            <li>I really like Shanny!</li>
            <li>, I got this in the mail right before I started getting ready for the day.&lt;br /&gt;First thing I want to say</li>
            <li>The colour is a good neutral beige-y pink-y colour, and would work on any skin tone, but if you are a darker skin tone than my Oregonian paleness, you may want to make sure you get all of it covered with eyeshadow, otherwise it might look really weird.</li>
            <li>It is in such a cute little container and is very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>so if you&#x27;re using a darker lipstick it might take a few more coats for it to appear true to color.</li>
            <li>I have unusually oily eyelids</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I am very impressed!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have VERY oily skin and eyelids</li>
            <li>so I can draw a lip line really anywhere.</li>
            <li>My shadow stays on much longer.</li>
            <li>Thanks Shany.</li>
            <li>I only apply a thin layer and it works great!  </li>
            <li>However, good things do come in small packages!  </li>
            <li>Pretty good product, dried out my lips after a few hours if wear, kept lipstick on</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always hesitant about trying a new brand.</li>
            <li>I have ordered several other SHANY products and they are all top notch quality.</li>
            <li>As far as use on lips, it&#x27;s a nude color</li>
            <li>I purchased mainly as a lip base, it is working better than most products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t put in on too thick and give it a few minutes to set, you are guaranteed to have bright shadow that lasts all day without creasing.  </li>
            <li>The base is a bit challenging to get out of the container- fingertip will not work, q tip was OK-</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and and very critical about make-up.  </li>
            <li>It does not crease which is a major</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this and will continue to use it as long as they make it.</li>
            <li>Believe me, this base will last you a good long time, as you don&#x27;t use very much.</li>

            <li> I expected a larger size.</li>
            <li> The consistency of this product is easier than the SB or UD primers to apply precisely, but you really do have to be careful, as this base is pigmented, not sheer, so you don&#x27;t want it going anywhere</li>

            <li> You really do have to have a very very small amounts at a time on your finger, or it&#x27;s going to get everywhere on your eyes.</li>
            <li> Now, don&#x27;t get me wrong, this base is the perfect consistency for applying to your lids and catching your shadow, but it&#x27;s a little difficult to get it on your lids without smearing it somewhat everywhere.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry and make my lips feel cakey.  </li>
            <li> so far a small eyeliner brush is working for me.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by how small the jar was.  </li>
            <li> I tried it as a shadow base and was very pleased with how it worked-</li>
            <li> Those who are not using a brush and have long nails may have a harder time getting the product on their finger pads.</li>
            <li> Replacing item (purchased 3/20/15), which was accidentally, flushed down the toilet!</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> final praise is that it doesn&#x27;t have any harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Magic Decrease primer, which is the last one I tried (hated it) and just as well as some more expensive ones I&#x27;ve tried in the past.  </li>
            <li> Just a little spreads a long way.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> However, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Using a small lipstick application brush, a little tiny bit of this stuff goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> but where you are putting eyeshadow.hes, due to the slipperyness of the cream.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!!</li>
            <li> I have long fingernails so that makes it difficult to apply with fingertips the way I have with other eye shadow primers that come in tube form, especially since the compact this product comes in is very tiny.  </li>
            <li> It does nothing for your lashes except make them clump up a ton, but it&#x27;s really hard to get this product down to the lash line without getting it on your actual lashes, due to the slipperyness of the cream.</li>
            <li> I got this to help with dark eyelids and a scar on my lip.</li>
            <li> When I apply it to my eyelids it does help to hide the dark.</li>
            <li> Can slightly change the color of your lipstick</li>
            <li> The majority of the day it stayed put,  After a few hour it did start to wear off.  </li>
            <li> but I have used it a few times and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have given this 5 stars if I didn&#x27;t have to use a small brush to apply it, but despite the slightly less convenient application process, I would buy this again because it does work well.</li>
            <li> The packaging is tiny, and it makes it really difficult to get a little bit out and use it.</li>
            <li> Container is to small.</li>
            <li> And it usually feathers out.  </li>
            <li> I have always been a lazy make up wearer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it first as a base for my eyes.  </li>
            <li> i mean I could go on vacation with the bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li> application process is a little difficult because of the consistency.</li>
            <li> would call this base comparable to, if not better than, the Smashbox or Urban Decay primers.</li>
            <li> would call this base comparable to, if not better than, the Smashbox or Urban Decay primers.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll want to apply a very thin layer and let it try a few minutes to set while you do your foundation, blush, etc.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very impressed.</li>
            <li> Made my eye make crease worse.</li>
            <li> However, I wouldn&#x27;t change the creaminess of this base for anything, I&#x27;m just saying it can be difficult, especially for the un-experienced makeup</li>

            <li> Not that there&#x27;s anything wrong with that.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will mention that the product definitely is a *base* and not just a primer.</li>

            <li> Container is to small.</li>
            <li> Too creamy! Made my eye make crease worse.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It does a great job of anchoring your lipstick to your lips for an extended stay!</li>
            <li> It was way smaller than I expected!it also says that it won&#x27;t crease and it does. Not what I expected. I guess it is waterproof and it is better then no primer but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have unusually oily eyelids so I need to use a primer before I apply eyeshadow or else I will end up looking like a raccoon by the end of the day.  I was using Estee Lauder primer and liked that a lot but it was also expensive.  Shany eye and lip primer is very comparable to Estee Lauder&#x27;s if not better.  My eyeshadow stays on all day and I have had no irritation from this product.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with the staying power of this product! It takes a good rubbing with a makeup wipe to get this stuff off your eyes. It doesn&#x27;t crease, as far as I have experienced, but I can tell it would if you put too much on at one time. The colour is a good neutral beige-y pink-y colour, and would work on any skin tone, but if you are a darker skin tone than my Oregonian paleness, you may want to make sure you get all of it covered with eyeshadow, otherwise it might look really weird. It makes any eyeshadow a bajillion times more pigmented and brilliant, and it works with any shade of shadow without changing the colour of the final look. This really is a great product. I will mention that the product definitely is a *base* and not just a primer. The product has some colour to it, and is not just a sheer primer.  Not that there&#x27;s anything wrong with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problems I have with this product is with the packaging and application process. The packaging is tiny, and it makes it really difficult to get a little bit out and use it. If you have longer fingernails and want to apply with your fingertips, you&#x27;re going to get a bunch under your nails while trying to get it out. Now, the tiny packaging is not a problem when it comes to the amount of product you get. Believe me, this base will last you a good long time, as you don&#x27;t use very much. The problem is just getting it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The application process is a little difficult because of the consistency. Now, don&#x27;t get me wrong, this base is the perfect consistency for applying to your lids and catching your shadow, but it&#x27;s a little difficult to get it on your lids without smearing it somewhat everywhere. You really do have to have a very very small amounts at a time on your finger, or it&#x27;s going to get everywhere on your eyes. It does nothing for your lashes except make them clump up a ton, but it&#x27;s really hard to get this product down to the lash line without getting it on your actual lashes, due to the slipperyness of the cream. However, I wouldn&#x27;t change the creaminess of this base for anything, I&#x27;m just saying it can be difficult, especially for the un-experienced makeup applicators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would call this base comparable to, if not better than, the Smashbox or Urban Decay primers. The consistency of this product is easier than the SB or UD primers to apply precisely, but you really do have to be careful, as this base is pigmented, not sheer, so you don&#x27;t want it going anywhere but where you are putting eyeshadow.hes, due to the slipperyness of the cream.

            <li> I love this stuff! I ordered it with an eyeshadow palette I ordered from the same company, and it works awesome. It helps keep my eyeshadow vibrant and stay on all day.&lt;br /&gt;the delivery process was quick and smooth, too!</li>
            <li> Pretty good product, dried out my lips after a few hours if wear, kept lipstick on</li>
            <li> works great, also works as a concealer.</li>
            <li> This came in fast! I swam for 2 hours and my makeup didn&#x27;t budge. Need I say more?</li>
            <li> The Shany Eye and lip primer//base is nice. It helps keep my eye shadow from clumping and stay on longer. I will definitely buy this again.,</li>
            <li> I Agree with Madeline... Primer Makes Eye shadow vibrant, holds up nicely, makes eyes pop, no creases.  Replacing item (purchased 3/20/15), which was accidentally, flushed down the toilet!</li>
            <li> OMG!  I found my new favorite beauty product! I ordered this not knowing exactly what to expect. I&#x27;m always hesitant about trying a new brand. But  the price was right and the stats looked good so I jumped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As luck my have it, I got this in the mail right before I started getting ready for the day.&lt;br /&gt;First thing I want to say is that it has a nice pleasant smell.  Not perfum-y but it doesn&#x27;t have that chemical smell that some bases have.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very smooth and easy to apply.  A little goes a long way!! I can see where this container will last awhile!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it first as a base for my eyes.  I have a tendency to use darker shades that may smudge.  and my eyeliner sometimes streaks also.  I can honestly say, my makeup stayed put!  I am very impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The true test,  LIPSTICK.  I use lipliner and gloss.  My lip liner NEVER stays on.  like ever.  And it usually feathers out.  The majority of the day it stayed put,  After a few hour it did start to wear off.  But I can&#x27;t complain about that at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My final praise is that it doesn&#x27;t have any harsh chemicals.  I have very sensitive skin and and very critical about make-up.  I have literally ZERO complaints.  And that is rare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMEND! and will be a repeat buyer!</li>
            <li> It is OK. I expected a larger size.</li>
            <li> I used this primer today before I had an award ceremony and I absolutely love it! It made my eyeshadow so much more vibrant and made my eyes really pop! It is in such a cute little container and is very easy to apply. A little bit goes a long way! I applied this at around 7 A.M. and It is now 6 P.M. and my eyeshadow still looks amazing. It does not crease which is a major plus and is very light. I have yet to try it on my lips but I will be trying soon since I am so impressed with what it did on my eyes. This is definitely my favorite primer by far.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  At 1st I wasnt sure but I have used it a few times and its goes on easy and seems to stay on well.</li>
            <li> Great Product!   I already haven&#x27;t try this in my lips yet, but for my eyeshadows... It makes the color pop, an no crease or fading noticeable after 8 hours wearing!!!</li>
            <li> Wife said this was the best she used. Did not burn her eyes like others.</li>
            <li> I have long fingernails so that makes it difficult to apply with fingertips the way I have with other eye shadow primers that come in tube form, especially since the compact this product comes in is very tiny.  However, good things do come in small packages!  Using a small lipstick application brush, a little tiny bit of this stuff goes a long way.  You&#x27;ll want to apply a very thin layer and let it try a few minutes to set while you do your foundation, blush, etc.  If you don&#x27;t put in on too thick and give it a few minutes to set, you are guaranteed to have bright shadow that lasts all day without creasing.  I have VERY oily skin and eyelids and this really works... much better than L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Magic Decrease primer, which is the last one I tried (hated it) and just as well as some more expensive ones I&#x27;ve tried in the past.  I&#x27;d have given this 5 stars if I didn&#x27;t have to use a small brush to apply it, but despite the slightly less convenient application process, I would buy this again because it does work well.</li>
            <li> This primer feels and looks more like makeup than primer. On my lips it made them look white and with lipstick on it looked good and did not run or wear off like normal. When used on my eyes my makeup stayed in place without getting all greasy and run and make my eyes burn.</li>
            <li> I am loving the SHANY makeup. I am in my mid thirties and my daughter is entering her teen years and makeup is becoming more appealing. I have always been a lazy make up wearer. Now that I need to teach my daughterabout makeup I am trying to learn about it. I got this to help with dark eyelids and a scar on my lip. When using it on my lips it does make the lips the same color as my face so I can draw a lip line really anywhere. It does help the lipstick stay in place. It doesn&#x27;t dry and make my lips feel cakey.  When I apply it to my eyelids it does help to hide the dark. i mean I could go on vacation with the bags under my eyes. Woof... even though this is a primer and not a concealer it does well at both. It works well to help mattify a cream shadow and put on top of undereye concealer to help brighten the under eye area. I have ordered several other SHANY products and they are all top notch quality. They feel good, no harsh chemical smells, and do not irritate my somewhat sensitive skin. I havenot had any breakouts while using the SHANY products. I think I am hooked!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very impressed. It is ok, but I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I use an eye  shadow brush with this. Just a little spreads a long way. It works great. My shadow stays on much longer.</li>
            <li> I really like Shanny! It keeps my eye make up,  to stay on so well.Alo good for my lips, keeps lipstick looking good for hours. Thanks for a good product.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time without problems. The base is a bit challenging to get out of the container- fingertip will not work, q tip was OK- so far a small eyeliner brush is working for me. I purchased mainly as a lip base, it is working better than most products I&#x27;ve tried. I tried it as a shadow base and was very pleased with how it worked- all day stay power.  I would purchase again, my preference is to keep lip products separate from eye products. The price is very reasonable so it is not a problem.</li>
            <li> Can slightly change the color of your lipstick</li>
            <li> Very nice...a little goes a long way.  Keeps my eye shadow in place all day.</li>
            <li> love this product.  I only have to apply once in the morning. can&#x27;t say enough about this primer.</li>
            <li> The product is perfect for my skin tone. I wore this last night for the first time and my man loved it! So I will definitely be ordering this product again. Thanks Shany.</li>
            <li> When I received the SHANY Eye Primer I was surprised by how small the jar was.  However, a little goes a long way.  I just dab some on the pad of my finger and apply. It goes on smoothly and enhances eye shadow colors well.  My shadow stays on all day.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any creasing. I only apply a thin layer and it works great!  I wonder if those who have experienced creasing are applying it more heavily than I do. Those who are not using a brush and have long nails may have a harder time getting the product on their finger pads.</li>
            <li> I love this primer!!  I have been using it with my power eye shadow and it was working great.  Just recently, I tried it with my stick eye shadow.  I rarely use the stick shadow because it wears off so quickly, but when using the Shany Eye Primer, it stayed on all day.  By the end of the day, my eye makeup, shadow and liner, looked like I had just applied it.  I highly recommend this and will continue to use it as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> I am impressed with this product. I use it as a primer for my eye shadow, eyeliner, and lips. As far as use on lips, it&#x27;s a nude color so if you&#x27;re using a darker lipstick it might take a few more coats for it to appear true to color. It definitely extends the life of all of my eye and lip products. I recommend.</li>
