            <li> /&gt;TJ MAX sells a larger size for less than the money I paid for here.</li>
            <li> It was smaller than I thought when I purchased, but a little dab will do you as they say.</li>
            <li> I have no idea why that little tiny bottle is $20.It</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Not really worth the price for the size</li>
            <li> The bottle is so small, that for the price I paid plus shipping was not worth it!</li>
            <li> $16.50 for a teaspoon of fragrance seems excessive.</li>
            <li> For the price the bottle was way to small.</li>
            <li> Plus when I apply it you can hardly smell the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I have had a hard time finding it</li>
            <li> It is really hard to find now.  </li>
            <li> The bottle contains approximately a teaspoon of perfume.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother buying this product from this vendor, it&#x27;s a rip-off</li>
            <li> Horrible bottle was so tiny</li>
            <li> but this ever again and no one should# disappointed beyond words</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been disappointed this product until now.  </li>

            <li> The bottle is very small but it was great for my little one&#x27;s first bottle of big girl perfume.....She loves it and thinks she&#x27;s doing something and has &amp;#34;what mommy wears&amp;#34;.  She&#x27;s happy and that&#x27;s all that matters.</li>
            <li> Horrible bottle was so tiny I have no idea why that little tiny bottle is $20.It did not smell like it should at all and I was/am so very very disappointed with this purchase. I wouldn&#x27;t but this ever again and no one should# disappointed beyond words</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Nautica for Women for many years.  I&#x27;ve never been disappointed this product until now.  The bottle contains approximately a teaspoon of perfume.  It was not advertised as a miniature.  $16.50 for a teaspoon of fragrance seems excessive.Plus when I apply it you can hardly smell the fragrance.  Don&#x27;t bother buying this product from this vendor, it&#x27;s a rip-off</li>
            <li> Good buy, small bottle</li>

            <li> This is the fragrance that I wanted, however the size is not.  The bottle is so small, that for the price I paid plus shipping was not worth it!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume but lately it becoming hard to find</li>

            <li> Didnt realize this was a miniature size, pleasant fragrance!!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume but I thought I was ordering 1.3 oz bottles and when I got them they were .25 oz bottles... Not really worth the price for the size but I cant live without my Nautica.</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected.  I used to pay $18 for a full size bottle.  This is a mini that you could get from Walmart for $5.  Huge ripoff.</li>
            <li> Description of product was accurate and good price for the size. Great size for my purse/wallet and smells wonderful :)</li>
            <li> this bottle was so tiny it is a great scent but not worth the price I paid for this little bottle</li>

            <li> I love nautica perfume. I have had a hard time finding it so when I found this I had to buy it because I love it so much. Also I like the small bottle because it made it easy for me to be able to take it with me in my purse if I wanted to. Thank you.</li>
            <li> thank you ...my daughter loved it</li>
            <li> I started using this perfume probably 10 years ago.  It is really hard to find now.  I&#x27;m so glad I can still get it here.  I get many compliments on it. It isn&#x27;t overwhelming like so many perfumes are.</li>
            <li> i love it!!  used to wear the fragrance years ago but hadn&#x27;t been able to find it until now. thanks for the great product and great service!! :)</li>
