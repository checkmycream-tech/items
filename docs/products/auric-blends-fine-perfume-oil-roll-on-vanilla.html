            <li>LOL.</li>
            <li>Great for the price.</li>
            <li>Happy</li>
            <li>Great product and great price.</li>
            <li>Seems like this should be a wonderful combination, as I love both sandalwood and vanilla.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells great in the bottle, and ohhhhhh it&#x27;s so nice when you put it on.  </li>
            <li>i knew this would smell good.</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>I love this one it is one of my favorits!</li>
            <li>This product has a very nice sweet scent!</li>
            <li>The sandelwood and vanilla oil smells amazing.</li>
            <li>When I saw a mix I thought it might be nice.</li>
            <li>It is a nice scent, not over powering.</li>
            <li>Kind of gets to me after a while.</li>
            <li>I liked the Egyptian goddess one and thought I would like this one too</li>
            <li>When she first tried it we laughed over her saying it smelled like a dryer softener sheet!</li>
            <li>This fragrance is nice, but more on the vanilla than the sandalwood.</li>
            <li>I think that Auric Blends as a brand is probably my favorite suppliers of perfume oils.</li>
            <li>I love the sand a sandalwood</li>
            <li>It mixes well with patchouli oil adding to the earthy quality I love.</li>
            <li>but this one smells more like sandalwood than vanilla.</li>
            <li>I like this one much better.</li>
            <li>I love this scent.</li>
            <li>Hope, PA.&lt;br /&gt;Thank-you for carrying the Auric Blends oils &amp; the scent I LOVE.</li>
            <li>ive been rubbing it on myself since : )</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t wipe off easy once its on you</li>
            <li>They are manufactured well and the roll on allows for easy application.</li>
            <li>The sandalwood in this case is more of the powdery mild variety.</li>
            <li>It is light and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Perfect to wear to work, as it definitely wouldn&#x27;t be offensive to even the most fragrance sensitive people.</li>
            <li>It smells like cheap perfume</li>
            <li>We both like it, but I still like the plain sandalwood best.</li>
            <li>The Sandalwood Vanilla is soft, light and very good for my 13 yr old daughter.</li>
            <li>I originally bought it in a boutique in Mt.</li>
            <li>I loved it from the first use and have purchased more in multiple quantities.</li>
            <li>it is too sweet.</li>
            <li>It is a sweet and earthy smell which makes you skin glow.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell too woody or too sweet.</li>
            <li>this is useful ...</li>
            <li>thanks to other people who reviewed it....because it helped me pick this great scent.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this oil its long lasting and I get nothing but compliments on how good I smell..</li>
            <li>This one is very nice; but Love is my favorite of everything that I have...including some of the very expensive perfumes I have.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s sweet, but the sandalwood keeps it woodsy, so that it doesn&#x27;t smell too much like a pastry.</li>
            <li>I like the Auric Blend products very much.</li>
            <li>This is a very light, simple fragrance.</li>
            <li>and hes very picky with perfume scents that he doesnt mind smelling all the time!</li>
            <li>As always, rec&#x27;d in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li>I expected more of a sandalwood musk fragrance (with a hint of vanilla).  </li>
            <li>This really should not be sold on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet and vanillay without being over-whelming, but there are undertones of musk and earth that make it heart-racing and definitely not girlish.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to give it more time and try again tomorrow with less.</li>
            <li>I think it lasts pretty long, im just not crazy about the scent.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, though, this is a high quality oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few of the scents, but this one is my favorite (sandalwood vanilla)</li>
            <li>will smell like it witch is a good thing unless you do what I did witch was put on wrists in my arm creases , behind ears and rubbed my wrists all over my dress tomorrow</li>
            <li>To make this fragrance last longer, I first apply vanilla soy lotion or coconut oil before applying my sandalwood vanilla &amp; right after my shower, while the pores are still open.  </li>
            <li>It seems a little soapy vanilla whereas I wanted a strong vanilla or a spicy vanilla.</li>
            <li>my puppy wouldn&#x27;t even come near me when she got a wiff</li>
            <li>Smells baby powder and old spice cologne.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this one and Egyptian Goddess so far.</li>
            <li>This one is pretty mild, I can&#x27;t smell it after a few hours which is why it only gets 4 stars, but since I carry it with me I can re apply!</li>
            <li>As far as longevity, it&#x27;s pretty average.</li>
            <li>It smelled wonderful, just don&#x27;t put too much on or it will be awful .</li>

            <li> Not strong enought dones not last long enought</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this oil its long lasting and I get nothing but compliments on how good I smell..</li>
            <li> It smells like baby powder! Total bummer :(</li>
            <li> I think that Auric Blends as a brand is probably my favorite suppliers of perfume oils. This one is very nice; but Love is my favorite of everything that I have...including some of the very expensive perfumes I have. I have purchased 5 roll on bottles of it. Just had to throw that in there. LOL. As always, rec&#x27;d in a very timely manner. My only issue is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to stay with me all day.I have to reapply at least once. But it is still the best.......</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these. The smell of this oil is undescriablly wonderfull! It is light and not overpowering. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Love this! I keep it in my purse for when I need to freshen up during the day. I&#x27;ve tried a few of the scents, but this one is my favorite (sandalwood vanilla), it&#x27;s sweet, but the sandalwood keeps it woodsy, so that it doesn&#x27;t smell too much like a pastry. As far as longevity, it&#x27;s pretty average. I feel like oil based perfumes used to last longer and be stronger. This one is pretty mild, I can&#x27;t smell it after a few hours which is why it only gets 4 stars, but since I carry it with me I can re apply!</li>
            <li> It smelled wonderful, just don&#x27;t put too much on or it will be awful . I&#x27;m going to give it more time and try again tomorrow with less. It doesn&#x27;t wipe off easy once its on you will smell like it witch is a good thing unless you do what I did witch was put on wrists in my arm creases , behind ears and rubbed my wrists all over my dress tomorrow I will do one little dab instead of 2 generous ones... my puppy wouldn&#x27;t even come near me when she got a wiff lol !!! I will update this later</li>
            <li> This was just so-so.  I expected more of a sandalwood musk fragrance (with a hint of vanilla).  Overall it is too sweet.</li>
            <li> The Sandalwood Vanilla is soft, light and very good for my 13 yr old daughter. When she first tried it we laughed over her saying it smelled like a dryer softener sheet! It changed into a delightful inviting scent w/in 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> I love the sand a sandalwood and my husband likes vanilla perfumes. When I saw a mix I thought it might be nice. It is a nice scent, not over powering. We both like it, but I still like the plain sandalwood best.</li>

            <li> This product is the perfect fragrance! I loved it from the first use and have purchased more in multiple quantities. It is a sweet and earthy smell which makes you skin glow. I have received tons of compliments from my friends since I started using this product. It mixes well with patchouli oil adding to the earthy quality I love.</li>
            <li> This product has a very nice sweet scent! I like the Auric Blend products very much. They are manufactured well and the roll on allows for easy application.</li>
            <li> smells NOTHING like Sandalwood or Vanilla.  Smells baby powder and old spice cologne.  Seriously.... I am not kidding.  This really should not be sold on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is a very light, simple fragrance. Perfect to wear to work, as it definitely wouldn&#x27;t be offensive to even the most fragrance sensitive people. To make this fragrance last longer, I first apply vanilla soy lotion or coconut oil before applying my sandalwood vanilla &amp; right after my shower, while the pores are still open.  Hope this is useful ... Happy shopping!&lt;br /&gt;~ D Vas</li>
            <li> What can you not love,,,,,,you have the scent of the sandalwood, then back ground scent of your vanilla...!!</li>
            <li> I liked the Egyptian goddess one and thought I would like this one too but this one smells more like sandalwood than vanilla.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is nice, but more on the vanilla than the sandalwood. The sandalwood in this case is more of the powdery mild variety. This is not for someone who is looking for a woody sandalwood with a hint of vanilla. Otherwise, though, this is a high quality oil.</li>
            <li> Seems like this should be a wonderful combination, as I love both sandalwood and vanilla. I&#x27;m sorry to say that this does not smell anything like sandalwood or vanilla, either in the bottle or on. Smells awful. I had to take a shower after putting it on.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great in the bottle, and ohhhhhh it&#x27;s so nice when you put it on.  But wait, oh no, what&#x27;s happening?!  AAAUUGGHH, help me!  It&#x27;s turning into baby powder scented!  *chokes and dies*</li>
            <li> It has a perfect blend of sweets an earthy scents. I love this one it is one of my favorits!</li>
            <li> I ordered this one and Egyptian Goddess so far. I like this one much better. It doesn&#x27;t smell too woody or too sweet. A perfect blend of the two.</li>
            <li> Just got this today and I can&#x27;t stop sniffing it (or myself).  It&#x27;s sweet and vanillay without being over-whelming, but there are undertones of musk and earth that make it heart-racing and definitely not girlish.  This isn&#x27;t a teeny-bopper sugary vanilla type scent.</li>
            <li> I love this scent. I will b reordering again. I originally bought it in a boutique in Mt. Hope, PA.&lt;br /&gt;Thank-you for carrying the Auric Blends oils &amp; the scent I LOVE.</li>
            <li> The sandelwood and vanilla oil smells amazing. I get complements all the time about how great it smells! Great product and great price.</li>
            <li> It smells like cheap perfume</li>
            <li> when i read sandlewood and vanilla..i knew this would smell good. I put it on as soon as i opened the package...ive been rubbing it on myself since : ) my husband likes it..and hes very picky with perfume scents that he doesnt mind smelling all the time! When i run out i am going to buy another and possibly other fragrances. thanks to other people who reviewed it....because it helped me pick this great scent.</li>
