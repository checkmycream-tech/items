            <li>Smell is very strong</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m for sure buying more of these.!(&#x3D;</li>
            <li>Nothing more than a moisture cream, I say.</li>
            <li>BUT id say, for the way it&#x27;s helped my complexion and improved my skin is much more supple -at</li>
            <li>I guess it OK.</li>
            <li>is okay</li>
            <li>If I see more improvement</li>
            <li>my friend love this product and she want me to order again when she run out..</li>
            <li>The price is so good, it&#x27;s worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;4.  </li>
            <li>Although I am using it on my legs, it seems to be non-irritating and could be used on most skin.  </li>
            <li>have used it for about a week - my skin looks more even.  </li>
            <li>My face has NEVER looked any better than this.</li>
            <li>Since it came uncovered,  I doubted if the cream was authentic.</li>
            <li>the ayurvedic formula contains a blend of herbs that is non toxic and promotes healthy skin.</li>
            <li>Lol it&#x27;s Pretty Cheap</li>
            <li>Smells good though and all very organic</li>
            <li>It is fine as a moisturizer but probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li>it comes on so smooth</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s alright, if you stop using it, the blemishes and scars start to become noticeable again, but fantastic for the price.</li>
            <li>I loved the natural smell of turmeric.</li>
            <li>There is an herbal fragrance...not strong, and dispersed quickly.</li>
            <li>This is very good product for removing dark spots on our skin that  I ever had in my life.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it said and my skin is looking better and</li>
            <li>(1) : Get a clean wash rag&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li>my face is nice on soft and smooth i highly recommend it and for six dollar :)</li>
            <li>WOW it works amazing....</li>
            <li>first of allove with this product!</li>
            <li>so the seller wins...</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s all natural too because i don&#x27;t like using chemicals on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I believe I am too sensitive for many face products.</li>
            <li>After applying the full mask onto the area in need of this cream, wait for 25 mins &amp; thoroughly wash your face with hot water for 17 seconds.</li>
            <li>The price is right.</li>
            <li>you have to be consistent with application.</li>
            <li>or when I try to sneak in something with chocolate, like have ovaltine or hot cocoa.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what it says it is an eraser.</li>
            <li>but at a much higher price.</li>
            <li>I used it everyday on a scar for a good month now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other removers for my dark skin spots and this one works the best.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a nurse practitioner, got my masters degree as well as my bachelors degree &amp; studied pretty much EVERYTHING there&#x27;s to know about one of the oldest medicines on this planet ( Ayurvedic ) &amp;&#x27;how much seconds it would take...</li>
            <li>This product was an absolute waste of money, if you have acne scars do not under any circumstances buy this product thinking that they will go away because they SURELY won&#x27;t !</li>
            <li>I really wish that I had bought it sooner</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know is giving reviews about this product</li>
            <li>I found chocolate to absolutely do me in with acne.</li>
            <li>After 2 days of using the cream I saw them lighten and after a week 2x a day I no longer use it on that part of my body, it seems to really erase the marks so that you don&#x27;t have to use it forever.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Out of all my years of using acne creams, NONE of them shows the amount of results as much as the eraser, I have went from proactiv to x-out to nadinola &amp; none of them showed more than partial of a removal of this cystic acne...</li>
            <li>The base smells good and the cream is nice, even if you don&#x27;t care about erasing anything.  </li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li>This cream really works,and it goes on smoothly,so there is no mess!</li>
            <li>So far, this has worked very well at lightening the spots so that when I put makeup on the spots can now be covered.</li>
            <li>suggested to few friends, they also seem to be satisfied with the cream.</li>
            <li>I looked at several much more expensive and glamorous spot lightening creams on Amazon, but decided to try this due to its very reasonable price and the good reviews.  </li>
            <li>It has gotten rid of any new scar like cuts, spots, marks, etc.</li>
            <li>In my experience this cream is not greasy and it smells very natural.</li>
            <li>and i just put some on, all I can say is wow!</li>
            <li>I am an African American woman &amp; i had simple steps to complete for satisfying results!&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li>most wont take the time to get $  back not worth their time  </li>
            <li>It actually made me break out more which I found odd.</li>
            <li>come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had experienced bad breakouts for some time and have really made some strides this year by cleaning up my diet.</li>
            <li>I have to keep using this to see if it will clear up the mark on my leg.  </li>
            <li>I am 67 years old and have age/sun spots on my shins from too much sun as a teen.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for about six weeks now and my overall complexion is brighter and the cheeks are especially clear.</li>
            <li>Hopefully they will disappear completely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a natural remedy.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s working</li>
            <li>I tried this skin cream because of the natural (Ayurvedic) qualities on my sun spots.  </li>
            <li>I bought it to use on old acne scarring, it&#x27;s soft and non greasy</li>
            <li>on  and near my face.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are natural.  </li>
            <li>and I have always been conscious about my things</li>
            <li>So I definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend this if you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I usually do a double take in the mirror to see how far my skin has</li>
            <li>first of all I got my cream earlier then expected</li>
            <li>After 2 weeks of using it just  on my eyes and not really seeing a change I started using it on my entire face and neck twice a day everyday and I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>From Dark acne scar to hardly noticeable... love the product</li>
    </ol>

            <li> From Dark acne scar to hardly noticeable... love the product</li>
            <li> cause this guy is getting  rich on false hopes,  </li>
            <li> Its Too small didn&#x27;t see much improvement.</li>
            <li> This product will not remove dark spots or anything in your face do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> The dark spots are still there, and I don&#x27;t know if anything would completely remove them.  </li>
            <li> my face after minutes of wearing the cream gets very greasy and i&#x27;m not sure why</li>
            <li> i have several scars and it is getting lighter but is taking a long time to dissappear.</li>
            <li> my daughter said that this helps her clear her acne scars (black marks) somewhat.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I&#x27;ve been suffering from acne for several years and it has left dark spots.</li>
            <li> Also, I have had dark circles under my eyes for as long as I can remember, and this has definitely helped to lighten them as well!</li>
            <li> I think if you use this daily and put a but extra on any discolorations it would work in a few months.  </li>
            <li> ( 2) : Put it under hot water for approximately 35 seconds&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li> but it only lightened my under eye circles a little-</li>
            <li> Hope it works better than it smells; at least it wa not too expensive.</li>
            <li> this takes tooooooo long to show effect, however doesn&#x27;t seems like its working to the effect ERASE dark hyperpigmentation on skin, need something quicker</li>
            <li> A partial list of the ingredients are: aloe vera, wheat germ oil, citrus rinds.</li>
            <li> It says to use it three times a day, with a little extra on dark spots.  </li>
            <li> so I would not exactly recommend it .</li>
            <li> In any case, I am still using this product, which by now I was have already tossed into the pile of other products that were of no use.</li>
            <li> I will look for other type.</li>
            <li> and this is a miracle not more red skin</li>
            <li> I bought this to get rid of a couple of dark spots on my cheek.</li>
            <li> Will not buy again not worth it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in the dark spot on my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> I bought this is reduce dark marks from acne breakouts.</li>
            <li> I also use under the eyes for dark circles and it has helped to lighten the skin there too.</li>
            <li> I bought this for dark spots.</li>
            <li> maybe starting to see brightening of complexion effects but slowly gradually it brightens a lighter color</li>
            <li> I am a caramel complexion black woman and I orginally purchased this to use for my under eye dark circles.</li>
            <li> I have used it twice per day for almost a month and half a tube is gone now, nothing had changed.</li>
            <li> I notice the change on my skin in less than a week, the marks began disappearing.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that I have less acne as well</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re having serious skin problems, do NOT go to a dermatologist &amp; get some phony $250.00 acne cream, when you can simply go on amazon type in eraser cream &amp; get this for around 8 bucks!</li>
            <li> I had a tattoo removed and my skin was still a little dark in the area.</li>
            <li> It works for me though it is little bit slower by depending on the type of my skin as I guess.</li>
            <li> A little oily.</li>
            <li> little goes a looooong way also.</li>
            <li> i suffered and its not worth it !</li>
            <li> , they HAD birth marks on them that looked like little butterflies.</li>
            <li> ( 4) : Apply a little dab of cream all around the area in need of Ayurvedic .&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is heavy.....</li>
            <li> I can see an improvement within a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> It arrived without the aluminum cover and seems to have been tampered with, as the &amp;#34;non-oily&amp;#34; mixture feels like heavy vaseline on my face and causes sweating for hours.</li>
            <li> waste of time .</li>
            <li> ( 1) : Put a clean wash rag into COLD water for approximately 55 seconds&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li> but at least it was inexpensive compared  to the other products I&#x27;ve tried that were also ineffective...</li>
            <li> I like it, and it is not strong like a muscle-rub.  </li>
            <li> The few bumps I get now are usually because I go picking or squeezing at a pore that looks clogged</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure it is even doing anything  </li>
            <li> Perhaps petroleum, I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it will do anything, however, do not care for the smell of the product.  </li>
            <li> I continue to use it when I do have a small breakout as it heals.</li>
            <li> I have found very few things that work as well for the money</li>
            <li> for year when  the cold starts my skin becomes red and scaly i ll alway use hidrocortisone  but never work  .....</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I bought it for dark under eye circles and, like everything else I&#x27;ve tried, it didn&#x27;t work for that.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any change with this cream at all no good as it said....</li>
            <li> While ingredients listed are natural base oil for product is not listed .  </li>
            <li> this is on one of my secret beauty weapons list</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the product Eraser.</li>
            <li> It heals perfectly no scars or marks.</li>
            <li> it got some of the mark of my face but is not that bad</li>
            <li> Does not smell bad and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with the product.</li>
            <li> Just horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any results from this. Nothing more than a moisture cream, I say.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I&#x27;ve been suffering from acne for several years and it has left dark spots. So far, this has worked very well at lightening the spots so that when I put makeup on the spots can now be covered. Also, I have had dark circles under my eyes for as long as I can remember, and this has definitely helped to lighten them as well!</li>
            <li> I have to keep using this to see if it will clear up the mark on my leg.  Hope that it works trying to avoid going to the derm office for laser treatment.</li>
            <li> Not seeing any lightening under my eyes, however it is a really good moisturizer.  I so hoped it would lighten my under eye area.</li>
            <li> just go in your garbage can and you will find the same thing  .... ..  just a another piece of garbage  .. moral  of the story just save your money  cause this guy is getting  rich on false hopes,  cause  most wont take the time to get $  back not worth their time  so the seller wins...</li>
            <li> this is an amazing products the skin cream on your skin makes you feel perfect it comes on so smooth and it smells good this is perfect for scars in anybody who has horrible acne blemishesall I can say is that I&#x27;m a client for life this is on one of my secret beauty weapons list</li>
            <li> This cream really works,and it goes on smoothly,so there is no mess! I really wish that I had bought it sooner</li>
            <li> satisfied with the cream, works great and seems to not cause any irritations. suggested to few friends, they also seem to be satisfied with the cream.</li>
            <li> I am a caramel complexion black woman and I orginally purchased this to use for my under eye dark circles. After 2 weeks of using it just  on my eyes and not really seeing a change I started using it on my entire face and neck twice a day everyday and I LOVE IT. I&#x27;ve seen a great change in my tone evening out but it only lightened my under eye circles a little- i still have to wear concealer EVERY day. BUT id say, for the way it&#x27;s helped my complexion and improved my skin is much more supple -at this price im DEFINITELY going to continue to use it if for nothing else as a moisturizer. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> Smell is very strong but I&#x27;m not sure it is even doing anything  so I would not exactly recommend it .</li>
            <li> While ingredients listed are natural base oil for product is not listed .  It is heavy.....Perhaps petroleum, I&#x27;m not sure.Either way it should be identified for consumer.</li>
            <li> I bought this to get rid of a couple of dark spots on my cheek. I have used it twice per day for almost a month and half a tube is gone now, nothing had changed. Two stars is to day it didn&#x27;t cause any irritation. I noticed this product is made in India.</li>
            <li> I had a scar that stayed irritated and red for several years. The scar was raised and itched constantly. After using Eraser, the constant itching stopped and the irritation went away. You can still see where it was, but it is no longer rasied and red as before. LOVED IT!</li>
            <li> Its Too small didn&#x27;t see much improvement. But smells good I guess it OK. Will not buy again not worth it.</li>
            <li> it do not work not at all i wish i did not even buy it i could have saved my money</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know is giving reviews about this product but it doesn&#x27;t work at all. This product will not remove dark spots or anything in your face do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> This product was an absolute waste of money, if you have acne scars do not under any circumstances buy this product thinking that they will go away because they SURELY won&#x27;t !</li>
            <li> is okay it got some of the mark of my face but is not that bad for it pice will or might buy it again but not a big fan about it</li>
            <li> I had a procedure that has some scarring.  I can see an improvement within a few weeks.  I will come to use the product.  Hopefully they will disappear completely.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for 8 months now for my acne scars WOW it works amazing.... Patient is the key and apply it as often works in two weeks or three weeks for me.... From Dark acne scar to hardly noticeable... love the product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d probably have to give this a longer trial.  I think if you use this daily and put a but extra on any discolorations it would work in a few months.  The base smells good and the cream is nice, even if you don&#x27;t care about erasing anything.  Give it a try.  No chemicals.  It&#x27;s a natural remedy.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with the product. It arrived without the aluminum cover and seems to have been tampered with, as the &amp;#34;non-oily&amp;#34; mixture feels like heavy vaseline on my face and causes sweating for hours. It is an off-yellow color, not off-white, and smells a bit rancid. Just horrible.</li>
            <li> maybe starting to see brightening of complexion effects but slowly gradually it brightens a lighter color this takes tooooooo long to show effect, however doesn&#x27;t seems like its working to the effect ERASE dark hyperpigmentation on skin, need something quicker hopefully theres more products out there with quicker results!!!!</li>
            <li> This product gave me skin allergy,i started to develop a lot of pimples on my fave so I had to discontinue to use this cream.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great for me on scars, redness and bumps.  I have used so many products and this is the best I&#x27;ve come across.  I love that it&#x27;s all natural too because i don&#x27;t like using chemicals on my skin.  I use it every day and it makes my skin look awesome.  I am so glad I found this product!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Excellent service!!</li>
            <li> This product does not remove any thing.  You may have to use it for months before you see any results.  I would not recommend it to anyone.  The only thing is it moisturizes your skin.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s working I think ? Lol it&#x27;s Pretty Cheap as well I&#x27;m Impressed.!!  If I see more improvement I&#x27;m for sure buying more of these.!(&#x3D;</li>
            <li> my friend love this product and she want me to order again when she run out..i want to try it too.</li>
            <li> I have been using it every day. I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in the dark spot on my face and neck.  It is fine as a moisturizer but probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I tried this skin cream because of the natural (Ayurvedic) qualities on my sun spots.  This cream did not help me, but it helps my mom with her sun spots.  I believe I am too sensitive for many face products. My hunt will continue...</li>
            <li> This cream can be used all over the face, including under the eyes. I loved the natural smell of turmeric. It is a good cream for moisturizing. There&#x27;s a promise to remove spots and marks, so I can&#x27;t tell the results immediately. In my experience this cream is not greasy and it smells very natural.</li>
            <li> my daughter said that this helps her clear her acne scars (black marks) somewhat. it didnt make her break out and she has senstive skin. it didnt irritate her skin ither.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t find the product to work on me. I bought it to use on old acne scarring, it&#x27;s soft and non greasy and I found that it does heal scabs on cuts, but not for scars.</li>
            <li> This is very good product for removing dark spots on our skin that  I ever had in my life. It works for me though it is little bit slower by depending on the type of my skin as I guess. Seems it is matching for any type of skin, especially using for face. I am willing to keep using and will buy the product again from this seller!!!!</li>
            <li> I would recommend it! It does show you results after like 2 days of usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But you have to be consistent with application. A little oily. Smells is distinctive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a looooong way also.</li>
            <li> I have found very few things that work as well for the money and i don&#x27;t mind the smell, it&#x27;s also a wonderful over all moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other removers for my dark skin spots and this one works the best.  I also like that it does not have chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> This does lighten age spots.  Unfortunately, I bought it for dark under eye circles and, like everything else I&#x27;ve tried, it didn&#x27;t work for that.  I might keep buying this just for the age spots, though.  The price is right.</li>
            <li> Ayurvedic medicine (also called Ayurveda) is one of the world&#x27;s oldest medical systems. It originated in India and has evolved there over thousands of years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said... the short version:&lt;br /&gt;1.  I have only used this a short time, but I do see improvement.&lt;br /&gt;2.  There is an herbal fragrance...not strong, and dispersed quickly. I like it.&lt;br /&gt;3.  The price is so good, it&#x27;s worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;4.  I ordered a second tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Longer version:  I am 67 years old and have age/sun spots on my shins from too much sun as a teen.  I looked at several much more expensive and glamorous spot lightening creams on Amazon, but decided to try this due to its very reasonable price and the good reviews.  It is all herbal, and the packaging shows that it is geared to Asian/Indian women (I am Caucasian). It is made in India.  The package also indicates it can be used to lighten facial and under-eye skin as well as stretch marks.  Although I am using it on my legs, it seems to be non-irritating and could be used on most skin.  It says to use it three times a day, with a little extra on dark spots.  It is also a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for about a week - my skin looks more even.  The dark spots are still there, and I don&#x27;t know if anything would completely remove them.  They seem a bit lighter, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is an herbal smell...kind of \\&quot;new-age\\&quot; or aroma therapy style.  I like it, and it is not strong like a muscle-rub.  It does not linger.  I did order a second tube, so that I can continue to use it over time.</li>
            <li> waste of time . this thing is so smelly , my scar is on my face so i could smell it ... i suffered and its not worth it !</li>
            <li> This worked for me. I use it 2-3 times a week. It has gotten rid of any new scar like cuts, spots, marks, etc. on  and near my face. I dab it on and leave it. Its whitish creamy in color. Does not smell bad and is not greasy. The ingredients are natural.  A partial list of the ingredients are: aloe vera, wheat germ oil, citrus rinds.</li>
            <li> I purchased this produced since i noticed in a lot of reviews it was helping people, but it did not help me at all. It actually made me break out more which I found odd. So I definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend this if you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> the cream seems to work. i have several scars and it is getting lighter but is taking a long time to dissappear. my face after minutes of wearing the cream gets very greasy and i&#x27;m not sure why</li>
            <li> Have just started using this on some age or maturity(smile) spots.  Not sure if it will do anything, however, do not care for the smell of the product.  Hope it works better than it smells; at least it wa not too expensive.</li>
            <li> I bought this is reduce dark marks from acne breakouts. I had them on cheeks, chin, and forehead. It made some type of foundation a must. I&#x27;ve used this product for about six weeks now and my overall complexion is brighter and the cheeks are especially clear. I usually do a double take in the mirror to see how far my skin has come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had experienced bad breakouts for some time and have really made some strides this year by cleaning up my diet. I found chocolate to absolutely do me in with acne. For me, it is a trigger. The few bumps I get now are usually because I go picking or squeezing at a pore that looks clogged or when I try to sneak in something with chocolate, like have ovaltine or hot cocoa. In any case, I am still using this product, which by now I was have already tossed into the pile of other products that were of no use. I continue to use it when I do have a small breakout as it heals. I also use under the eyes for dark circles and it has helped to lighten the skin there too. Also, I do not notice any skin bleaching or anything like that. I am just really happy with this product. Did not break me out or get a rash.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the product Eraser. Once received and I began using it. I notice the change on my skin in less than a week, the marks began disappearing. I am on week three now and I am amazed at the results.. All the over the counter creams are a joke compared to this. This product is exactly what it says it is an eraser. This product does exactly what it said and my skin is looking better and better.everyday.. I&#x27;m impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> first of allove with this product! I&#x27;ve had a scar on my cheek for the longest time, since I was a kid. first of all I got my cream earlier then expected and i just put some on, all I can say is wow! the scar is already fading. This stuff is amazing ðŸ™Œ</li>
            <li> I am a model and I have always been conscious about my things, they HAD birth marks on them that looked like little butterflies. After 2 days of using the cream I saw them lighten and after a week 2x a day I no longer use it on that part of my body, it seems to really erase the marks so that you don&#x27;t have to use it forever.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if its working or not.  Smells good though and all very organic so I guess for the price it&#x27;s alright.</li>
            <li> I use this product to lighten my blackheads and I noticed them gradually getting lighter and only used it for 3 weeks! My daughter told me last night that my face was clearing up. I also noticed that I have less acne as well and it is so affordable. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Bought this product to help blend my skin tone. I had a tattoo removed and my skin was still a little dark in the area. Used product 2-3 times a day and saw no difference.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work...but at least it was inexpensive compared  to the other products I&#x27;ve tried that were also ineffective...but at a much higher price.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my scars from scrapes and scratches because of my cat. It heals perfectly no scars or marks.</li>
            <li> I used it everyday on a scar for a good month now. The scar doesn&#x27;t appear any lighter. I think I will get a bleaching cream instead.</li>
            <li> Out of all my years of using acne creams, NONE of them shows the amount of results as much as the eraser, I have went from proactiv to x-out to nadinola &amp; none of them showed more than partial of a removal of this cystic acne... My face has NEVER looked any better than this. If you&#x27;re having serious skin problems, do NOT go to a dermatologist &amp; get some phony $250.00 acne cream, when you can simply go on amazon type in eraser cream &amp; get this for around 8 bucks! But, I am NOT speaking for anyone else. I am an African American woman &amp; i had simple steps to complete for satisfying results!&lt;br /&gt;Step (1) : Get a clean wash rag&lt;br /&gt;Step ( 2) : Put it under hot water for approximately 35 seconds&lt;br /&gt;Step ( 3) : Wipe any substance from the presumed area&lt;br /&gt;Step ( 4) : Apply a little dab of cream all around the area in need of Ayurvedic .&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re Caucasian, Hispanic or Native,&lt;br /&gt;Step ( 1) : Put a clean wash rag into COLD water for approximately 55 seconds&lt;br /&gt;Step ( 2) : Througly apply a eraser Ayurvedic mask around the presumed and infected area.&lt;br /&gt;Step  ( 3 ) : After applying the full mask onto the area in need of this cream, wait for 25 mins &amp; thoroughly wash your face with hot water for 17 seconds. &amp; if you&#x27;re wondering how I know all this math &amp; stuff. I&#x27;m a nurse practitioner, got my masters degree as well as my bachelors degree &amp; studied pretty much EVERYTHING there&#x27;s to know about one of the oldest medicines on this planet ( Ayurvedic ) &amp;&#x27;how much seconds it would take... I will follow up on an upgrade in 2 weeks. Peace ! Lol</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s alright, if you stop using it, the blemishes and scars start to become noticeable again, but fantastic for the price. cheaper than retinol.</li>
            <li> Yuck...stank....and didn&#x27;t work....period.  Wouldn&#x27;t do this one again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for dark spots. It came without the aluminium cover at the tip of the ointment tube. Lost interest in it and threw it away. Since it came uncovered,  I doubted if the cream was authentic.</li>
            <li> No improvement as of yet, been 3 weeks but I will continue</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any change with this cream at all no good as it said.... I will look for other type.</li>
            <li> for year when  the cold starts my skin becomes red and scaly i ll alway use hidrocortisone  but never work  .....so i orde this cream ayurvedic  and this is a miracle not more red skin my face is nice on soft and smooth i highly recommend it and for six dollar :)</li>
            <li> Product is very good for any kind of mild acne or skin blemishes.....the ayurvedic formula contains a blend of herbs that is non toxic and promotes healthy skin.</li>
