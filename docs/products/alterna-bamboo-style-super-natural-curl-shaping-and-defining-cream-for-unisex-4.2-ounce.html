            <li>product was exactly what I was looking for ..&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>this product is fantastic for my naturally curly/frizzy hair.  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a nice smell but a little too parfumy for my taste.</li>
            <li>This product works really well.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>Works very well for keeping hair curly and not frizzy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this styling cream twice so far, but I think it will end up being a favorite.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy on my hair and it helps my curls!!</li>
            <li>so I added a little more the results were no crunchy feeling and no unruly hair.</li>
            <li>I personally think they are worth every cent I spend on them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on the look out for a new product I can count on.</li>

            <li>Super Natural Curl Shaping and Defining Cream worked just as I had expected.  </li>
            <li>But, I wanted a product I could put in hair after being washed and it would give me soft, gentle lasting curls without frizz.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>The search continues for a natural hair product that gives oomph to my curls.</li>
            <li>It holds pretty well to start but by the end of the day I&#x27;m a fluff ball.</li>
            <li>I have natural curly hair that is at times unruly and tends to frizz especially in the summer</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t really care for is that when it dries it makes your hair look a little dull Other than that its good.</li>
            <li>The pump is ridiculous if you have a full head of curly hair.</li>

            <li> have curly hair and this product helps keep my hair looking soft and tame !</li>
            <li> Is the hole the product comes out of supposed to be so tiny that it takes 50 pumps to get enough for my long, thick hair?  </li>
            <li> With this product I use 10 to 11 squirts into my palm, rub onto both my hands and then rub thoroughly through my wet hair trying to get underneath to all hairs.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, long, naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> I used about 5 dime size amount and ran through my hair and let air dry depending on how long you hair is mine is a little past my shoulders</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the size of the bottle for the price</li>

            <li> Use at your roots then go down your hair</li>
            <li> A little sticky, but it does wonders for my frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> It almost feels like it has a little serum in and helps with shine.</li>
            <li> Bought this for me but, thought it was a little to sticky feeling.  </li>
            <li> but it was a little too heavy</li>
            <li> I have long thin hair that likes to frizz out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> As usual, I find myself regretting buying a hair product.</li>
            <li> It was hard to find a product that worked that didn&#x27;t have phthalates, etc, but this one does the trick.</li>
            <li> Humidity struck my hair hard and boy did it frizz.  </li>

            <li> Nice smell. A little sticky, but it does wonders for my frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> It was hard to find a product that worked that didn&#x27;t have phthalates, etc, but this one does the trick. It does a good job of making my curls sleek without being crunchy. I also like that the bottle is quite big compared to the amount that I use, it will last a long time. I use 5 squirts of it after I wash my hair (my hair is to the bottom of my shoulder blades).</li>
            <li> This product works really well. The only thing I don&#x27;t really care for is that when it dries it makes your hair look a little dull Other than that its good.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much for my hair</li>
            <li> I absolutely love using this product!  It&#x27;s not heavy on my hair and it helps my curls!! I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product.  I had been using Alterna Texturizing Cream for years and then they discontinued it.  I have naturally curly hair that gets frizzy after it is wet.  I liked the Texturing Cream but it was a little too heavy and I had to use a lot of it to get rid of the frizz.  With this product I use 10 to 11 squirts into my palm, rub onto both my hands and then rub thoroughly through my wet hair trying to get underneath to all hairs.  My hair has a lighter, not so weighted down look without any frizz.  I am happy with how my hair looks.  My only complaint is the size of the bottle for the price and I wish the pump had a longer spout.</li>
            <li> I have frizzy hair and this turns the frizz into soft curls!  It has a soft pleasant smell send a little but if gel goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair.  But, I wanted a product I could put in hair after being washed and it would give me soft, gentle lasting curls without frizz.  It didn&#x27;t deliver the softness I wanted and the curls didn&#x27;t last.  Humidity struck my hair hard and boy did it frizz.  I&#x27;m back to trying some more products.  Sigh.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s perfect for my long, thick and wavy hair. It helps keep the frizz down.</li>
            <li> I used this once after getting out of the shower. I went to bed hoping I would wake up with bouncier, more shiny curls, but there was not difference. My hair may have even been less curly than normal. As usual, I find myself regretting buying a hair product. The search continues for a natural hair product that gives oomph to my curls.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my long fine, curly hair. I apply to damp hair and use a dryer with a diffuser to get the extra dampness out. Hair comes out great every time.</li>
            <li> Love this cream ~ my hair is finally enjoying life w/out crunch.  So happy it&#x27;s on the market and will purchase more.  Use at your roots then go down your hair and you will be pleased when it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> Love this item.  Was purchasing from my local beauty supply but Amazon had a better deal.</li>

            <li> My daughter recommended this to me and I really like it.  It is a good product!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  The cream gives my wavy hair just the right amount of control and it helps with the frizz.  Arrived right on time.</li>
            <li> Alterna Bamboo Style Super Natural Curl Shaping and Defining Cream worked just as I had expected.  The clean and crisp smell made the prdocut choice even better.</li>
            <li> Give great hold without grease or heaviness.  It lasts all day. What more can you say about it? It works</li>
            <li> Sticky and smells funny.</li>
            <li> Loved this product!  It is mind-boggling to me with the ratings why Alterna would discontinue making.  Raise the price if you aren&#x27;t making enough money on it, I would have paid more!!!</li>
            <li> I use many Alterna hair products though they are a little expensive I personally think they are worth every cent I spend on them. I have natural curly hair that is at times unruly and tends to frizz especially in the summer I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair often but every now and than I use a flat iron .I decided to give this product a try I rated this 5 stars because it did control the frizz ,is light weight gave my curls definition with a nice hold and smooth finish. This product is a light weight cream with organic Bamboo&amp;blue Yucca root .Free of Parabens,Gluten.Sodium Chloride. Phthalates,Synthetic Color Mineral oil,Petrolatum and Paba. goes on smooth I used about 5 dime size amount and ran through my hair and let air dry depending on how long you hair is mine is a little past my shoulders so I added a little more the results were no crunchy feeling and no unruly hair. This should last a few months depending how much you use.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I&#x27;ve been using alterna for hair cream for years and it&#x27;s the only stuff I&#x27;ve used that is amazing, smells good, and makes my hair perfect every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can sleep with curly hair and it still looks ok the next morning.</li>
            <li> The pump is ridiculous if you have a full head of curly hair. I ended up just taking the top off. It&#x27;s a nice smell but a little too parfumy for my taste. It holds pretty well to start but by the end of the day I&#x27;m a fluff ball. The old Alterna curl define in the pink bottle was the best. I&#x27;m so bummed they discontinued it (again). I&#x27;m still on the look out for a new product I can count on.</li>
            <li> If you are a &amp;#34;hair product junkie&amp;#34; like me, this is worth a try. I&#x27;ve only used this styling cream twice so far, but I think it will end up being a favorite. I have very thick, long, naturally curly hair. This cream is enough to give my curls the little bit of weight needed to eliminate  &amp;#34;fly aways&amp;#34; yet it is not heavy on my hair. It almost feels like it has a little serum in and helps with shine. I like the definition it adds to my curls, and I think it helps with frizz somewhat - although we all no NOTHING takes all the frizz away.</li>
            <li> It defined my hair and helped to de-frizz,and I have THICK Long Hair,I Love All of Alterna Bamboo Products Now!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  I switched to it after Alterna discontinued it&#x27;s hemp texturizing glaze,  which I had used for years.  This cream is better!  It&#x27;s light and it defines the waves in my hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this for me but, thought it was a little to sticky feeling.  My daughter tried it and didn&#x27;t have the stickyness.  She&#x27;ll use it.</li>
            <li> To all those who responded to my concerns I send a huge thank you !&lt;br /&gt;This product was exactly what I was looking for ..&lt;br /&gt;I have curly hair and this product helps keep my hair looking soft and tame !&lt;br /&gt;I have also used Sebastian Whipped Creme but Alterna bamboo is the best !</li>
            <li> I love this cream, I have a natural curly hair and this product really works:)</li>
            <li> It works great and my hair looks good with only one product.. Still flyaways not quite solved as promissed.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise very good high quality product</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold the curls or maintain frizz.</li>
            <li> I like the product and my hairdresser uses it.  Is the hole the product comes out of supposed to be so tiny that it takes 50 pumps to get enough for my long, thick hair?  Its not like I want to get carpal tunnel every time I do my hair.  Or did I get a defective bottle?  I suppose I could just open the bottle and dump the goop out, but that sort of defeats the purpose for the price.</li>
            <li> Works very well for keeping hair curly and not frizzy</li>
            <li> sent it to my sister in Europe SE ask for it and loved it,i wish i  have sent it street ,</li>
            <li> I love this product and got a much better price here than in the beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> Great for curly hair if you want a soft hold and extra shine.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the product. It does exactly what it claims to do!  Defines curls and amplifies them.</li>
            <li> this product is fantastic for my naturally curly/frizzy hair.  it tames the frizz without being oily or stiff and leaves my hair soft.</li>
