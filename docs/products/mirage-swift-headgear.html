    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Excellent quality.</li>
            <li>The Mirage Swift is the best headgear I&#x27;ve seen yet.</li>
            <li>Great</li>
            <li>It was a great relief to find this as I didn&#x27;t want to pay for a doctor&#x27;s visit and doctor&#x27;s prices.</li>
            <li>I am happy it has replacements.</li>
            <li>None are truly great, but I fall asleep and stay asleep with this headgear.</li>
            <li>This Mirage Swift Headgear fits good.</li>
            <li>I bought this spare because the original was pratically destroyed after 3 years of use, but the mask is excellent.</li>
            <li>This replacement unit is exactly perfect and matched the old headset.</li>
            <li>Just as good as the original and way cheaper replacement without all of the doctor&#x27;s office overhead costs tacked on</li>
            <li>Delivery was good and product came in perfect shape, carefully packed and shipped with no problems.</li>
            <li>But glad we can get accessories on here.  </li>
            <li>It fit perfectly and now i&#x27;m back up and running without leaks.</li>
            <li>This product came in a new brand new fashion and all the detail were perfect.</li>
            <li>Worked perfectly to replace my previous one which began the fray.</li>
            <li>Comfortable headgear for CPAP nasal pillows, flexible and easy to adjust for correct fit.</li>
            <li>This works fine and is like the original that came with my machine.  </li>
            <li>This is an original replacement that came with my cpap.  </li>
            <li>Now my c-pap mask is a good as new, and stays nice and tight around my dome.</li>
            <li>Very reasonable and good delivery (timely) product was easy to integrate into the existing cpap system and is made of high quality and standard that I expect</li>
            <li>The rest of the mask is fine and really didnt need to be replaced.  </li>
            <li>The whole science of these machines and straps still has a way to go to make them comfortable, but this is state-of-the-art at the moment.</li>
            <li>I find that this headgear fits very well, is light weight and durable.  </li>
            <li>It was worth my time alone to just order the part here and have it shipped to me.</li>
            <li>Superior to plastic headgear supplied by other manufacturers.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>This headgear was an exact replacement for my existing but warn out gear.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed for a stomach/side sleeper.  </li>
            <li>Was happy with the quality I did not know it would be as new and firm as it was.</li>
            <li>The product was the right size and the product came in a fast delivery time.</li>
            <li>story short, the new headgear was priced right &amp; is comfortable to wear all night.</li>
            <li>You really need to replace the headgear after a while as it stretches out and starts to fall apart</li>
            <li>The headgear was as advertised and it was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Also liked the fact I could get this online versus having to see my doctor and get a prescription as in the past.</li>
            <li>The shipping was extreamly fast and my mask now works like new again.</li>
            <li>My philosophy is \\&quot;Why buy a whole new car when all you need to replace is the radio?\\</li>
            <li>After replacing this i&#x27;m back to getting uninterrupted sleep and feeling a lot better.</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor - order this every year or two when your old headgear starts to stretch out!!</li>
            <li>Head gear came in the factory packaging, brand new.  </li>
            <li>Got this to replace my old one that had shredded after a couple years.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment-I expect it to last for years.</li>
            <li>after wearing it a couple of nights I realized that my older headgear was too stretched out after years of use.&lt;br /&gt;Long</li>
            <li>I kept my old headset for about 5 years, and over time it simply shredded.</li>
            <li>The only drawback is that they only last about a year before the neoprene start to show some wear and are ready to be replaced after two years.</li>
            <li>After a while, my headgear had worn down pretty bad, but the rest of my c-pap mask we still in great shape.  </li>
            <li>Great quality and much less expensive than purchasing thru the doctor&#x27;s recommendation.</li>

            <li> This headgear was an exact replacement for my existing but warn out gear.  The shipping was extreamly fast and my mask now works like new again.</li>
            <li> Was happy with the quality I did not know it would be as new and firm as it was. Great</li>
            <li> After a while, my headgear had worn down pretty bad, but the rest of my c-pap mask we still in great shape.  My philosophy is \\&quot;Why buy a whole new car when all you need to replace is the radio?\\&quot;  So I did the sensible thing and just replaced the headgear.  Now my c-pap mask is a good as new, and stays nice and tight around my dome.</li>
            <li> Got this to replace my old one that had shredded after a couple years. Delivery was good and product came in perfect shape, carefully packed and shipped with no problems. It fit perfectly and now i&#x27;m back up and running without leaks. You really need to replace the headgear after a while as it stretches out and starts to fall apart and then the nose piece is not being held tightly to your face and when you get leaks then the CPAP is not functioning and you wake up a lot. After replacing this i&#x27;m back to getting uninterrupted sleep and feeling a lot better. Do yourself a favor - order this every year or two when your old headgear starts to stretch out!!</li>
            <li> Great quality and much less expensive than purchasing thru the doctor&#x27;s recommendation. Fast shipment-I expect it to last for years.</li>
            <li> Comfortable headgear for CPAP nasal pillows, flexible and easy to adjust for correct fit. Superior to plastic headgear supplied by other manufacturers. Somewhat pricey, but comfort and ease of use justify the cost.</li>
            <li> This Mirage Swift Headgear fits good. The headgear was as advertised and it was reasonably priced. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> But glad we can get accessories on here.  Cheaper then the CPAP distributors who rely on insurance and now with Obamacare prices are sky rocketing.</li>
            <li> I kept my old headset for about 5 years, and over time it simply shredded. This replacement unit is exactly perfect and matched the old headset. It was a great relief to find this as I didn&#x27;t want to pay for a doctor&#x27;s visit and doctor&#x27;s prices.</li>
            <li> Needed to replace the headgear for my CPAP mask.  The rest of the mask is fine and really didnt need to be replaced.  Save a few dollars and just replace the worn out part.  Head gear came in the factory packaging, brand new.  Also cheaper than going to the DME (durable medical equipment)store and have to get a perscription from the DR and file the insurance, then pay the co-pay, etc.  It was worth my time alone to just order the part here and have it shipped to me.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed for a stomach/side sleeper.  This allows my mouth to be closer to the pillow without having to worry about the tube.  The tube comes out at the side instead of the front.</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly to replace my previous one which began the fray. Also liked the fact I could get this online versus having to see my doctor and get a prescription as in the past.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the original and way cheaper replacement without all of the doctor&#x27;s office overhead costs tacked on</li>
            <li> No point in overspending for a simple headset.  This works fine and is like the original that came with my machine.  The whole science of these machines and straps still has a way to go to make them comfortable, but this is state-of-the-art at the moment.</li>
            <li> There are not many options for replacement parts for a CPAP so you are very limited in choice.  I find that this headgear fits very well, is light weight and durable.  The only drawback is that they only last about a year before the neoprene start to show some wear and are ready to be replaced after two years.</li>
