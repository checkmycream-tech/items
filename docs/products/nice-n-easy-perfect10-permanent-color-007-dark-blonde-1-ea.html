    <ol>
            <li>the Perfect10 line is the BEST!  </li>
            <li>AND THE BEST ITS THAT</li>
            <li>ITS A GREAT PRODUCT BEAUTIFULL COLOR WITH GREAT QUALITY</li>
            <li>I like the 10 minute timing and it worked great for my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair feels great after using this and it is good for covering grays.  </li>
            <li>Great easy way to color !</li>
            <li>Always works perfectly in 10 minutes and covers gray completely.  </li>
            <li>is the best by far.</li>
            <li>the gentleness is very important to me.  </li>
            <li>What more could a person want?</li>
            <li>please don&#x27;t discontinue this one Clairol :-)</li>
            <li>I LOVE the conditioner that comes with the color, wish I could buy it separately.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>WILL BE PURCHASING MORE AND MORE................</li>
            <li>I have tried several brands and Perfect 10.</li>
            <li>the perfect 10 line of color is back!</li>
            <li>I love the results.</li>
            <li>However, I LOVE the dye... always does a fantastic job.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine textured hair that is easily damaged so</li>
            <li>Great color in only 10 minutes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Perfect 10 for several years and have no plans to go back to anything else.</li>
            <li>The application is super easy and fast.</li>
            <li>The Nice N Easy color I used caused my hair to dry out &amp; become very brittle</li>
            <li>I like this product because the color is rich and the process is fast.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny how the right hair color can make all the difference to your skin tone.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the hair color I received was possibly old or what, but I have never used hair color that has smelled so insanely strong before.</li>
            <li>The color was pretty &amp;#34;blah&amp;#34; too.</li>
            <li>The one and only problem has been that the colors I like the most are discontinued too soon</li>
            <li>This really did it!  </li>
            <li>I love that this takes only a 10-minute timing period.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for quite a few years and it is easy to use with true color results!</li>
            <li>Fast service.</li>
            <li>This is a great haircoloring kit and I am not able to find these in stores anymore, especially in my shade.</li>
            <li>I have naturally dark ashy blonde hair that&#x27;s been sun bleached to a very light blonde at the ends, with some grays up top as well.  </li>
            <li>It was his original natural color when he was younger.</li>
            <li>The color is much better and longer lasting than other brands I have used.  </li>
            <li>I have used this brand &amp; color for several years and was very concerned when it disappeared from the store shelves in my area.  </li>
            <li>Fast is important not just because of the convenience but because (if you need to color frequently to cover grays) less time processing seems to cause less damage to the hair.  </li>
            <li>Loses one star because even though it is the best I&#x27;ve found it is still not perfect</li>
            <li>It is also much gentler on my hair because it works in half the time.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> It is also much gentler on my hair because it works in half the time.  </li>
            <li> My skin is a little ruddy and tired looking but after coloring my hair, my skin looks entirely different and my eyes are more noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Clairol products for a long time...</li>
            <li> Will continue to get as long as they carry.</li>
            <li> which was alarming.  </li>
            <li> Need to use a little longer than 10 min for grey.  </li>
            <li> My hair felt straw like &amp; was hard to comb.</li>
            <li> I wanted to darken my washed out blonde locks and give a little richer color to my ugly roots.  </li>
            <li> I hate the new bottles, the brushlike lid doesn&#x27;t tighten correctly on the bottle and it spills out.</li>
            <li> highlighted/permed my hair all in the past &amp; this by far was the worst.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t realized how horrible my complexion looked with the dull blonde hair until using this.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always difficult to find this shade in the store, so I bought it online.</li>
            <li> I will say that the badly sun bleached areas of my hair have a gray cast to them now</li>
            <li> I also hated how my hair felt afterwards.</li>

            <li> Always works perfectly in 10 minutes and covers gray completely.  What more could a person want?</li>
            <li> Did not cover gray roots at all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the hair color I received was possibly old or what, but I have never used hair color that has smelled so insanely strong before. I have bleached/colored/highlighted/permed my hair all in the past &amp; this by far was the worst. I also hated how my hair felt afterwards.My hair felt straw like &amp; was hard to comb. The color was pretty &amp;#34;blah&amp;#34; too. I recommend looking elsewhere for hair color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Clairol products for a long time...the Perfect10 line is the BEST!  The one and only problem has been that the colors I like the most are discontinued too soon and I have to find another one....please don&#x27;t discontinue this one Clairol :-)</li>
            <li> I hate the new bottles, the brushlike lid doesn&#x27;t tighten correctly on the bottle and it spills out. However, I LOVE the dye... always does a fantastic job.</li>
            <li> Somebody had me in mind when they shortened the time to leave the color on before jumping in the shower to rinse it out. I LOVE the conditioner that comes with the color, wish I could buy it separately.</li>
            <li> I have naturally dark ashy blonde hair that&#x27;s been sun bleached to a very light blonde at the ends, with some grays up top as well.  I wanted to darken my washed out blonde locks and give a little richer color to my ugly roots.  This really did it!  I hadn&#x27;t realized how horrible my complexion looked with the dull blonde hair until using this.  My skin is a little ruddy and tired looking but after coloring my hair, my skin looks entirely different and my eyes are more noticeable.  It&#x27;s funny how the right hair color can make all the difference to your skin tone.  I will say that the badly sun bleached areas of my hair have a gray cast to them now but that&#x27;s ok.  After a while of using the same color, it will all look the same in time.</li>
            <li> Actually, I buy this color for my husband. It was his original natural color when he was younger. The application is super easy and fast. It&#x27;s always difficult to find this shade in the store, so I bought it online.</li>
            <li> ITS A GREAT PRODUCT BEAUTIFULL COLOR WITH GREAT QUALITY&lt;br /&gt;I WILL BE PURCHASING MORE AND MORE................AND THE BEST ITS THAT IT DOESNT DAMAGE YOUR HAIR.!</li>
            <li> Great color in only 10 minutes</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if they are discontinuing but I cannot get at any of the stores where I used to buy it. I like the 10 minute timing and it worked great for my hair. Will continue to get as long as they carry.</li>
            <li> Need to use a little longer than 10 min for grey.  Loses one star because even though it is the best I&#x27;ve found it is still not perfect</li>
            <li> Fast service. Great easy way to color ! I have tried several brands and Perfect 10. is the best by far.</li>
            <li> This is the only way I can find this product in my area. I have been using this product for 3 years and did not want to change products. Some local stores carry the brand but not the color I needed.</li>
            <li> This is a great haircoloring kit and I am not able to find these in stores anymore, especially in my shade. (#7).  I love that this takes only a 10-minute timing period.  I hope never to have to go back to the 25-35 minute hair coloring brands!  My hair feels great after using this and it is good for covering grays.  I&#x27;ve been using Perfect 10 for several years and have no plans to go back to anything else.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand &amp; color for several years and was very concerned when it disappeared from the store shelves in my area.  The color is much better and longer lasting than other brands I have used.  It is also much gentler on my hair because it works in half the time.  I have baby fine textured hair that is easily damaged so the gentleness is very important to me.  For a time, I could not even find this on line or on the Clairol website so I used a different line 1 time.  The Nice N Easy color I used caused my hair to dry out &amp; become very brittle which was alarming.  Thank goodness the perfect 10 line of color is back!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for quite a few years and it is easy to use with true color results!</li>
            <li> I like this product because the color is rich and the process is fast.  Fast is important not just because of the convenience but because (if you need to color frequently to cover grays) less time processing seems to cause less damage to the hair.  I love the results.</li>
