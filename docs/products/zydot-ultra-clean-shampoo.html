            <li>Good luck people</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>It says on the box, \\&quot;for best results, use the day of test\\&quot;, I used it literally 2 hours before I took the test, and I still tested positive for Marijuana!</li>
            <li>Used it exactly how the box stated and the results where awesome.</li>
            <li>amazing product.  </li>
            <li>This product was received in excellent condition much quicker than anticipated.</li>
            <li>For the price, it honestly is a steal</li>
            <li>Thank you very much for this amazing product!</li>
            <li>Most of the time they sample the lower part of your leg if not there then armpit then the crown of your head.</li>
            <li>Showed cocaine at more than 5000 pg/</li>
            <li>Looked like many reviews were</li>
            <li>But wish it offered more in the packaging.</li>
            <li>so I bought two just to be safe.</li>
            <li>Found this item only purchased 5 boxes followed directions perfect.</li>
            <li>THANKS ZYDOT!!!!</li>
            <li>If you want to clean out THC from your hair DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the most success with this.</li>
            <li>My hair was free from chlorine and the like after using.</li>
            <li>I have 9 inches of hair to clean</li>
            <li>so I was clean for about 3.5 weeks before the test.</li>
            <li>There are sooooo many professional individuals out there, that are more than qualified for the positions they apply for, and they get denied or terminated, because they choose to smoke Marijuana rather than become an Alcoholic!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used Zydot Ultra clean the day of my hair test and it DID NOT WORK.</li>
            <li>At the end of the day, these kits don&#x27;t guarantee a clean result.</li>
            <li>You can guess why, I don&#x27;t really need to say much more than that.  </li>
            <li>If not then damage it as much as possible and hope for the best, last resort size up the person sampling it and bribe them if you think it will work</li>
            <li>If asked why you cant give hair on particular day say its not the required length and wait it out 90 days.. better than failing</li>
            <li>Great stuff, I was really worried about passing the drug test after only 16 days</li>
            <li>I did exactly what she said and followed the directions precisely</li>
            <li>followed exactly to directions and failed,had a clean comb avoided getting anything on or around me</li>
            <li>it was definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>I was told this product had a 99% success rate.  </li>
            <li>Thanks ZYDOT for a clean test result.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast and usage was extremely fast and easy.</li>
            <li>Also the days before you take it do not go around anything that will show up and for precaution buy a new shirt and put a clean bleached towel around your hair to protect it from any stray particles that could contaminated it, this could even be a pillow case, the head rest in your car</li>
            <li>It was about 5 weeks new growth also, so mostly naturally clean hair.</li>
            <li>I used clean towel and a new shirt.</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure my levels were pretty low and this product still didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I used 4 boxes of zydot in between 2 days just to be extra sure.</li>
            <li>I can only hope you have better results than me</li>
            <li>I can only hope you have better results than me</li>
            <li>Used about 5 times n never failed, but my sister in law did so idk with females for me</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>it worked for me - follow instructions exactly as it says.  </li>
            <li>Had recently used for my birthday and wasn&#x27;t sure if I would pass and a friend recommended it.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>With satisfaction guarenteed We should be able to get our money back, which probably isn&#x27;t going to happen.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s safe to say the only way to pass a hair test is to stop smoking a minimum of 3 months before.</li>
            <li>Also used zydot and followed the instructions exactly.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>I followed directions exactly using the longest times listed for leaving on hair.</li>
            <li>First box was used at 1am and test was at 11am.</li>
            <li>I followed instructions exactly.</li>
            <li>Sure enough, my Hair Follicle Test came back positive for Marijuana!!!</li>
            <li>Another thing, as long as its in your blood/body it is still depositing it inside the follicle you must be clean before you can grow a clean hair sample</li>
            <li>The family member still showed a positive result and put a lot of stress and damage to their hair &amp; scalp in the process.</li>
            <li>so I cannot be certain this made a difference but rated it 5-stars since I passed my test.</li>
            <li>I think it depends on your hair type as I have lots of fine blonde hair.</li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>but it fit my specific needs.</li>
            <li>Light smoker, quit 1 month prior to test</li>
            <li>and I was worried the whole time</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve used this product 3 times before and just got my results back today as clean.</li>
            <li>then it will take a week or two for the clean hair to grow form the root out to the skin, all hair is different</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve personally had Zydot Ultra Clean work for me.  </li>
            <li>I was told at the clinic, that if I didn&#x27;t hear from anyone within 48-72 hours than the results came back clean.</li>
            <li>I had taken the test on a Tuesday afternoon at 3:10PM, and I was told if I didn&#x27;t hear from anyone by Friday, then the test came back clean.</li>
            <li>Basically Ultra Clean just prolonged the inevitable!</li>
            <li>I took the Ultra Clean pill for the Urine Test, and apparently I drank to much water before the test, because the results came back, as a Diluted Sample, but I didn&#x27;t test positive for Marijuana.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;am a previous user of the Zydot product and if use correctly it does work, and the longer your hair the more packs you will need; I have about 4-5 inches of hair</li>
            <li>levels may have been low enough to be ok</li>
            <li>used in quite a while,actually quit using drugs prior.passed a piss test on my own but failed hair test.so you tell me ,wouldnt recommend this product,try something else if you need clean hair.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth noting that there was only 1 \\&quot;toxin\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Hopefully this third time ends in another success</li>
            <li>use new towels, hair brush, clothes and something to cover the headrest in  your car.  </li>
            <li>if you have short hair is to shave completely off and start fresh will not indulging in whatever substance.</li>
            <li>Ive been clean for a little over a month and am very nervous and pessimistic......</li>
            <li>Ive been clean for a little over a month and am very nervous and pessimistic......</li>
            <li>I was a pretty regular smoker (3-4 times a week)</li>
            <li>My system should have been positive for H (moderate user x1 month).</li>
            <li>Came back positive for THC and I stopped smoking 4 months before the test and did everything I could think of.</li>
            <li>Came back positive for THC and I stopped smoking 4 months before the test and did everything I could think of.</li>
            <li>There are different things you can try if you look into it that will damage your hair, the more damaged it is the less it obtains.</li>
            <li>I also used 1 box of all clear  as well too on my testing day.</li>
            <li>, the SMALLEST amount of contamination can destroy your chances of passing, these tests are EXTREMELY sensitive and accurate.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions completely, and set a timers.</li>
            <li>Couple of slips with adult ADD medication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Do not waste your time/money with this.</li>
            <li>I had applied for a professional career position, and wasn&#x27;t informed on either of my two interviews that I was going to have to undergo a Drug Screening.</li>
            <li>Tried professionally bleaching and coloring hair, then Zydot day of...forget it.</li>
            <li>When the day came, I rushed from the training center, back to my hotel, to start the Ultra Clean</li>
            <li>I was clear on my way to finally having a professional career!</li>
            <li>Prior to this product I did the  home remedy as well plus I  not a heavy smoker.</li>
            <li>, ask yourself how much is this job worth, the worst they can say is no and continue the sampling, this worked for me the last time I brought 500 and a CLEAN bag of clean hair.</li>
            <li>On the following week, Monday, didn&#x27;t hear anything, so now I definitely thought I was in the clear, but I still hadn&#x27;t smoked in 2 weeks, just in case.</li>
            <li>This one was actually purchased for a family member - 2 kits were purchased, and even prior to using this additional professional grade hair-stripping products were used.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t smoked in a month but certainly had a few times within the 90 day period.  </li>

            <li> This one was actually purchased for a family member - 2 kits were purchased, and even prior to using this additional professional grade hair-stripping products were used.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t smoked in a month but certainly had a few times within the 90 day period.  </li>
            <li> Use properly, each step FULL 10min, buy a new brush and shirt for your day, touch no money that could leave drug oil residue behind in ur hair, sleep with a bleached towel over ALL of ur hair and let your hair touch nothing before your test!</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is my hair is so long I had to buy 2 boxes.</li>
            <li> Been a long time smoker all my life and never had to do a hair test until now....</li>
            <li> When I called, they were closed, so I had to call them the following morning on Wednesday.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t bad enough that it took over a half an hour to do the whole process, but I completed the Ultra Clean 2 hours before my Hair Samples were taken.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use any prior home remedies or other products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sorry for the long review, just wanted to get my story out there!</li>
            <li> They told me to quit my other job as I would be starting in a week.</li>
            <li> Followed the instructions to the letter I was 85 days clean (weed) and failed</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say it did not live up to the hype and leave it at that....</li>
            <li> They make quick profiles to review their products high for every bad review.</li>
            <li> I had smoked half a gram for about 3 months prior.</li>
            <li> once they preform the test as to the effectiveness of this last test, Ive been dying my hair every few days and washing with vinegar and organic lemon juice as well as taking pills to make my hair grow faster</li>
            <li> last test, Ive been dying my hair every few days and washing with vinegar and organic lemon juice as well as taking pills to make my hair grow faster</li>
            <li> it did, however, pick up my prescription narcotic, which is why this get 4 stars from me, so be careful with that part.  </li>
            <li> I guess I should&#x27;ve expected it, but it wasn&#x27;t even listed in the Job Ad.</li>
            <li> It works... plain and simple.</li>
            <li> I smoke everyday, but only at night to unwind and relax, like someone who would be kicking back a few beers!</li>
            <li> I had used heavy for two months and used slightly the last month before giving the sample.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had to use it yet (and hopefully won&#x27;t need to), so not sure if it actually works yet.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T BUY THIS or any other shampoo claiming it can help you pass.</li>
            <li> Then used other box at 8am, again test was at 11am.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was this product or all the other things which I did to my hair, but it worked for me.</li>
            <li> The hair test tracks back at least 90 days.</li>
            <li> Used longer than directed and passed, was very scared and skeptical.</li>
            <li> 1000 Thumbs down</li>
            <li> Needless to say I was only trying to cover up weed which I had stopped smoking almost 2 months prior,</li>
            <li> but I used half and used it twice..</li>
            <li> I was told by my new employer that they needed a hair sample for my drug test and because I had taken a few illegal drugs in the past few months I was obviously nervous.</li>
            <li> Does not clean out impurities in your hair.</li>
            <li> I had little to no clean time and passed.</li>
            <li> The ridiculous thing is within a 90 day period I took a few small puffs because I thought the employer administered a urinalyses and by law you are allowed to have a cut off level of 3.9% THC metabolites in the human body for pre employment.</li>
            <li> No good.... 21 days clean, bleached armpit hair 5-6 times with 40% (highest you can buy) and used this Zydot crap for extra reinsurance.</li>
            <li> I just happened to have smoked a few times 3 weeks before the test</li>
            <li> As well as a few friends of mine.</li>
            <li> heavy smoker and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste.</li>
            <li> I air dried my hair and didn&#x27;t touch it until after the test</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> TOTALLLL WASTE OF MY TIME, MONEY AND EFFORT</li>
            <li> dont waste your money</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money on this s</li>
            <li> waste of money</li>
            <li> Hair test failed due to this product, after following directions 100%.</li>
            <li> I did everything understand the sun to try and get my hair clean and nothing worked including this Crap.</li>
            <li> I was super skeptical about whether or not this worked but it does!!</li>
            <li> a waste of my hard earned money.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but for this I felt I should.</li>
            <li> The smell is not too out of the ordinary either.</li>
            <li> After lots of research I finally came to this unfortunate acceptance and quit doing everything.</li>
            <li> I past my hair test.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, if you feel that you&#x27;ll ever be in a position to have a job that will require a screening, or ongoing random screenings, the solution is to simply not partake!</li>
            <li> The worst part about it, is that I was actually passing the training, and doing very well.</li>
            <li> so it is hard for me to rate it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pathetic how stigmatized Marijuana is, when it&#x27;s far less detrimental than Alcohol or any other drug out there.</li>
            <li> but I had to at least try.</li>
            <li> This product sucks.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give it negative stars</li>
            <li> The lady at the store said buy 2 boxes because my hair is thick.</li>
            <li> Did not work at all,  a failure all the way around do not buy.</li>
            <li> Followed all the steps down to a T and still failed hair follicle drug test for marijuana, lost my $18.50/h job offer.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste a bloody red cent on this product, because it indefinitely does not work!!!!!</li>
            <li> Just passed hair drug test, as in NEGATIVE results after using this product the morning of the test!  </li>
            <li> I know this type of drug test is very difficult to fabricate (unlike the other ones)</li>
            <li> I should be getting a lawyer and suing for false advertisement.</li>
            <li> Well sad to say it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Failed with flying colors</li>
            <li> The guy I bought this for still failed his hair follicle test and lost the job.</li>
            <li> ,failed ,couldnt believe it .hadnt</li>
            <li> and I still failed my hair test and</li>
            <li> Failed.</li>
            <li> ; Hey... you failed hair screening for marijuana, I will pass this info to your employer&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> All these people have fake profiles.. they have nothing else bought, reviewed, etc.</li>
            <li> Took my drug test and failed.</li>
            <li> My son used it to the letter &amp; still failed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> I did one packet the night before and one the day of and still failed!</li>
            <li> sorry, I hate writing reviews, just would rather anyone else who thinks it might work not get their hopes up.</li>
            <li> Worthless, test failed.</li>
            <li> Not be a downer but a hair test is nearly impossible to cheat.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me, im disappointed.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend  to anyone product is worthless.</li>
            <li> Worthless junk!</li>
            <li> Awful.</li>
            <li> Terrible product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Just passed hair drug test, as in NEGATIVE results after using this product the morning of the test!  My system should have been positive for H (moderate user x1 month). Also used vinegar, salacylic acid, tide, coal tar shampoo and ammonia for 4 days prior to test.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but for this I felt I should. I was told by my new employer that they needed a hair sample for my drug test and because I had taken a few illegal drugs in the past few months I was obviously nervous. I know this type of drug test is very difficult to fabricate (unlike the other ones) but I had to at least try. I bought the shampoo kit and followed the instructions. Later that day I provided my hair sample. I am glad to say it must have worked!! it was definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I purchased Zydot Ultra Cleanse for a 90 day hair test. I even paid extra to have it over nighted to my house. Well sad to say it didn&#x27;t work. The ridiculous thing is within a 90 day period I took a few small puffs because I thought the employer administered a urinalyses and by law you are allowed to have a cut off level of 3.9% THC metabolites in the human body for pre employment. I am pretty sure my levels were pretty low and this product still didn&#x27;t work. Bottom line is if you are looking for a job best thing to do is not do drugs.</li>
            <li> I was told this product had a 99% success rate.  Well, it didn&#x27;t work for us.</li>
            <li> PASSED THE HAIR FOLLICLE TEST!!! I had smoked half a gram for about 3 months prior. However my hair is kept short, and hair grows about 0.5 in. every two weeks. I followed the directions completely, and set a timers. I used it 30 minutes before I left to take the test. The smell is not too out of the ordinary either. I didn&#x27;t use any prior home remedies or other products.</li>
            <li> It worked for me, a life changing job that I coildnt  missed. Prior to this product I did the  home remedy as well plus I  not a heavy smoker. I just happened to have smoked a few times 3 weeks before the test</li>
            <li> This product was received in excellent condition much quicker than anticipated. Haven&#x27;t had to use it yet (and hopefully won&#x27;t need to), so not sure if it actually works yet.</li>
            <li> Worthless junk! Does not clean out impurities in your hair. If you want to clean out THC from your hair DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> This product worked for me. Helped me land a great job! I had little to no clean time and passed. Good product. Would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Worked great passed my test</li>
            <li> Great product worked great</li>
            <li> I used some home remedies and zydot to pass a hair follicle test, except I left the zydot on 3X longer than instructions say to. I have 9 inches of hair to clean</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve used this product 3 times before and just got my results back today as clean. I used 4 boxes of zydot in between 2 days just to be extra sure. I used applecider vintiger in between shampoos and followed the directions to a tee. I also used 1 box of all clear  as well too on my testing day. I think the key ingredient is stop smoking as soon as you know that there is a possibility that you&#x27;ll have to test. I stopped smoking at the end of January and took the test mid April. Either way I&#x27;ve had the most success with this.</li>
            <li> Not be a downer but a hair test is nearly impossible to cheat. Don&#x27;t let anyone tell you different, any chemical you introduce into your body is deposited inside of the hair follicle and nothing can take it out,I used this product twice along with 2 others and did not pass. After lots of research I finally came to this unfortunate acceptance and quit doing everything. There are different things you can try if you look into it that will damage your hair, the more damaged it is the less it obtains. If you have time take supplements to make your hair grow faster than the 1.25 centimeters a month. Most of the time they sample the lower part of your leg if not there then armpit then the crown of your head. Also the days before you take it do not go around anything that will show up and for precaution buy a new shirt and put a clean bleached towel around your hair to protect it from any stray particles that could contaminated it, this could even be a pillow case, the head rest in your car even a shirt it your closet that particles settled on, the SMALLEST amount of contamination can destroy your chances of passing, these tests are EXTREMELY sensitive and accurate. If not then damage it as much as possible and hope for the best, last resort size up the person sampling it and bribe them if you think it will work but you cant throw 50 on the counter and expect them to put their job on the line, ask yourself how much is this job worth, the worst they can say is no and continue the sampling, this worked for me the last time I brought 500 and a CLEAN bag of clean hair. Another thing, as long as its in your blood/body it is still depositing it inside the follicle you must be clean before you can grow a clean hair sample then it will take a week or two for the clean hair to grow form the root out to the skin, all hair is different though/ Good luck!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have a hair test coming up and will update this in a week or so once they preform the test as to the effectiveness of this last test, Ive been dying my hair every few days and washing with vinegar and organic lemon juice as well as taking pills to make my hair grow faster Ive been clean for a little over a month and am very nervous and pessimistic......&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update  It did not work just as I had feared. Came back positive for THC and I stopped smoking 4 months before the test and did everything I could think of. I can only hope you have better results than me if your going to use this product. GoodLuckis last test, Ive been dying my hair every few days and washing with vinegar and organic lemon juice as well as taking pills to make my hair grow faster Ive been clean for a little over a month and am very nervous and pessimistic......&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update  It did not work just as I had feared. Came back positive for THC and I stopped smoking 4 months before the test and did everything I could think of. I can only hope you have better results than me if your going to use this product. GoodLuck</li>
            <li> Do not rely on this.product to cover up the hair shaft and hide polutants, does not cleanse either. Hair test failed due to this product, after following directions 100%.</li>
            <li> It really works.  My man got the job!  Thank you very much for this amazing product!</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews, I&#x27;m wondering what people are using this product for? It is to be used to remove mineral build-up or product build-up from the hair, specifically before chemical services. This product is not intended to remove drug build up, so if you are using it to pass a drug test, I wouldn&#x27;t bother, you won&#x27;t pass. I am a Stylist with 22 years in the business, we&#x27;ve used it in the Salon for years and it&#x27;s a great product if you use it for what it&#x27;s intended for.</li>
            <li> Couple of slips with adult ADD medication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My levels may have been low enough to be ok so I cannot be certain this made a difference but rated it 5-stars since I passed my test.</li>
            <li> Well it did NOT work (January 5 2014)  Showed cocaine at more than 5000 pg/mg    I am screwed beyond belief .....</li>
            <li> Used about 5 times n never failed, but my sister in law did so idk with females for me it works</li>
            <li> It worked for me!!!!! Use properly, each step FULL 10min, buy a new brush and shirt for your day, touch no money that could leave drug oil residue behind in ur hair, sleep with a bleached towel over ALL of ur hair and let your hair touch nothing before your test! AND ALL WILL WORK OUT!!!!!!! THANKS ZYDOT!!!! ;)</li>
            <li> Failed with flying colors</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve personally had Zydot Ultra Clean work for me.  As well as a few friends of mine. Only one I know that didn&#x27;t pass showed me his report and it said he passed everything but Meth was over 25,000 ng (he should have fried out at 10,000!!) If you don&#x27;t pass with Zydot you might check the labs credentials</li>
            <li> Zydot worked well for us! We followed the directions to the letter. it&#x27;s worth noting that there was only 1 \\&quot;toxin\\&quot; we were trying to cleanse so for our purposes it did the job! We would recommend and use this product again.</li>
            <li> heavy smoker and it worked for me - follow instructions exactly as it says.  use new towels, hair brush, clothes and something to cover the headrest in  your car.  try not to even turn on the a/c if you smoke in your car (just as a precaution).  it did, however, pick up my prescription narcotic, which is why this get 4 stars from me, so be careful with that part.  hope this helps.</li>
            <li> This product sucks. I do not recommend wasting your time trying this. The guy I bought this for still failed his hair follicle test and lost the job.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get it! It&#x27;s a waste. I did one packet the night before and one the day of and still failed! And I went thruQuest diagnostics. Didn&#x27;t work for me, im disappointed.</li>
            <li> I had a week before my drug test, I thought it would be a urine test so I was clean for about 3.5 weeks before the test. The hair test tracks back at least 90 days. I was a pretty regular smoker (3-4 times a week) and I thought there was no way I would pass. I did the macujo method (look it up online) once a day for 7 days and the day of my test used this product. I air dried my hair and didn&#x27;t touch it until after the test AND I PASSED. Definitely recommend buying, it works!</li>
            <li> You can guess why, I don&#x27;t really need to say much more than that.  Do not waste your time/money with this.</li>
            <li> Needed this for a great job offer. Used it exactly how the box stated and the results where awesome. Had recently used for my birthday and wasn&#x27;t sure if I would pass and a friend recommended it.</li>
            <li> Did not work at all,  a failure all the way around do not buy. Would not recommend  to anyone product is worthless.</li>
            <li> Used longer than directed and passed, was very scared and skeptical. I read all the reviews on every website I could find on the product. Looked like many reviews were 50/50. I had used heavy for two months and used slightly the last month before giving the sample. I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> save your money this is not gonna work trust me it did not work for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;am a previous user of the Zydot product and if use correctly it does work, and the longer your hair the more packs you will need; I have about 4-5 inches of hair so the one pack did work, I do recommend this product. But wish it offered more in the packaging.</li>
            <li> This product may not be for everybody but it fit my specific needs. My hair was free from chlorine and the like after using.</li>
            <li> Great product, great seller. WILL do business again in future. Thanks! (:</li>
            <li> Just ordered for third time. Worked once before for a friend and also worked once for myself. Hopefully this third time ends in another success</li>
            <li> This does NOT work to pass a hair follicle test. Don&#x27;t waste your money. I figured it wouldn&#x27;t work but gave it a try anyways....sorry, I hate writing reviews, just would rather anyone else who thinks it might work not get their hopes up.</li>
            <li> Perfect, just what I was looking for</li>
            <li> Light smoker, quit 1 month prior to test and I passed no problem</li>
            <li> Followed the instructions to the letter I was 85 days clean (weed) and failed</li>
            <li> followed exactly to directions and failed,had a clean comb avoided getting anything on or around me,failed ,couldnt believe it .hadnt used in quite a while,actually quit using drugs prior.passed a piss test on my own but failed hair test.so you tell me ,wouldnt recommend this product,try something else if you need clean hair.</li>
            <li> This worked for me after doing the macujo method twice and Zydot on the morning of my test. The only issue I have is my hair is so long I had to buy 2 boxes. I also quit about 35 days before the test.</li>
            <li> This product was used as directed and didn&#x27;t make a differance. With satisfaction guarenteed We should be able to get our money back, which probably isn&#x27;t going to happen.</li>
            <li> It does not work on African Hair</li>
            <li> Been a long time smoker all my life and never had to do a hair test until now....I have 4in dreads so I bought two just to be safe. I followed the instructions and in between the two I put vinegar and organic lemon juice in my hair and let it sit for ten min for each...then I used the second one and let all 3 steps sit in my hair for ten min each.....passed a panel 5 + opeits</li>
            <li> I had applied for a professional career position, and wasn&#x27;t informed on either of my two interviews that I was going to have to undergo a Drug Screening. I guess I should&#x27;ve expected it, but it wasn&#x27;t even listed in the Job Ad. When I was accepted, I had to go away on a training program for the job. I was told that I had to take a Urine Test two days before I had to actually take it! Now I only smoke Marijuana, because I&#x27;m not a big drinker. I smoke everyday, but only at night to unwind and relax, like someone who would be kicking back a few beers! I took the Ultra Clean pill for the Urine Test, and apparently I drank to much water before the test, because the results came back, as a Diluted Sample, but I didn&#x27;t test positive for Marijuana. I was then told that I would have to take a Hair Follicle Test while training. When the day came, I rushed from the training center, back to my hotel, to start the Ultra Clean process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t bad enough that it took over a half an hour to do the whole process, but I completed the Ultra Clean 2 hours before my Hair Samples were taken. I was told at the clinic, that if I didn&#x27;t hear from anyone within 48-72 hours than the results came back clean. I had taken the test on a Tuesday afternoon at 3:10PM, and I was told if I didn&#x27;t hear from anyone by Friday, then the test came back clean. Friday came, didn&#x27;t hear anything. On the following week, Monday, didn&#x27;t hear anything, so now I definitely thought I was in the clear, but I still hadn&#x27;t smoked in 2 weeks, just in case. Tuesday came, didn&#x27;t hear nothing until the end of the day. I was given a letter stating to call a number regarding the results of my Hair Follicle Test. When I called, they were closed, so I had to call them the following morning on Wednesday. Sure enough, my Hair Follicle Test came back positive for Marijuana!!! The worst part about it, is that I was actually passing the training, and doing very well. I was clear on my way to finally having a professional career! It says on the box, \\&quot;for best results, use the day of test\\&quot;, I used it literally 2 hours before I took the test, and I still tested positive for Marijuana! It&#x27;s pathetic how stigmatized Marijuana is, when it&#x27;s far less detrimental than Alcohol or any other drug out there. There are sooooo many professional individuals out there, that are more than qualified for the positions they apply for, and they get denied or terminated, because they choose to smoke Marijuana rather than become an Alcoholic!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for the long review, just wanted to get my story out there! Basically Ultra Clean just prolonged the inevitable! I wouldn&#x27;t waste a bloody red cent on this product, because it indefinitely does not work!!!!!</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work... a waste of my hard earned money.</li>
            <li> amazing product.  I have almost 12 inches of hair.  I used the product the night before my test then a 2nd package hours before the morning of.  I passed the hair test with flying colors.  I hadn&#x27;t smoked in a month but certainly had a few times within the 90 day period.  I was super skeptical about whether or not this worked but it does!!</li>
            <li> Followed all the steps down to a T and still failed hair follicle drug test for marijuana, lost my $18.50/h job offer. if you&#x27;re buying this for weed. DON&#x27;T BUY THIS or any other shampoo claiming it can help you pass. only way to pass a hair follicle test is to NOT SMOKE. TOTALLLL WASTE OF MY TIME, MONEY AND EFFORT 1000 Thumbs down</li>
            <li> Does not work at all!!</li>
            <li> I used Zydot Ultra clean the day of my hair test and it DID NOT WORK. Needless to say I was only trying to cover up weed which I had stopped smoking almost 2 months prior, before that I smoked on a regular basis. IT guaranteed me it would work or my money back so now I am trying to get my money back. The lady at the store said buy 2 boxes because my hair is thick. I did exactly what she said and followed the directions precisely and I still failed my hair test and the HR lady said my test came back as I was a user!! I lost the great job and now I am unemployed again. It&#x27;s safe to say the only way to pass a hair test is to stop smoking a minimum of 3 months before.</li>
            <li> I give this a five star rating because it works for &amp;#34;everthing&amp;#34; !  Thanks ZYDOT for a clean test result.</li>
            <li> Did not work at all. I even had really short hair, about 3/8 of an inch. It was about 5 weeks new growth also, so mostly naturally clean hair. Also used zydot and followed the instructions exactly. Failed. Lost a life changing opportunity.</li>
            <li> I past my hair test. I&#x27;m happt</li>
            <li> I should be getting a lawyer and suing for false advertisement. Just lost the job of a lifetime after using 2 boxes of this stuff and letting it all sit at the different levels for 15 minutes each step. Do not buy!!!</li>
            <li> I passed my hair follicle, enough said. And I&#x27;m a daily user. I recommend it to every one who has to take the test.</li>
            <li> No good.... 21 days clean, bleached armpit hair 5-6 times with 40% (highest you can buy) and used this Zydot crap for extra reinsurance. Followed direction to insure passing result as it states on box &amp;#34; Only use day of test&amp;#34;. Company held my hair sample for 3 months or didnt test it til 3 months later.. got a surpising yet devasting call from MRO &amp;#34; Hey... you failed hair screening for marijuana, I will pass this info to your employer&amp;#34; Potential for 65k gone! Best bet if you have short hair is to shave completely off and start fresh will not indulging in whatever substance. If asked why you cant give hair on particular day say its not the required length and wait it out 90 days.. better than failing and NO they will not take hair from gentials. Good luck people</li>
            <li> did not work.  purchased two boxes, and it still did not do what it was supposed to do..dont waste your money</li>
            <li> It works... plain and simple. It says do it once (one and done) but I used half and used it twice.. I have shorter (guy style) haircut. It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do. For the price, it honestly is a steal and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> At the end of the day, these kits don&#x27;t guarantee a clean result. This one was actually purchased for a family member - 2 kits were purchased, and even prior to using this additional professional grade hair-stripping products were used. The family member still showed a positive result and put a lot of stress and damage to their hair &amp; scalp in the process. In my opinion, if you feel that you&#x27;ll ever be in a position to have a job that will require a screening, or ongoing random screenings, the solution is to simply not partake!</li>
            <li> It DOES NOT WORK. All these people have fake profiles.. they have nothing else bought, reviewed, etc. They make quick profiles to review their products high for every bad review. It&#x27;s not coincidental there are a split 50/50 in 5 stars and 1 stars. Don&#x27;t waste your money. If it&#x27;s only meant for the day of testing, it&#x27;s a masking shampoo. Which don&#x27;t work anymore.</li>
            <li> Had to give one star to comment. Dont waste your money on this s***. I did everything understand the sun to try and get my hair clean and nothing worked including this Crap.</li>
            <li> Did not work wish I could get my money back dont buy this its bogus just don&#x27;t smoke at all I wish I could give it negative stars</li>
            <li> Great stuff, I was really worried about passing the drug test after only 16 days I stopped using.</li>
            <li> It worked for me now I work for the railroad</li>
            <li> Worthless, test failed.</li>
            <li> I followed directions exactly using the longest times listed for leaving on hair. I then went to test 1 hour later and I passed! It took 3 days to get results and I was worried the whole time but it did work. I was a regular user of smokage and quit about 2 weeks before test. I used clean towel and a new shirt. I scored the job Ive been wanting all my life.  Jackpot baby!</li>
            <li> Awful. Terrible product. Let&#x27;s just say it did not live up to the hype and leave it at that.... Save your money</li>
            <li> Got the job, must of worked!! Thankd so much, great product for the price! Shipped fast and usage was extremely fast and easy.</li>
            <li> I applied for a job got the interview and was hired in. They told me to quit my other job as I would be starting in a week. So the day before I start I was told I need to take a hair drug test. Found this item only purchased 5 boxes followed directions perfect. Took my drug test and failed. Worst part is the company won&#x27;t give me a refund as they state of their page.</li>
            <li> Product did not work!! I used 2. First box was used at 1am and test was at 11am. Then used other box at 8am, again test was at 11am. This product does not work!!!!!! Oh and shipping sucked too. Overnight took 5 days!!!</li>
            <li> Product did not work for me!! I followed instructions exactly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was this product or all the other things which I did to my hair, but it worked for me. I think it depends on your hair type as I have lots of fine blonde hair.</li>
            <li> Works great if yu follow the instructions ðŸŽ‰</li>
            <li> Did not work! Tried professionally bleaching and coloring hair, then Zydot day of...forget it.</li>
            <li> My son used it to the letter &amp; still failed. waste of money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry this purchase is some thing I have not used so it is hard for me to rate it</li>
