            <li>Folding/unfolding the unit is a breeze and it stores against a wall or in a trunk very nicely when folded.  </li>

            <li>We are very happy with the whole process.  </li>

            <li>very easy to manouver.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to set up, just make sure you turn the foot rests 180 degrees, otherwise you&#x27;ll be kicking yourself for a while... read the directions, even if you think it&#x27;s self explanatory</li>
            <li>Plus, it is easy to fold up and fits nicely in the trunk.  </li>
            <li>She gets to get out more often, which she enjoys.</li>
            <li>Compared to 5 time more than many chairs.  </li>
            <li>She prefers using it as a walker--in fact, it seems more stable than her walker for use in the house.     </li>
            <li>This chair is ideal for someone who is not heavy built.</li>
            <li>A sturdy useful chair and a good buy.</li>
            <li>so we were able to stow in trunk of the car and have the mobility we were looking for.</li>
            <li>You would expect to pay more for the quality that is in this chair.</li>
            <li>Quite handsomely finished.</li>
            <li>The handles could use more  cushioning because my hands hurt after going through the mall</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>The chair is light and very easy to fold.</li>
            <li>Very light, easy to use, fold and unfold.  </li>
            <li>It is not as easy to maneuver, fold, or lift in/out of car.  </li>
            <li>The company shipped it very quickly.  </li>
            <li>This chair is idea for getting around the house and easy to get in and out the car.</li>
            <li>It fitted in my car easily.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s so easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>You can easily put it in the car.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The chair fold easily and fits in the trunk with out any hassles.  </li>
            <li>Easy to maneuver and lightweight for lifting in and out of vehicles.</li>
            <li>The transport is light weigh, easy to navigate.</li>
            <li>It fit in the trunk of my car and was easy to fold and unfold.</li>
            <li>We like the light weight and easy to fold.</li>
            <li>We bough it for my mother in law and is fine</li>
            <li>/&gt;Quality seems to be fine.</li>
            <li>She loved the comfort, the sturdiness, and especially liked the extra support for the legs which many other chairs she looked at for this price did not have.</li>
            <li>This little gem folds up so perfectly and fits into the trunk no problem,</li>
            <li>It said light weight, but weighs close to 20 pounds.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a narrow one and this one is excellent.</li>
            <li>Fairly comfortable for extended use.</li>
            <li>Cheap welds the arm already broke off</li>
            <li>Ordered this chair to have a light folding wheelchair for taking an elderly parent around to the department store, mall, museums etc.  </li>
            <li>No kidding I really love this wheelchair, well as much as anyone can love a wheelchair.  </li>
            <li>We specially used it when in Las Vegas, making it a breeze to take him from place to place.  </li>
            <li>Oh and weight is real nice not that heavy.    </li>
            <li>and it became cumbersome to load her full size wheelchair in and out of the trunk of my Altima.</li>
            <li>It is very flexible and easy for us to fold and to get in and out of our car.  </li>
            <li>I still give them 3 starts because all else was good about the chairs, light weight, hand breaks, etc., but they were of little use when the foot rests were no longer attached to the chairs.</li>
            <li>The brakes on the chair are smooth and very convenient.</li>
            <li>We bought the lightweight wheelchair to give us greater mobility with our 92 year old aunt.  </li>
            <li>My ninety-year old mother has Alzheimer&#x27;s and cannot walk for more than two or three steps at a time.</li>
            <li>It folds  up and fits nicely into to the trunk of my husband&#x27;s smaller car.  </li>
            <li>We haven&#x27;t used it that much, but it is very portable and easy to setup.  </li>
            <li>The wheels squeeked when I first got it</li>
            <li>This wheelchair makes our lives so much easier!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Two problems with first chair.</li>
            <li>Company sent replacement immediately and also a prepaid return label for the first chair.</li>
            <li>Able to maneuver over mild rough terrain better than smaller wheeled units.</li>
            <li>wheelchair part arrived in good repair, was light enough and small enough to easily be stored in the cargo area of the family Jeep or SUV and was easy to fold and unfold.  </li>
            <li>For me, it is much lighter and easier to manuever than a larger more cumbersome wheelchair, plus it folds up and can be put in the car.</li>
            <li>I do not recommend this chair for someone who is large in body build.  </li>
            <li>I guess there is something to the large rear wheel design.</li>
            <li>The wheels are large enough (I will have to see how they  hold up) and make the wheelchair easy to push, the build seems to be sturdy enough, the weight is just right for this kind of wheelchair, the seat is high enough that my husband can stand up without much effort.</li>
            <li>we were becoming really limited because my mom is getting more restricted in her walking ability, this wheel chair lets us go to the mall, the museum, or taking long strolls and walks and makes it alot easier on me as well for not having to hold her up as we walk.  </li>
            <li>It is a cinch to fold and doesn&#x27;t require much space to store.    </li>
            <li>Very sturdy construction.</li>
            <li>Having this makes it so much easier to take my mom around</li>
            <li>My brother found it quite comfortable and roomy enough.</li>
            <li>It is very convenient.</li>
            <li>(2) as I do not want to have to pack up and return the whole chair.  </li>
            <li>easy to fold and assemble, not much to collapsing and yet sturdy and very functional.  </li>
            <li>Lastly, my Mom love the red finish!</li>
            <li>and you can raise the chair to go over, burms, high threshold.    </li>
            <li>Highly recomend this chair.</li>
            <li>It may be possible for us to disassemble the footrests and re-assemble them with the plastic bottoms pointing the right way.  </li>
            <li>contacted Amazon about just sending back the footrest assemblies (since they come in a separate little box anyway) and keeping the large main chair as it works fine</li>
            <li>The Product came on time as promised, Just a little cheaply built in China.  </li>
            <li>Everything but the footrests works great and the chair packed into its shipping boxes was about twice as heavy and unwieldy as the chair by itself, making a pack-up and return hard for me to manage.  </li>
            <li>After tons of research I bought this transport chair for my 92 year old mother.</li>
            <li>Bought this for a 3 week visit from my 81 year old mother in law.</li>
            <li>(I am almost 80 years old)</li>
            <li>Breaks down enough and light weight</li>
            <li>We weren&#x27;t looking for a heavy duty chair since the person is small/ light and can walk a little ways on their own, but gets tired walking or standing for a long time so rather than have to scout out a free wheelchair from \\&quot;customer service\\</li>
            <li>return whole chair (not just footrests) for refund or re-order, or 2)  without returning anything, get a partial credit to allow me to buy new footrests.  </li>
            <li>It has really helped my Mom when she goes to see the doctor or has to walk long distances.   </li>
            <li>The seat belt was a added feature that was really needed, but generally found on more expensive chairs.</li>
            <li>Major problem because it appears footrests were installed backwards so they cannot be used.</li>
            <li>While it won&#x27;t fit in my truck it folds down enough to go in the back</li>
            <li>Hand rakes and strap behind feet are extras not found on most travel chairs.</li>
            <li>Obviously with the two footrests jutting out like wings to the side there is no place to rest one&#x27;s feet while sitting, and the assembly was done in such a way that it made it difficult/impossible to remove the black plastic bottom parts and put them on facing the right way.  </li>
            <li>(he can walk very slowly but tires out easily).</li>

            <li> My brother found it quite comfortable and roomy enough.</li>
            <li> It is very convenient.</li>
            <li> (2) as I do not want to have to pack up and return the whole chair.  </li>
            <li> easy to fold and assemble, not much to collapsing and yet sturdy and very functional.  </li>
            <li> Lastly, my Mom love the red finish!</li>
            <li> and you can raise the chair to go over, burms, high threshold.    </li>
            <li> Highly recomend this chair.</li>
            <li> It may be possible for us to disassemble the footrests and re-assemble them with the plastic bottoms pointing the right way.  </li>
            <li> contacted Amazon about just sending back the footrest assemblies (since they come in a separate little box anyway) and keeping the large main chair as it works fine</li>
            <li> The Product came on time as promised, Just a little cheaply built in China.  </li>
            <li> Everything but the footrests works great and the chair packed into its shipping boxes was about twice as heavy and unwieldy as the chair by itself, making a pack-up and return hard for me to manage.  </li>
            <li> After tons of research I bought this transport chair for my 92 year old mother.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a 3 week visit from my 81 year old mother in law.</li>
            <li> (I am almost 80 years old)</li>
            <li> Breaks down enough and light weight</li>
            <li> We weren&#x27;t looking for a heavy duty chair since the person is small/ light and can walk a little ways on their own, but gets tired walking or standing for a long time so rather than have to scout out a free wheelchair from \\&quot;customer service\\</li>
            <li> return whole chair (not just footrests) for refund or re-order, or 2)  without returning anything, get a partial credit to allow me to buy new footrests.  </li>
            <li> It has really helped my Mom when she goes to see the doctor or has to walk long distances.   </li>
            <li> The seat belt was a added feature that was really needed, but generally found on more expensive chairs.</li>
            <li> Major problem because it appears footrests were installed backwards so they cannot be used.</li>
            <li> While it won&#x27;t fit in my truck it folds down enough to go in the back</li>
            <li> Hand rakes and strap behind feet are extras not found on most travel chairs.</li>
            <li> Obviously with the two footrests jutting out like wings to the side there is no place to rest one&#x27;s feet while sitting, and the assembly was done in such a way that it made it difficult/impossible to remove the black plastic bottom parts and put them on facing the right way.  </li>
            <li> (he can walk very slowly but tires out easily).</li>
            <li> This wheelchair is not only lightweight but it folds very flat and almost square</li>
            <li> He also puts it in and out of our vehicle, which I couldn&#x27;t do, even though it isn&#x27;t very heavy, I still can&#x27;t manipulate it very well.</li>
            <li> but I used some dry spray lubricant on the wheel bearings and it was totally quiet.</li>
            <li> Seeing how long it will hold up is the issue.</li>
            <li> is she is sitting for a long period of time, but we adapt all what she needs to be confortable and take her with us all the time.</li>
            <li> I notice one other reviewer already did that same thing and another mentions turning the footrests \\&quot;180</li>
            <li> with the regular wheel chair my mom chair flew out of my hands when I went down a ramp, could not catch her, she went into the parking street, thank God no cars was coming.</li>
            <li> The down side is with smaller wheels</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, the footrest assemblies (the two parts in front that rest the person&#x27;s feet and are connected with a black strap) were a different story.  </li>
            <li> Narrow enough to get through doorways without a problem.  </li>
            <li> Moms insurance covered her for a wheelchair, but boy is that thing cumbersome, it&#x27;s heavy and BIG.  </li>
            <li> I purchase the wrong chair but exchanged it for the right wheelchair without any problems.</li>
            <li> After struggling for about an hour to get these on as shown in the picture and in the assembly diagram, and finding that they would not fit/ lock in place/ stay out of the way of the wheels, we took a closer look and realized the black plastic footrest parts had been assembled at the factory so when the footrest assemblies were locked in place, the black plastic bottom parts pointed out from either side of the chair and not in towards the middle.  </li>
            <li> These came in a separate little box with instructions (not very clear) on how to attach them to the wheelchair frame.  </li>
            <li> In fact, other sites have it for over $100 more.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It will handle hard dirt surfaces and solid grass</li>
            <li> It takes up way less space and fits in the trunk.</li>
            <li> To a 49er football game, to the Japanese Tea Garden in San Francisco ( even though there&#x27;s a limited area where a transport chair can go ) , a family reunion and a few eateries etc.</li>
            <li> I did have trouble figuring out how to fold the  push handles down</li>
            <li> I want to make one thing clear, the only way someone is getting it away from me is when they pry it out of my cold dead fingers!  </li>
            <li> The chair is a  little heavier than some others I looked at online</li>
            <li> After a few uses, the foot rests on both chairs came off and we were never able to fix them.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the small wheels scare you.</li>
            <li> we are not able to use the product at this time because the footrest has a problem.  </li>
            <li> Must have been some idiot&#x27;s first day on the job or else the inspector had a hangover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> Pushing the chair on rugs and hard surfaces is a breeze (my 120 Lb wife has no problem pushing).</li>
            <li> It has all the features you will need (handbrakes; bars you step on while pushing to make the front wheels lift over curbs/door sills; and the strap for behind the legs of the rider are important--don&#x27;t buy a chair without them!!).  </li>
            <li> I was shocked at the weight of this chair.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I was shocked at the weight of this chair.  It said light weight, but weighs close to 20 pounds.  It is not as easy to maneuver, fold, or lift in/out of car.  The additional brakes are good, but just add weight to it for me.</li>
            <li> We bought the lightweight wheelchair to give us greater mobility with our 92 year old aunt.  It is very flexible and easy for us to fold and to get in and out of our car.  She gets to get out more often, which she enjoys. The company shipped it very quickly.  We are very happy with the whole process.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> The transport is light weigh, easy to navigate. The seat belt was a added feature that was really needed, but generally found on more expensive chairs. This chair is idea for getting around the house and easy to get in and out the car.</li>
            <li> After tons of research I bought this transport chair for my 92 year old mother. Its great. fits my trunk even on my sentra. The brakes come in real handy. Use the seat belt as if you hit a bump or burm it will hang up. But just step on the back leg and you can raise the chair to go over, burms, high threshold.    The price is the best after hours of searching. Compared to 5 time more than many chairs.  Oh and weight is real nice not that heavy.    Great buy. Good qaulity.</li>
            <li> The Product came on time as promised, Just a little cheaply built in China.  Do not like the band that keeps the legs together but it  otherwise does the job. Seeing how long it will hold up is the issue.</li>
            <li> This transport chair was a Godsend. My ninety-year old mother has Alzheimer&#x27;s and cannot walk for more than two or three steps at a time. The transport chair allows her a degree of mobility. She prefers using it as a walker--in fact, it seems more stable than her walker for use in the house.     For me, it is much lighter and easier to manuever than a larger more cumbersome wheelchair, plus it folds up and can be put in the car. I push her in the transport chair around our neighborhood both mornings and evenings, and--thus far--it has held up great. It is a cinch to fold and doesn&#x27;t require much space to store.    I would reccommend this product to anyone who needs a lightweight, low-cost transport chair.</li>
            <li> I bought this chair when my mother came to visit. The chair is light and very easy to fold. It fitted in my car easily. This chair is ideal for someone who is not heavy built. The brakes on the chair are smooth and very convenient. I got my mother around everywhere. A sturdy useful chair and a good buy.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom who had been looking for a wheelchair. She loved the comfort, the sturdiness, and especially liked the extra support for the legs which many other chairs she looked at for this price did not have. It&#x27;s a great chair and the price was even better!!</li>
            <li> I bought two of these chairs for my parents.  After a few uses, the foot rests on both chairs came off and we were never able to fix them. I still give them 3 starts because all else was good about the chairs, light weight, hand breaks, etc., but they were of little use when the foot rests were no longer attached to the chairs.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a 3 week visit from my 81 year old mother in law. It performed admirably. It fit in the trunk of my car and was easy to fold and unfold. Very sturdy construction. The wheels squeeked when I first got it but I used some dry spray lubricant on the wheel bearings and it was totally quiet. I successfully used it to push my mother in law all over \\&quot;the world\\&quot; at Disney EPCOT. The hand brakes were great in helping her get out of the chair. I recommend this product if you want a portable wheelchair to take someone around. Good value for the price.</li>
            <li> This item is perfect for wheeling my Mom around.  She feels comfortable and the foot rests are ideal. Plus, it is easy to fold up and fits nicely in the trunk.  The hand brakes are also a nice touch.  Lastly, my Mom love the red finish!</li>
            <li> with the regular wheel chair my mom chair flew out of my hands when I went down a ramp, could not catch her, she went into the parking street, thank God no cars was coming. The brake on this chair is essential.</li>
            <li> My mother broke her hip and needed a wheelchair that I could pick up and throw in the trunk of the car.  This is a perfect transport chair.  Narrow enough to get through doorways without a problem.  I do not recommend this chair for someone who is large in body build.  I wanted a narrow one and this one is excellent.</li>
            <li> Thank God I bought this!  Moms insurance covered her for a wheelchair, but boy is that thing cumbersome, it&#x27;s heavy and BIG.  This little gem folds up so perfectly and fits into the trunk no problem, (we have a Saturn L200.)  This wheelchair is not only lightweight but it folds very flat and almost square, it&#x27;s so easy to handle.  Having this makes it so much easier to take my mom around which is good for her and makes life easier for me.  Now that I have this I want to make one thing clear, the only way someone is getting it away from me is when they pry it out of my cold dead fingers!  No kidding I really love this wheelchair, well as much as anyone can love a wheelchair.  If you do a lot of traveling this is a great item in this price range, I&#x27;m sure there are some really great ones with lots more features but just look at the prices, ouch.</li>
            <li> I was stressed by all the choices and price ranges when looking for a chair.  This one is excellent.  It has all the features you will need (handbrakes; bars you step on while pushing to make the front wheels lift over curbs/door sills; and the strap for behind the legs of the rider are important--don&#x27;t buy a chair without them!!).  Don&#x27;t let the small wheels scare you. Pushing the chair on rugs and hard surfaces is a breeze (my 120 Lb wife has no problem pushing). It will handle hard dirt surfaces and solid grass O.K. Remember with transport chairs the rider cannot move him/herself alone like in a wheelchair--someone has to push.  Folding/unfolding the unit is a breeze and it stores against a wall or in a trunk very nicely when folded.  If you need a transport chair for under $300. buy this one. All the feature for a great price.</li>
            <li> This is a great lightweight chair and the price was great also.  I recommend it to anyone that is looking for a inexpensive chair that doesn&#x27;t weight alot.</li>
            <li> Great chair for travel.  Very light, easy to use, fold and unfold.  We purchased one when my brother came to visit.  We specially used it when in Las Vegas, making it a breeze to take him from place to place.  At the airport just take it up to the airplane itself and check it at the door.  And the price was the best I found for this kind of chair.  My brother found it quite comfortable and roomy enough.</li>
            <li> It is very convenient. You can easily put it in the car. very easy to manouver. I&#x27;m happy I bought this for my mom. We can now easily go to places and shopping!!!</li>
            <li> This transport has been everywhere! To a 49er football game, to the Japanese Tea Garden in San Francisco ( even though there&#x27;s a limited area where a transport chair can go ) , a family reunion and a few eateries etc. My husband pushes it with ease. He also puts it in and out of our vehicle, which I couldn&#x27;t do, even though it isn&#x27;t very heavy, I still can&#x27;t manipulate it very well.</li>
            <li> This has been a great investment. It has really helped my Mom when she goes to see the doctor or has to walk long distances.   Highly recomend this chair.</li>
            <li> Breaks down enough and light weight so we were able to stow in trunk of the car and have the mobility we were looking for. Able to maneuver over mild rough terrain better than smaller wheeled units.</li>
            <li> Contrary to some one-star reviews I want to say that it took me (I am almost 80 years old) only about 15 minutes to put the wheelchair together, no problem with attaching the leg parts, and now I can take my husband into stores shopping, in a museum or to a show and don&#x27;t have to &#x27;deposit&#x27; him somewhere or exhaust him with having to walk longer distances (he can walk very slowly but tires out easily). The wheels are large enough (I will have to see how they  hold up) and make the wheelchair easy to push, the build seems to be sturdy enough, the weight is just right for this kind of wheelchair, the seat is high enough that my husband can stand up without much effort. It fits perfectly in the trunk of our medium sized car. I also bought 2 foldable bicycle side-baskets and a larger basket to attach on the back (some &#x27;mickeymousing&#x27; with doouble sided Velcro involved in that one), so we can go shopping without struggling with an additional shopping cart. This wheelchair makes our lives so much easier! At the moment I would like to give it 6 stars if I could…</li>
            <li> You would expect to pay more for the quality that is in this chair. In fact, other sites have it for over $100 more.&lt;br /&gt;The chair fold easily and fits in the trunk with out any hassles.  Very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It looks great but have not used it yet.</li>
            <li> Easy to maneuver and lightweight for lifting in and out of vehicles. Fairly comfortable for extended use. Quite handsomely finished.</li>
            <li> I bought this chair to take on a future trip overseas with my   daughter who has cerebral palsy.  I&#x27;ve tried it out at the mall  and am very pleased with the quality of the product.  It folds  up and fits nicely into to the trunk of my husband&#x27;s smaller car.  The seat and back are padded which probably adds to the comfort of  of the user.  I did have trouble figuring out how to fold the  push handles down but the company&#x27;s customer service person   promptly contacted me and talked me through it. The chair is a  little heavier than some others I looked at online but I can  hang carryon bags on back and not have to worry about tipping  it so I think that is a good thing.  The handles could use more  cushioning because my hands hurt after going through the mall but   I remedied the situation by adding extra gel covers that we had received  to put on the handles of her crutches. This was a good choice for us  and a lot lighter and more convenient to use than her electric wheelchair!</li>
            <li> We received this promptly, it is as described, and is an excellent value for the price. Thanks!</li>
            <li> My grandmother was staying with us for a while and it became cumbersome to load her full size wheelchair in and out of the trunk of my Altima. This wheelchair allowed us to travel with ease. It takes up way less space and fits in the trunk. The down side is with smaller wheels it is sometimes more difficult to maneuver, and it feels heavier to push than a regular wheelchair. I guess there is something to the large rear wheel design. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I purchase the wrong chair but exchanged it for the right wheelchair without any problems.</li>
            <li> Well made chair. Hand rakes and strap behind feet are extras not found on most travel chairs. Excellent customer service. Two problems with first chair. Company sent replacement immediately and also a prepaid return label for the first chair.</li>
            <li> Cheap welds the arm already broke off</li>
            <li> Ordered this chair to have a light folding wheelchair for taking an elderly parent around to the department store, mall, museums etc.  We weren&#x27;t looking for a heavy duty chair since the person is small/ light and can walk a little ways on their own, but gets tired walking or standing for a long time so rather than have to scout out a free wheelchair from \\&quot;customer service\\&quot; I wanted us to have our own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wheelchair part arrived in good repair, was light enough and small enough to easily be stored in the cargo area of the family Jeep or SUV and was easy to fold and unfold.  No problems there and it worked for its intended purpose.  HOWEVER, the footrest assemblies (the two parts in front that rest the person&#x27;s feet and are connected with a black strap) were a different story.  These came in a separate little box with instructions (not very clear) on how to attach them to the wheelchair frame.  After struggling for about an hour to get these on as shown in the picture and in the assembly diagram, and finding that they would not fit/ lock in place/ stay out of the way of the wheels, we took a closer look and realized the black plastic footrest parts had been assembled at the factory so when the footrest assemblies were locked in place, the black plastic bottom parts pointed out from either side of the chair and not in towards the middle.  Obviously with the two footrests jutting out like wings to the side there is no place to rest one&#x27;s feet while sitting, and the assembly was done in such a way that it made it difficult/impossible to remove the black plastic bottom parts and put them on facing the right way.  Must have been some idiot&#x27;s first day on the job or else the inspector had a hangover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve contacted Amazon about just sending back the footrest assemblies (since they come in a separate little box anyway) and keeping the large main chair as it works fine and I don&#x27;t want to have to package up and ship back that big thing.  Will update to let you know how it ocmes out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE***  Amazon offered two options:  1)  return whole chair (not just footrests) for refund or re-order, or 2)  without returning anything, get a partial credit to allow me to buy new footrests.  I went for option (2) as I do not want to have to pack up and return the whole chair.  Everything but the footrests works great and the chair packed into its shipping boxes was about twice as heavy and unwieldy as the chair by itself, making a pack-up and return hard for me to manage.  It may be possible for us to disassemble the footrests and re-assemble them with the plastic bottoms pointing the right way.  I notice one other reviewer already did that same thing and another mentions turning the footrests \\&quot;180 degrees\\&quot;.  Buyer should be aware with this item there seems to be an excellent chance of getting defective footrests and you will need a properly sized hex wrench at minimum to get them off and back on.</li>
            <li> we are not able to use the product at this time because the footrest has a problem.  Instructions state it is labeled &amp;#34;right and left&amp;#34; but they are not labeled.  Major problem because it appears footrests were installed backwards so they cannot be used.</li>
            <li> We like the light weight and easy to fold. We bough it for my mother in law and is fine but she complain that needs cusion for the back and the sit because her body hurts is she is sitting for a long period of time, but we adapt all what she needs to be confortable and take her with us all the time.</li>
            <li> we were becoming really limited because my mom is getting more restricted in her walking ability, this wheel chair lets us go to the mall, the museum, or taking long strolls and walks and makes it alot easier on me as well for not having to hold her up as we walk.  easy to fold and assemble, not much to collapsing and yet sturdy and very functional.  Love it</li>
            <li> We haven&#x27;t used it that much, but it is very portable and easy to setup.  I have an rx8.  While it won&#x27;t fit in my truck it folds down enough to go in the back seat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality seems to be fine. Time will tell.</li>
            <li> This is a great chair! It was the best for the money, is light, sturdy &amp; easily maneuverable.  I&#x27;d like for mom not to need it, but she does and it works out perfectly! It is very easy to set up, just make sure you turn the foot rests 180 degrees, otherwise you&#x27;ll be kicking yourself for a while... read the directions, even if you think it&#x27;s self explanatory like I did! lol!</li>
