            <li>YOUR PROB JUST BETTER OFF SAVING YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li>I LOVE my hair extensions.!</li>
            <li>received these items in very good shape and quickly as well.</li>
            <li>Brilliant product,and exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li>They are amazing...</li>
            <li>The seller was nice after I paid for the extensions.</li>
            <li>Product came nicely packaged and on time.</li>
            <li>The color did not match at all, but that is not any ones fault but my own.  </li>
            <li>The clips are also nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice but you CANT STRAIGHTEN IT OR CURL IT &amp;</li>
            <li>, this hair extension makes me feel good about myself :)</li>
            <li>The shipping was surprisingly fast, and the extensions are the best hair-related purchase I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
            <li>Well, it looks nice when you take it out of the package.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear it often, but it comes in handy when I want to switch things up a bit.</li>
            <li>Quality is nice</li>
            <li>, they kind of clump up</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to pay that kind of money.</li>
            <li>use any kind of iron (flat/curler) on them or the hair will melt.</li>
            <li>so everything was kind of a disaster .</li>
            <li>and they still look nice</li>
            <li>They came packaged nicely (by nicely</li>
            <li>It was really nice</li>
            <li>Clip in nicely depending on your head frame.</li>
            <li>I thought I liked them</li>
            <li>so what i did was i would wrap it around the wand and then &amp;#34;curled&amp;#34; it up with my fingers (kind of the way you do.. when doing the &amp;#34;no heat&amp;#34; curls)</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted for a very good price.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was very good, but when I got it it was so tangled</li>
            <li>really love it excellent product they look almost real.</li>
            <li>Great price for product, needs to be washed to eliminate the super shine look.</li>
            <li>Also the clips in them broke very easily.</li>
            <li>Again I love it.! :)</li>
            <li>Good length ,good color , delivering was very fast</li>
            <li>I liked the fact that the seller was understanding and told me things that more sellers wouldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>the item came early, the color and texture match my hair perfectly....</li>
            <li>to be honest, Barbie hair is better.</li>
            <li>I have natural curly hair , and when I straightened my hair they blended amazingly 400 thumbs up!!!!</li>
            <li>nd got tangled veryyyy easy!</li>
            <li>it worked great forthe first month....</li>
            <li>Overall the price was good and the product was good!</li>
            <li>The extensions were beautiful and real looking when I received them.  </li>
            <li>, actually very light brown.  </li>
            <li>But it shipped quickly and nicely, looks nice when you brush it for like 4 or 5 minutes,</li>
            <li>then its okay reminds me of a very cheap brand of weave</li>
            <li>Very happy with this product not only is the price very cheap</li>
            <li>AND LITERALLY A HUGE CHUNK OF HAIR CAME OUT!</li>
            <li>and this was better than them.</li>
            <li>They did take time to get to me but in my eyes that was okay.</li>
            <li>and I recommend ordering more than one or from another place as to get side pieces.</li>
            <li>they are okay for the price, the color a bit off</li>
            <li>okay....</li>
            <li>I love them</li>
            <li>:) I got them in 2 weeks&lt;</li>
            <li>so I might cut it to blend in better.</li>
            <li>all my friends love it</li>
            <li>but it is very inexpensive and great</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>When u put them in I was in love.</li>
            <li>so cuz of that u will need 2 or more pieces.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>The hair doesn&#x27;t fall out or tangle, and I was even able to use styling products on it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>cost is more then the hair cost.</li>
            <li>It had more of a reddish tint to it.</li>
            <li>Having never bought extensions before, I wasn&#x27;t totally sure what to expect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>I would probably buy 2 more so it can match the thickness of my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the problem would be solved.</li>
            <li>Which I like way better then</li>
            <li>Will be ordering some more.</li>
            <li>Am ordering one more for a friend.</li>
            <li>May buy more</li>
            <li>but overall does the job perfectly</li>
            <li>It had more of a reddish tint to it.</li>
            <li>I love the hair</li>
            <li>maybe those ones will be better.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product!</li>
            <li>Yep-garbage!!! :-)</li>
            <li>Everything was okay considering what I paid for it.</li>
            <li>but my hair matches perfectly and last all day</li>
            <li>They were okay when I got them the clips were coming off from the extensions and</li>
            <li>on top of that they wouldn&#x27;t curl at all for me.</li>
            <li>Overall, this hair piece is great for the price!</li>
            <li>and if you brush them they look better.</li>
            <li>I just wish they had more of selection of colors.</li>
            <li>Static static static.</li>
            <li>sure you buy more then one and make sure its the color you need.</li>
            <li>But in overall, the product is great comparing to the price and the seller is awesome , very oriented to the customer service.</li>
            <li>I would buy again :)</li>
            <li>Love love love love love.</li>
            <li>i absolutley LOVE hair extensions</li>
            <li>I love my hair extensions...</li>
            <li>I think that it would look better curled.</li>
            <li>Ok so for the price i was sceptical...</li>
            <li>Im glad</li>
            <li>and I think they were a lot better when cut into 2 pieces.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t regret it more.</li>
            <li>It is ok for a one time wear or to see if you like having them clipped in your head</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m In love with them.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to order more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I am probably going to buy another as I write this because of how pleased I am.</li>
            <li>More like costume hair...</li>
            <li>only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that the hair got is not the best quality .</li>
            <li>I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>but the fry very easily and also tangle easily ...  </li>
            <li>not only were these awesome extensions beautiful and look like natural hair</li>
            <li>but after I cut the extensions and blended it in with my natural hair it looked gorgeous!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super glad I came across these hair extensions!</li>
            <li>this product is definitely ideally for super pin straight hair.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t style these with heat or wash them or anything you&#x27;ll get a couple good wears but don&#x27;t expect too much!</li>
            <li>for the money you get a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>seams good be better made but overall good product.</li>
            <li>But in all its beautiful it has a slight shine but looks just like my real hair and its the perfect length and weight.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t looking for anything super spectacular.</li>
            <li>Very good product, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Very full</li>
            <li>IT GETS VERY TANGLED VERY EASILY!</li>
            <li>It is more of a light to medium brown.</li>
            <li>They give great volume to my already long hair and when braided in the hair does not have any kind of conspicuous shine to give it off asfake.</li>
            <li>If you are just looking for a day look or something like one day use go for the purchase its cheap and replaceable and pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li>and I think these are great love them especially for the price :)</li>
            <li>I enjoy this product but the quality could still be better.</li>
            <li>But, I wasn&#x27;t too upset because it was expected for the price to not be perfect.</li>
            <li>best $22.34 spent</li>
            <li>it really looks good ..</li>
            <li>I loved the carrier because they were very understanding and made me feel as though I was being heard.</li>
            <li>but they get tangled very easily and fast!!</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t come with anything to keep them safe and clean</li>
            <li>It came just like the photo and was so easy to clip in id buy it again</li>
            <li>and I recommend you to use a comb instead of a brush because it does tangle easily.</li>
            <li>It does tangle easily too.  </li>
            <li>Overall great product :)</li>
            <li>Easy to comb, too.</li>
            <li>, you can wash them and curl them and maintaining them is so easy,</li>
            <li>And they get tangled too easy.</li>
            <li>The hair fell out easy.</li>
            <li>and they are easy to take in and take out .</li>
            <li>They tangle really easy.</li>
            <li>Hair tangles way to easy</li>
            <li>Kinda tangle easily</li>
            <li>Easily adjustable.</li>
            <li>The extensions are of good thickness and look realistic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun to wear but it damages very easily.</li>
            <li>really good quality and very soft!</li>
            <li>good for price does get a little tangled easily but everyone says they look real and not synthetic match my hair perfectly</li>
            <li>Hair was super shiny, and it looked very cheap.</li>
            <li>when I contacted them all they wanted was more money and claimed the detail did not say full head.</li>
            <li>The shipping was nice, looked neat at first .</li>
            <li>It holds curls fine.</li>
            <li>the piece I got looks fine but the hair falls out ALOT</li>
            <li>I bought to of these and the thickness was fine.</li>
            <li>Overall I was pretty impressed by the quality with the price.</li>
            <li>So if you have hair like mine (fine hair)</li>
            <li>They matched my hair perfectly and I love the length, plus the price was unbelievable</li>
            <li>I did like the length, i didn&#x27;t like the static either the fact as soon as i pulled them out of their package, they where already falling apart, the hair was just coming off so quickly</li>
            <li>will absolutely buy more!</li>
            <li>Why buy real hair which costs so much more!?</li>
            <li>i have very dark brown hair, it matched perfectly!</li>
            <li>these extensions are very dark brown which is perfect for my hair.</li>
            <li>(maybe I have a huge pumpkin head</li>
            <li>They are great, except it says &amp;#34;six pieces&amp;#34; but it was just one total clip in piece.</li>
            <li>I ordered another one because it wasn&#x27;t quite enough to fill my head, but for the price these are great.</li>
            <li>Turns out it looks light brown ....</li>
            <li>Although this hair looked really nice on, it was very staticy</li>
            <li>i do not recommend what so ever, the color is to light</li>
            <li>and they came light brown</li>
            <li>but the extensions didn&#x27;t fit for me.)</li>
            <li>cheap but will do.</li>
            <li>Kinda heavy but look great!!!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect anything from this order, I was just browsing &amp; saw them for cheap,</li>
            <li>yes they were cheap but they didn&#x27;t come on time before Christmas</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a light auburn color.</li>
            <li>THE HAIR QUALITY IS CHEAP</li>
            <li>AND IF YOU DON&#x27;T HAVE SILKY SMOOTH HAIR</li>
            <li>got this for my daughter and she loved it except we thought it would be more thicker and fuller if we ordered a second one</li>
            <li>It was long and beautiful.</li>
            <li>and it was beautiful and long, just what I wanted.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s beautiful very long and cheap.</li>
            <li>The hair itself is real looking and a very nice gift for the price you really can&#x27;t beat it</li>
            <li>This hair is very long and beautiful.</li>
            <li>and I can run my flat iron and brush through them (gently) and its just awesome how they come out looking.</li>
            <li>When I bought this I was excited,  a cheaply priced hair extension</li>
            <li>they got tangled super easy.</li>
            <li>but I used too high of a heat and kind of fried the ends.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this in the mail</li>
            <li>This is my first set of extensions and was actually pleased with what I received.</li>
            <li>So worth it!</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m pretty pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>A fun addition!</li>
            <li>Was so excited to order these</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just so excited to wear them out.</li>
            <li>and I was just like &#x27;how does a full head fit in this&#x27;.</li>
            <li>super cheap.</li>
            <li>The hair is was beautiful when I first got it, however after wearing it several times it started getting frizzy and the synthetic material started tangling to the point where I could not use it.</li>
            <li>So you have to cut it apart and add your own clips to get more tracks to make it look like its your actual hair.</li>
            <li>kind of stringy, really made for super straight hair, wasn&#x27;t really able to curl but still used them.</li>
            <li>Good investment I will gladly buy more in the near future !</li>
            <li>Not the right color, tangles way too easily</li>
            <li>They are just as good if anything better than my other ones I get.</li>
            <li>I got this and a $12 full head</li>
            <li>I wish they was full head</li>
            <li>I did not receive a full head.</li>
            <li>Besides my own fault, the hair feels like plastic, looks like plastic, and doesn&#x27;t blend well with natural hair at all.</li>
            <li>When I got it, it wasn&#x27;t a full head clip in like it say on here.</li>
            <li>I wanted a full hair,you described it as full head,all I saw was just one piece of hair</li>
            <li>Overall good product</li>
            <li>The good thing, I only lost about $7,00.</li>
            <li>They are as decribed a one full piece it has 5 clips on it</li>
            <li>but you would need some 3 clip ones to get a full head of hair.</li>
            <li>I thought it meant full set</li>
            <li>But overall good product.</li>
            <li>Thank you for such a good product</li>
            <li>I bought these extensions just for trial purposes, before I go out and spend over $100.00 on a full set.</li>
            <li>the label said &amp;#34;straight full head clip in hair&amp;#34; its just one track not the full head.</li>
            <li>Thought I would of gotten a full set of extension</li>
            <li>the \\&quot;full head\\&quot; didnt blend well.</li>
            <li>They are cheap and I do not even know if they are worth the 40 bucks.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re wanting extensions, its better to just spend the money on real hair.</li>
            <li>I have thick hair and it blends perfectly!</li>
            <li>Only looks good up in a ponytail.</li>
            <li>Other than that it was great, make sure you trim the ends because they felt very burned and knotted.</li>
            <li>but it didnt fit my head right.</li>
            <li>is smooth,lovely, has several clips so secure to real hair and will blend with your own hair seamlessly with appropriate blending, trimming, or whichever method yourself or your stylist feels helps to blend this full head silky straight smooth clip in extension with your own</li>
            <li>The hair is really soft and very full though!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d enjoy a slightly smaller set of say 2 3-clip pieces in a lighter color that I could use alternatively to these to achieve highlights (with my own darker hair sandwiched in between).</li>
            <li>The package arrived so quickly.</li>
            <li>Sometimes you get lucky</li>
            <li>all the clips fell out.. super glue wouldnt even help..</li>
            <li>I think you should try these out if you are looking to do something fun with your hair for special occasions like halloween.</li>
            <li>plus it is pretty cheap.</li>
            <li>if you use low heat you can curl or straighten I&#x27;m very pleased</li>
            <li>Colour not dark brown but more light auburn.</li>
            <li>loved them matched my hair perfectly really long</li>
            <li>But if your looking for long term you need to get off here and spend a couple hundred on a good pair for extensions .</li>
            <li>Hair is the right length but is in no way a \\&quot;full head\\&quot; clip.</li>
            <li>Also tangles easily while straight.</li>
            <li>The color is too dark, so I probably will not be able to wear it since it doesn&#x27;t match my own hair color.</li>
            <li>Well packaged and it arrived exactly on time!</li>
            <li>WHICH IS THE ONLY THING I DISLIKED,BUT OTHERWISE HECK YA LOVE EM!</li>
            <li>These look completely real and they&#x27;re 10 dollars!!</li>
            <li>would be great if it was the right color so for those with dark brown hair like the pic</li>
            <li>They came earlier then expected which is always super awesome.  </li>
            <li>If you going to wear the hair straight this is fine, you can NOT curl this hair trust me</li>
            <li>They are also super long which I love!</li>
            <li>It is amazing, i use it to make a big braid...</li>
            <li>They feel like horse hair and cannot be washed which is a big problem if you want to smell nice .</li>
            <li>For what I paid, it was worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really good for the price, but if you have thick hair you are going to need more than one.</li>
            <li>ITEM IS NOT QUALITY AND WORTH THE EFFORT.</li>
            <li>expected more hair and a better color.</li>
            <li>for the price I think it was worth the buy.</li>
            <li>But fun to wear for a night out....</li>
            <li>Easily worth it for the money.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled and just bought a second one!!!</li>
            <li>Way worth 5 bucks.</li>
            <li>Well worth the 5 bucks</li>
            <li>and it was light browns and red more like a chesnut color</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s definitely fun to play around with.</li>
            <li>But I just saw an ad for secretextentions.com and it looks way more natural</li>
            <li>They are silky and fun to wear...</li>
            <li>received them oct.20th), but it&#x27;s so worth</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money</li>
            <li>but worth what i paid for</li>
            <li>I thought maybe they were worth the wait</li>
            <li>It was silky and soft but it does have a static.</li>
            <li>its more of a reddish brown, but its very soft and shinny and came very fast.</li>
            <li>This is super shiny, unnaturally shiny, and does not look very real.  </li>
            <li>They arrived pretty quickly as well..  </li>
            <li>And it wasn&#x27;t the right color.</li>
            <li>but you get what yuu paid for ^-^ right?</li>
            <li>Not the right color though.</li>
            <li>so now I can&#x27;t wear them because it doesn&#x27;t look right</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t the right color.</li>
            <li>the blend right in with my hair.</li>
            <li>;, right?</li>
            <li>Wasnt the right color</li>
            <li>not bad overall - more one time use</li>
            <li>They lay down smoothly under a layer of your own hair.  </li>
            <li>My first order got lost in the mail, but the seller was an absolute angel!!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it with this hairpiece in a lighter shade (the dark brown matches my own shade pretty well), but I think there&#x27;s probably too much hair in it to result in believable highlights.</li>
            <li>Happy for the price I paid since I wasn&#x27;t sure what I was expecting, but unhappy I would need two to fit on my head.</li>
            <li>very plastic feeling, but true to color and length</li>
            <li>Its nice and long.</li>
            <li>I took it out and continued to brush it to get all of the other loose strands out, and most of it seems well anchored, but the quality of the sewn portion is just not that great.  </li>
            <li>it have a nice color and felt like real hair, but that&#x27;s the only god thing about it.</li>
            <li>they are very silky and super georgous</li>
            <li>really expected better, a clip was broke when i recieved it, but it was cheap.</li>
            <li>but they came in a more reddish tint rather than a darker brown than I asked for their nice quality and they&#x27;re thick</li>
            <li>cause if they move at all they get tangled, I would recomend them for an occasion but not everyday wear, way to much of a hassel and to many trips to the bathroom to comb them.</li>
            <li>and I got a light brown/reddish but other then that its perfectly fine !</li>
            <li>Very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S SUPER THICK AND AMAZING!</li>
            <li>arrived here very fast</li>
            <li>It sheds a little as well as tangles but over all a good product.</li>
            <li>Yes, it doesn&#x27;t feel exactly real, but it looks pretty close!</li>
            <li>and it tangles fast but very soft and easy to brush and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s obviously not real hair, but it blends in decently with my own, even if it has a definite tint of auburn (which my own hair doesn&#x27;t).</li>
            <li>but I got some good one&#x27;s the only thing is that sew the clips on a little better</li>
            <li>This was my first time purchasing hair extension</li>
            <li>It was my first time ordering extensions</li>
            <li>I guess I should have read the description better and saw that this is only one weft of hair.</li>
            <li>FIRST OF ALL</li>
            <li>But it was worth my 5 dollars haha</li>
            <li>but they blended in pretty well for me.</li>
            <li>you cant even tell they aren&#x27;t my real hair!</li>
            <li>Overall, I love this piece and wish to purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li>I am an avid hair extension user.</li>
            <li>I normally use 100g natural hair extensions that come in 5 packs and love them, but they are around $100.  </li>
            <li>She liked them and they were exactly what she expected.</li>
            <li>Pretty.</li>
            <li>These were my first set of extensions that I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>the color of the ones that I got were more medium brown with red undertones.  </li>
            <li>I ordered these for prom mostly and a couple other events to change things up and have fun!</li>
            <li>Definitely buying more.</li>
            <li>Alright, first off...</li>
            <li>Other than that, I love them!</li>
            <li>;).</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s actually a really pretty brown)</li>
            <li>For 5$ its an om product, Ive bought Better For The Same Price.</li>
            <li>Its really pretty</li>
            <li>the only thing i did not like is that it is a&lt;br /&gt;little static .</li>
            <li>I do love this piece I just got it today finally</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>I wish it was of higher quality</li>
            <li>and it was replaced with a lighter auburn than the first.  </li>
            <li>Good buy but not for everyday wear.</li>
            <li>They also don&#x27;t stay in your hair good, falls out unless you bobby pin it in and is also heavy.</li>
            <li>Hair arrived way early and it is super soft and very full.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m pretty excited about them.  </li>
            <li>Their beautiful but like all synthetic extensions they get tangled but other than that they look like human hair .</li>
            <li>Tangles super easily and looks and feels like false hair unless it&#x27;s worked into some kind of hair style.</li>
            <li>Earlier I left a rating that was not as good, but I&#x27;d like to update it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so they last longer and to apply some glue for extension to keeps the hair in place other than this thing I have talked about they are great.</li>
            <li>Got this pretty fast, used them.</li>
            <li>is soft and long... :) still wishing they got my order correct!</li>
            <li>Really pretty thanks.</li>
            <li>they better be for taking this long.</li>
            <li>Not as dark as they look on screen but nice texture.</li>
            <li>Anyway they were shiny and super soft.</li>
            <li>it does tanlge easy and big chunks of hair started falling off.</li>
            <li>it is super silky and soft and has not tangled on me yet.</li>
            <li>Not only did it smell of a strong plastic smell but the hairs are so shiny.</li>
            <li>have another of these that I purchased from ebay, almost exactly the same color when held side-by-side, and exactly the same length &amp; product description, but the mesh was larger, there is just a tad more hair, and the hair is much better anchored.  </li>
            <li>So the product is nice, came in a little package, I didn&#x27;t realize it was the extensions.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very unnatural-looking and get so knotty and tangled .</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear them much anymore</li>
            <li>Very silky and straight.</li>
            <li>Thanks guys</li>
            <li>, it looked real felt real.</li>
            <li>i decided to curl it, i reas alot of reviewea and people said ut wouldnt curl, but it curled really well.</li>
            <li>she wants to make her&lt;br /&gt;hair</li>
            <li>again if she wants it thanx bunches...</li>
            <li>I really recommend it.</li>
            <li>although the extensions blend well, they don&#x27;t really add a lot (maybe a change of 5% in the direction of increased volume as opposed to an 80% increase in volume appearance when braided).</li>
            <li>It advertised real hair, can be dyed.  </li>
            <li>but it is also very shiny</li>
            <li>My husband loves it and couldn&#x27;t tell where my real hair ended.</li>
            <li>Very well packaged.</li>
            <li>It had came very knotted up.</li>
            <li>the hair gets really tangly and i threw it out ...</li>
            <li>So I can&#x27;t wear them together really, but for the price it can&#x27;t really be beat.</li>
            <li>but it does look and feel like real hair.  </li>
            <li>so keep in made your going to have straight hair.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really mind.</li>
            <li>The picture makes it look way thicker and duller than it really is.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It handled the heat from my curling wand very well.</li>
            <li>They do look real.</li>
            <li>Everyone believes it&#x27;s my real hair.</li>
            <li>and i was hoping to find just a straight set of extensions just to mix it up every now and then</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much</li>
            <li>straight to the garbage,</li>
            <li>And very manageable..</li>
            <li>I really like it .</li>
            <li>For the price I wasn&#x27;t expecting much</li>
            <li>Did not blend and very noticeable, went straight to the trash 👎</li>
            <li>but it gets really tangled</li>
            <li>They are very then and smell like plastic</li>
            <li>I like it, but I was hoping it would cover the whole head not just one part.</li>
            <li>Really couldn&#x27;t style it the way I wanted to</li>
            <li>Very affordable .</li>
            <li>So I cannot use unless I am ready to color my hair that color..</li>
            <li>it took 2 weeks longer than it was supposed to to get here, and they are very tangled and the hair falls out a lot.</li>
            <li>I have ordered real hair for 100 dollars before.</li>
            <li>i tried curling them on my wand that heats up to 410° but they didnt really curl..</li>
            <li>I have only worn my extensions for a day and so far ok</li>
            <li>the hair is so soft!!!</li>
            <li>It gets tangled extremely easy and it comes in one track 6 or 7 inches long.</li>
            <li>so I was glad I got the other ones.</li>
            <li>But other then my mistake I love them.</li>
            <li>May look ok if you have other pieces to blend it all in.</li>
            <li>I love my other extensions that have the curl to them</li>
            <li>the dark brown was very light brown &amp;</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m in love with how long and naturally it</li>
            <li>the hair is nice but its only one and it takes to long to come in.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t be able to wear these with my hair straight and down because you can tell, but I bought two of them and that way you can.</li>
            <li>I just wish it didn&#x27;t take so long to ship, but free shipping?</li>
            <li>Its more a medium brown than dark brown, but it blended it</li>
            <li>so they don&#x27;t look exactly like your natural hair</li>
            <li>Small miscommunication though and my own fault</li>
            <li>I ordered the dark brown colors, and it was more on a copper brown.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong thase extension are BEAUTIFUL</li>
            <li>Cute but not for thick hair or for length if ur trying to make ur hair look fuller and its the same legnth as the extensions they are ok</li>
            <li>I thought they were going to be dark brown, but instead, they are more of a medium brown...</li>
            <li>the color was not the correct one, they where more burgandy color then dark brown did not like them not completly satisfide.</li>
            <li>It says full head but its only one piece..</li>
            <li>When I first opened the package, the hair was soo soft.</li>
            <li>I will reorder new ones today!</li>
            <li>and unfortunately I live in a windy state!</li>
            <li>straight, it was extremely shiny, and easily tangled.  </li>
            <li>I ordered them in july I ordered 4 and only one has came so far, other wise</li>
            <li>I open it and it is very soft, shinny and the color is really rich.</li>
            <li>look better than glued in ones my aunt paid over a hundred dollars for. and took out in less than a week</li>
            <li>Decent product for the price.</li>
            <li>The color brown is super red.</li>
            <li>, I wanted to have thicker hair, particularly for braided hairdos and let me tell you with these extensions my hair is humongous.</li>
            <li>Overall SO SATISFIED with the quality, especially for what I paid.</li>
            <li>these shed but the shipping is decent and i think you would like it for a night out or something</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s totally fine with me as I ordered these only for occasional wear and the clips aren&#x27;t really comfortable enough to wear all the time imo.</li>
            <li>Secondly, it looks exactly like real hair and is sewn in very well.</li>
            <li>They are super long and they matched my hair color really well.</li>
            <li>Silky, well put together, and high quality.</li>
            <li>The clips are a little bit too wide for my head surprisingly and I have a rather large head</li>
            <li>Hair was not very natural looking and is described as full head?</li>
            <li>so I learned I need additional ones with shorter lengths to get a natural blend since my real hair is it my shoulders and</li>
            <li>the hair feels and looks real just cannot get it to look natural and stay in place.</li>
            <li>I was just looking for something fun and different for Halloween.</li>
            <li>my normal hair</li>
            <li>You can brush it like normal hair.</li>
            <li>They are full and thick, one group so easier to instal, the hair was smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>so overall these extensions are worth it for the price..</li>
            <li>Not thick enough and not the right color.</li>
            <li>But got to keep the product got a half of what I paid which was nice considering the low price I paid for it</li>
            <li>I got the dark brown ones and I have brown black hair, the color is a bit off but still looks nice!</li>
            <li>I really liked the idea of having a fake 1-piece hair extension to use for quick on the go thickening of my hair.  </li>
            <li>These are very long and quite full.</li>
            <li>so if you are thinking that this may be an issue I would recommend single clips instead of a full head clip.</li>
            <li>so they are sending out a new one</li>
            <li>so it like a live</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to persons new to using clip in hair extensions.&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li>I live in jersey .</li>
            <li>I love these so much, I actually cut mine in half so that so much weight wasn&#x27;t on one section of my hair</li>
            <li>When you advertise and say whole head it makes one think that it will be enough hair to cover the whole head</li>
            <li>Just pay a few extra dollars for a nice one</li>
            <li>so i know what looks good and doesnt look good but trust me when i say these are AWFUL!!</li>
            <li>It felt very soft but it kept tangling at the ends.</li>
            <li>and it is very soft and shinny.</li>
            <li>I ordered dark brown and they came light brown.</li>
            <li>Complete waist of money!</li>
            <li>SO BE PREPARED FOR ONLY STRAIGHT HAIR!</li>
            <li>dark drown is too light.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t even fit half my head</li>
            <li>I cannot honestly  give you any other information other than what she gave me</li>
            <li>Honestly its pretty and straight but very brittle and hard to brush feels alot like fake hair and the band is to long for most hair types</li>
            <li>but the other ones was by the hand full and this one the hair comes out if you touch them a lot.</li>
            <li>As i brushed through more than half of the hair got soo tangled that i had to cut it, It ended up me never having a chance to wear them because they had to be thrown out within the hour of buying.</li>
            <li>It is super shiny, light and thin.</li>
            <li>Even in a ponytail you can clearly see the difference.</li>
            <li>your hair is naturally &amp;#34;Black&amp;#34; I recommend getting the &amp;#34;Dark</li>
            <li>Received my package early.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any real shedding, although I have brushed through these.</li>
            <li>and they actually held the curl really well without hairspray or anything.</li>
            <li>When I opened them, they were really soft &amp; silky.</li>
            <li>match n looks so natural no one can tell when I&#x27;m wearing it.</li>
            <li>but the second set I got was stick straight like in the photo.</li>
            <li>but you can still see my real hair peering through, so with a second</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how soft these extensions are.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly</li>
            <li>somehow managed to make it work and made them look natural</li>
            <li>My daughter ordered these hair extensions and they look completely natural.  </li>
            <li>Color was completely off.  </li>
            <li>but it was really soft and stays put.</li>
            <li>It also looks natural.</li>
            <li>i got them so early on OCT31  </li>
            <li>it is long and not fake looking at all.&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li>but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>the hair is really soft.</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>The hair was shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t true Dark Brown.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t true Dark Brown.</li>
            <li>Kind of poor quality. .</li>
            <li>Also, good quality and doesn&#x27;t look completely fake.</li>
            <li>I had my hair braided (single braid) for about 7 hours today and when I un-did my hair the extensions were still very straight</li>
            <li>Also, sometimes I find that I have to try several times before a clip closes, based on the position and the curvature of my head, but with the other 4 clips securely in place it would probably still not slide.</li>
            <li>Other than that they are fun to wear.</li>
            <li>Many people felt it looked very real, however I would never let anyone touch my hair because of how fake it felt.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s SUPER soft and came earlier than expected.</li>
            <li>I ordered dark brown, the color I recieved was light brown with a red tone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun to add volume to short hair when worn as a long ponytail</li>
            <li>So long and soft and looks so real.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was a little different than what I had expected, but Overall it is a good product.</li>
            <li>or else I didn&#x27;t clip it in high enough.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this vendor for future purchases and products.</li>
            <li>I really didnt like they just looked really bad on and didnt have a good smell they also didnt feel soft</li>
            <li>I ended up getting two of these because one was not thick enough for my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overly shiny (as in fake shiny), but also not the silkiest hair either which makes it tangle a bit, but so far I&#x27;ve been able to deal with that very well with a bit of patience.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Was so  excited when these came nice packaging really soft , but the thing I disliked about these is that they were shiny looked so fake</li>
            <li>It looks plastic and the color is not dark brown.</li>
            <li>Not dark brown at all</li>
            <li>Not dark brown.</li>
            <li>it is NOT dark brown.</li>
            <li>but I expected the color to be a little bit more darker.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I ordered the dark brown color, and the length was right.</li>
            <li>I knew I wasn&#x27;t expecting much paying $5, at most I was hoping to wear it as a gag/costume if it was the wrong color.</li>
            <li>I was concerned that they would look too obviously synthetic, but they actually blend with my hair much better than any of the real, and infinitely more expensive, extensions that I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li>i would say it is more black then dark brown.</li>
            <li>The dark brown color was more like black.</li>
            <li>First of all, they were black, not dark brown, so the color didn&#x27;t match my hair.</li>
            <li>Was not the best quality, it ripped right away, also got knotted up badly and was very hard to brush out.</li>
            <li>pretty heavy, and the clips to hold hair well, they dont really hold it long before they fall out.</li>
            <li>I gave it to my 10yr old to play with and threw it out the same day.</li>
            <li>I cut it into 3 strips a few days ago because it just didn&#x27;t look right in my hair</li>
            <li>but i would not buy if u are looking to use it more than a few times because it starts to tangle and look like a knotty mess</li>
            <li>I put them on along with my other extensions (real humar hair)</li>
            <li>Also it&#x27;s red brown not dark brown at all.</li>
            <li>The extensions were not dark brown (2), they are auburn (red) brown (4)</li>
            <li>At only $5 with free shipping you should buy at least 3....</li>
            <li>do not get this item it only comes with one thin piece of hair i can go Anywere and get a better item</li>
            <li>They came earlier than expected and they are so soft!!!</li>
            <li>FIRST OF ALL I ORDERED DARK BROWN HAIR!</li>
            <li>The first package arrived and the hair was a little bit wavy (possibly from the packaging?)</li>
            <li>it is only one tract and has a net in it, they are cheap and its fake hair so if you want real do not buy these</li>
            <li>they got broken and the hairs gets tangled so easily.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that they are pretty heavy</li>
            <li>They also do not curl or style in any other way than just being plain straight which was very upsetting as I planned to curl my hair for prom.</li>
            <li>They are a little fake looking, very shiny, the only thing I don&#x27;t like is you cant comb them, they get tangled very easy.</li>
            <li>I already happen to have really long hair (going down to my waist which is even a bit longer than the extensions, but, again, it depends on where on your head you choose to clip them in - i.e. higher and closer to the crown or lower)</li>
            <li>The hair came earlier than expected, it was carefully packaged and exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised since the price was so cheap,but it is so soft and thick the color is different than a normal hair color</li>
            <li>I was excited until I got the package and realized it was a long thick strip of plastic hair.</li>
            <li>I figure for the money I won&#x27;t have much to lose, I was a little worried because of some of the reviews I read on them</li>
            <li>The hair was really shiny, but I brushed a little baby powder on there</li>
            <li>Loved the hair only bad thing is that it tangles.</li>

            <li> Brilliant product,and exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li> They are amazing...</li>
            <li> The seller was nice after I paid for the extensions.</li>
            <li> Product came nicely packaged and on time.</li>
            <li> The color did not match at all, but that is not any ones fault but my own.  </li>
            <li> The clips are also nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice but you CANT STRAIGHTEN IT OR CURL IT &amp;</li>
            <li> , this hair extension makes me feel good about myself :)</li>
            <li> The shipping was surprisingly fast, and the extensions are the best hair-related purchase I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
            <li> Well, it looks nice when you take it out of the package.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear it often, but it comes in handy when I want to switch things up a bit.</li>
            <li> Quality is nice</li>
            <li> , they kind of clump up</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to pay that kind of money.</li>
            <li> use any kind of iron (flat/curler) on them or the hair will melt.</li>
            <li> so everything was kind of a disaster .</li>
            <li> and they still look nice</li>
            <li> They came packaged nicely (by nicely</li>
            <li> It was really nice</li>
            <li> Clip in nicely depending on your head frame.</li>
            <li> I thought I liked them</li>
            <li> so what i did was i would wrap it around the wand and then &amp;#34;curled&amp;#34; it up with my fingers (kind of the way you do.. when doing the &amp;#34;no heat&amp;#34; curls)</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted for a very good price.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was very good, but when I got it it was so tangled</li>
            <li> really love it excellent product they look almost real.</li>
            <li> Great price for product, needs to be washed to eliminate the super shine look.</li>
            <li> Also the clips in them broke very easily.</li>
            <li> Again I love it.! :)</li>
            <li> Good length ,good color , delivering was very fast</li>
            <li> I liked the fact that the seller was understanding and told me things that more sellers wouldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> the item came early, the color and texture match my hair perfectly....</li>
            <li> to be honest, Barbie hair is better.</li>
            <li> I have natural curly hair , and when I straightened my hair they blended amazingly 400 thumbs up!!!!</li>
            <li> nd got tangled veryyyy easy!</li>
            <li> it worked great forthe first month....</li>
            <li> Overall the price was good and the product was good!</li>
            <li> The extensions were beautiful and real looking when I received them.  </li>
            <li> , actually very light brown.  </li>
            <li> But it shipped quickly and nicely, looks nice when you brush it for like 4 or 5 minutes,</li>
            <li> then its okay reminds me of a very cheap brand of weave</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product not only is the price very cheap</li>
            <li> AND LITERALLY A HUGE CHUNK OF HAIR CAME OUT!</li>
            <li> and this was better than them.</li>
            <li> They did take time to get to me but in my eyes that was okay.</li>
            <li> and I recommend ordering more than one or from another place as to get side pieces.</li>
            <li> they are okay for the price, the color a bit off</li>
            <li> okay....</li>
            <li> I love them</li>
            <li> :) I got them in 2 weeks&lt;</li>
            <li> so I might cut it to blend in better.</li>
            <li> all my friends love it</li>
            <li> but it is very inexpensive and great</li>
            <li> i love it</li>
            <li> When u put them in I was in love.</li>
            <li> so cuz of that u will need 2 or more pieces.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> The hair doesn&#x27;t fall out or tangle, and I was even able to use styling products on it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> cost is more then the hair cost.</li>
            <li> It had more of a reddish tint to it.</li>
            <li> Having never bought extensions before, I wasn&#x27;t totally sure what to expect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> I would probably buy 2 more so it can match the thickness of my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the problem would be solved.</li>
            <li> Which I like way better then</li>
            <li> Will be ordering some more.</li>
            <li> Am ordering one more for a friend.</li>
            <li> May buy more</li>
            <li> but overall does the job perfectly</li>
            <li> It had more of a reddish tint to it.</li>
            <li> I love the hair</li>
            <li> maybe those ones will be better.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> Yep-garbage!!! :-)</li>
            <li> Everything was okay considering what I paid for it.</li>
            <li> but my hair matches perfectly and last all day</li>
            <li> They were okay when I got them the clips were coming off from the extensions and</li>
            <li> on top of that they wouldn&#x27;t curl at all for me.</li>
            <li> Overall, this hair piece is great for the price!</li>
            <li> and if you brush them they look better.</li>
            <li> I just wish they had more of selection of colors.</li>
            <li> Static static static.</li>
            <li> sure you buy more then one and make sure its the color you need.</li>
            <li> But in overall, the product is great comparing to the price and the seller is awesome , very oriented to the customer service.</li>
            <li> I would buy again :)</li>
            <li> Love love love love love.</li>
            <li> i absolutley LOVE hair extensions</li>
            <li> I love my hair extensions...</li>
            <li> I think that it would look better curled.</li>
            <li> Ok so for the price i was sceptical...</li>
            <li> Im glad</li>
            <li> and I think they were a lot better when cut into 2 pieces.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t regret it more.</li>
            <li> It is ok for a one time wear or to see if you like having them clipped in your head</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m In love with them.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to order more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I am probably going to buy another as I write this because of how pleased I am.</li>
            <li> More like costume hair...</li>
            <li> only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that the hair got is not the best quality .</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> but the fry very easily and also tangle easily ...  </li>
            <li> not only were these awesome extensions beautiful and look like natural hair</li>
            <li> but after I cut the extensions and blended it in with my natural hair it looked gorgeous!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super glad I came across these hair extensions!</li>
            <li> this product is definitely ideally for super pin straight hair.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t style these with heat or wash them or anything you&#x27;ll get a couple good wears but don&#x27;t expect too much!</li>
            <li> for the money you get a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> seams good be better made but overall good product.</li>
            <li> But in all its beautiful it has a slight shine but looks just like my real hair and its the perfect length and weight.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t looking for anything super spectacular.</li>
            <li> Very good product, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Very full</li>
            <li> IT GETS VERY TANGLED VERY EASILY!</li>
            <li> It is more of a light to medium brown.</li>
            <li> They give great volume to my already long hair and when braided in the hair does not have any kind of conspicuous shine to give it off asfake.</li>
            <li> If you are just looking for a day look or something like one day use go for the purchase its cheap and replaceable and pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li> and I think these are great love them especially for the price :)</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product but the quality could still be better.</li>
            <li> But, I wasn&#x27;t too upset because it was expected for the price to not be perfect.</li>
            <li> best $22.34 spent</li>
            <li> it really looks good ..</li>
            <li> I loved the carrier because they were very understanding and made me feel as though I was being heard.</li>
            <li> but they get tangled very easily and fast!!</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t come with anything to keep them safe and clean</li>
            <li> It came just like the photo and was so easy to clip in id buy it again</li>
            <li> and I recommend you to use a comb instead of a brush because it does tangle easily.</li>
            <li> It does tangle easily too.  </li>
            <li> Overall great product :)</li>
            <li> Easy to comb, too.</li>
            <li> , you can wash them and curl them and maintaining them is so easy,</li>
            <li> And they get tangled too easy.</li>
            <li> The hair fell out easy.</li>
            <li> and they are easy to take in and take out .</li>
            <li> They tangle really easy.</li>
            <li> Hair tangles way to easy</li>
            <li> Kinda tangle easily</li>
            <li> Easily adjustable.</li>
            <li> The extensions are of good thickness and look realistic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun to wear but it damages very easily.</li>
            <li> really good quality and very soft!</li>
            <li> good for price does get a little tangled easily but everyone says they look real and not synthetic match my hair perfectly</li>
            <li> Hair was super shiny, and it looked very cheap.</li>
            <li> when I contacted them all they wanted was more money and claimed the detail did not say full head.</li>
            <li> The shipping was nice, looked neat at first .</li>
            <li> It holds curls fine.</li>
            <li> the piece I got looks fine but the hair falls out ALOT</li>
            <li> I bought to of these and the thickness was fine.</li>
            <li> Overall I was pretty impressed by the quality with the price.</li>
            <li> So if you have hair like mine (fine hair)</li>
            <li> They matched my hair perfectly and I love the length, plus the price was unbelievable</li>
            <li> I did like the length, i didn&#x27;t like the static either the fact as soon as i pulled them out of their package, they where already falling apart, the hair was just coming off so quickly</li>
            <li> will absolutely buy more!</li>
            <li> Why buy real hair which costs so much more!?</li>
            <li> i have very dark brown hair, it matched perfectly!</li>
            <li> these extensions are very dark brown which is perfect for my hair.</li>
            <li> (maybe I have a huge pumpkin head</li>
            <li> They are great, except it says &amp;#34;six pieces&amp;#34; but it was just one total clip in piece.</li>
            <li> I ordered another one because it wasn&#x27;t quite enough to fill my head, but for the price these are great.</li>
            <li> Turns out it looks light brown ....</li>
            <li> Although this hair looked really nice on, it was very staticy</li>
            <li> i do not recommend what so ever, the color is to light</li>
            <li> and they came light brown</li>
            <li> but the extensions didn&#x27;t fit for me.)</li>
            <li> cheap but will do.</li>
            <li> Kinda heavy but look great!!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect anything from this order, I was just browsing &amp; saw them for cheap,</li>
            <li> yes they were cheap but they didn&#x27;t come on time before Christmas</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a light auburn color.</li>
            <li> THE HAIR QUALITY IS CHEAP</li>
            <li> AND IF YOU DON&#x27;T HAVE SILKY SMOOTH HAIR</li>
            <li> got this for my daughter and she loved it except we thought it would be more thicker and fuller if we ordered a second one</li>
            <li> It was long and beautiful.</li>
            <li> and it was beautiful and long, just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful very long and cheap.</li>
            <li> The hair itself is real looking and a very nice gift for the price you really can&#x27;t beat it</li>
            <li> This hair is very long and beautiful.</li>
            <li> and I can run my flat iron and brush through them (gently) and its just awesome how they come out looking.</li>
            <li> When I bought this I was excited,  a cheaply priced hair extension</li>
            <li> they got tangled super easy.</li>
            <li> but I used too high of a heat and kind of fried the ends.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this in the mail</li>
            <li> This is my first set of extensions and was actually pleased with what I received.</li>
            <li> So worth it!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m pretty pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> A fun addition!</li>
            <li> Was so excited to order these</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just so excited to wear them out.</li>
            <li> and I was just like &#x27;how does a full head fit in this&#x27;.</li>
            <li> super cheap.</li>
            <li> The hair is was beautiful when I first got it, however after wearing it several times it started getting frizzy and the synthetic material started tangling to the point where I could not use it.</li>
            <li> So you have to cut it apart and add your own clips to get more tracks to make it look like its your actual hair.</li>
            <li> kind of stringy, really made for super straight hair, wasn&#x27;t really able to curl but still used them.</li>
            <li> Good investment I will gladly buy more in the near future !</li>
            <li> Not the right color, tangles way too easily</li>
            <li> They are just as good if anything better than my other ones I get.</li>
            <li> I got this and a $12 full head</li>
            <li> I wish they was full head</li>
            <li> I did not receive a full head.</li>
            <li> Besides my own fault, the hair feels like plastic, looks like plastic, and doesn&#x27;t blend well with natural hair at all.</li>
            <li> When I got it, it wasn&#x27;t a full head clip in like it say on here.</li>
            <li> I wanted a full hair,you described it as full head,all I saw was just one piece of hair</li>
            <li> Overall good product</li>
            <li> The good thing, I only lost about $7,00.</li>
            <li> They are as decribed a one full piece it has 5 clips on it</li>
            <li> but you would need some 3 clip ones to get a full head of hair.</li>
            <li> I thought it meant full set</li>
            <li> But overall good product.</li>
            <li> Thank you for such a good product</li>
            <li> I bought these extensions just for trial purposes, before I go out and spend over $100.00 on a full set.</li>
            <li> the label said &amp;#34;straight full head clip in hair&amp;#34; its just one track not the full head.</li>
            <li> Thought I would of gotten a full set of extension</li>
            <li> the \\&quot;full head\\&quot; didnt blend well.</li>
            <li> They are cheap and I do not even know if they are worth the 40 bucks.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re wanting extensions, its better to just spend the money on real hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and it blends perfectly!</li>
            <li> Only looks good up in a ponytail.</li>
            <li> Other than that it was great, make sure you trim the ends because they felt very burned and knotted.</li>
            <li> but it didnt fit my head right.</li>
            <li> is smooth,lovely, has several clips so secure to real hair and will blend with your own hair seamlessly with appropriate blending, trimming, or whichever method yourself or your stylist feels helps to blend this full head silky straight smooth clip in extension with your own</li>
            <li> The hair is really soft and very full though!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d enjoy a slightly smaller set of say 2 3-clip pieces in a lighter color that I could use alternatively to these to achieve highlights (with my own darker hair sandwiched in between).</li>
            <li> The package arrived so quickly.</li>
            <li> Sometimes you get lucky</li>
            <li> all the clips fell out.. super glue wouldnt even help..</li>
            <li> I think you should try these out if you are looking to do something fun with your hair for special occasions like halloween.</li>
            <li> plus it is pretty cheap.</li>
            <li> if you use low heat you can curl or straighten I&#x27;m very pleased</li>
            <li> Colour not dark brown but more light auburn.</li>
            <li> loved them matched my hair perfectly really long</li>
            <li> But if your looking for long term you need to get off here and spend a couple hundred on a good pair for extensions .</li>
            <li> Hair is the right length but is in no way a \\&quot;full head\\&quot; clip.</li>
            <li> Also tangles easily while straight.</li>
            <li> The color is too dark, so I probably will not be able to wear it since it doesn&#x27;t match my own hair color.</li>
            <li> Well packaged and it arrived exactly on time!</li>
            <li> WHICH IS THE ONLY THING I DISLIKED,BUT OTHERWISE HECK YA LOVE EM!</li>
            <li> These look completely real and they&#x27;re 10 dollars!!</li>
            <li> would be great if it was the right color so for those with dark brown hair like the pic</li>
            <li> They came earlier then expected which is always super awesome.  </li>
            <li> If you going to wear the hair straight this is fine, you can NOT curl this hair trust me</li>
            <li> They are also super long which I love!</li>
            <li> It is amazing, i use it to make a big braid...</li>
            <li> They feel like horse hair and cannot be washed which is a big problem if you want to smell nice .</li>
            <li> For what I paid, it was worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good for the price, but if you have thick hair you are going to need more than one.</li>
            <li> ITEM IS NOT QUALITY AND WORTH THE EFFORT.</li>
            <li> expected more hair and a better color.</li>
            <li> for the price I think it was worth the buy.</li>
            <li> But fun to wear for a night out....</li>
            <li> Easily worth it for the money.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled and just bought a second one!!!</li>
            <li> Way worth 5 bucks.</li>
            <li> Well worth the 5 bucks</li>
            <li> and it was light browns and red more like a chesnut color</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s definitely fun to play around with.</li>
            <li> But I just saw an ad for secretextentions.com and it looks way more natural</li>
            <li> They are silky and fun to wear...</li>
            <li> received them oct.20th), but it&#x27;s so worth</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money</li>
            <li> but worth what i paid for</li>
            <li> I thought maybe they were worth the wait</li>
            <li> It was silky and soft but it does have a static.</li>
            <li> its more of a reddish brown, but its very soft and shinny and came very fast.</li>
            <li> This is super shiny, unnaturally shiny, and does not look very real.  </li>
            <li> They arrived pretty quickly as well..  </li>
            <li> And it wasn&#x27;t the right color.</li>
            <li> but you get what yuu paid for ^-^ right?</li>
            <li> Not the right color though.</li>
            <li> so now I can&#x27;t wear them because it doesn&#x27;t look right</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t the right color.</li>
            <li> the blend right in with my hair.</li>
            <li> ;, right?</li>
            <li> Wasnt the right color</li>
            <li> not bad overall - more one time use</li>
            <li> They lay down smoothly under a layer of your own hair.  </li>
            <li> My first order got lost in the mail, but the seller was an absolute angel!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it with this hairpiece in a lighter shade (the dark brown matches my own shade pretty well), but I think there&#x27;s probably too much hair in it to result in believable highlights.</li>
            <li> Happy for the price I paid since I wasn&#x27;t sure what I was expecting, but unhappy I would need two to fit on my head.</li>
            <li> very plastic feeling, but true to color and length</li>
            <li> Its nice and long.</li>
            <li> I took it out and continued to brush it to get all of the other loose strands out, and most of it seems well anchored, but the quality of the sewn portion is just not that great.  </li>
            <li> it have a nice color and felt like real hair, but that&#x27;s the only god thing about it.</li>
            <li> they are very silky and super georgous</li>
            <li> really expected better, a clip was broke when i recieved it, but it was cheap.</li>
            <li> but they came in a more reddish tint rather than a darker brown than I asked for their nice quality and they&#x27;re thick</li>
            <li> cause if they move at all they get tangled, I would recomend them for an occasion but not everyday wear, way to much of a hassel and to many trips to the bathroom to comb them.</li>
            <li> and I got a light brown/reddish but other then that its perfectly fine !</li>
            <li> Very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S SUPER THICK AND AMAZING!</li>
            <li> arrived here very fast</li>
            <li> It sheds a little as well as tangles but over all a good product.</li>
            <li> Yes, it doesn&#x27;t feel exactly real, but it looks pretty close!</li>
            <li> and it tangles fast but very soft and easy to brush and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s obviously not real hair, but it blends in decently with my own, even if it has a definite tint of auburn (which my own hair doesn&#x27;t).</li>
            <li> but I got some good one&#x27;s the only thing is that sew the clips on a little better</li>
            <li> This was my first time purchasing hair extension</li>
            <li> It was my first time ordering extensions</li>
            <li> I guess I should have read the description better and saw that this is only one weft of hair.</li>
            <li> FIRST OF ALL</li>
            <li> But it was worth my 5 dollars haha</li>
            <li> but they blended in pretty well for me.</li>
            <li> you cant even tell they aren&#x27;t my real hair!</li>
            <li> Overall, I love this piece and wish to purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> I am an avid hair extension user.</li>
            <li> I normally use 100g natural hair extensions that come in 5 packs and love them, but they are around $100.  </li>
            <li> She liked them and they were exactly what she expected.</li>
            <li> Pretty.</li>
            <li> These were my first set of extensions that I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> the color of the ones that I got were more medium brown with red undertones.  </li>
            <li> I ordered these for prom mostly and a couple other events to change things up and have fun!</li>
            <li> Definitely buying more.</li>
            <li> Alright, first off...</li>
            <li> Other than that, I love them!</li>
            <li> ;).</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s actually a really pretty brown)</li>
            <li> For 5$ its an om product, Ive bought Better For The Same Price.</li>
            <li> Its really pretty</li>
            <li> the only thing i did not like is that it is a&lt;br /&gt;little static .</li>
            <li> I do love this piece I just got it today finally</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I wish it was of higher quality</li>
            <li> and it was replaced with a lighter auburn than the first.  </li>
            <li> Good buy but not for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> They also don&#x27;t stay in your hair good, falls out unless you bobby pin it in and is also heavy.</li>
            <li> Hair arrived way early and it is super soft and very full.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m pretty excited about them.  </li>
            <li> Their beautiful but like all synthetic extensions they get tangled but other than that they look like human hair .</li>
            <li> Tangles super easily and looks and feels like false hair unless it&#x27;s worked into some kind of hair style.</li>
            <li> Earlier I left a rating that was not as good, but I&#x27;d like to update it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so they last longer and to apply some glue for extension to keeps the hair in place other than this thing I have talked about they are great.</li>
            <li> Got this pretty fast, used them.</li>
            <li> is soft and long... :) still wishing they got my order correct!</li>
            <li> Really pretty thanks.</li>
            <li> they better be for taking this long.</li>
            <li> Not as dark as they look on screen but nice texture.</li>
            <li> Anyway they were shiny and super soft.</li>
            <li> it does tanlge easy and big chunks of hair started falling off.</li>
            <li> it is super silky and soft and has not tangled on me yet.</li>
            <li> Not only did it smell of a strong plastic smell but the hairs are so shiny.</li>
            <li> have another of these that I purchased from ebay, almost exactly the same color when held side-by-side, and exactly the same length &amp; product description, but the mesh was larger, there is just a tad more hair, and the hair is much better anchored.  </li>
            <li> So the product is nice, came in a little package, I didn&#x27;t realize it was the extensions.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very unnatural-looking and get so knotty and tangled .</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear them much anymore</li>
            <li> Very silky and straight.</li>
            <li> Thanks guys</li>
            <li> , it looked real felt real.</li>
            <li> i decided to curl it, i reas alot of reviewea and people said ut wouldnt curl, but it curled really well.</li>
            <li> she wants to make her&lt;br /&gt;hair</li>
            <li> again if she wants it thanx bunches...</li>
            <li> I really recommend it.</li>
            <li> although the extensions blend well, they don&#x27;t really add a lot (maybe a change of 5% in the direction of increased volume as opposed to an 80% increase in volume appearance when braided).</li>
            <li> It advertised real hair, can be dyed.  </li>
            <li> but it is also very shiny</li>
            <li> My husband loves it and couldn&#x27;t tell where my real hair ended.</li>
            <li> Very well packaged.</li>
            <li> It had came very knotted up.</li>
            <li> the hair gets really tangly and i threw it out ...</li>
            <li> So I can&#x27;t wear them together really, but for the price it can&#x27;t really be beat.</li>
            <li> but it does look and feel like real hair.  </li>
            <li> so keep in made your going to have straight hair.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really mind.</li>
            <li> The picture makes it look way thicker and duller than it really is.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It handled the heat from my curling wand very well.</li>
            <li> They do look real.</li>
            <li> Everyone believes it&#x27;s my real hair.</li>
            <li> and i was hoping to find just a straight set of extensions just to mix it up every now and then</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much</li>
            <li> straight to the garbage,</li>
            <li> And very manageable..</li>
            <li> I really like it .</li>
            <li> For the price I wasn&#x27;t expecting much</li>
            <li> Did not blend and very noticeable, went straight to the trash 👎</li>
            <li> but it gets really tangled</li>
            <li> They are very then and smell like plastic</li>
            <li> I like it, but I was hoping it would cover the whole head not just one part.</li>
            <li> Really couldn&#x27;t style it the way I wanted to</li>
            <li> Very affordable .</li>
            <li> So I cannot use unless I am ready to color my hair that color..</li>
            <li> it took 2 weeks longer than it was supposed to to get here, and they are very tangled and the hair falls out a lot.</li>
            <li> I have ordered real hair for 100 dollars before.</li>
            <li> i tried curling them on my wand that heats up to 410° but they didnt really curl..</li>
            <li> I have only worn my extensions for a day and so far ok</li>
            <li> the hair is so soft!!!</li>
            <li> It gets tangled extremely easy and it comes in one track 6 or 7 inches long.</li>
            <li> so I was glad I got the other ones.</li>
            <li> But other then my mistake I love them.</li>
            <li> May look ok if you have other pieces to blend it all in.</li>
            <li> I love my other extensions that have the curl to them</li>
            <li> the dark brown was very light brown &amp;</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m in love with how long and naturally it</li>
            <li> the hair is nice but its only one and it takes to long to come in.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be able to wear these with my hair straight and down because you can tell, but I bought two of them and that way you can.</li>
            <li> I just wish it didn&#x27;t take so long to ship, but free shipping?</li>
            <li> Its more a medium brown than dark brown, but it blended it</li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t look exactly like your natural hair</li>
            <li> Small miscommunication though and my own fault</li>
            <li> I ordered the dark brown colors, and it was more on a copper brown.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong thase extension are BEAUTIFUL</li>
            <li> Cute but not for thick hair or for length if ur trying to make ur hair look fuller and its the same legnth as the extensions they are ok</li>
            <li> I thought they were going to be dark brown, but instead, they are more of a medium brown...</li>
            <li> the color was not the correct one, they where more burgandy color then dark brown did not like them not completly satisfide.</li>
            <li> It says full head but its only one piece..</li>
            <li> When I first opened the package, the hair was soo soft.</li>
            <li> I will reorder new ones today!</li>
            <li> and unfortunately I live in a windy state!</li>
            <li> straight, it was extremely shiny, and easily tangled.  </li>
            <li> I ordered them in july I ordered 4 and only one has came so far, other wise</li>
            <li> I open it and it is very soft, shinny and the color is really rich.</li>
            <li> look better than glued in ones my aunt paid over a hundred dollars for. and took out in less than a week</li>
            <li> Decent product for the price.</li>
            <li> The color brown is super red.</li>
            <li> , I wanted to have thicker hair, particularly for braided hairdos and let me tell you with these extensions my hair is humongous.</li>
            <li> Overall SO SATISFIED with the quality, especially for what I paid.</li>
            <li> these shed but the shipping is decent and i think you would like it for a night out or something</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s totally fine with me as I ordered these only for occasional wear and the clips aren&#x27;t really comfortable enough to wear all the time imo.</li>
            <li> Secondly, it looks exactly like real hair and is sewn in very well.</li>
            <li> They are super long and they matched my hair color really well.</li>
            <li> Silky, well put together, and high quality.</li>
            <li> The clips are a little bit too wide for my head surprisingly and I have a rather large head</li>
            <li> Hair was not very natural looking and is described as full head?</li>
            <li> so I learned I need additional ones with shorter lengths to get a natural blend since my real hair is it my shoulders and</li>
            <li> the hair feels and looks real just cannot get it to look natural and stay in place.</li>
            <li> I was just looking for something fun and different for Halloween.</li>
            <li> my normal hair</li>
            <li> You can brush it like normal hair.</li>
            <li> They are full and thick, one group so easier to instal, the hair was smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> so overall these extensions are worth it for the price..</li>
            <li> Not thick enough and not the right color.</li>
            <li> But got to keep the product got a half of what I paid which was nice considering the low price I paid for it</li>
            <li> I got the dark brown ones and I have brown black hair, the color is a bit off but still looks nice!</li>
            <li> I really liked the idea of having a fake 1-piece hair extension to use for quick on the go thickening of my hair.  </li>
            <li> These are very long and quite full.</li>
            <li> so if you are thinking that this may be an issue I would recommend single clips instead of a full head clip.</li>
            <li> so they are sending out a new one</li>
            <li> so it like a live</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to persons new to using clip in hair extensions.&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li> I live in jersey .</li>
            <li> I love these so much, I actually cut mine in half so that so much weight wasn&#x27;t on one section of my hair</li>
            <li> When you advertise and say whole head it makes one think that it will be enough hair to cover the whole head</li>
            <li> Just pay a few extra dollars for a nice one</li>
            <li> so i know what looks good and doesnt look good but trust me when i say these are AWFUL!!</li>
            <li> It felt very soft but it kept tangling at the ends.</li>
            <li> and it is very soft and shinny.</li>
            <li> I ordered dark brown and they came light brown.</li>
            <li> Complete waist of money!</li>
            <li> SO BE PREPARED FOR ONLY STRAIGHT HAIR!</li>
            <li> dark drown is too light.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t even fit half my head</li>
            <li> I cannot honestly  give you any other information other than what she gave me</li>
            <li> Honestly its pretty and straight but very brittle and hard to brush feels alot like fake hair and the band is to long for most hair types</li>
            <li> but the other ones was by the hand full and this one the hair comes out if you touch them a lot.</li>
            <li> As i brushed through more than half of the hair got soo tangled that i had to cut it, It ended up me never having a chance to wear them because they had to be thrown out within the hour of buying.</li>
            <li> It is super shiny, light and thin.</li>
            <li> Even in a ponytail you can clearly see the difference.</li>
            <li> your hair is naturally &amp;#34;Black&amp;#34; I recommend getting the &amp;#34;Dark</li>
            <li> Received my package early.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any real shedding, although I have brushed through these.</li>
            <li> and they actually held the curl really well without hairspray or anything.</li>
            <li> When I opened them, they were really soft &amp; silky.</li>
            <li> match n looks so natural no one can tell when I&#x27;m wearing it.</li>
            <li> but the second set I got was stick straight like in the photo.</li>
            <li> but you can still see my real hair peering through, so with a second</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how soft these extensions are.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly</li>
            <li> somehow managed to make it work and made them look natural</li>
            <li> My daughter ordered these hair extensions and they look completely natural.  </li>
            <li> Color was completely off.  </li>
            <li> but it was really soft and stays put.</li>
            <li> It also looks natural.</li>
            <li> i got them so early on OCT31  </li>
            <li> it is long and not fake looking at all.&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li> but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> the hair is really soft.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> The hair was shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t true Dark Brown.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t true Dark Brown.</li>
            <li> Kind of poor quality. .</li>
            <li> Also, good quality and doesn&#x27;t look completely fake.</li>
            <li> I had my hair braided (single braid) for about 7 hours today and when I un-did my hair the extensions were still very straight</li>
            <li> Also, sometimes I find that I have to try several times before a clip closes, based on the position and the curvature of my head, but with the other 4 clips securely in place it would probably still not slide.</li>
            <li> Other than that they are fun to wear.</li>
            <li> Many people felt it looked very real, however I would never let anyone touch my hair because of how fake it felt.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s SUPER soft and came earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> I ordered dark brown, the color I recieved was light brown with a red tone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun to add volume to short hair when worn as a long ponytail</li>
            <li> So long and soft and looks so real.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was a little different than what I had expected, but Overall it is a good product.</li>
            <li> or else I didn&#x27;t clip it in high enough.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this vendor for future purchases and products.</li>
            <li> I really didnt like they just looked really bad on and didnt have a good smell they also didnt feel soft</li>
            <li> I ended up getting two of these because one was not thick enough for my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overly shiny (as in fake shiny), but also not the silkiest hair either which makes it tangle a bit, but so far I&#x27;ve been able to deal with that very well with a bit of patience.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Was so  excited when these came nice packaging really soft , but the thing I disliked about these is that they were shiny looked so fake</li>
            <li> It looks plastic and the color is not dark brown.</li>
            <li> Not dark brown at all</li>
            <li> Not dark brown.</li>
            <li> it is NOT dark brown.</li>
            <li> but I expected the color to be a little bit more darker.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I ordered the dark brown color, and the length was right.</li>
            <li> I knew I wasn&#x27;t expecting much paying $5, at most I was hoping to wear it as a gag/costume if it was the wrong color.</li>
            <li> I was concerned that they would look too obviously synthetic, but they actually blend with my hair much better than any of the real, and infinitely more expensive, extensions that I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> i would say it is more black then dark brown.</li>
            <li> The dark brown color was more like black.</li>
            <li> First of all, they were black, not dark brown, so the color didn&#x27;t match my hair.</li>
            <li> Was not the best quality, it ripped right away, also got knotted up badly and was very hard to brush out.</li>
            <li> pretty heavy, and the clips to hold hair well, they dont really hold it long before they fall out.</li>
            <li> I gave it to my 10yr old to play with and threw it out the same day.</li>
            <li> I cut it into 3 strips a few days ago because it just didn&#x27;t look right in my hair</li>
            <li> but i would not buy if u are looking to use it more than a few times because it starts to tangle and look like a knotty mess</li>
            <li> I put them on along with my other extensions (real humar hair)</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s red brown not dark brown at all.</li>
            <li> The extensions were not dark brown (2), they are auburn (red) brown (4)</li>
            <li> At only $5 with free shipping you should buy at least 3....</li>
            <li> do not get this item it only comes with one thin piece of hair i can go Anywere and get a better item</li>
            <li> They came earlier than expected and they are so soft!!!</li>
            <li> FIRST OF ALL I ORDERED DARK BROWN HAIR!</li>
            <li> The first package arrived and the hair was a little bit wavy (possibly from the packaging?)</li>
            <li> it is only one tract and has a net in it, they are cheap and its fake hair so if you want real do not buy these</li>
            <li> they got broken and the hairs gets tangled so easily.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that they are pretty heavy</li>
            <li> They also do not curl or style in any other way than just being plain straight which was very upsetting as I planned to curl my hair for prom.</li>
            <li> They are a little fake looking, very shiny, the only thing I don&#x27;t like is you cant comb them, they get tangled very easy.</li>
            <li> I already happen to have really long hair (going down to my waist which is even a bit longer than the extensions, but, again, it depends on where on your head you choose to clip them in - i.e. higher and closer to the crown or lower)</li>
            <li> The hair came earlier than expected, it was carefully packaged and exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised since the price was so cheap,but it is so soft and thick the color is different than a normal hair color</li>
            <li> I was excited until I got the package and realized it was a long thick strip of plastic hair.</li>
            <li> I figure for the money I won&#x27;t have much to lose, I was a little worried because of some of the reviews I read on them</li>
            <li> The hair was really shiny, but I brushed a little baby powder on there</li>
            <li> Loved the hair only bad thing is that it tangles.</li>
            <li> worth a buy if your hair is thick and blackish and your using it for a costume party...</li>
            <li> I wish I had 4 for every single day because they olny last about 1-3 days depending on how active you are and how much you brush them.</li>
            <li> However, the clip ins are only large enough for a small person&#x27;s head (such as a child)</li>
            <li> Super fake hair falls right out and looks super fake.</li>
            <li> they are jet black and super heavy</li>
            <li> I used dry shampoo on the extensions to make it a little bit dull to match my hair more or you can use baby powder.</li>
            <li> but they well flat iron on LOW HEAT (</li>
            <li> * fake along with my own hair, when I brushed my hair into it for the finishing touch, several SEVERAL strands of the fake hair came right out of the mesh it was sewn into.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First picture is my natural hair which goes down to about my arm pits, and was actually a lighter brownish red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Got it today, when I read other reviews about it being &amp;#34;REDDISH&amp;#34; I was expecting a natural red tint like my own hair,  but its a fake red like almost dark pink color .</li>
            <li> Not really satisfied doesn&#x27;t feel real</li>
            <li> Its not the same color as my hair and is really long</li>
            <li> the lowest your flat iron can go).</li>
            <li> (: THEY ARE REALLY LONG AND MY HAIR IS REALLY SHORT, SO WE TRIMMED ONE</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re simply wearing your hair hanging loose over your back,</li>
            <li> I just got mine today in a little bag which made me nervous and came fast than i expected.  </li>
            <li> This is the most pathetic excuse for &#x27;hair extensions&#x27; $6 more like $1.39 quality its not even remotely close to what grows from a persons head.</li>
            <li> Not dark brown, very thin, sheds a lot, tangles every 30 seconds, need about 4 to make a full coverage.</li>
            <li> They hurt, you cannot blow dry or straighten them as it states, and the hairs fall out constantly.</li>
            <li> The hair that I was suppose to get was dark brown hair was not dark brown at all</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; was super long and cut poorly at the end.</li>
            <li> the picture, brittle,  looks very shiny, very fake looking.tangles easily, brushing ruins it.</li>
            <li> Very thin and tangles easily.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not sure about its elasticity though, hair was not mean to elastic.</li>
            <li> the hair is very heavy but very soft!</li>
            <li> Didnt fit around my head, looked to fake.</li>
            <li> So cheap and obviously fake.</li>
            <li> Cheap but not superb.</li>
            <li> Overall it is still soft and not many hairs fell out</li>
            <li> IT IS NOT A COMPLETE PIECE...</li>
            <li> find that if your hair is already that long</li>
            <li> , \\&quot;You&#x27;re hair is getting so long, Dina.</li>
            <li> its not all of the extensions and it takes SO LONG to come in.</li>
            <li> it totally looks fake and the color i ordered was a dark brown and when i got it was a light brown color close to blonde</li>
            <li> Came earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> i WOULD RECOMMEND THESE TO ANYBODY BECAUSE OF THE PRICE, AND HOW LONG YOU GET</li>
            <li> The shipping wasn&#x27;t too long .</li>
            <li> Received earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier then expected.</li>
            <li> This is a six clip extension so it can drag down on your natural hair do to the weight.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t actually wore these in public and I might just try to dye them black and cut some inches off them..</li>
            <li> Staticky tangled just a complete mess!</li>
            <li> Was not 23&amp;#34; was about 19&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;It was also red when I ordered brown and got very tangled very fast, the clips were really bad and ripped out my hair.</li>
            <li> but thats why i bought it long!</li>
            <li> They are suuuper long!</li>
            <li> IT WONT BE FOR LONG!</li>
            <li> Now half of it is curly &amp; the other half is straight.</li>
            <li> It did take a very long time to receive the product though.</li>
            <li> but if its uust for the extra thinckness they are cute its not all that bad</li>
            <li> I kind of expected these to be bad</li>
            <li> My daughter selected dark brown extensions and they are no where near dark brown.</li>
            <li> My hair is very straight and moderately thin</li>
            <li> My hair is currently around 20&amp;#34; long so this was purchased to slightly lengthen, while thickening my hair on-the-go.&lt;br</li>
            <li> only BAD thing was that it was MORE RED than black brown.</li>
            <li> I am even a bit worried that doing a single braid with these extensions on makes my hair look a bit too full, thus making it look somewhat fake.</li>
            <li> I bought dark brown,  and it came as a red purple colour.  </li>
            <li> Not worth money to ship back.</li>
            <li> quality is average, but colours a bit different than stated.</li>
            <li> It is soft but it&#x27;s also heavy!</li>
            <li> they arrived 2 weeks earlier than the expected due date.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m kind of disappointed in the listing of color compared to the reality of it</li>
            <li> so u can&#x27;t curl or straighten them or it will melt onto the iron if you brush them you loose a lot of hair</li>
            <li> do not wear it loose</li>
            <li> It is super shiny and kinda unrealistic plus they Lost my package and it took forever</li>
            <li> it stayed curl and just got into a big mess.</li>
            <li> Its a big mess.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 of the same product and it was not a whole half of wig</li>
            <li> They are synthetic so they tangle a little easier but can be brushed out no problem I suggest using a detangler.</li>
            <li> but I like it cause it&#x27;s a little different.</li>
            <li> but it looked a little red.</li>
            <li> The color was a little different than my daughter&#x27;s hair, so I haven&#x27;t seen her wear it yet.</li>
            <li> They were really soft but the ends seem split and there hard to brush, but they so blend woth your hair well.</li>
            <li> But I wonders if I put these and a few peices to reinacte my hair lights if it would be tick enough.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected</li>
            <li> They are not real hair</li>
            <li> It was not real hair</li>
            <li> Not real hair, do not expose to heat.</li>
            <li> The shipping was faster than I expected.</li>
            <li> do not try to apply heat is not resistant be careful</li>
            <li> and I cry everyday because my hair is soo short</li>
            <li> Went to comb it with a wide toothed comb like your suppose to and the hair just kept falling out....threw it away.</li>
            <li> It took me quite awhile to get the hair to curl how I wanted it to, but it is synthetic hair so that is expected.</li>
            <li> When I got this product it was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> You can tell it&#x27;s not real now.</li>
            <li> I ordered them and when i got them, they were nothing like i had expected.</li>
            <li> but it made the extension feel rough and teased.</li>
            <li> just be careful when you move it around .</li>
            <li> ,  you should know that the hair gets matted and tangled after a few times of wearing it, even if you store it properly.</li>
            <li> they are not real hair which I assumed the were.. cant curl them or dye them</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not real hair.</li>
            <li> for all the reasons stated above, I never wore it once, and I wasted my money:/ --_</li>
            <li> I got them a lot sooner than expected</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re SO long, probably about down to my butt.</li>
            <li> And I actually cut down some of the extensions because they were down to my butt.</li>
            <li> The only problem was that it wasn&#x27;t much hair, very thin.</li>
            <li> I typically wear it in a long braid.</li>
            <li> It was long and really soft, but you can definitely tell it&#x27;s fake.</li>
            <li> They are full and thick which I was worried about them being thin</li>
            <li> I plan on dying the other.</li>
            <li> This is not real hair!</li>
            <li> Received the wrong color but customer service is prompt and very helpful!</li>
            <li> Not real hair so don&#x27;t be fooled!</li>
            <li> i returned the other package..</li>
            <li> The set came a day before expected!</li>
            <li> Extremely shiny.</li>
            <li> I had to use other shorter extensions to blend it in with my hair, too.</li>
            <li> wish I didn&#x27;t buy the, pretty annoyed!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not exactly what I expected at all!</li>
            <li> but if your hair Is short or think they are really hard to blend and the shed a ton also not real hair</li>
            <li> Not very full, darker then</li>
            <li> Of course, most ppl would not have such a thick braid naturally, but then again I do have one friend who comes terribly close to that w/o any extensions.</li>
            <li> They are kind of heavy though and the clips are uncomfortable and can be a little hard to cover up unless you have really thick hair.</li>
            <li> The brown is a really dark brown color.</li>
            <li> I ordered the dark brown.</li>
            <li> so i got it dark brown.</li>
            <li> I order the dark brown and yes, it is brown</li>
            <li> and i ordered the dark brown</li>
            <li> I ordered dark brown ones but</li>
            <li> and my hair is dark brown....</li>
            <li> also very shiny which makes it look really fake.</li>
            <li> I ordered dark brown</li>
            <li> the color is way too dark</li>
            <li> i got dark brown</li>
            <li> Item was well not worth it.</li>
            <li> Item not worth one star</li>
            <li> I bought dark brown</li>
            <li> (The browns not as dark as it shows to be in the picture</li>
            <li> and I order a dark brown</li>
            <li> wasn&amp;#34;t dark brown at all</li>
            <li> And the color is not even close to dark brown.</li>
            <li> The dark brown shade shown is not what came in the mail.</li>
            <li> BUT I DYED MY DARK BROWN HAIR BEFORE THEY CAME.</li>
            <li> i ordered these extensions in dark brown ..</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t happen, its more of a reddish color, and I really hate how you can&#x27;t style it.</li>
            <li> i emailed the carrier telling them about my hair which is a short thick pixie cut</li>
            <li> Here in Tyler, i pay about $100 for extensions that aren&#x27;t a third as thick as these.</li>
            <li> and i straightened my hair for these extensions, and there was no amount of heat to match this thin hair with my natural hair.</li>
            <li> i should&#x27;ve ordered 3-5 with my thick hair, but i only ordered one to test before prom and it took TWO months for it to get to me.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t thick enough</li>
            <li> Mine turned out to be black instead of dark brown</li>
            <li> Item was closer in color to black than dark brown.  </li>
            <li> I specifically ordered them in dark brown and they came in jet black.</li>
            <li> no number of clips not right not a full head..</li>
            <li> I bought this in dark brown since everyone said the color was almost as black since my hair is black brown</li>
            <li> but i am gonna buy it again in black .</li>
            <li> but, it wasnt the color i was expecting it looks black</li>
            <li> the next day said I was getting refund because price was wrong neve got my money back</li>
            <li> i suggest u just order black</li>
            <li> I accidentally ordered brown instead of black</li>
            <li> My hair is purple and black</li>
            <li> I ordered brown i received black</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a month and a half since I ordered it</li>
            <li> Color is black.</li>
            <li> Thirdly, I have just past shoulder-length hair and it looked silly when I put it on because of the major gap between the layers.</li>
            <li> they are easy to comb and don&#x27;t look fake at all!!</li>
            <li> Not good overall</li>
            <li> and then It got into a mess,</li>
            <li> Was not a full head clip.</li>
            <li> For the price, its long, shiny, I would say buy two at least,.</li>
            <li> and I had to contact the seller a few occasions, the hair feels like barbie hair, plus the color I ordered was dark brown</li>
            <li> They are in a frizzed up mess now.  </li>
            <li> its not true to color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so long and thick.</li>
            <li> I like that it was neatly packaged, they are very long and blend in well with my thick hair.</li>
            <li> and more bad thing !</li>
            <li> but it may be just like any other extensions, not sure I&#x27;ve never had any before.</li>
            <li> Not worth to try at all!</li>
            <li> you could use little heat on them</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little lighter than my hair color</li>
            <li> Also mine came a little bit wavy</li>
            <li> Maybe to add a little volume</li>
            <li> and I repeat A LITTLE.</li>
            <li> I guess my little girls will have some hair to play with.</li>
            <li> and if it&#x27;s a little frizzy I just put some water on my pick and that helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Is a little bit staticy, but, can be combed through without shedding.</li>
            <li> I did expect it to be a little lighter</li>
            <li> They are not worth the money do not buy these!</li>
            <li> so it took a little bit of time to attach the piece to my hair</li>
            <li> it came in a little package from china, they were not tangled at all.</li>
            <li> so it does give the false hair look if your natural hair is dull.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> but I recently baught hair extensions and they where way too thin.</li>
            <li> but then it is too heavy to wear attached to your head.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have is that they&#x27;re kinda thin</li>
            <li> is too heavy and it tangles alot</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an everyday wear.</li>
            <li> So i bought a quite few of them..</li>
            <li> a smidge heavy</li>
            <li> also, they are incredibly thin which is the opposite of my hair...</li>
            <li> so it looked choppy and stuck out.</li>
            <li> Plus it is vary heavy and the clips hurt.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> i wouldnt waste my time or money on this.</li>
            <li> semi dead.</li>
            <li> so it did not exactly fit my hair color.</li>
            <li> If you want to wear it in a side braid it looks good, but any other look fake and ugly!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I wasted money on this.</li>
            <li> At this point i just hope i didnt waste my money</li>
            <li> there were clips broken, hair was in a  big knot...</li>
            <li> I hate that it&#x27;s shiny love that it&#x27;s thick 😍👿</li>
            <li> I am not color blind, but whoever doesn&#x27;t know that dark brown is just a shade lighter than black shouldn&#x27;t be advertising they have different colors.  </li>
            <li> looks super fake like the fake hair you buy for little kids to play dress up with.</li>
            <li> The ends frizzed and and wouldnt tame after a wash I had to cut the frizz out &amp; it continued</li>
            <li> From seeing all of the negative reviews I was a little nervous, and when they get here they were in a little package</li>
            <li> but I am afraid strands will continue to fall loose while wearing which will totally ruin the illusion.&lt;br</li>
            <li> tried to order a second one to get a fuller look, but for some reason I can&#x27;t, I don&#x27;t know if that was because I left a bad review or what</li>
            <li> I love clip on extensions but these one all the hair comes out too easy.i am very  Disappointed in product.</li>
            <li> A little hard to put in</li>
            <li> The extension isn&#x27;t thick and the color was a little off.</li>
            <li> I usually get tape in extensions</li>
            <li> Just a waste of time and money!</li>
            <li> Nope it came in reddish orange! :/</li>
            <li> biggest waste of money ever!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Usually I just wear one and put it into a braid, and nobody can tell they&#x27;re extensions.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t the color that i anticipated :/</li>
            <li> You can definitely tell it&#x27;s fake.</li>
            <li> still not here :/</li>
            <li> , the extensions couldn&#x27;t be more awful, it took a month to get them</li>
            <li> Not sure if I can use it then...</li>
            <li> You can obviously tell that its fake.</li>
            <li> The reason why I rated it a four out if five stars is because the hair looked messy with movement of hair!</li>
            <li> And it is not straight at all coz they fold it which is ridiculous!</li>
            <li> Very heavy extensions.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to brush it out</li>
            <li> NO ONE knew my little secret (tee hee hee)</li>
            <li> I also recommend at least getting two wefts.</li>
            <li> Too late now.</li>
            <li> this is not it, I should have expected it from the price, hair is so thin it was bent tangled and shipping took over a month!</li>
            <li> The package was late.</li>
            <li> it sucks</li>
            <li> It sucks because it took over a month to ship, but as soon as I contacted the seller it got sent out.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite thick</li>
            <li> It is thick and shiny but I would still get two if you have thicker hair.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick hair, so Remy extensions tend to look like rat-tails on me unless I curl them.</li>
            <li> Are these thick before I get them</li>
            <li> ALTHOUGH THE \\&quot;HAIR\\&quot; IS THICK</li>
            <li> They are really thin unlike the description and they sent me black not brown!</li>
            <li> I mean no tangles or hair was not bent)</li>
            <li> This is crazy waiting this long for something and never getting it.  </li>
            <li> Very thin, not very full at all.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> please listen and believe me everyone.. seriously..</li>
            <li> I received my extensions and they came the wrong color I got black</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> But for only 5$ not too bad.</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> Not a good idea.  </li>
            <li> Synthetic not good at all</li>
            <li> it was way too long and fell of ur head easily..looked very fake and cheesy/</li>
            <li> I finally got sick of the expense and decided to give something cheaper a try.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to comb as well.</li>
            <li> Blended well with my hair, very thick.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very thick</li>
            <li> These extensions were poor quality</li>
            <li> A bit thin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worse than Barbie doll hair.</li>
            <li> It is really thin</li>
            <li> When i opened it i noticed the the clip was broken, and hair was already falling out.</li>
            <li> This hair is thin and looks nothing like the photos.</li>
            <li> Buy these I have really really thin hair</li>
            <li> They tried to make up for poor quality by adding length.</li>
            <li> It was so thin.</li>
            <li> Hair was too thin.</li>
            <li> so if you have thin hair it is gonna show.</li>
            <li> Way too thin.</li>
            <li> It was thin, I wont buy again.</li>

            <li> I have thin hair</li>
            <li> These by far are the worst extensions I&#x27;ve ever owned .</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed the hair</li>

            <li> They were the wrong color.</li>
            <li> , IT WILL BE THE WRONG COLOR AND STYLE</li>
            <li> Looked really fake didn&#x27;t like this product at all ended up returning it as soon as I received it.</li>
            <li> so I was unable to dye it.  </li>
            <li> Second of all, the texture was just terrible.</li>
            <li> Came in the wrong color.</li>
            <li> but I was wrong....</li>
            <li> It feels fake and i would have to coat my hair in oil for it to match the extensions.</li>
            <li> They do look fake.</li>
            <li> What I did in order for them not to look fake</li>
            <li> looks fake, like doll hair.</li>
            <li> Feels and looks fake.</li>
            <li> Just looks too fake.</li>
            <li> Wrong color brown and feels and looks so fake</li>
            <li> I found the item difficult to attatch and it cam without directions.</li>
            <li> These are fake hair extensions.</li>
            <li> and it felt really fake got tangled and after 2 days I threw it away.</li>
            <li> Wrong.</li>
            <li> they send me the wrong hair extencion</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the color is lighter than what is portrayed in the picture.</li>
            <li> THE HAIR IS VERY THIN</li>
            <li> Very poor quality.</li>
            <li> But after 1 use they were awfully ratted and looked very fake and gross!</li>
            <li> IDK how to fix it,I am afraid that all the hair will be out if I brush it.</li>
            <li> curly tangled and just disappointing.</li>
            <li> Like when I would try and even finger comb it it sheds like crazy</li>
            <li> so it was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I have never ever owned extensions because I always thought they were real expensive and looked fake</li>
            <li> I was mad that the hair was synthetic and couldn&#x27;t dye ::</li>
            <li> WTF!</li>
            <li> You cant go wrong with the price and quality!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mad</li>
            <li> However, the hair itself isn&#x27;t bad.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This was my first time purchasing hair extension and i just gotta say that I LOVED IT!&lt;br /&gt;if your hair is naturally &amp;#34;Black&amp;#34; I recommend getting the &amp;#34;Dark brown&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;ITS SOOO perfect. Everyone loved my hair and my sister is getting one as well cause of good it looked.</li>
            <li> Decent product for the price. however the color does not match this picture, it is redder than this.</li>
            <li> These by far are the worst extensions I&#x27;ve ever owned . They&#x27;re very unnatural-looking and get so knotty and tangled . They feel like horse hair and cannot be washed which is a big problem if you want to smell nice . The clips get caught in your hair and hurt your scalp . Terrible product . Do not buy !</li>
            <li> The brown is a really dark brown color.</li>
            <li> Received my package early. Noticed hair had a bit of shine to it. Sprayed with hair spray and curled it. It holds curls fine. Blended well with my hair, very thick. Also tangles easily while straight. I could only wear a side braid with it straightened. For what I paid, it was worth it. I also recommend at least getting two wefts. Because one will not be enough for anyone.</li>
            <li> I got this and a $12 full head and this was better than them. I wish they was full head it&#x27;s just one 5 clip nothing else. The seller was nice after I paid for the extensions. They do have hair come out but the other ones was by the hand full and this one the hair comes out if you touch them a lot. I don&#x27;t wear them much anymore since I found out I like my hair just the way it is. They didn&#x27;t come with anything to keep them safe and clean so I was glad I got the other ones. I liked the fact that the seller was understanding and told me things that more sellers wouldn&#x27;t. They did take time to get to me but in my eyes that was okay. I would say that the price was would make people think they wouldn&#x27;t be good but I got some good one&#x27;s the only thing is that sew the clips on a little better so they last longer and to apply some glue for extension to keeps the hair in place other than this thing I have talked about they are great.</li>
            <li> Not good. Waste of money. The color brown is super red.</li>
            <li> The color was misleading. I did not receive a full head.</li>
            <li> They are great, except it says &amp;#34;six pieces&amp;#34; but it was just one total clip in piece. It&#x27;s really good for the price, but if you have thick hair you are going to need more than one. I ordered another one because it wasn&#x27;t quite enough to fill my head, but for the price these are great. Color is as pictured.</li>
            <li> Very silky and straight. Staticky and I recommend ordering more than one or from another place as to get side pieces. It was my first time ordering extensions so I learned I need additional ones with shorter lengths to get a natural blend since my real hair is it my shoulders and this extension almost reaches my butt.</li>
            <li> takes a moderate time to arrive. but i would not buy if u are looking to use it more than a few times because it starts to tangle and look like a knotty mess</li>
            <li> I ordered dark brown and they came light brown. Anyway they were shiny and super soft.</li>
            <li> Product came nicely packaged and on time. Unfortunately the color is way off. I ordered the dark brown. It is more of a light to medium brown.</li>
            <li> Fell apart before i could even wear it</li>
            <li> Kind of poor quality. . But for only 5$ not too bad.</li>
            <li> It feels and looks like doll hair. Not good overall</li>
            <li> These are FAKE hair extensions. I like that it was neatly packaged, they are very long and blend in well with my thick hair. They do not curl with a curling iron and that upsets me. I only wanted them for when I curled my hair. Sad face</li>
            <li> Very heavy extensions.</li>
            <li> I really didnt like they just looked really bad on and didnt have a good smell they also didnt feel soft</li>
            <li> Do these come with the clips already sewn on? I just ordered these and didn&#x27;t no if I should order clips as well?</li>
            <li> I am thinking about purchasing these. They are a really good price but I recently baught hair extensions and they where way too thin. Ey 70g tho. But I wonders if I put these and a few peices to reinacte my hair lights if it would be tick enough.</li>
            <li> It came just like the photo and was so easy to clip in id buy it again it was the perfect length and felt like realy hair i had to have them cut to match but thats why i bought it long! im very impressed</li>
            <li> Honestly its pretty and straight but very brittle and hard to brush feels alot like fake hair and the band is to long for most hair types</li>
            <li> they are okay for the price, the color a bit off and they tangle very easily, but for the price cant complain!!</li>
            <li> No it was not the same color as my hair as they say it was</li>
            <li> Was not the best quality, it ripped right away, also got knotted up badly and was very hard to brush out. but it worked well enough.</li>
            <li> I guess I should have read the description better and saw that this is only one weft of hair. Besides my own fault, the hair feels like plastic, looks like plastic, and doesn&#x27;t blend well with natural hair at all. The &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; was super long and cut poorly at the end. It has literally been sitting in my bathroom closet since it arrived and will probably be part of this year&#x27;s Halloween costume.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected</li>
            <li> Always on time, great items! Love!!!!! Thanks guys 😁</li>
            <li> As soon as i got them in they were tangled so i decided to brush through them. As i brushed through more than half of the hair got soo tangled that i had to cut it, It ended up me never having a chance to wear them because they had to be thrown out within the hour of buying.</li>
            <li> Mine turned out to be black instead of dark brown but I actually love them a lot! :D really good quality and very soft!</li>
            <li> They were the wrong color. Contacted the seller, said they would send me a different one, never did. You can&#x27;t put heat on it or else they burn up. Now half of it is curly &amp; the other half is straight. I can&#x27;t do anything about the curly part.</li>
            <li> When I got it, it wasn&#x27;t a full head clip in like it say on here. And it wasn&#x27;t the right color.</li>
            <li> I read alot of reviews on thia and decided to finally get it. It came ALOT earlier than it said it would. i was ao exited to open it, it looked real felt real. Its more a medium brown than dark brown, but it blended it okay.... it worked great forthe first month.... i decided to curl it, i reas alot of reviewea and people said ut wouldnt curl, but it curled really well. i left it curled for 3 days. WORST MISTAKE EVER. i thought it would un curl if i washes it..... it stayed curl and just got into a big mess. i tried to bruah it out and almoat all the hair came out! it was ao thin!!! i tried to straighten it..... but nothing would work. Its a big mess. i would reccomend NOT buying this product unless its juat for temporary use... buy a good quality product. not this one!!!</li>
            <li> I wanted a full hair,you described it as full head,all I saw was just one piece of hair</li>
            <li> I love them I have thick hair and I only need one I curled them and straightened them :) I got them in 2 weeks&lt;br /&gt;I loved them matched my hair perfectly really long</li>
            <li> Well I bought this for my daughter.. She loves the clip in hair she wants to make her&lt;br /&gt;hair look longer and it works and blends in with her hair it really looks good .. Would&lt;br /&gt;purchase again if she wants it thanx bunches...</li>
            <li> TRUST ME NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE DO NOT BE FOOLED INTO BUYING THIS PRODUCT. FIRST OF ALL IT WILL TAKE THEM A MILLION YEARS TO SEND IT TO YOU, THEN ONCE YOU RECEIVE IT, IT WILL BE THE WRONG COLOR AND STYLE AND IT WILL BE A TINY ITTY BITTY PICE THAT YOU CAN ONLY USE ON THE SIDE OF YOU HAIR IT IS NOT A COMPLETE PIECE... DO NOT DO IT... HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. THEN THEY COP AND ATTITUDE IF YOU TELL THEM THERE ITEM IS NOT QUALITY AND WORTH THE EFFORT.</li>
            <li> got this for my daughter and she loved it except we thought it would be more thicker and fuller if we ordered a second one and we did..I really recommend it.</li>
            <li> So the product is nice, came in a little package, I didn&#x27;t realize it was the extensions. But came in good condition. Its not the same color as my hair and is really long so I might cut it to blend in better. A little hard to put in but it may be just like any other extensions, not sure I&#x27;ve never had any before. Overall good product</li>
            <li> I think these extensions are nice and they fulfill perfectly the function that I had envisioned for them. These are very long and quite full. I already happen to have really long hair (going down to my waist which is even a bit longer than the extensions, but, again, it depends on where on your head you choose to clip them in - i.e. higher and closer to the crown or lower), I wanted to have thicker hair, particularly for braided hairdos and let me tell you with these extensions my hair is humongous. I am even a bit worried that doing a single braid with these extensions on makes my hair look a bit too full, thus making it look somewhat fake. However, the hair itself isn&#x27;t bad. It&#x27;s obviously not real hair, but it blends in decently with my own, even if it has a definite tint of auburn (which my own hair doesn&#x27;t). It&#x27;s not overly shiny (as in fake shiny), but also not the silkiest hair either which makes it tangle a bit, but so far I&#x27;ve been able to deal with that very well with a bit of patience.&lt;br /&gt;I find that if your hair is already that long and you&#x27;re simply wearing your hair hanging loose over your back, although the extensions blend well, they don&#x27;t really add a lot (maybe a change of 5% in the direction of increased volume as opposed to an 80% increase in volume appearance when braided). That&#x27;s totally fine with me as I ordered these only for occasional wear and the clips aren&#x27;t really comfortable enough to wear all the time imo. Also, sometimes I find that I have to try several times before a clip closes, based on the position and the curvature of my head, but with the other 4 clips securely in place it would probably still not slide. I haven&#x27;t noticed any real shedding, although I have brushed through these. I&#x27;ll see how well they&#x27;ll hold up to washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, i am really happy with these for the price. They give great volume to my already long hair and when braided in the hair does not have any kind of conspicuous shine to give it off asfake. Of course, most ppl would not have such a thick braid naturally, but then again I do have one friend who comes terribly close to that w/o any extensions. I&#x27;d enjoy a slightly smaller set of say 2 3-clip pieces in a lighter color that I could use alternatively to these to achieve highlights (with my own darker hair sandwiched in between). I haven&#x27;t tried it with this hairpiece in a lighter shade (the dark brown matches my own shade pretty well), but I think there&#x27;s probably too much hair in it to result in believable highlights.</li>
            <li> It is amazing, i use it to make a big braid...all my friends love it</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t apply heat. I learned my lesson but the hair was great!!</li>
            <li> expected more hair and a better color. not bad overall - more one time use</li>
            <li> These extensions were poor quality they got tangled super easy.They were way too shiny. &amp; The brown colordidn&#x27;t match the picture</li>
            <li> A bit thin but it looks great!</li>
            <li> Looked really fake didn&#x27;t like this product at all ended up returning it as soon as I received it. But got to keep the product got a half of what I paid which was nice considering the low price I paid for it so that was a plus!</li>
            <li> I bought this in dark brown since everyone said the color was almost as black since my hair is black brown so i got it dark brown. Turns out it looks light brown .... soooo i was disappointed but i am gonna buy it again in black . Overall it is still soft and not many hairs fell out but it is very inexpensive and great i love it</li>
            <li> Although this hair looked really nice on, it was very staticy nd got tangled veryyyy easy! But it was worth my 5 dollars haha</li>
            <li> Brilliant product,and exactly as advertised! Well packaged and it arrived exactly on time!</li>
            <li> These just came 20 minutes ago. When u put them in I was in love. I usually get tape in extensions but I wanted to try these. I was very impressed. I haven&#x27;t tried to iron them or anything so I don&#x27;t know how that works but these are GREAT quality. These should be $200 extensions. They are just as good if anything better than my other ones I get. I love theses DEFINITELY a very very happy buyer. ALSO it came with two! I don&#x27;t know if it was supposed to or not but I&#x27;m not complaining. I plan on dying the other. Very pleased with This product!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this in the mail but then it is too heavy to wear attached to your head. Neck pain for days</li>
            <li> Not very full, darker then the picture, brittle,  looks very shiny, very fake looking.tangles easily, brushing ruins it. DONT BUY IT</li>
            <li> Item was closer in color to black than dark brown.  The quality is good and it is a good value for the price.</li>
            <li> It did not come in the color I asked for horrible</li>
            <li> So these extensions aren&#x27;t good</li>
            <li> I love these! They are super long and they matched my hair color really well. They are not real hair so they don&#x27;t look exactly like your natural hair but they blended in pretty well for me. Nobody noticed that I was wearing them! They are kind of heavy though and the clips are uncomfortable and can be a little hard to cover up unless you have really thick hair. You can curl or straighten these on a low heat. I curled mine on low and they actually held the curl really well without hairspray or anything. Overall the price was good and the product was good!</li>
            <li> It advertised real hair, can be dyed.  It was not real hair so I was unable to dye it.  The color is too dark, so I probably will not be able to wear it since it doesn&#x27;t match my own hair color. The good thing, I only lost about $7,00.</li>
            <li> This is not real hair! Don&#x27;t be fooled! It is super shiny and kinda unrealistic plus they Lost my package and it took forever but after I cut the extensions and blended it in with my natural hair it looked gorgeous! You can&#x27;t style these with heat or wash them or anything you&#x27;ll get a couple good wears but don&#x27;t expect too much! for the price I think it was worth the buy.</li>
            <li> I ordered them in july I ordered 4 and only one has came so far, other wise the piece I got looks fine but the hair falls out ALOT and u cant brush it if it gets tangled but you get what yuu paid for ^-^ right?</li>
            <li> it have a nice color and felt like real hair, but that&#x27;s the only god thing about it. it does not blend well with ur hair at all. so cuz of that u will need 2 or more pieces. with the one piece in, u will look like u have a bad hair cut. i dont think i will order from this company ever again</li>
            <li> the item came early, the color and texture match my hair perfectly....you cant even tell they aren&#x27;t my real hair! and the price is great! will absolutely buy more!</li>
            <li> Hello ladies and possibly men? This is my first set of extensions and was actually pleased with what I received. I order the dark brown and yes, it is brown but it is also very shiny so it does give the false hair look if your natural hair is dull. I used dry shampoo on the extensions to make it a little bit dull to match my hair more or you can use baby powder. My husband loves it and couldn&#x27;t tell where my real hair ended. This piece cannot be used with heat and I recommend you to use a comb instead of a brush because it does tangle easily. I had my hair braided (single braid) for about 7 hours today and when I un-did my hair the extensions were still very straight so it keeps its form. The clips are a little bit too wide for my head surprisingly and I have a rather large head so if you are thinking that this may be an issue I would recommend single clips instead of a full head clip. Overall, I love this piece and wish to purchase more in the future. I hope this helps!</li>
            <li> The color did not match at all, but that is not any ones fault but my own.  This is super shiny, unnaturally shiny, and does not look very real.  It does tangle easily too.  For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it, especially if it matches your hair color.</li>
            <li> Very good product, especially for the price. Very soft and smooth. The clips are also nice. I am very satisfied with it!</li>
            <li> Didnt fit around my head, looked to fake. fell out. a wast of 5 bucks to me, dont buy these</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice but you CANT STRAIGHTEN IT OR CURL IT &amp; It just one piece 😕</li>
            <li> not what they appeared to be...color no number of clips not right not a full head..okay I guess just gotta change my hair color tho lol</li>
            <li> I bought these for costume purposes, and they were horrible. First of all, they were black, not dark brown, so the color didn&#x27;t match my hair. Second of all, the texture was just terrible. It&#x27;s worse than Barbie doll hair. Don&#x27;t buy these for any reason.</li>
            <li> It had a smell of plastic and the color was quite off from the picture! its more of a reddish brown, but its very soft and shinny and came very fast.</li>
            <li> Received the wrong color but customer service is prompt and very helpful! The hair itself is real looking and a very nice gift for the price you really can&#x27;t beat it</li>
            <li> The package arrived so quickly. Very well packaged. There were no tangles. The extensions were a gift for my daughter. She loved them. She got her hair to match the same color as the extensions. Then decided she needed another one.  She is extremely happy with them</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THESE. IT IS NOT WHAT IT SAYS IT IS. THE HAIR IS VERY THIN AND MINE WAS CURLY??? NEVER BUYING FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN.</li>
            <li> I hate they don&#x27;t have a 0. Because that&#x27;s what I would&#x27;ve rated it. It was like a Halloween wig</li>
            <li> they are jet black and super heavy it is only one tract and has a net in it, they are cheap and its fake hair so if you want real do not buy these</li>
            <li> The hair came earlier than expected, it was carefully packaged and exactly as described. I will definitely be buying here again. Silky, well put together, and high quality.</li>
            <li> i will not even give it 1 star the hair ext.. keep on falling !and more bad thing ! when i got them that same day they streded to fall !</li>
            <li> Earlier I left a rating that was not as good, but I&#x27;d like to update it.&lt;br /&gt;It was a little different than what I had expected, but Overall it is a good product. The hair doesn&#x27;t fall out or tangle, and I was even able to use styling products on it.&lt;br /&gt;I tried to order a second one to get a fuller look, but for some reason I can&#x27;t, I don&#x27;t know if that was because I left a bad review or what</li>
            <li> When I got this yesterday the hair fall off! And it is not straight at all coz they fold it which is ridiculous! Not worth to try at all! Just a waste of time and money!</li>
            <li> Not dark brown, very thin, sheds a lot, tangles every 30 seconds, need about 4 to make a full coverage.</li>
            <li> Got this pretty fast, used them. hair gets frizzy so you gotta get detangler. can&#x27;t strip them and dye so might as well not even try. cost is more then the hair cost. pretty heavy, and the clips to hold hair well, they dont really hold it long before they fall out.</li>
            <li> I just got these today! When I opened them, they were really soft &amp; silky. They are also super long which I love! The only problem I have is that they&#x27;re kinda thin so I&#x27;m gonna buy another one today! They also came earlier than planned. I ordered them August 9th &amp; they were supposed to come September 5th! Overall great product :)</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for! DO NOT RECOMMEND! Staticky tangled just a complete mess! Not real hair so don&#x27;t be fooled!</li>
            <li> its is made great, it is alittle cut off on the sides but it fits good and I am very happy with it</li>
            <li> Someone bought this item for me off of my wishlist a month ago. I have been waiting for it and it never came.  The buyer sent the seller an e mail and they said that \\&quot;it must have gotten lost in the mail\\&quot; so they are sending out a new one plus he still has to pay for it.  What, am I going to have to wait another month to get it? I understand that things get lost but they could have dropped the price. This is crazy waiting this long for something and never getting it.  I do not think that i will go through this company again for anything. cant give it a 0 so i had to rate it a 1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update on this. Another month has went by and nothing.&lt;br /&gt;I do not know what is going on. but looks like they didn&#x27;t feel like sending me my stuff.</li>
            <li> Hair was not my shade eve tho they said it would come in close to 1b or 2. Nope it came in reddish orange! :/</li>
            <li> I really liked the idea of having a fake 1-piece hair extension to use for quick on the go thickening of my hair.  I am an avid hair extension user. My hair is very straight and moderately thin so I like them for thickening and lengthening my hair.  I normally use 100g natural hair extensions that come in 5 packs and love them, but they are around $100.  My hair is currently around 20&amp;#34; long so this was purchased to slightly lengthen, while thickening my hair on-the-go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it did as I wanted, and doesn&#x27;t look *too* fake along with my own hair, when I brushed my hair into it for the finishing touch, several SEVERAL strands of the fake hair came right out of the mesh it was sewn into.  I took it out and continued to brush it to get all of the other loose strands out, and most of it seems well anchored, but the quality of the sewn portion is just not that great.  It is still wearable... but I am afraid strands will continue to fall loose while wearing which will totally ruin the illusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have another of these that I purchased from ebay, almost exactly the same color when held side-by-side, and exactly the same length &amp; product description, but the mesh was larger, there is just a tad more hair, and the hair is much better anchored.  It, too, was around $6 total.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess when you are buying $6 hair extensions, it is sort of a crap-shoot.  Sometimes you get lucky but sometimes you get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> Not real hair, do not expose to heat. But fun to wear for a night out....</li>
            <li> i have very dark brown hair, it matched perfectly! only downfall i should have got longer then the 23&amp;#34; since it didn&#x27;t add any length to my hair just thickness.... even though i love it great match n looks so natural no one can tell when I&#x27;m wearing it.</li>
            <li> I ordered dark brown, the color I recieved was light brown with a red tone. Can&#x27;t curl them at all.</li>
            <li> I received these two weeks after ordering.  They are as decribed a one full piece it has 5 clips on it and they are good quality for the price.  I have not tried yo curl yet but they well flat iron on LOW HEAT (the lowest your flat iron can go). They are synthetic so they tangle a little easier but can be brushed out no problem I suggest using a detangler. I will buy again</li>
            <li> It had more of a reddish tint to it. It wasn&#x27;t true Dark Brown. It had came very knotted up.</li>
            <li> Hair doesn&#x27;t look like picture but you get what you expect for the price.</li>
            <li> is too heavy and it tangles alot</li>
            <li> horrible hair extensions....i would never buy again .... the hair gets really tangly and i threw it out ... garbage</li>
            <li> When I received them in the mail they were perfect! They are full and thick which I was worried about them being thin but they are not. I saw on here you could use little heat on them but I used too high of a heat and kind of fried the ends. Mistake on my part. But other then my mistake I love them. I will reorder new ones today!</li>
            <li> Was not 23&amp;#34; was about 19&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;It was also red when I ordered brown and got very tangled very fast, the clips were really bad and ripped out my hair.</li>
            <li> The dark brown color was more like black. It did not blend in with my brown hair. Other than that they are fun to wear. This is a six clip extension so it can drag down on your natural hair do to the weight. I had to cut 5 inches off to make it lighter. It&#x27;s fun to add volume to short hair when worn as a long ponytail but you would need some 3 clip ones to get a full head of hair. The shipping was faster than I expected. I think you should try these out if you are looking to do something fun with your hair for special occasions like halloween. It&#x27;s not an everyday wear.</li>
            <li> Having never bought extensions before, I wasn&#x27;t totally sure what to expect. I ended up getting two of these because one was not thick enough for my hair. The first package arrived and the hair was a little bit wavy (possibly from the packaging?) but the second set I got was stick straight like in the photo. So I can&#x27;t wear them together really, but for the price it can&#x27;t really be beat. I wasn&#x27;t looking for anything super spectacular. I was just looking for something fun and different for Halloween.</li>
            <li> I did like the length, i didn&#x27;t like the static either the fact as soon as i pulled them out of their package, they where already falling apart, the hair was just coming off so quickly i do not recommend what so ever, the color is to light and i ordered the dark brown, it was too close to like a redish color</li>
            <li> horrible..do not buy.. all the clips fell out.. super glue wouldnt even help..the hair was tangle and un even and fell out.. u couldnt straighten it like they said.. it was way too long and fell of ur head easily..looked very fake and cheesy/ i am a hair stylist so i know what looks good and doesnt look good but trust me when i say these are AWFUL!! i threw them away the next day and since i ordered two i returned the other package..biggest waste of money ever! please listen and believe me everyone.. seriously..</li>
            <li> I use it just one night and then It got into a mess, IDK how to fix it,I am afraid that all the hair will be out if I brush it.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a set of extensions, (why wouldn&#x27;t I, the title is plural) but got 1 weft with a basket net and clips. The description should not be plural if we only get 1 piece.</li>
            <li> I would suggest buying 2  or 3hair clips because one is not enough. It is really thin but it does look and feel like real hair.  It&#x27;s okay plus it is pretty cheap. I would probably buy 2 more so it can match the thickness of my hair.</li>
            <li> really love it excellent product they look almost real. do not try to apply heat is not resistant be careful</li>
            <li> She liked them and they were exactly what she expected. Her hair color is different now but she&#x27;ll use them again later.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stop looking in the mirror. My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t buy a second one. It&#x27;s quite thick but you can still see my real hair peering through, so with a second I&#x27;m sure the problem would be solved. I was pleasantly surprised at how soft these extensions are. Easy to comb, too. Overall SO SATISFIED with the quality, especially for what I paid.</li>
            <li> I was expecting to get the perfect color but it didn&#x27;t happen, its more of a reddish color, and I really hate how you can&#x27;t style it. The hair is really soft and very full though!</li>
            <li> Matched my hair color perfectly. Small miscommunication though and my own fault I thought it meant full set but is only one piece. But overall good product.</li>
            <li> The hair that I was suppose to get was dark brown hair was not dark brown at all what so ever.</li>
            <li> 1st time you get it looks good and stuff but then 4th day it doesnt look as good as it was</li>
            <li> Pretty. Not the right color though.</li>
            <li> This item was for my wife. I cannot honestly  give you any other information other than what she gave me</li>
            <li> So i bought a quite few of them.. hairs are really good quality and matched mine... and very beautiful but the pins are not well stitched...they got broken and the hairs gets tangled so easily.</li>
            <li> These were my first set of extensions that I have ever owned.  I wanted to try something different but didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money.  They came earlier then expected which is always super awesome.  I ordered dark brown ones but the color of the ones that I got were more medium brown with red undertones.  Which I like way better then my normal hair so I&#x27;m going to be adjusting my hair color to match the extensions.  So far I&#x27;m pretty excited about them.  Will be ordering some more.</li>
            <li> They look great but they get knotted very very easy at the end! Good buy but not for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> So worth it! So long and soft and looks so real. I absoloutely loved this!</li>
            <li> To shiny but it&#x27;s very thick so it like a live and hate I hate that it&#x27;s shiny love that it&#x27;s thick 😍👿</li>
            <li> I got these extensions in the mail today! They came earlier than expected and they are so soft!!! they are easy to comb and don&#x27;t look fake at all!! I got the dark brown ones and I have brown black hair, the color is a bit off but still looks nice!</li>
            <li> Came in the wrong color. I specifically ordered them in dark brown and they came in jet black. I needed them for a trip that i am taking tomorrow. Guess that&#x27;s not going to happen. The quality is great i guess....is soft and long... :) still wishing they got my order correct!</li>
            <li> Tangles very easily!!! I&#x27;ve only worn them a couple times and they are almost unwearable now. Would not recommend to buy</li>
            <li> Cant  believe the quality of work it is realy life like.  Am ordering one more for a friend.Thank you for such a good product</li>
            <li> i emailed the carrier telling them about my hair which is a short thick pixie cut and they said I could wear it as an extension. I was excited until I got the package and realized it was a long thick strip of plastic hair. I loved the carrier because they were very understanding and made me feel as though I was being heard. I&#x27;m rating the product not the carrier. I would rate the person who helped me a 10.</li>
            <li> I bought these extensions just for trial purposes, before I go out and spend over $100.00 on a full set. I figure for the money I won&#x27;t have much to lose, I was a little worried because of some of the reviews I read on them but I took a chance and bought them anyway. If you going to wear the hair straight this is fine, you can NOT curl this hair trust me I almost ruined my curling iron. It is thick and shiny but I would still get two if you have thicker hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for prom mostly and a couple other events to change things up and have fun! But after 1 use they were awfully ratted and looked very fake and gross! You also can not wash these at all, trust me I tried. They also do not curl or style in any other way than just being plain straight which was very upsetting as I planned to curl my hair for prom. Also the clips in them broke very easily. I ended up having to throw them away because they were &amp;#34;un-usable&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> worst hair extensions I&#x27;ve bought, i would not recommend these!</li>
            <li> for the money you get a pretty good product. seams good be better made but overall good product. May buy more</li>
            <li> I received my extensions and they came the wrong color I got black and they came light brown so now I can&#x27;t wear them because it doesn&#x27;t look right</li>
            <li> kind of stringy, really made for super straight hair, wasn&#x27;t really able to curl but still used them. this product is definitely ideally for super pin straight hair.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised since the price was so cheap,but it is so soft and thick the color is different than a normal hair color but I like it cause it&#x27;s a little different.</li>
            <li> Hair is the right length but is in no way a \\&quot;full head\\&quot; clip. Doesn&#x27;t even fit half my head and I&#x27;m petite. Horrible and nasty customer service..when I contacted them all they wanted was more money and claimed the detail did not say full head.</li>
            <li> I like this product!!!!! It&#x27;s a little lighter than my hair color but it&#x27;s SUPER soft and came earlier than expected. Definitely buying more. Considering that my hair is sooo short and it looks ratchet and I cry everyday because my hair is soo short, this hair extension makes me feel good about myself :)</li>
            <li> i recieved my product and it was damaged the quality isnt great at all. worst mistake</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money! So cheap and obviously fake. Not only did it smell of a strong plastic smell but the hairs are so shiny. It&#x27;s like they came off a dolls head. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I have never ever owned extensions because I always thought they were real expensive and looked fake but I was wrong....not only were these awesome extensions beautiful and look like natural hair but they were at the best price I&#x27;ve seen. I totally recommend these extensions and the seller to anyone and everyone.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be able to wear these with my hair straight and down because you can tell, but I bought two of them and that way you can. Usually I just wear one and put it into a braid, and nobody can tell they&#x27;re extensions. Easily worth it for the money.</li>
            <li> It was red not brown at all.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for..</li>
            <li> This product was seriously amazing! It&#x27;s just a tad lighter than my actual hair color but that&#x27;s not a problem!&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I thought this would be a waste of time and money, or that it would be really thin.&lt;br /&gt;BUT IT&#x27;S SUPER THICK AND AMAZING! You really only need one of these to satisfy you!&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T THINK TWICE! BUY IT!</li>
            <li> Holy crap! It is unreal the amount of hair you get with these extensions! It&#x27;s so long and thick. At only $5 with free shipping you should buy at least 3.... Seriously. Here in Tyler, i pay about $100 for extensions that aren&#x27;t a third as thick as these. Unreal. I can&#x27;t get over the amount of hair. You&#x27;ve got nothing to lose.</li>
            <li> Alright, first off... these extensions are very dark brown which is perfect for my hair. It matches exactly!(I don&#x27;t dye my hair.) Secondly, it looks exactly like real hair and is sewn in very well. Thirdly, I have just past shoulder-length hair and it looked silly when I put it on because of the major gap between the layers. I youtubed how to cut layers into extensions and got it to match perfectly. I could not be happier. Why buy real hair which costs so much more!? Nobody can tell I have it in and comment, \\&quot;You&#x27;re hair is getting so long, Dina. It looks great.\\&quot; lol I am thrilled and just bought a second one!!! I just wish it didn&#x27;t take so long to ship, but free shipping? I&#x27;m not complaining. xoxoxoxoxo</li>
            <li> i like the fact that they hold great but, it wasnt the color i was expecting it looks black and my hair is dark brown....also very shiny which makes it look really fake. worth a buy if your hair is thick and blackish and your using it for a costume party... and they also dont curl so keep in made your going to have straight hair.</li>
            <li> Was so  excited when these came nice packaging really soft , but the thing I disliked about these is that they were shiny looked so fake I ordered dark brown and they came in a  auburn color . Very disappointed ...</li>
            <li> a smidge heavy but overall does the job perfectly</li>
            <li> Cheapest thing I&#x27;ve ever bought, don&#x27;t waist your money !</li>
            <li> It had more of a reddish tint to it. It wasn&#x27;t true Dark Brown.</li>
            <li> I love the hair it&#x27;s great! Way worth 5 bucks. It doesn&#x27;t blend too well with my hair since my hair is shorter but if I braid it it looks awesome! The only problem was that it wasn&#x27;t much hair, very thin. I bought another. Also mine came a little bit wavy but I don&#x27;t really mind. Well worth the 5 bucks</li>
            <li> I ordered the dark brown colors, and it was more on a copper brown. They came neatly and wasn&#x27;t folded but when I was running my fingers&lt;br /&gt;Threw it some hair came out. But I died them the color I wanted and it was all good. So after dying them they are excally what I wanted.</li>
            <li> When i opened it i noticed the the clip was broken, and hair was already falling out. the color is way too dark then i thought it was going to be.</li>
            <li> i got these today. they are very silky and super georgous but the color was way off. i would say it is more black then dark brown. it does tanlge easy and big chunks of hair started falling off. i wouldnt repurchase these and i wish i hadnt order a second pair before getting these ones. maybe those ones will be better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering Remy hair extensions for years. I finally got sick of the expense and decided to give something cheaper a try. The shipping was surprisingly fast, and the extensions are the best hair-related purchase I&#x27;ve ever made. I have extremely thick hair, so Remy extensions tend to look like rat-tails on me unless I curl them. With these extensions, I can simply clip them in and go. I was concerned that they would look too obviously synthetic, but they actually blend with my hair much better than any of the real, and infinitely more expensive, extensions that I&#x27;ve purchased in the past. Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> Went to comb it with a wide toothed comb like your suppose to and the hair just kept falling out....threw it away.</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t the worst I&#x27;ve used but the fry very easily and also tangle easily ...  I was mad that the hair was synthetic and couldn&#x27;t dye ::</li>
            <li> Well, it looks nice when you take it out of the package. It was losing strands of hair by the seam and instead of it being a &amp;#34;dark brown&amp;#34;, it was like a reddish brown. It felt very soft but it kept tangling at the ends. You get what you pay for. $6.00? Yep-garbage!!! :-)</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly and i straightened my hair for these extensions, and there was no amount of heat to match this thin hair with my natural hair. The picture makes it look way thicker and duller than it really is. It is super shiny, light and thin. It feels fake and i would have to coat my hair in oil for it to match the extensions. Good luck, order at your own risk. I realized now i should&#x27;ve ordered 3-5 with my thick hair, but i only ordered one to test before prom and it took TWO months for it to get to me. Too late now.</li>
            <li> bought these for my teen and boy do they look awesome, you can wash them and curl them and maintaining them is so easy,</li>
            <li> The extension isn&#x27;t thick and the color was a little off. It is very hard to comb as well. You get what you pay for</li>
            <li> Recommend to anyone wanting to add length without commitment.  received these items in very good shape and quickly as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and I got order conformation ad the next day said I was getting refund because price was wrong neve got my money back never got the hair and comp that is say I bought it from don&#x27;t ex sits and it&#x27;s has another company that it says ships it friendshop88 if it has that name DO NOT BUY IT they will tell you they can&#x27;t find your Order stuff even when you send them proof so I don&#x27;t want anyone else to make same mistake save your money don&#x27;t buy from these guys</li>
            <li> its not my hair color i got dark brown and it was light browns and red more like a chesnut color and it tangles fast but very soft and easy to brush and would be great if it was the right color so for those with dark brown hair like the pic i suggest u just order black</li>
            <li> Everything was okay considering what I paid for it. The clips sort of suck but I&#x27;m still optimistic!  Still learning.</li>
            <li> Not really satisfied doesn&#x27;t feel real feels like a Barbie dolls hair</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t the color that i anticipated :/</li>
            <li> You can definitely tell it&#x27;s fake. You get what you paid for. But it&#x27;s definitely fun to play around with.</li>
            <li> These extensions are really pretty, color matched perfect to my hair. They are a little fake looking, very shiny, the only thing I don&#x27;t like is you cant comb them, they get tangled very easy. Other than that, I love them!</li>
            <li> I received the extensions yesterday. They are suuuper long! They do look fake. What I did in order for them not to look fake I put them on along with my other extensions (real humar hair) then I curled the synthetic extensions and they blended in :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You CAN curl and straighten them. The heat applied to the synthetic extension should be at a very low setting!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They somewhat shed , just avoid running your fingers through them and they can also get tangled easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I somehow managed to make it work and made them look natural</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed with these. They aren&#x27;t thick enough so I haven&#x27;t ever used mine. Even in a ponytail you can clearly see the difference. And they get tangled too easy. But I just saw an ad for secretextentions.com and it looks way more natural so it&#x27;s something I&#x27;ll look into since I do a lot of acting</li>
            <li> Love that you can curl, straighten and wash it!</li>
            <li> The set came a day before expected! They do what they are meant to do, they blend so well with my hair NO ONE knew my little secret (tee hee hee) and I can run my flat iron and brush through them (gently) and its just awesome how they come out looking. So I&#x27;m pretty pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong thase extension are BEAUTIFUL I wish I had 4 for every single day because they olny last about 1-3 days depending on how active you are and how much you brush them. If you are just looking for a day look or something like one day use go for the purchase its cheap and replaceable and pretty good for the price. But if your looking for long term you need to get off here and spend a couple hundred on a good pair for extensions . I purchase 7 and they lasted my 3 whers but I was on a bike and putting them in a bun so yeah.</li>
            <li> Hair was not very natural looking and is described as full head? Maybe to add a little volume and I repeat A LITTLE. But if you are looking for something to make your short hair appear longer this is not it, I should have expected it from the price, hair is so thin it was bent tangled and shipping took over a month! Never will order again</li>
            <li> I knew I wasn&#x27;t expecting much paying $5, at most I was hoping to wear it as a gag/costume if it was the wrong color. However, the clip ins are only large enough for a small person&#x27;s head (such as a child) or else I didn&#x27;t clip it in high enough. The color was also not as pictured and was a reddish brown. Happy for the price I paid since I wasn&#x27;t sure what I was expecting, but unhappy I would need two to fit on my head. (maybe I have a huge pumpkin head but the extensions didn&#x27;t fit for me.)</li>
            <li> This hair is thin and looks nothing like the photos. It looks plastic and the color is not dark brown. I requested to return and received arguments and was asked to send pictures of the product.  This looks like costume party hair. I still haven&#x27;t received a return label.</li>
            <li> really expected better, a clip was broke when i recieved it, but it was cheap.</li>
            <li> I ordered brown and the one I got is reddish.&lt;br /&gt;Hair looks fake, like doll hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased four if these hair pieces...They are silky and fun to wear...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Narvelle E.</li>
            <li> Feels and looks fake. Extremely shiny. Get what you pay for. May look ok if you have other pieces to blend it all in. I bought to of these and the thickness was fine. Just looks too fake.</li>
            <li> Good but the ends were curled because of how it was shipped. Very pleased otherwise. A must try especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Buy these I have really really thin hair and I think these are great love them especially for the price :)</li>
            <li> My daughter ordered these hair extensions and they look completely natural.  They lay down smoothly under a layer of your own hair.  A fun addition!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not what I thought it was goin to be. It didn&#x27;t blend in with my hair like it showed in the picture</li>
            <li> Can they be dyed?? I need some for my wedding but there isn&#x27;t any of my hair color.. :( Thanks</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product not only is the price very cheap but my hair matches perfectly and last all day if you use low heat you can curl or straighten I&#x27;m very pleased</li>
            <li> The color is way off, I bought for my niece to use for a costume, they sucked! Do Not Buy!</li>
            <li> this product. IS A LIE. its not all of the extensions and it takes SO LONG to come in. the hair is nice but its only one and it takes to long to come in.</li>
            <li> Great hair for the price. It sheds a little as well as tangles but over all a good product. I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> They were okay when I got them the clips were coming off from the extensions and on top of that they wouldn&#x27;t curl at all for me.</li>
            <li> Hair arrived way early and it is super soft and very full. The hair was really shiny, but I brushed a little baby powder on there and now it looks just perfect. It took me quite awhile to get the hair to curl how I wanted it to, but it is synthetic hair so that is expected. It handled the heat from my curling wand very well. Overall I was pretty impressed by the quality with the price.</li>
            <li> Not good. Automatically gets too tangled</li>
            <li> Not the right color, tangles way too easily</li>
            <li> Are these thick before I get them</li>
            <li> Very poor quality. They tried to make up for poor quality by adding length. Not a good idea.  unmanageable and fuzzy</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 of the same product and it was not a whole half of wig it was literally a row of hair.! what am I going to do with one row? It came from Hong Kong and hod no receipt. It was so thin. I will not buy this agian</li>
            <li> super cheap. looks super fake like the fake hair you buy for little kids to play dress up with. lots of the hair falls out.</li>
            <li> I loved this. It worked for me. I washed it, I layered it and it blends wonderfully with my hair. I have used my curling iron on it (on low heat) and it did not burn, however I would not recommend doing it (just in case it actually burns). I don&#x27;t wear it often, but it comes in handy when I want to switch things up a bit. I am very pleased with this purchase, and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy this product again.</li>
            <li> i would have never bought this if it looked like this it totally looks fake and the color i ordered was a dark brown and when i got it was a light brown color close to blonde so i would buy this only if u want to dress up for a tea party</li>
            <li> Wrong color brown and feels and looks so fake</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t the right color. Took forever to get here. The hair fell out easy.</li>
            <li> You get what u pay for...I gave it to my 10yr old to play with and threw it out the same day.</li>
            <li> Quality is nice but I expected the color to be a little bit more darker. Overall, this hair piece is great for the price!</li>
            <li> When I got this product it was not what I expected. I guess my little girls will have some hair to play with.</li>
            <li> Hair was too thin. Was not a full head clip. Hair was super shiny, and it looked very cheap. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have only worn my extensions for a day and so far ok, they kind of clump up and if you brush them they look better. They do look real.</li>
            <li> My daughter has more hair now lol</li>
            <li> it shows the 7 peice but is not the seven peice i only recieved one peice</li>
            <li> Cute but not for thick hair or for length if ur trying to make ur hair look fuller and its the same legnth as the extensions they are ok but if your hair Is short or think they are really hard to blend and the shed a ton also not real hair so u can&#x27;t curl or straighten them or it will melt onto the iron if you brush them you loose a lot of hair your best bet is to buy real hair extensions if your looking for good quality but if its uust for the extra thinckness they are cute its not all that bad I just don&#x27;t reccomend these for short hair</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted extensions. I didn&#x27;t want to pay that kind of money. Especially because she&#x27;s a teen that changes her mind constantly. ;). She wears them about once or twice a week and loves them. Matches her hair color perfectly!</li>
            <li> I had to shake my head when I saw this hair. the label said &amp;#34;straight full head clip in hair&amp;#34; its just one track not the full head. but you get what you pay for I guess.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product but the quality could still be better. I combed through it and now its frizzy and unattractive. You can tell it&#x27;s not real now.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments when I wear the extensions! Everyone believes it&#x27;s my real hair. Yes, it doesn&#x27;t feel exactly real, but it looks pretty close! I just wish they had more of selection of colors.</li>
            <li> Item was well not worth it. Once out of the package, bar becomes tangled. Color was completely off.  Item not worth one star</li>
            <li> Received on the day it was promised. Same product as advertised. WARNING: Do not curl or straighten it will burn</li>
            <li> Static static static. Very thin, not very full at all.&lt;br /&gt;If you are buying these make sure you buy more then one and make sure its the color you need.</li>
            <li> When you advertise and say whole head it makes one think that it will be enough hair to cover the whole head there&#x27;s only two tracks that should be included in your advertisement if you do not plan to comb it and its just a temporary fix for the evening then its okay reminds me of a very cheap brand of weave</li>
            <li> i choose a 2 star for reasons of the hair is not what i excpected and it is falling out from clip so not to happy.................................</li>
            <li> I didnt get this have been waiting for it to come still hasnt!!!!!!!!!!!!! Like to know where it is or my money!</li>
            <li> I found the item difficult to attatch and it cam without directions. the hair feels and looks real just cannot get it to look natural and stay in place.</li>
            <li> The extensions are of good thickness and look realistic. The only disadvantage is . that they tangle a lot and while you try to detangle them the hair breaks and fall out. But in overall, the product is great comparing to the price and the seller is awesome , very oriented to the customer service.</li>
            <li> I love my other extensions that have the curl to them and i was hoping to find just a straight set of extensions just to mix it up every now and then.. i came across this and thought ok lets try them! I ordered them and when i got them, they were nothing like i had expected. I thought they were going to be dark brown, but instead, they are more of a medium brown...also, they are incredibly thin which is the opposite of my hair...</li>
            <li> Tangles super easily and looks and feels like false hair unless it&#x27;s worked into some kind of hair style. I typically wear it in a long braid. It&#x27;s excellent for the price though!</li>
            <li> Really pretty thanks.</li>
            <li> They never even showed up, its been over a year.&lt;br /&gt;Bullshit</li>
            <li> Mine sucked!! The ends frizzed and and wouldnt tame after a wash I had to cut the frizz out &amp; it continued so I threw it away</li>
            <li> very satisfied. good deal for the price the blend right in with my hair. and they are easy to take in and take out . arrived here very fast they came in a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;would recommend .</li>
            <li> Thought I would of gotten a full set of extension but I only got one clip in.</li>
            <li> do not get this item it only comes with one thin piece of hair i can go Anywere and get a better item</li>
            <li> Tangles real easily, dont take flash pictures. Over all good buy for price.</li>
            <li> The extensions were beautiful and real looking when I received them.  This is exactly what I wanted for a very good price.</li>
            <li> the dark brown was very light brown &amp; the hair is very heavy but very soft! took 2 months to ship.. ended up throwing it away bc the \\&quot;full head\\&quot; didnt blend well. (i have shoulder length hair)</li>
            <li> These are fake hair extensions. They are taking forever to get here. Its been just about a month!!!!!!!!!!!! and still nothing! very disappointed!!!!!!! They are cheap and I do not even know if they are worth the 40 bucks. they better be for taking this long. I wish I could give no stars!!!</li>
            <li> The color was a tad off but it was really soft and stays put. I would buy again :)</li>
            <li> The extensions were all tangled in the packaging when arrived, I tried brushing them and tons of hair fell out.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t use any kind of iron (flat/curler) on them or the hair will melt.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful very long and cheap. It also looks natural. I bought dark brown but it looked a little red. I will dye it.</li>
            <li> Was not the color I ordered it was reddish brown  and it felt really fake got tangled and after 2 days I threw it away. It was good for me bc I wanted to see how extensions would look on me and now I know so I&#x27;ll give 3 stars</li>
            <li> TODO BIEN UN EXCELENTE PRODUCTO  ...&lt;br /&gt;LAS PERSONAS QUE USAN ESTE PRODUCTO ESTAN MUY SATISFECHAS CON EL PRODUCTO&lt;br /&gt;MUY AGRADECIDOS</li>
            <li> They tangle really easy. The package was late. i also i thought i could curl them and i cant unlike what they said .</li>
            <li> This piece is horrible!! I wasn&#x27;t expecting much but this is not acceptable. Just pay a few extra dollars for a nice one</li>
            <li> I ordered these but they came in a more reddish tint rather than a darker brown than I asked for their nice quality and they&#x27;re thick but I&#x27;m kind of disappointed in the listing of color compared to the reality of it</li>
            <li> Not dark brown at all, actually very light brown.  They also don&#x27;t stay in your hair good, falls out unless you bobby pin it in and is also heavy.</li>
            <li> Love love love love love.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun to wear but it damages very easily. I looked up how to take care of extension and I followed the steps but it made the extension feel rough and teased.</li>
            <li> Super fake hair falls right out and looks super fake. straight to the garbage,</li>
            <li> My boyfriend bought me this hair beause i absolutley LOVE hair extensions &amp; i still havent got it! I placed my order on APRIL 17 &amp; still havent got my hair! WTF! I hope i didnt lose my money! URGH &amp;#62;:(</li>
            <li> I love my hair extensions... They arrived pretty quickly as well..  Wonderful color.. And very manageable..</li>
            <li> Got my extentsions today and they are perfect!! The only thing is that they are pretty heavy and I could feel it tugging on my hair when I put them in. Other than that it was great, make sure you trim the ends because they felt very burned and knotted. I think that it would look better curled.</li>
            <li> Great price for product, needs to be washed to eliminate the super shine look.</li>
            <li> Came earlier than expected. (: THEY ARE REALLY LONG AND MY HAIR IS REALLY SHORT, SO WE TRIMMED ONE AND NOW IT LOOKS LIKE I HAVE LOTS OF LAYERS AND ITS REALLY CUTE! i WOULD RECOMMEND THESE TO ANYBODY BECAUSE OF THE PRICE, AND HOW LONG YOU GET, I WAITED ABOUT 2-3 WEEKS FOR THESE, YOU CANT TRACK THEM WHICH IS THE ONLY THING I DISLIKED,BUT OTHERWISE HECK YA LOVE EM!</li>
            <li> The color was perfect and great package. But the hair falls out and I have short hair so it looked choppy and stuck out. But looks great otherwise.</li>
            <li> For the price, its long, shiny, I would say buy two at least,. one isn&#x27;t enough. its good and Its nice and long.</li>
            <li> The shipping was nice, looked neat at first . The &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; gets tangled all the time and it gets really annoying . I cut it into 3 strips a few days ago because it just didn&#x27;t look right in my hair what-so-ever . I accidentally ordered brown instead of black so everything was kind of a disaster . My hair is purple and black so... But it shipped quickly and nicely, looks nice when you brush it for like 4 or 5 minutes, just be careful when you move it around . Haven&#x27;t actually wore these in public and I might just try to dye them black and cut some inches off them.. (The browns not as dark as it shows to be in the picture, it&#x27;s actually a really pretty brown)</li>
            <li> They were really soft but the ends seem split and there hard to brush, but they so blend woth your hair well. cheap but will do.</li>
            <li> look better than glued in ones my aunt paid over a hundred dollars for. and took out in less than a week</li>
            <li> Um can you iron this product on those of you that have bought it um do you guys have short hair if you do does it look ugly</li>
            <li> The hair is was beautiful when I first got it, however after wearing it several times it started getting frizzy and the synthetic material started tangling to the point where I could not use it. I had to use other shorter extensions to blend it in with my hair, too. While it lasted it was great.</li>
            <li> id give it a 4.5 for only one reason though. they were awesome because my earliest estimated deluvery date was on NOV17. i got them so early on OCT31  it came about 2 weeks earlier.&lt;br /&gt;for the quality it is awesome. it is super silky and soft and has not tangled on me yet. it is long and not fake looking at all.&lt;br /&gt;the only BAD thing was that it was MORE RED than black brown. i compared it to my darkish hair and it was really red its not at all the color shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> Was so excited to order these and they never came I check the mail daily still it sucks like really badly</li>
            <li> I ordered brown i received black</li>
            <li> I like the length and the amount you get for the price . Just hair to play around with . I really like it . The shipping wasn&#x27;t too long . I would recommend it .</li>
            <li> these shed but the shipping is decent and i think you would like it for a night out or something</li>
            <li> Ordered sept 8th... october 28th still not here :/</li>
            <li> When I bought this I was excited,  a cheaply priced hair extension yes!  Wrong. This product disappointed me.  I bought dark brown,  and it came as a red purple colour.  It did not match my hair at all.  Plus it is vary heavy and the clips hurt.  I suggest no one buys this.</li>
            <li> Got it today, when I read other reviews about it being &amp;#34;REDDISH&amp;#34; I was expecting a natural red tint like my own hair,  but its a fake red like almost dark pink color . As soon as I put it in the hair in it started falling out everywhere. For 5$ its an om product, Ive bought Better For The Same Price.</li>
            <li> Its scrunched up in a drawer.. I cant use it, its way too plastic-like&lt;br /&gt;I should have listened to the reviews</li>
            <li> Ok so for the price i was sceptical... but they are amazing! Kinda heavy but look great!!! I bought two just in case and their perfect!!! My first order got lost in the mail, but the seller was an absolute angel!! Resent me my origional roder even though they didnt have to and Im glad they did!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ve been wearing these and they still look nice but they get tangled very easily and fast!! I have to carry a comb with me cause if they move at all they get tangled, I would recomend them for an occasion but not everyday wear, way to much of a hassel and to many trips to the bathroom to comb them.</li>
            <li> its just a strand of hair.... it sucks</li>
            <li> LOVE!!!!! I didn&#x27;t expect anything from this order, I was just browsing &amp; saw them for cheap, so &amp;#34;why not?&amp;#34;, right? I&#x27;m super glad I came across these hair extensions! Yeah I took a while for them to get here (placed order oct.5th received them oct.20th), but it&#x27;s so worth the wait &amp; money. $6 is nothing! So affordable! They came packaged nicely (by nicely I mean no tangles or hair was not bent) the hair is so soft!!! You can brush it like normal hair. OMGOSH! I just love them! It&#x27;s one piece. Ear to ear! Beautiful! Makes my hair look thicker! I&#x27;m just so excited to wear them out. So if you have hair like mine (fine hair) I tease my hair wear I want the extension &amp; clip it on! Yes they are clip ons! I will be ordering again soon!!</li>
            <li> These are very nice....you cn cut them to make them shorter, but the part to attach them to your head is big so if you have thin hair it is gonna show.</li>
            <li> I love these so much, I actually cut mine in half so that so much weight wasn&#x27;t on one section of my hair and I think they were a lot better when cut into 2 pieces. But that&#x27;s just me. I use a pick to get rats out and if it&#x27;s a little frizzy I just put some water on my pick and that helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I braided mine to the side today, and i&#x27;m in love with how long and naturally it looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First picture is my natural hair which goes down to about my arm pits, and was actually a lighter brownish red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second picture is with the extensions in to which i died my hair a purplish reddish brown. And I actually cut down some of the extensions because they were down to my butt. [:</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a month and a half since I ordered it and it&#x27;s still not here. They sent me a email saying how did I like it and I still didn&#x27;t get it</li>
            <li> very plastic feeling, but true to color and length,  you should know that the hair gets matted and tangled after a few times of wearing it, even if you store it properly. The clips are great and hide well. Many people felt it looked very real, however I would never let anyone touch my hair because of how fake it felt. great for starter hair piece.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my friends daughter,she is real pleased with the quality,and I have seen the extension and it looks nice and a good quality,good buy</li>
            <li> Please save yourself the money and time, the extensions couldn&#x27;t be more awful, it took a month to get them and I had to contact the seller a few occasions, the hair feels like barbie hair, plus the color I ordered was dark brown and I was sent a burgundy. It does not look at all like the picture at all. I couldn&#x27;t regret it more. Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to persons new to using clip in hair extensions.&lt;br /&gt;Hair is smooth,lovely, has several clips so secure to real hair and will blend with your own hair seamlessly with appropriate blending, trimming, or whichever method yourself or your stylist feels helps to blend this full head silky straight smooth clip in extension with your own hair.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery and customer service was both impeccable and helpful.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this vendor for future purchases and products.</li>
            <li> It was really good! It showed up on time, and is all in all, a great product! Totally worth the money</li>
            <li> Are you kidding me?! This is the most pathetic excuse for &#x27;hair extensions&#x27; $6 more like $1.39 quality its not even remotely close to what grows from a persons head. Maybe it blends well with white or asian hair but textured hair.. NO. Don&#x27;t waste your money. I opened my package &amp; threw it away. Plus it arrived 5weeks after I ordered it..curly tangled and just disappointing.</li>
            <li> Not as advertised. Colour not dark brown but more light auburn. As a result cannot use. Not worth money to ship back.</li>
            <li> yes they were cheap but they didn&#x27;t come on time before Christmas they are not real hair which I assumed the were.. cant curl them or dye them n they are an ugly redish color wish I didn&#x27;t buy the, pretty annoyed!</li>
            <li> good for price does get a little tangled easily but everyone says they look real and not synthetic match my hair perfectly</li>
            <li> Horrible! Bad quality! Color is black.</li>
            <li> you get what you pay for I guess. Cheap but not superb. quality is average, but colours a bit different than stated. Not sure if I can use it then...</li>
            <li> For the price I wasn&#x27;t expecting much but I was pleasantly surprised. It did take a very long time to receive the product though. I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Wore the extensions one time.  They are in a frizzed up mess now.  Pitch</li>
            <li> Hair tangles way to easy</li>
            <li> The hair extensions were great! They matched my hair perfectly and I love the length, plus the price was unbelievable</li>
            <li> I ordered mines janurary 31st and was supposed to get them between the dates of feburary 21st to march 17th an i never recieved them. If i was u i wouldnt waste my time or money on this.</li>
            <li> It is ok for a one time wear or to see if you like having them clipped in your head</li>
            <li> Their beautiful but like all synthetic extensions they get tangled but other than that they look like human hair .</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was very good, but when I got it it was so tangled I&#x27;m tempted just to throw them out. Also the hair ALL kept falling out no matter what. Like when I would try and even finger comb it it sheds like crazy</li>
            <li> I love clip on extensions but these one all the hair comes out too easy.i am very  Disappointed in product.</li>
            <li> Way too thin. Like Barbie hair. Did not blend and very noticeable, went straight to the trash 👎</li>
            <li> Its really pretty but it gets really tangled and it&#x27;s hard to brush it out and I order a dark brown and I got a light brown/reddish but other then that its perfectly fine !</li>
            <li> U cant curl them they burn! They are very then and smell like plastic and I am not a fan of this</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed the hair wasn&amp;#34;t dark brown at all, it was med. brown with red tones... It was thin, I wont buy again.</li>
            <li> the color was not the correct one, they where more burgandy color then dark brown did not like them not completly satisfide.</li>
            <li> They are amazing...I&#x27;m In love with them. Can&#x27;t wait to order more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not exactly what I expected at all!</li>
            <li> I just received my hair extension today. It came packaged neatly and not tangled.&lt;br /&gt;I open it and it is very soft and shinny. the color is beautiful. the only thing i did not like is that it is a&lt;br /&gt;little static . but worth what i paid for</li>
            <li> Really thin, clips broke, plasticy hair. Just no...</li>
            <li> My daughter selected dark brown extensions and they are no where near dark brown. They look like an auburn red. Another product she cannot use.</li>
            <li> It was really nice but it didnt fit my head right. Also the clips arnt like the photo so it was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> It says full head but its only one piece.. the hair is really soft. I like it, but I was hoping it would cover the whole head not just one part.</li>
            <li> When I first opened the package, the hair was soo soft. it was great. the next day it became...semi dead. the clip fell off after the third use.</li>
            <li> I double checked my order and when i received it, it was blonde and a lot of it was coming out.</li>
            <li> You can obviously tell that its fake. It gets tangled extremely easy and it comes in one track 6 or 7 inches long. So you have to cut it apart and add your own clips to get more tracks to make it look like its your actual hair. If you&#x27;re wanting extensions, its better to just spend the money on real hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. Really couldn&#x27;t style it the way I wanted to but it did the job for the time needed.</li>
            <li> I live in jersey . Not a thing to dislike about this product . Very affordable . Good investment I will gladly buy more in the near future ! 😍💳</li>
            <li> Looks great! Received earlier than expected. Also, good quality and doesn&#x27;t look completely fake. Is a little bit staticy, but, can be combed through without shedding. I did expect it to be a little lighter so it did not exactly fit my hair color. But, I wasn&#x27;t too upset because it was expected for the price to not be perfect. Great for the price!</li>
            <li> Horrible dont buy sheded so much</li>
            <li> Not as dark as they look on screen but nice texture. Kinda tangle easily so they need to be stored properly. Clip in nicely depending on your head frame. Easily adjustable.</li>
            <li> If you want to wear it in a side braid it looks good, but any other look fake and ugly! Also it&#x27;s red brown not dark brown at all.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised. I love it.</li>
            <li> I kind of expected these to be bad but I was hoping for the best. Anyway, I ordered the dark brown color, and the length was right. It was long and really soft, but you can definitely tell it&#x27;s fake. It&#x27;s too shiny and it always, ALWAYS, tangles. It&#x27;s always in a knot. And the color is not even close to dark brown. It&#x27;s like a light auburn color. I was not even happy with this product. I don&#x27;t recommend buying this product.</li>
            <li> bad quality and they send me the wrong hair extencion</li>
            <li> I do love this piece I just got it today finally and I would have given it 5 stars but it took forever to get here and before I even wore it some hair came out. But in all its beautiful it has a slight shine but looks just like my real hair and its the perfect length and weight. I am probably going to buy another as I write this because of how pleased I am. You cant go wrong with the price and quality!</li>
            <li> I thought I liked them but it&#x27;s not real hair. Don&#x27;t waste your money. I&#x27;m mad I wasted money on this. More like costume hair...so if you want to be an ugly witch for Halloween...this is for you.</li>
            <li> Good length ,good color , delivering was very fast only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that the hair got is not the best quality .</li>
            <li> The hair was shiny and soft. Unfortunately, the color is lighter than what is portrayed in the picture. It has a reddish tint to it. So I cannot use unless I am ready to color my hair that color..</li>
            <li> They are really thin unlike the description and they sent me black not brown! They are not worth the money do not buy these! I thought maybe they were worth the wait considering it took 3 weeks for me to get them but they are not. Complete waist of money!</li>
            <li> I bought these just to see what I would look like with longer hair, and you definitely get what you pay for. They hurt, you cannot blow dry or straighten them as it states, and the hairs fall out constantly.</li>
            <li> These were supposed to be here on the 14th. its the 30th and i still dont have them.. At this point i just hope i didnt waste my money</li>
            <li> it took 2 weeks longer than it was supposed to to get here, and they are very tangled and the hair falls out a lot.</li>
            <li> I just got mine today in a little bag which made me nervous and came fast than i expected.  When i took the hair exstention out of the package. It was long and beautiful. It was silky and soft but it does have a static. But i will order again. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Would not buy. Quality is crap. Does not feel like &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; hair at all. Feels like Barbie hair. The dark brown shade shown is not what came in the mail. The color is much different and lighter. overall I would Not recommend.</li>
            <li> This hair is very long and beautiful. The color was a little different than my daughter&#x27;s hair, so I haven&#x27;t seen her wear it yet.</li>
            <li> I wish it was of higher quality</li>
            <li> The extensions were not dark brown (2), they are auburn (red) brown (4), I had them replace them and it was replaced with a lighter auburn than the first.  I am not color blind, but whoever doesn&#x27;t know that dark brown is just a shade lighter than black shouldn&#x27;t be advertising they have different colors.  The hair texture is just like doll hair (cabbage patch) straight, it was extremely shiny, and easily tangled.  you&#x27;d have to lacquer your client&#x27;s hair severely to blend. Not what advertised at all.</li>
            <li> I just received the hair extension 2 days ago, just in time for the wedding I was about to attend. It came in a good packaging. I open it and it is very soft, shinny and the color is really rich. I&#x27;m just not sure about its elasticity though, hair was not mean to elastic. But otherwise, really happy with it.</li>
            <li> Not thick enough and not the right color.</li>
            <li> I purchased this last December. there were clips broken, hair was in a  big knot... its not true to color. to be honest, Barbie hair is better. for all the reasons stated above, I never wore it once, and I wasted my money:/ --_</li>
            <li> Synthetic not good at all</li>
            <li> They are full and thick, one group so easier to instal, the hair was smooth and silky. Arrived earlier then expected.</li>
            <li> The color is a perfect match to my hair color! I have thin hair so it took a little bit of time to attach the piece to my hair but once I got it attached it looked great! The reason why I rated it a four out if five stars is because the hair looked messy with movement of hair! I don&#x27;t think it will fair well in a windy environment and unfortunately I live in a windy state!</li>
            <li> It is soft but it&#x27;s also heavy! It&#x27;s good quality but I don&#x27;t know if I would ever purchase again.</li>
            <li> FIRST OF ALL I ORDERED DARK BROWN HAIR! AND IT CAME KINDA LIKE A CHESTNUT COLOR! ANNOYING SINCE THAT WHAS THE COLOR MY HAIR WAS BEFORE BUT I DYED MY DARK BROWN HAIR BEFORE THEY CAME. SECOND! THE HAIR QUALITY IS CHEAP I RAN A BRUSH THROUGH AND LITERALLY A HUGE CHUNK OF HAIR CAME OUT! AND CONTINUES TOO! IT GETS VERY TANGLED VERY EASILY! ALTHOUGH THE \\&quot;HAIR\\&quot; IS THICK IT WONT BE FOR LONG! THIS WEAVE WILL NOT SURVIVE! ALSO IT DOESN&#x27;T CURL OR WAVE OR CRIMP! SO BE PREPARED FOR ONLY STRAIGHT HAIR! AND IF YOU DON&#x27;T HAVE SILKY SMOOTH HAIR ITS NOT GONNA LOOK GOOD ON! THE \\&quot;HAIR\\&quot; IS SO FRAGILE THAT I HAD TO DYE THE HAIR WITH COFFEE!!!! BECAUSE IT CONTINUES TO JUST COME OUT! YOUR PROB JUST BETTER OFF SAVING YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> From seeing all of the negative reviews I was a little nervous, and when they get here they were in a little package and I was just like &#x27;how does a full head fit in this&#x27;. But it did! They&#x27;re SO long, probably about down to my butt. I have thick hair and it blends perfectly! It only took 8 days to get here! I have ordered real hair for 100 dollars before. These look completely real and they&#x27;re 10 dollars!! I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS.</li>
            <li> these are awesome I ordered 4 and only used 2 I have natural curly hair , and when I straightened my hair they blended amazingly 400 thumbs up!!!! best $22.34 spent</li>
            <li> not what we thought it would be.  tangles horribly.</li>
            <li> Not dark brown. Hair doesn&#x27;t curl, the color is reddish with blonde streaks it is NOT dark brown. Don&#x27;t fall for it!</li>
            <li> Loved the hair only bad thing is that it tangles. But you can apply heat. I did.</li>
            <li> It sucks because it took over a month to ship, but as soon as I contacted the seller it got sent out. What a coincidence. The hair is completely awful.</li>
            <li> Wasnt the right color</li>
            <li> I used it alot but over used it lol got all tangled</li>
            <li> Too fake.wrong colour. dark drown is too light.Only looks good up in a ponytail. do not wear it loose</li>
            <li> i ordered these extensions in dark brown .. they arrived 2 weeks earlier than the expected due date. it came in a little package from china, they were not tangled at all. BUT the color was not &amp;#34;dark brown&amp;#34; it has a red tone to it. These extensions are SYNTHETIC, i straightened mine with a straightener who heats up to 350° and they did not melt. i tried curling them on my wand that heats up to 410° but they didnt really curl.. so what i did was i would wrap it around the wand and then &amp;#34;curled&amp;#34; it up with my fingers (kind of the way you do.. when doing the &amp;#34;no heat&amp;#34; curls) after that i pinned them with a bobhy pin for a couple of seconds and THEY CURLED! so overall these extensions are worth it for the price.. just the color was the only thing that wasnt like it seems in the picture.</li>
            <li> Very thin and tangles easily.  Threw mine away</li>
            <li> Really Good Quality specially for the price!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE my hair extensions.! I got them a lot sooner than expected and it was beautiful and long, just what I wanted. Also the color was just perfect.! I will be ordering again Soon.. Again I love it.! :) :)</li>
            <li> Wish I had gotten 2.... Very full</li>
            <li> I loved the length of the hair and the color but was wondering if can be dyed another color can anyone help</li>
