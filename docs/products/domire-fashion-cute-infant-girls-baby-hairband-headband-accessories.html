            <li> There perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no complaints!</li>
            <li> These headbands came in exactly like the picture above. I had contacted the seller regarding i had a missing headband and i would have recieved a refund but i appologize beacuse i ended up finding it under the couch. I would ordering again/ recommend to anyone. They fit my 3month old perfectly.</li>
            <li> Love these they fit my 4 month old perfectly with room to stretch so they will last for a while. Very good quality for the price!</li>
            <li> Really cute but cheaply made.  They should have added felt or something between the band and the flower to keep the tulle from fraying and damaging.  Also like others I didn&#x27;t receive all the colors pictured.  Instead got two of the same color.  I really wanted the yellow but it was one of the missing colors. :( So if quality and all the colors don&#x27;t matter to you get it because the price is good.</li>
            <li> I love these and my baby girl gets sooo many compliments on her bows everywhere we go.</li>
            <li> These are great!  So cute, especially for the price.  My daughter wears one almost every day to coordinate with different outfits.  She&#x27;s 3 months old, and they are a perfect fit!</li>
            <li> These headbands are super cute! I love that I have a headband for my baby girl for every outfit now. I get complements every time she wears one. They also got to me a lot quicker then I expected. They are definitely worth the money and great to dress up any outfit and make sure everyone knows your baby is a girl.</li>
            <li> There are just perfect</li>
            <li> Cute headbands for the price. It did take a couple weeks to receive the item.</li>
            <li> You may get one that isn&#x27;t perfect but the price is so affordable you can&#x27;t complain. I love these bows. They don&#x27;t leave an indentation in daughter&#x27;s head and are very sweet looking. You can use them for dressy or casual outfits. Order in advance becuase they take about 2 weeks to arrive.</li>
            <li> Love this it fits perfectly on my 2 month old daughter&#x27;s head</li>
            <li> Love them... variety or colors for great price</li>
            <li> fit a little small, but my little girl is 18months and still no hair that&#x27;s why I got them</li>

            <li> I wish there were more colors I need a tan/gold or brown and a black one..They are cute and add a bit of fancy for Sunday outfits.</li>
            <li> These fit my never but are a little tight. In their defense, her head is in the 9th percentile so it&#x27;s huge. These are very cute and I&#x27;ve seen no issues with quality and I&#x27;ve been using them for at least a month.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these headbands.My 3yr old Great Grandaughter loves to wear headbands when she plays dress up,and she wears them to school.</li>

Would definitely recommend them to anyone.</li>

            <li> I bought these to add to a shower gift. I didn&#x27;t use them, because  they took so long to arrive. It was within the time frame stated, but I ordered something else at the same time, and that item arrived 12 days faster. In the picture, they looked interesting, but flatter. In reality, the bows are almost fluffy, and partially made of a loose netting. Not what I anticipated.</li>
