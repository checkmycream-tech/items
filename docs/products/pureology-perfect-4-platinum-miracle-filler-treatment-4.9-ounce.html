            <li>Use sparingly, it makes a nice sealer for the hair.</li>
            <li>My salon stopped carrying this line, so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;m buying some more as I&#x27;m leaving this feedback.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>My hair dresser recommended the product and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>My hairdresser told me you don&#x27;t realize how healthy this helps make your hair until you stop using it.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>So glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Hair feels soft and easy to manage.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend !!!</li>
            <li>the Platinum means its a great product, has nothing that I could see about the Platinum blonde color.</li>
            <li>I spray this on my washed hair after I come out of the shower and it detangles and makes the hair shafts smooth.</li>
            <li>Went to my stylist who gave me a trim and this was one of the free samples she gave me.</li>
            <li>My hair is much softer and has a healthy shine to it again.</li>
            <li>Love this lovely smelling product which makes my hair tangle free &amp; ready to blow dry &amp; silky smooth!</li>
            <li>I was lucky and bought a sample size for $7 at a store.  </li>
            <li>It did make my hair super silky</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and keeps my hair soft without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>This stuff is excellent, I have thin, baby fine hair that&#x27;s highlighted (blonde) and that just thins out the shaft a bit more, this does exactly what it says, it fills in the hair.  </li>
            <li>She was right.  </li>
            <li>But WOW.. My hair is shiney and healthy looking after the first use.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use very much.</li>
            <li>First time trying pureology and like it very much.</li>
            <li>Nice scent, does not aggravate my allergies, without this and my Wet Brush I can&#x27;t even detangle my hair.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff!  </li>
            <li>this helps to keep my colored long hair healthy and easier to comb out.</li>
            <li>I love this product for my long hair.</li>
            <li>beautiful texture, don&#x27;t know that it does everything it says, but does make your hair soft and keeps the moisture in the hair that it loses from blow drying...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for those who need a leave-in conditioner!</li>
            <li>My hair looked really damaged before I began using this product.  </li>
            <li>This product really helped my over processed hair repair.  </li>
            <li>Gave my hair so much fullness and body.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t really provide that - have to use a leave-in condition too.</li>
            <li>Really recommend this highly.</li>
            <li>Repairs my fine, dry, lightened blond hair.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really rate the overall intent of the product as to keep highlights bright, I won&#x27;t be using it again as I could not get past the oily look.</li>
            <li>If you high highly processed, damaged hair - fork out the money for this.</li>
            <li>I definitely think it&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Hair feels very soft once the product is applied.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m probably paying less per use than if I used a cheap brand.  </li>
            <li>It smells heavenly and makes my hair so soft and silky and shiny.  </li>
            <li>working mother of two young ones.)</li>
            <li>My hair is highlighted blonde and this makes it shiny and really does help retain the color.  </li>
            <li>Then blow dry on cool since I have lightened fragile hair.</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to someone with super thick hair since it may be too much too handle.</li>
            <li>It is much easier than some other products that are similar but require a long w a it time (something I don&#x27;t have since I am a full time</li>
            <li>It makes my red hair soft and straighter.</li>
            <li>Gives a nice amount of thickness to my very thin hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure the long lasting effects of this product due to my hair being so overprocessed, but I do love the way it feels in my hair and therefor will not give up using it.</li>

            <li> A little goes a long way since this is very concentrated.</li>
            <li> Shipping took too long though.</li>
            <li> Because I have long hair</li>
            <li> It will end up saving you in the long run!</li>
            <li> ordered this product on a saturday morning, got it tuesday after the long holiday weekend!</li>
            <li> It also reduces frizziness when I dry it.</li>
            <li> I only shampoo my hair every other day, and every other day just rinse out the product</li>
            <li> I only sprayed a few sprays at the scalp and the ends.  </li>
            <li> Not what I expected for the price.</li>
            <li> You need very little and the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It almost appears to seal the ends making my hair less frizzy.</li>
            <li> I bought my bottle of shampoo on 12/17/14, I have used less than half of the bottle to date.  </li>
            <li> Try using less, if this happens.  </li>
            <li> Things people have to remember is that when you buy a &amp;#34;Salon&amp;#34; product that you will &amp;#34;use&amp;#34; less then the store brands.</li>
            <li> No more frizzy hair, no more broken ends - I have changed up my whole regimen of hair care products now</li>
            <li> Not sure what other people are saying about not detangling hair since I have no issues - you might want to reconsider your conditioner if that&#x27;s the case.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for the past couple of years.  </li>
            <li> It keeps the color brighter longer and truly helps my hair from getting dull.</li>
            <li> Not a good look!  </li>
            <li> I have badly overprocessed hair, splitting, breaking, frizzy.</li>
            <li> I hate my frizzy hair if I fail to use this product!  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been disappointed with a pureology product yet.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is great for highlighted blondes. It keeps the color brighter longer and truly helps my hair from getting dull.</li>
            <li> made hair feel greasy</li>
            <li> Great products!!! Hair feels soft and easy to manage.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend !!!</li>
            <li> Repairs my fine, dry, lightened blond hair. Nice scent, does not aggravate my allergies, without this and my Wet Brush I can&#x27;t even detangle my hair. I found out about both products from my hair stylist.</li>
            <li> beautiful texture, don&#x27;t know that it does everything it says, but does make your hair soft and keeps the moisture in the hair that it loses from blow drying...nice product.  note:  the Platinum means its a great product, has nothing that I could see about the Platinum blonde color.</li>
            <li> First time trying pureology and like it very much. I change hair products 2 to times per year and this is one I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product. Use sparingly, it makes a nice sealer for the hair.</li>
            <li> this helps to keep my colored long hair healthy and easier to comb out.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice amount of thickness to my very thin hair. You don&#x27;t need to use very much.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by a friend who is a former cosmetologist.  I luv it &amp; I&#x27;m buying some more as I&#x27;m leaving this feedback.  Highly recommend for those who need a leave-in conditioner!</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot. It makes my red hair soft and straighter. Shipping took too long though.</li>
            <li> While it may work well as a filler it does not moisturize and detangle enough for my liking. It smells great though.</li>
            <li> Good product but bottle leaks when spraying</li>
            <li> I was lucky and bought a sample size for $7 at a store.  Not a big commitment for yet another product that may or may not work.  But WOW.. My hair is shiney and healthy looking after the first use. I sprayed it evenly and brushed it through damp hair. Then blow dry on cool since I have lightened fragile hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and I love it. Makes my hair shiny and beautiful</li>
            <li> I bleach my hair and this is the best product I have ever used. I love all Pureology products!</li>
            <li> I use a lot of Pureology products.  I&#x27;m not sure the long lasting effects of this product due to my hair being so overprocessed, but I do love the way it feels in my hair and therefor will not give up using it.</li>
            <li> I spray this on my washed hair after I come out of the shower and it detangles and makes the hair shafts smooth. You need very little and the bottle lasts a long time. My salon stopped carrying this line, so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon. Because I have long hair and I have it highlighted, I can not do without this product.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used this product on my hair after my highlights so I thought I just had to have.  After receiving and trying I would not recommend this product.  It did make my hair super silky but with that came an oily look at the scalp after blow drying.  I only sprayed a few sprays at the scalp and the ends.  Not a good look!  I can&#x27;t really rate the overall intent of the product as to keep highlights bright, I won&#x27;t be using it again as I could not get past the oily look.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser recommended the product and I LOVE it. I have hair that falls just below my shoulders and it used to be a pain to comb through after I washed it. Now, it&#x27;s a breeze and my hair feels like silk. It also reduces frizziness when I dry it. I definitely think it&#x27;s worth the cost. I haven&#x27;t been disappointed with a pureology product yet. Plus, it smells great! I&#x27;ve used it every couple days and I still have plenty after a couple months.</li>
            <li> I love this product for my long hair. It smells wonderful and keeps my hair soft without weighing it down. It almost appears to seal the ends making my hair less frizzy.</li>
            <li> This stuff is excellent, I have thin, baby fine hair that&#x27;s highlighted (blonde) and that just thins out the shaft a bit more, this does exactly what it says, it fills in the hair.  I use all the Perfect 4 Platinum products, shampoo, conditioner and this filler and my hairdresser said my hair has never looked healthier.  Don&#x27;t balk at the price, you literally only need a dab of the shampoo and conditioner.  I bought my bottle of shampoo on 12/17/14, I have used less than half of the bottle to date.  I only shampoo my hair every other day, and every other day just rinse out the product so I&#x27;m probably paying less per use than if I used a cheap brand.  Really recommend this highly.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It smells heavenly and makes my hair so soft and silky and shiny.  Give it a try!</li>
            <li> My hair looked really damaged before I began using this product.  I immediately noticed a difference.  My hair is much softer and has a healthy shine to it again.</li>
            <li> Love this stay-on conditioner on my hair!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the bomb! I have badly overprocessed hair, splitting, breaking, frizzy. Went to my stylist who gave me a trim and this was one of the free samples she gave me. Are you kidding me? This stuff is truly a miracle! No more frizzy hair, no more broken ends - I have changed up my whole regimen of hair care products now but this truly is at the core of what has helped rehab my hair. Not sure what other people are saying about not detangling hair since I have no issues - you might want to reconsider your conditioner if that&#x27;s the case. If you high highly processed, damaged hair - fork out the money for this. It will end up saving you in the long run!</li>

            <li> This stuff is great. Gave my hair so much fullness and body. Great styling aid!  I&#x27;m going to buy another bottle!</li>
            <li> Not what I expected for the price. Expected soft, silky hair but it doesn&#x27;t really provide that - have to use a leave-in condition too.</li>
            <li> ordered this product on a saturday morning, got it tuesday after the long holiday weekend! packaged perfectly! great as a detangler and color protecter</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff!  I&#x27;ve read where others said that it makes their hair sticky.  Try using less, if this happens.  Things people have to remember is that when you buy a &amp;#34;Salon&amp;#34; product that you will &amp;#34;use&amp;#34; less then the store brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for the past couple of years.  Works great!</li>
            <li> Love this lovely smelling product which makes my hair tangle free &amp; ready to blow dry &amp; silky smooth!</li>
            <li> Arrived quick&lt;br /&gt;Good price&lt;br /&gt;Works fantastic&lt;br /&gt;Smells amazing</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this product. It smells great but caused my hair to be frizzy. It&#x27;s a great detangler but I didn&#x27;t care for the after effects.</li>
            <li> Liquid Gold!  This product is perfect for my fine, frizzy blond hair.  It makes it easier to comb through after washing, and tames the frizzies.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser told me you don&#x27;t realize how healthy this helps make your hair until you stop using it. She was right.  I ran out and noticed a big difference. I love it.  My hair is highlighted blonde and this makes it shiny and really does help retain the color.  So glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Use this after washing your hair as a styling aid. Adds body, seals ends and SMELLS HEAVENLY!!! Love Pureology Products!</li>
            <li> I hate my frizzy hair if I fail to use this product!  Great conditioner and leave in product!</li>
