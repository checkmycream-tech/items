            <li>Greatest foot file I have ever used and  especially love that I can purchase refills when necessary, however file washes off after each use and is brand new again and again..</li>
            <li>I have purchased and tried many foot scrubbers, but I must say by far this is the best.</li>
            <li>My feet are very smooth now.</li>
            <li>It is the best foot file I have ever used it smooths out the callouses  on your heel  to a very soft smooth</li>

            <li>Love this file.</li>
            <li>Both my daughter and I love this file.  </li>
            <li>On time delivery and will make  a perfect gift later in the year.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I decided to give this tool a try.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this foot file.</li>
            <li>I have 8 more to go.</li>
            <li>Love It.</li>
            <li>Lasts for 6 months or more when used weekly.</li>
            <li>This is a great tool for getting nice soft feet ,plus you can just buy the refill.</li>
            <li>Better than any metal file.</li>
            <li>It is best used when your feet or the file is slightly wet.  </li>
            <li>great professional grade pedicure tool</li>
            <li>-- It works great and feels great, has a large surface with two different grits, and is easy to hold.</li>
            <li>I own this foot file and if professionals use it \\&quot;across the board\\&quot;, there must be something right about it.  </li>
            <li>Easy to hold.</li>
            <li>I have also purchased OPI&#x27;s foot file replacement which slides easily onto the handle.</li>
            <li>This tool would be a good compliment to the metal file but it doesn&#x27;t do the entire job on its own</li>
            <li>It works fine, but I don&#x27;t feel for the price</li>
            <li>Delieverd on time and excellent product, which is recommended to all to try, it works wonders and makes your feet feel light, slight scrub movements and the results are visible</li>
            <li>The file paper part is heavy duty and works great!!</li>
            <li>By the time she was done, my feet were silky smooth and callus free, and I knew I had to have one of these for home use.  </li>
            <li>My feet are so smooth.</li>
            <li>I searched for a foot file that I liked as much but couldn&#x27;t find one.</li>
            <li>perfectly smooth (to where even nylons won&#x27;t grab and snag).</li>
            <li>(It also has refills available.)</li>
            <li>For accomplishing it&#x27;s goal, to smooth my feet - I give it 5 stars, but in design, I give it 1 star.</li>
            <li>Your feet will be smooth.</li>
            <li>I like the feel of the while product as its easy to apply the right amount of pressure!</li>
            <li>My manicurist told me it is best to use on dry feet, but I have better luck with it when my feet are slightly damp after a good soak.  </li>
            <li>I bought it after a nail technician used it during a pedicure, and I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth the money!</li>
            <li>I have tried lots of different foot files, but this one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>and it rinses clean like a breeze.</li>
            <li>Feet are super smooth.</li>
            <li>Received right away!</li>
            <li>Works very well leaving smooth feel!</li>
            <li>Large, two sided.....effective!!  </li>
            <li>Our feetsies are so soft and smooth:)  </li>
            <li>Overall it was worth the money and does a good job for my needs.  </li>
            <li>This had my summer feet smooth after first use.  </li>
            <li>My feet are so smooth and pretty</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this great product, definitely does the job!</li>
            <li>I love wearing sandals and walking around barefoot, hence I have some pretty decent calluses on my feet.</li>
            <li>so I immediately put it to use, and I was just as pleased with these results as I was after my spa treatment - and that&#x27;s without all the professional pre-pedi soaking</li>
            <li>Definitely get this and make your feet nice looking and feeling without having to have pedicures done.  </li>
            <li>Not harsh but effective so much so that my diebetic fiance have used this on his feet without any issues.  </li>
            <li>Well worth</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right</li>
            <li>Noticed a difference on my heels right away.  </li>
            <li>This thing is awesome for rough dry cracked heels.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for something a little more professional or effective.</li>
            <li>I first was made aware of this foot file by the lady who does my pedicures.  </li>
            <li>She bought me my first one</li>
            <li>Really works!</li>
            <li>I first discovered it during a pedicure at a day spa.  </li>
            <li>It is not harsh to the skin, but it gets the job done - leaving the feet smooth.  </li>
            <li>My heels are 90% better after only 2 uses.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used this file, I started with the OPI Soften product on them first before filing.</li>
            <li>the file did a lot the first time, but I still had some room for improvement.</li>
            <li>Wow!!!!</li>
            <li>The handle finally broke after many years, so this time I replaced the whole unit.  </li>
            <li>Positive experience.</li>
            <li>I love this, it works wonders on dry heals and all areas of your feet.</li>
            <li>I quickly changed my mind when I saw this thing in action.  </li>
            <li>Will certainly buy again.</li>
            <li>I really do like the product, i have really dry feet, so one side could be more aggressive.  </li>
            <li>the one I got is like the ones you see in a real spa.</li>
            <li>The handle doesn&#x27;t break and it really smooths out the bottom of your feet.  </li>
            <li>This really works so</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t like the fact that the salon applied the callus remover to parts of my foot that I didn&#x27;t think needed it.  </li>
            <li>Very strudy, others I&#x27;ve had just break.</li>
            <li>This file works very well.  </li>
            <li>It smoothes my rough feet probably better than anything else I have used.  </li>
            <li>It is much quicker to use and is durable.</li>
            <li>This really works and is reasonable in price for the quality.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend getting one of these and using it everyday to keep your feet super smooth throughout the year.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it a few more times -</li>
            <li>The only foot file worth buying.</li>
            <li>But consistently using this product WILL get you the results you want... and never expected you could have on your feet.  </li>
            <li>This file has one side a bit rougher than the other, so you can get the roughest parts off then smooth your feet out</li>
            <li>Mine still seems like it is brand new</li>
            <li>You can just pop off the file part and replace it with a new one, otherwise.</li>
            <li>Per the instructions, I then rinsed my feet and went to work with the white (coarse) side - within just a minute or so, I noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t buy again and certainly wouldn&#x27;t recommend - can buy better at the drug store for less than $5.00!!!</li>
            <li>The plastic handle is sturdy, and there is a refill of the white sandpaper for when you wear the first set out.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and it came with an extra set of filing pads that was not stated in the product description.</li>
            <li>So glad I bought this - will be tossing all the other junk in my drawer, since this is the only thing that works.</li>
            <li>I put eucerin on my heels afterward and if I do both for a few days my heels and calluses get more smooth than I ever had them after the few pedicures I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>Living through Midwest winters is challenging in a lot of respects, and dry rough feet seem to be par for the course.  </li>
            <li>This one gives you the same results but is much easier on your feet.</li>
            <li>I have one foot 2 sizes smaller than the other and since my one shoe doesn&#x27;t fit properly, I end up with a really calloused heel.</li>
            <li>I will definitely recommend this to my family and friends (and I don&#x27;t usually do that with many products).</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and highly recommend it;  I use it daily between pedicures.</li>
            <li>I was totally surprise on how quickly it smoothed my rough callouses.  </li>
            <li>It has two sides, one to get all the excess dry skin and the other side to smooth your feet.</li>
            <li>This file works really well at smoothing the bottom of my feet without being too rough.</li>
            <li>but for someone who really wants the callous gone, this will do minimal work.</li>
            <li>Works well due to large surface.</li>
            <li>It is a more expensive file, but well worth the investment both due to the results</li>

            <li> perfectly smooth (to where even nylons won&#x27;t grab and snag).</li>
            <li> (It also has refills available.)</li>
            <li> For accomplishing it&#x27;s goal, to smooth my feet - I give it 5 stars, but in design, I give it 1 star.</li>
            <li> Your feet will be smooth.</li>
            <li> I like the feel of the while product as its easy to apply the right amount of pressure!</li>
            <li> My manicurist told me it is best to use on dry feet, but I have better luck with it when my feet are slightly damp after a good soak.  </li>
            <li> I bought it after a nail technician used it during a pedicure, and I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Totally worth the money!</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of different foot files, but this one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> and it rinses clean like a breeze.</li>
            <li> Feet are super smooth.</li>
            <li> Received right away!</li>
            <li> Works very well leaving smooth feel!</li>
            <li> Large, two sided.....effective!!  </li>
            <li> Our feetsies are so soft and smooth:)  </li>
            <li> Overall it was worth the money and does a good job for my needs.  </li>
            <li> This had my summer feet smooth after first use.  </li>
            <li> My feet are so smooth and pretty</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this great product, definitely does the job!</li>
            <li> I love wearing sandals and walking around barefoot, hence I have some pretty decent calluses on my feet.</li>
            <li> so I immediately put it to use, and I was just as pleased with these results as I was after my spa treatment - and that&#x27;s without all the professional pre-pedi soaking</li>
            <li> Definitely get this and make your feet nice looking and feeling without having to have pedicures done.  </li>
            <li> Not harsh but effective so much so that my diebetic fiance have used this on his feet without any issues.  </li>
            <li> Well worth</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right</li>
            <li> Noticed a difference on my heels right away.  </li>
            <li> This thing is awesome for rough dry cracked heels.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for something a little more professional or effective.</li>
            <li> I first was made aware of this foot file by the lady who does my pedicures.  </li>
            <li> She bought me my first one</li>
            <li> Really works!</li>
            <li> I first discovered it during a pedicure at a day spa.  </li>
            <li> It is not harsh to the skin, but it gets the job done - leaving the feet smooth.  </li>
            <li> My heels are 90% better after only 2 uses.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used this file, I started with the OPI Soften product on them first before filing.</li>
            <li> the file did a lot the first time, but I still had some room for improvement.</li>
            <li> Wow!!!!</li>
            <li> The handle finally broke after many years, so this time I replaced the whole unit.  </li>
            <li> Positive experience.</li>
            <li> I love this, it works wonders on dry heals and all areas of your feet.</li>
            <li> I quickly changed my mind when I saw this thing in action.  </li>
            <li> Will certainly buy again.</li>
            <li> I really do like the product, i have really dry feet, so one side could be more aggressive.  </li>
            <li> the one I got is like the ones you see in a real spa.</li>
            <li> The handle doesn&#x27;t break and it really smooths out the bottom of your feet.  </li>
            <li> This really works so</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like the fact that the salon applied the callus remover to parts of my foot that I didn&#x27;t think needed it.  </li>
            <li> Very strudy, others I&#x27;ve had just break.</li>
            <li> This file works very well.  </li>
            <li> It smoothes my rough feet probably better than anything else I have used.  </li>
            <li> It is much quicker to use and is durable.</li>
            <li> This really works and is reasonable in price for the quality.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend getting one of these and using it everyday to keep your feet super smooth throughout the year.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few more times -</li>
            <li> The only foot file worth buying.</li>
            <li> But consistently using this product WILL get you the results you want... and never expected you could have on your feet.  </li>
            <li> This file has one side a bit rougher than the other, so you can get the roughest parts off then smooth your feet out</li>
            <li> Mine still seems like it is brand new</li>
            <li> You can just pop off the file part and replace it with a new one, otherwise.</li>
            <li> Per the instructions, I then rinsed my feet and went to work with the white (coarse) side - within just a minute or so, I noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t buy again and certainly wouldn&#x27;t recommend - can buy better at the drug store for less than $5.00!!!</li>
            <li> The plastic handle is sturdy, and there is a refill of the white sandpaper for when you wear the first set out.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and it came with an extra set of filing pads that was not stated in the product description.</li>
            <li> So glad I bought this - will be tossing all the other junk in my drawer, since this is the only thing that works.</li>
            <li> I put eucerin on my heels afterward and if I do both for a few days my heels and calluses get more smooth than I ever had them after the few pedicures I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> Living through Midwest winters is challenging in a lot of respects, and dry rough feet seem to be par for the course.  </li>
            <li> This one gives you the same results but is much easier on your feet.</li>
            <li> I have one foot 2 sizes smaller than the other and since my one shoe doesn&#x27;t fit properly, I end up with a really calloused heel.</li>
            <li> I will definitely recommend this to my family and friends (and I don&#x27;t usually do that with many products).</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and highly recommend it;  I use it daily between pedicures.</li>
            <li> I was totally surprise on how quickly it smoothed my rough callouses.  </li>
            <li> It has two sides, one to get all the excess dry skin and the other side to smooth your feet.</li>
            <li> This file works really well at smoothing the bottom of my feet without being too rough.</li>
            <li> but for someone who really wants the callous gone, this will do minimal work.</li>
            <li> Works well due to large surface.</li>
            <li> It is a more expensive file, but well worth the investment both due to the results</li>
            <li> I kept using them because I didn&#x27;t want to feel like I was wasting my money, but they worked so slowly or not at all that it was a waste of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it last a long time.</li>
            <li> After using dozens of the $2-6 foot files you find at drug stores and beauty stores, I found these did not last long at all.</li>
            <li> My old pumice stone didn&#x27;t do half the job that the OPI foot file has done in a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> It took half the time than my old file.  </li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The file lasts a long time and I like that I can keep it in the shower to use it as often as I need to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a litany of other foot products - standard sandpaper-y files, metal files, even the torturous callus remover blades...</li>
            <li> It will get rids of loads of dry skin and calluses.</li>
            <li> I get really dry feet because I work in a factory</li>
            <li> Their are two types of feet in this world, ones that shed skin and others that hold on to dry skin.  </li>
            <li> My sister and I were born with the dry, cracked heels.</li>
            <li> I can not live without this product, Nothing has ever matched this product.</li>
            <li> Bought this because of great reviews and have not been disappointed!</li>
            <li> You get the same results as other foot files but its not as rough on your feet.</li>
            <li> , it works dry or wet.</li>
            <li> Can be used dry or wet.</li>
            <li> I can use it wet or dry and not worry about ruining the file.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s done wonders on my calluses and rough heels.</li>
            <li> The file performs as expected.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I was expecting, but this file is only glorified sand paper.</li>
            <li> the money!!And WAY cheaper on Amazon than any other place.</li>
            <li> For this price I expected something a bit special - I got something very ordinary and awkward to hold/use.</li>
            <li> She answered that grating is for cheese and was too harsh for your feet causing micro abrasions to your foot which could invite foot fungus.  </li>
            <li> I smoothed my feet with the green side and finished with some lotion.   </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect to wipe away months or years of dead skin at once.  </li>
            <li> My first time with it, I took a particularly nasty callus down too far.</li>
            <li> Ladies &amp; Gentleman, forget all other foot files, pumic stones, and pedi eggs!!!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to keep from shoving them in people&#x27;s faces all day.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for at least 15 years.</li>
            <li> OkOk really like this hate that there is a requirement for words.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried pumice stones, microplanes, ped-eggs and a myriad of other products with mediocre results.  </li>
            <li> I use it in the shower (seems like a bad idea to use it dry, but just my opinion).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my dumb fault for reading the description wrong....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been to a lot of shops to get pedicures and hate how rough the material is that they use on your feet.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, I was WRONG!  </li>
            <li> I have one of those expensive electric foot files, it pales in comparison!!  </li>
            <li> Did the job but when cleaning the file in water, the base holds on it the water</li>
            <li> I promise you wont be disappointed!</li>

            <li> This is my second foot file.  I use it often and it last a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of foot files.  This had my summer feet smooth after first use.  The file paper part is heavy duty and works great!! I like the feel of the while product as its easy to apply the right amount of pressure!</li>
            <li> I really do like the product, i have really dry feet, so one side could be more aggressive.  If i used it more often, im sure the results would be better.</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of different foot files, but this one is by far the best.  I bought it after a nail technician used it during a pedicure, and I was not disappointed.  It is best used when your feet or the file is slightly wet.  It will get rids of loads of dry skin and calluses.</li>
            <li> I love this, it works wonders on dry heals and all areas of your feet. I bought this one for my daughter for christmas. She loves it, my son has one too and uses his in the shower. That&#x27;s right, it works dry or wet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I was expecting, but this file is only glorified sand paper. The plastic handle is sturdy, and there is a refill of the white sandpaper for when you wear the first set out.  I was hoping for something a little more professional or effective.</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome for rough dry cracked heels. My nail gal uses it so I bought one too. Love it!</li>
            <li> Living through Midwest winters is challenging in a lot of respects, and dry rough feet seem to be par for the course.  I&#x27;ve tried pumice stones, microplanes, ped-eggs and a myriad of other products with mediocre results.  As fate would have it, I visited a local spa in February and treated myself to a pedicure with the works:  leg massage, foot soak, parafin wax dip - the whole nine yards, but the tool my technician pulled out to slough off the dead skin (OPI Pedicure Foot File)surprised me.  I hadn&#x27;t seen it before, and just by looking at it, I wasn&#x27;t too convinced it would do the job.  I quickly changed my mind when I saw this thing in action.  By the time she was done, my feet were silky smooth and callus free, and I knew I had to have one of these for home use.  It just arrived today so I immediately put it to use, and I was just as pleased with these results as I was after my spa treatment - and that&#x27;s without all the professional pre-pedi soaking and I saved myself about $65!  I love, love, love this product!</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time. Works well due to large surface. Easy to hold.</li>
            <li> The spa I go to for pedicures uses this same file but sells it for twice the price! I LOVE LOVE LOVE this file! Does the job and does it well! I highly recommend getting one of these and using it everyday to keep your feet super smooth throughout the year.</li>
            <li> This file works really well at smoothing the bottom of my feet without being too rough. Just remember that moisturizer of some kind must be used to keep the softness!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews, but felt compelled to do so after being so amazed. This file is so awesome, I cried. Stop reading reviews and just get it already.</li>
            <li> I guess I was under the impression that this was one of those metal type foot files that sort of &#x27;grate&#x27; your feet. It&#x27;s my dumb fault for reading the description wrong.... but for someone who really wants the callous gone, this will do minimal work. The salons use a grater type foot file on me and it took me forever to find one but I did... the one I got is like the ones you see in a real spa. This tool would be a good compliment to the metal file but it doesn&#x27;t do the entire job on its own</li>
            <li> I first was made aware of this foot file by the lady who does my pedicures.  She bought me my first one and I bought the second one.  The file lasts a long time and I like that I can keep it in the shower to use it as often as I need to.</li>
            <li> My OPI Pedicure foot file arrived even before its promised date.  It is just what I was expecting and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> I had this in my wish list for over a year. I wish I had just bought it. Skip anything that cuts the bottom of your feet and get this! My feet are very smooth now. It keeps my feet nice between pedicures. I use it in the shower (seems like a bad idea to use it dry, but just my opinion).</li>
            <li> I just had a pedicure &amp; when she whipped this out it looked like it wasn&#x27;t going to do anything.  Let me tell you, I was WRONG!  My feet have never been smoother.  I ordered one as soon as I got home.  I have one of those expensive electric foot files, it pales in comparison!!  Totally worth the money!</li>
            <li> This is the best foot file ever.  The handle doesn&#x27;t break and it really smooths out the bottom of your feet.  Will never purchase anything else.</li>
            <li> What wouldn&#x27;t you like, the foot file has replacement heads you can order, it&#x27;s curved to it fits the arch of your foot perfectly. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase.  It will be the only one I ever use.</li>
            <li> This foot file is the best I&#x27;ve ever owned. It&#x27;s done wonders on my calluses and rough heels. My old pumice stone didn&#x27;t do half the job that the OPI foot file has done in a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I own two of these. Best foot file I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Best foot file EVER.  Stumbled upon it at a friend&#x27;s house.  Loved it immediately.  Works Great!!!  I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Ladies &amp; Gentleman, forget all other foot files, pumic stones, and pedi eggs!!!  BUY THIS ONE! I works wonders! I promise you wont be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Works very well leaving smooth feel!</li>
            <li> This is the best file I have ever used!!</li>
            <li> It is the best foot file I have ever used it smooths out the callouses  on your heel  to a very soft smooth feel.&lt;br /&gt;Diane from Tumwater</li>
            <li> Speedy delivery. Exactly what I wanted and it came with an extra set of filing pads that was not stated in the product description.</li>
            <li> I have purchased and tried many foot scrubbers, but I must say by far this is the best. My feet are so smooth. Will certainly buy again.</li>
            <li> It works fine, but I don&#x27;t feel for the price it is any better than what you can get at Target for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> I had one of these and after years of use and dropping it on the tile floor, the handle broke. I searched for a foot file that I liked as much but couldn&#x27;t find one. I was glad when I found the OPI on Amazon!!</li>
            <li> Received right away! Works great! Leaves feet smooth!</li>
            <li> I love OPI nail polish, but I didn&#x27;t know about this item until a salon tech used one on my feet. AMAZING RESULTS! I have one foot 2 sizes smaller than the other and since my one shoe doesn&#x27;t fit properly, I end up with a really calloused heel. This file has one side a bit rougher than the other, so you can get the roughest parts off then smooth your feet out perfectly smooth (to where even nylons won&#x27;t grab and snag). It is a more expensive file, but well worth the investment both due to the results and it seems to last forever. Mine still seems like it is brand new, it hasn&#x27;t lost it&#x27;s grit at all and it rinses clean like a breeze. Fantastic purchase, I will never buy another brand foot file again!</li>
            <li> Love this file. Is the one they use in the salon. Can be used dry or wet. My feet have never felt so good.</li>
            <li> Amazing!  Really works!</li>
            <li> Recently a Nail Tech asked what I use during my routine foot care.  When I responded &#x27;one of those egg grating things or a pumice stone&#x27;.  She answered that grating is for cheese and was too harsh for your feet causing micro abrasions to your foot which could invite foot fungus.  She commented that the pumice stone can not be effectively santized and also can harbor fungus.  So I switched to the OPI foot file she was using as the fiberglass material does not harbor fungus.  I am happy with it. (It also has refills available.)</li>
            <li> This is what I&#x27;ve been looking for!  Large, two sided.....effective!!  Noticed a difference on my heels right away.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Greatest foot file I have ever used and  especially love that I can purchase refills when necessary, however file washes off after each use and is brand new again and again..</li>
            <li> Bought this because of great reviews and have not been disappointed! I put eucerin on my heels afterward and if I do both for a few days my heels and calluses get more smooth than I ever had them after the few pedicures I&#x27;ve ever had. It also doesn&#x27;t hurt my feet at all.</li>
            <li> The women who does pedıcure me likes and thınks ,ıt ıs satısfing to be satısfıed .she always uses ıt ın her pedıcure place ..</li>
            <li> No words can describe this product. It is awesome. I will use all my life. My foot change a lot.</li>
            <li> This thing works, and it saves me a trip to the podiatrist</li>
            <li> I looked at the pic and thought it was something else. I was looking for the one that looks like a grater for your feet.</li>
            <li> I love this tool!  I first discovered it during a pedicure at a day spa.  It is not harsh to the skin, but it gets the job done - leaving the feet smooth.  There are two grits - one on each side and you can get refills for it.  Really easy to use - feels good on the feet!</li>
            <li> Both my daughter and I love this file.  Our feetsies are so soft and smooth:)  Great product.  The handle finally broke after many years, so this time I replaced the whole unit.  You can just pop off the file part and replace it with a new one, otherwise.</li>
            <li> On time delivery and will make  a perfect gift later in the year.</li>
            <li> Awesome tool. Substantial and doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s going to fall apart like some cheaper brands. As good as the spa!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this great product, definitely does the job!</li>
            <li> This really works so well I&#x27;m in disbelief!  I&#x27;ve been getting pedicures for years just to have the callus remover treatment.  I decided to give this tool a try.  I discovered it while looking for a callus remover on Amazon.  I have only used this twice.  Both times were after being in the pool and then showering.  I only used it about 1-2 minutes on each foot.  I haven&#x27;t even used the callus remover yet.  I am going to attach pictures to show before and after.  I apologize in advance for the gross before picture.  My heels would crack and bleed if I did not get the calluses removed.  I am so glad I decided to give this tool a try.  I will be a customer for life.  Definitely get this and make your feet nice looking and feeling without having to have pedicures done.  I really didn&#x27;t like the fact that the salon applied the callus remover to parts of my foot that I didn&#x27;t think needed it.  Now I can control which parts of my feet to treat.  My heels are 90% better after only 2 uses.  I am not paid to write this.  I am trying to best describe the benefits to help those of you who read these reviews.  I love this foot file!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this foot file. I can across this when I went for a pedicure at one of the Dermalogica Centres. This is what they used on my feet. Not harsh but effective so much so that my diebetic fiance have used this on his feet without any issues.  I get really dry feet because I work in a factory and I am on my feet 95% of my shift but this does the job very effectively and thoroughly.  I cannot recommend this enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a litany of other foot products - standard sandpaper-y files, metal files, even the torturous callus remover blades...along with a number of creams and potions to help soften my feet. I love wearing sandals and walking around barefoot, hence I have some pretty decent calluses on my feet. The first time I used this file, I started with the OPI Soften product on them first before filing. Per the instructions, I then rinsed my feet and went to work with the white (coarse) side - within just a minute or so, I noticed a huge difference. I smoothed my feet with the green side and finished with some lotion.   I&#x27;ve used it a few more times - the file did a lot the first time, but I still had some room for improvement. I&#x27;ve used it 3 times now and am pretty happy with the results - just need to keep them in good shape going forward. So glad I bought this - will be tossing all the other junk in my drawer, since this is the only thing that works.</li>
            <li> This foot file is the BEST. They use them at the salon I go to and I had to get one for me and my BFF for in-between pedi&#x27;s. Very strudy, others I&#x27;ve had just break. Well worth the money!!And WAY cheaper on Amazon than any other place.</li>
            <li> OkOk really like this hate that there is a requirement for words. I have 8 more to go. Don&#x27;t like being required to writ lot</li>
            <li> Wow!!!! Great product</li>
            <li> Wonderful file! This is the same one the salon sells for $30.</li>
            <li> Love It. Best file ever!! It has two sides, one to get all the excess dry skin and the other side to smooth your feet. Awesome</li>
            <li> Positive experience. I like the file.</li>
            <li> Nice to have replacement heads!</li>
            <li> Great price and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> The file performs as expected.  However, it might be easier to handle if there is assistance from another person.  It needs a good amount of strength to do a good scrub.</li>
            <li> I had a foot file that I absolutely loved but was no longer available for purchase.  After reading the reviews on the OPI, I decided to give it a try.  I was totally surprise on how quickly it smoothed my rough callouses.  It took half the time than my old file.  I will definitely recommend this to my family and friends (and I don&#x27;t usually do that with many products).</li>
            <li> The only foot file worth buying. Lasts for 6 months or more when used weekly.</li>
            <li> The best foot file in the world, my feet feel like a newborn baby feet. I can&#x27;t wait until the summer to show off my feet.</li>
            <li> This file is amazing. I bought it a while back, because it was recommended to me by a nail tech. Forgot about it, have been now using it for a while and cannot believe how wonderful it is!</li>
            <li> For this price I expected something a bit special - I got something very ordinary and awkward to hold/use. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again and certainly wouldn&#x27;t recommend - can buy better at the drug store for less than $5.00!!!</li>
            <li> This file works very well.  It smoothes my rough feet probably better than anything else I have used.  However, I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it knowing that you had to put it together - i.e. remove the backing on the filing strips and stick them on the device.  That would benefits pedicurists, for reusing equipment, but to me that means that I have to replace the strips also at some point.  I don&#x27;t like the idea of having to purchase parts for a foot file.  For accomplishing it&#x27;s goal, to smooth my feet - I give it 5 stars, but in design, I give it 1 star.</li>
            <li> Delieverd on time and excellent product, which is recommended to all to try, it works wonders and makes your feet feel light, slight scrub movements and the results are visible</li>
            <li> After using dozens of the $2-6 foot files you find at drug stores and beauty stores, I found these did not last long at all. I kept using them because I didn&#x27;t want to feel like I was wasting my money, but they worked so slowly or not at all that it was a waste of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one works. It is much quicker to use and is durable. I can use it wet or dry and not worry about ruining the file.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be cautious though. This works so well you may get carried away. My first time with it, I took a particularly nasty callus down too far. I was more impressed than bothered by it though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> You get the same results as other foot files but its not as rough on your feet. It gives you excellent results! I&#x27;ve been to a lot of shops to get pedicures and hate how rough the material is that they use on your feet. This one gives you the same results but is much easier on your feet.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing I have found--much better than anything else I have used. It was recommended by the nail tech at the spa.</li>
            <li> great professional grade pedicure tool</li>
            <li> The item arrived before the estimated arrival time, and it works like a charm. I am very satisfied with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Works great! Have used this product for 3 years. Feet are super smooth.</li>
            <li> Did the job but when cleaning the file in water, the base holds on it the water so it leaks everywhere.</li>
            <li> Their are two types of feet in this world, ones that shed skin and others that hold on to dry skin.  My sister and I were born with the dry, cracked heels. The only product that works and prevents skin build up is, the OPI pedicure foot file.We have tried everything. I can not live without this product, Nothing has ever matched this product. I purchase two a year. I have been using this product for at least 15 years. This place on line through amazon is the best price as well. I use the file daily in my bath.Your feet will be smooth.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and highly recommend it;  I use it daily between pedicures. I have also purchased OPI&#x27;s foot file replacement which slides easily onto the handle.</li>
            <li> This is a great tool for getting nice soft feet ,plus you can just buy the refill.</li>
            <li> Same one they use at my spa -- It works great and feels great, has a large surface with two different grits, and is easy to hold. I have the urge to use it every day but I have to resist or I&#x27;ll file away all my skin. It just feels so good! My feet are so smooth and pretty it&#x27;s hard to keep from shoving them in people&#x27;s faces all day.</li>
            <li> I own this foot file and if professionals use it \\&quot;across the board\\&quot;, there must be something right about it.  I use it 2 or 3 times a week.  There is a rougher side and a smoother side.  My manicurist told me it is best to use on dry feet, but I have better luck with it when my feet are slightly damp after a good soak.  It even works on those callouses on the balls of my feet.  If you are starting out having never used a foot file, just keep at it.  Don&#x27;t expect to wipe away months or years of dead skin at once.  But consistently using this product WILL get you the results you want... and never expected you could have on your feet.  I love mine and wouldn&#x27;t be without it!</li>
            <li> Best foot  file I have ever purchased for anyone. This really works and is reasonable in price for the quality.</li>
            <li> This worked well for me and was affordable.  Overall it was worth the money and does a good job for my needs.  Better than any metal file.</li>
