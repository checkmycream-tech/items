            <li>I am very happy with this hairdryer.</li>
            <li>This is, simply, a great dryer.</li>
            <li>a design fault perhaps but generally a great value hair drier for price.</li>
            <li>It would be great if this came in travel size.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really good choice.</li>
            <li>The good:  </li>
            <li>Its VERY light weight which is good for those of us with lots of hair when we take a good 30 min.</li>
            <li>and when I do use it I love it!</li>
            <li>This one had great reviews and fit in my price range.</li>
            <li>This dryer is identical to the Revlon 544 which we already own.</li>
            <li>Never thought I&#x27;d find such an awesome product for a great price.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and works great.</li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE this hairdryer.</li>
            <li>and I like this one much better.  </li>
            <li>I love this blow dryer.</li>
            <li>I am well over 30 and have been through several oodles of dryers, and this one may be the best I&#x27;ve ever found.  </li>
            <li>I love this dryer.</li>
            <li>I really love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>For the most part I like this product,  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great - lightweight, dries quickly, comes with attachments, has 2 speed settings and 2 temperature settings along with cool blast.</li>
            <li>plus it has a good price and pretty color.</li>
            <li>The weight is more than what I was used to but was easy to work with.</li>
            <li>It works great and dries my hair pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Some reviewers stated that it was better for thicker hair because it overdried fine hair.</li>
            <li>The buttons are really easy to accidentally push</li>
            <li>The switches are easily accessable.</li>
            <li>so I was looking for a good one, but for a decent price.</li>
            <li>I have another tourmaline and they must&#x27;ve revamped it, because this one is way quieter..almost tricking you into thinking that it&#x27;s not as strong...but dries your hair smooth and in no time at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, compact, and super easy to use.</li>
            <li>So glad I bought this model - best $20 I spent last year.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has some ion action and, to be honest, I must say it does sort of work.  </li>
            <li>The hype is true.  </li>
            <li>A good, lightweight, pretty hot dryer for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Lightweight, gets hot (very hot!), and dries just like it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>It has a very nice finish and all the bells and whistles of the other version.    </li>
            <li>all good - nice and light, quiet, dries my hair in half the time...</li>
            <li>I rarely use this, but I&#x27;ve had it for about a year now</li>
            <li>Have used it a long time and am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>Good quality for the money and very powerful, be careful not to burn yourself with the heat set to high.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It can do warm, hot, low speed and high speed.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>I have no real complaints but the WARM setting is hot and</li>
            <li>My last dryer cost more than $200</li>
            <li>And, it gets pretty hot.  </li>
            <li>My only gripe is that I would love to have a comb attachment with it.</li>
            <li>I love that it has the different attachments for it</li>
            <li>and it dries my hair so fast!</li>
            <li>I use the warm temperature and low speed settings, and it dried my fine hair quickly without frying it.</li>
            <li>and this works very well.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care about that</li>
            <li>My hair is so much thicker and softer.</li>
            <li>And the ion element really seems to help reduce frizziness, even in 90+ temperatures and humidity.</li>
            <li>It dries my hair fast.</li>
            <li>I needed a new hair dryer and just am not up for spending $$ on one that gets really hot.  </li>
            <li>I wanted another dryer for our kids bathroom was so excited we could have it in BLUE also.    </li>
            <li>Its price is amazing -- and so are its speed of drying, almost unbelievable weightlessness, and absolutely tolerable noise level.</li>
            <li>to do a decent blow-out.  </li>
            <li>the HIGH setting is \\&quot;burn your hair hot\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little loud, but not terrible.</li>
            <li>The so-so: the switches are in a location so that if you&#x27;re not paying attention, you may switch to low heat and wonder why the dryer isn&#x27;t getting hot.  </li>
            <li>, note that if you put this down on your counter top that may have toothpaste and some mouth wash on it, the blue colour will leech out from the paint.  </li>
            <li>This replaces my old hair dryer that caught fire.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have thick curly hair with fine shaft that is treated with Brazilian Blowouts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised at how much faster and less charred my hair is.  </li>
            <li>only complaint is the on off switch by location is easy to switch off accidentally when flipping between heat settings...</li>
            <li>It is a little bulky for travel but not too much.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Absolutely LOVE this hairdryer. I read through reviews on Amazon and ConsumerSearch.com and decided to go with this model instead of spending a boatload on an expensive \\&quot;professional\\&quot; dryer. It&#x27;s great - lightweight, dries quickly, comes with attachments, has 2 speed settings and 2 temperature settings along with cool blast. Some reviewers stated that it was better for thicker hair because it overdried fine hair. I use the warm temperature and low speed settings, and it dried my fine hair quickly without frying it. So glad I bought this model - best $20 I spent last year.</li>
            <li> I have another tourmaline and they must&#x27;ve revamped it, because this one is way quieter..almost tricking you into thinking that it&#x27;s not as strong...but dries your hair smooth and in no time at all.</li>
            <li> My hairdryer broke so I was looking for a good one, but for a decent price. This one had great reviews and fit in my price range. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it. It works great and dries my hair pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> This dryer is identical to the Revlon 544 which we already own. I wanted another dryer for our kids bathroom was so excited we could have it in BLUE also.    It has a very nice finish and all the bells and whistles of the other version.    Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> This dryer is the best dryer I have used that was under $35, it dries the hair evenly without overdrying. It&#x27;s lightweight, compact, and super easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have no real complaints but the WARM setting is hot and the HIGH setting is \\&quot;burn your hair hot\\&quot;.  The buttons are really easy to accidentally push but it does what it is supposed to do....</li>
            <li> This replaces my old hair dryer that caught fire.&lt;br /&gt;It can do warm, hot, low speed and high speed.  You can also use the cold button which keeps the fan blade spinning and pushing air without activating the heating element.&lt;br /&gt;It has some ion action and, to be honest, I must say it does sort of work.  I&#x27;m surprised at how much faster and less charred my hair is.  I always swim in the morning so I need to dry my hair before work, especially in the winter and this works very well.  I have medium length, thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;Also, note that if you put this down on your counter top that may have toothpaste and some mouth wash on it, the blue colour will leech out from the paint.  I don&#x27;t really care about that but that may matter to some of you.</li>
            <li> The hype is true.  This dryer cut my blow drying time in half.  And it is so inexpensive!  It&#x27;s a really good choice. My last dryer cost more than $200 and I like this one much better.  It&#x27;s a little loud, but not terrible.</li>
            <li> I love this blow dryer. It&#x27;s lightweight, so your hand doesn&#x27;t become so tired while drying your hair. My hair is so much thicker and softer. I would definitely recommend this blow dryer to everyone. The switches are easily accessable.</li>
            <li> If you are over the age of 30, you have probably used oodles of hair dyers. I am well over 30 and have been through several oodles of dryers, and this one may be the best I&#x27;ve ever found.  Its price is amazing -- and so are its speed of drying, almost unbelievable weightlessness, and absolutely tolerable noise level. And the ion element really seems to help reduce frizziness, even in 90+ temperatures and humidity. This is, simply, a great dryer.</li>
            <li> I needed a new hair dryer and just am not up for spending $$ on one that gets really hot.  Though I&#x27;m tempted, and its what I need for my coarse, wavy hair, I just can&#x27;t justify spending a lot of money for a blow dryer.  So, after reading lots of reviews I chose the Revlon Blu Tourmaline Ionic 1875 Watt Dryer.  The good:  Its VERY light weight which is good for those of us with lots of hair when we take a good 30 min. to do a decent blow-out.  And, it gets pretty hot.  The so-so: the switches are in a location so that if you&#x27;re not paying attention, you may switch to low heat and wonder why the dryer isn&#x27;t getting hot.  A good, lightweight, pretty hot dryer for a reasonable price.  I like it.</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer!! I needed one that was ionic and could not be happier with the price and how well it works. It is a little bulky for travel but not too much. The weight is more than what I was used to but was easy to work with.</li>
            <li> I rarely use this, but I&#x27;ve had it for about a year now and when I do use it I love it! Lightweight, gets hot (very hot!), and dries just like it&#x27;s supposed to. plus it has a good price and pretty color. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one!</li>
            <li> I love this dryer. The heat settings are perfect. My only gripe is that I would love to have a comb attachment with it.</li>
            <li> Have used it a long time and am very pleased.  If if quits, as electrical appliances, do, I will reorder it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter to take with her to college. I would not recommend this product. It quit working after less than a year.</li>
            <li> all good - nice and light, quiet, dries my hair in half the time...only complaint is the on off switch by location is easy to switch off accidentally when flipping between heat settings...a design fault perhaps but generally a great value hair drier for price.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this hairdryer. I love that it has the different attachments for it so it isn&#x27;t as harsh on my hair and it dries my hair so fast! Would definately recommend this.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and works great. Good quality for the money and very powerful, be careful not to burn yourself with the heat set to high.</li>
            <li> I really love this hair dryer. It dries my hair fast. I&#x27;m usually done in 10 min - and my hair is not even towel dried! I have thick curly hair with fine shaft that is treated with Brazilian Blowouts. Never thought I&#x27;d find such an awesome product for a great price. It would be great if this came in travel size.</li>
            <li> For the most part I like this product,  BUT, it states on the box &amp;#34;quiet&amp;#34; AND IT IS NOT.  i have to use earplugs when I use it.  That is pretty bad when the product inside the box does not do what it says on the outside of the box.</li>
