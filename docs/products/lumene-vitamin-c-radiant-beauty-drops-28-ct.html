            <li>and I am SO impressed with the results.  </li>
            <li>This might be the best face product I have purchases in a while.  </li>

            <li>I will continue to be a loyal customer! :)</li>
            <li>Make my skin soft and bright and healthy ..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed my foundation goes on more smoothly and the individual capsules are great for those who travel.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I was given it for free and used it up quickly.</li>
            <li>The drops make my skin feel incredibly smooth after applying .  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got this light airy citrusy scent that I adore.</li>
            <li>The stuff in these capsules makes my skin feel really smooth</li>
            <li>I ended up using these up on my hair before blowdrying it, which looked pretty ok.</li>
            <li>Results are quick.  </li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and can&#x27;t wait to start seeing results again.</li>
            <li>The box arrived open....and arrived quickly</li>
            <li>I imagine if I remain consistent with the regimen than I will be able to see a more significant overall change in my skin.</li>
            <li>First of all I have really sensitive skin and I somewhat like the product because when I put it on my skin has a nice matte finish, however; this product makes my skin itch</li>
            <li>I recommend these capsules if you&#x27;re looking to even out your skin tone and feel soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>I do love how soft my skin feels after these are applied to my face.</li>
            <li>and my skin has a nice healthy glow and is a great base before moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I like it, its work fine for me so far.</li>
            <li>This is definetly a product I would recommend to others - so much so that I purchased one for my mom and one for my friend that lives in Portland!</li>
            <li>I use one a night for a month, and they make my skin SO smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I use this on my face my boyfriend tells me how pretty I am.  </li>
            <li>Work very well!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now and love the way it makes my skin feel but will be using real Vitamin C going forward as I&#x27;m interested in treating fine lines/wrinkles, etc....rather than the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>I really like the entire Lumene line, but these capsules are among my favorite items.</li>
            <li>Paid too much on these at Ulta first.  </li>
            <li>Each little capsule is enough to cover the entire face; it smoothes the pores so make up goes on flawlessly!</li>
            <li>Feels silky....not much product in each capsule.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t absorb very well...</li>
            <li>They really worked wonders on my skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I love it so much I have shared with a few coworkers so they can try it as well</li>
            <li>Love this radiance in a little tube.</li>
            <li>Just started using it, I really like it so far.</li>
            <li>it is now January 2012, so you all would know that I am new to this line.</li>
            <li>, I guess my skin adjusted to the new products, so bear that</li>
            <li>I decided to give this product a try after reading about it in New Beauty magazine.</li>
            <li>Now I usually do not like reading these reviews since I think the majority of them are written by the company that sells these products</li>
            <li>I have purchased this product three times since the original purchase and use it as part of my nightly skin care regiment, but this product I use every other night.</li>
            <li>They are on the expensive side for me, so I don&#x27;t use them year round, but I&#x27;m sure that if I did my skin would love it!  </li>
            <li>As a red head, fair skinned individual I was sure i would get a bad report from the dermatologist butt</li>
            <li>So far I have seen a satisfactory change in my skin tone.</li>
            <li>Well, I guess I am going to be a frequent user now.  </li>
            <li>This is so soft it feels like silk going on.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft after I apply it.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin so soft and luminous.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>so I am ok with the slow fading process.</li>
            <li>I travel a lot and the Vitamin C capsules are easy to transport and help keep my skin looking vibrant, instead of dull from air travel or long road trips.  </li>
            <li>; I give full credit to these little drops.!</li>
            <li>After coming off this rough winter in PA I am ready to have a radiant complexion from here on.</li>
            <li>The Body Shop offers the same product in a pump style.</li>

            <li> After coming off this rough winter in PA I am ready to have a radiant complexion from here on.</li>
            <li> The Body Shop offers the same product in a pump style.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what it&#x27;s really doing except making me itch.  </li>
            <li> Other than that I am not really sure if I am getting any other benefits because I use so many other creams on my face before bedtime.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so soft and I noticed less break outs when using it.</li>
            <li> I am 55 yrs old and grew up without the benefit odd sunscreen.</li>
            <li> The capsules are small, but there is enough to completely use and cover the face and neck area entirely.  </li>
            <li> I can not discern a long  term result when using the drops.</li>
            <li> I use one of these capsules every other night and my skin is dramatically different.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin anyway but will not get these again.</li>
            <li> Also let me interject here that the 1st few days I started using these products I noticed that I developed a slight acne outbreak.</li>
            <li> I use this twice a day and have seen a pretty dramatic improvement in my skin texture.</li>
            <li> I thought it&#x27;s oil in the little capsules, similar to Elemis skin bliss recovery capsules</li>
            <li> Other than that I will continue to use these products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because my skin doesn&#x27;t like a lot of stuff except for the other products I reviewed.  </li>
            <li> , I use this about every other night or maybe 2-3 times a week.  </li>
            <li> Works well with other moisturizers too.</li>
            <li> I dab a little on each section of my face and also my neck.</li>
            <li> ONE little capsule is all you need.  </li>
            <li> I just started using Lumene products a few months ago</li>
            <li> However they did eventually disappear after the few weeks</li>
            <li> in mind for a few of you.</li>
            <li> The product was opened and/or used; some capsules were missing - returned.</li>
            <li> It absorbs immediately and isn&#x27;t heavy feeling at all.  </li>
            <li> The little capsules are wasteful and pointless.</li>
            <li> My skin looks healthier in terms of the glowing and the marks that I have are diminishing (slowly) but I can&#x27;t expect a miracle in just a few weeks</li>
            <li> No really sure what else to say about this.</li>
            <li> I use a product that I am obsessed with for retinol that does dry my skin out</li>
            <li> In the past I have used very expensive products, for my face.  </li>
            <li> It just felt artificial and unhealthy.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed to find out that this product is not truly Vitamin C, but rather Ascorbic Acid.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Each little capsule is enough to cover the entire face; it smoothes the pores so make up goes on flawlessly!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d purchased this as gift for my sister in law who asked for it specifically so I only have that to go by.</li>
            <li> I just started using Lumene products a few months ago and I am SO impressed with the results.  These capsules give my skin an unbelieveable glow.  I have always been prone to breakouts and none of the Lumene products are a problem in this area.  I will continue to be a loyal customer! :)</li>
            <li> I started using this product in December 2011 it is now January 2012, so you all would know that I am new to this line. I use these capsules (night and day) along with the Lumene Vitamin C Bright Skin Radiance Nectar (night and Day) and Lumene Vitamin C+ Day Cream with SPF (night and day). So far I have seen a satisfactory change in my skin tone. My skin looks healthier in terms of the glowing and the marks that I have are diminishing (slowly) but I can&#x27;t expect a miracle in just a few weeks so I am ok with the slow fading process. I imagine if I remain consistent with the regimen than I will be able to see a more significant overall change in my skin. Now I usually do not like reading these reviews since I think the majority of them are written by the company that sells these products but I just had to write of my experience with this product line. Also let me interject here that the 1st few days I started using these products I noticed that I developed a slight acne outbreak. However they did eventually disappear after the few weeks, I guess my skin adjusted to the new products, so bear that in mind for a few of you. Other than that I will continue to use these products.</li>
            <li> Great Sun protection. You&#x27;ll notice a difference in a week or so. Goes on under my moisturizer and helps even out my skin and brightens up my face.</li>
            <li> Feels silky....not much product in each capsule.  Feel as though I could use two each time I apply.  I have dry skin anyway but will not get these again.</li>
            <li> Packaging, delivery Price were good.  The drops make my skin feel incredibly smooth after applying .  I can not discern a long  term result when using the drops.</li>
            <li> Great product, lightens wrinkles</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t absorb very well... My skin started too look orange after a week...</li>
            <li> I use one of these capsules every other night and my skin is dramatically different.  I travel a lot and the Vitamin C capsules are easy to transport and help keep my skin looking vibrant, instead of dull from air travel or long road trips.

I have purchased this product three times since the original purchase and use it as part of my nightly skin care regiment, but this product I use every other night.</li>
            <li> Make my skin soft and bright and healthy .. i like it .. also not oily .. u can but it any time .. i think i will bay it again</li>
            <li> I love these Vitamin C tablets.  They really worked wonders on my skin.</li>
            <li> Just started using it, I really like it so far. I thought it&#x27;s oil in the little capsules, similar to Elemis skin bliss recovery capsules but it is a cream. I like it, its work fine for me so far. I&#x27;ve been putting it on in the evening after cleansing and toning, followed by my night cream.</li>
            <li> It has only been 3 applications of use and I can tell you I am a fan of this product.  I read about it on Woman&#x27;s World magazine and decided to order it.  Well, I guess I am going to be a frequent user now.  After coming off this rough winter in PA I am ready to have a radiant complexion from here on.</li>
            <li> Very unique capsules.  one drop covers your entire face and neck area. Leaves skin silky smooth and nice fragrance from the cloudberries.</li>
            <li> This might be the best face product I have purchases in a while.  I use a product that I am obsessed with for retinol that does dry my skin out so I was looking for a perfect Vitamin C capsule to hydrate my skin.  This is so soft it feels like silk going on.  I love it so much I have shared with a few coworkers so they can try it as well and they felt the same.  It also smells great! This is definetly a product I would recommend to others - so much so that I purchased one for my mom and one for my friend that lives in Portland!</li>
            <li> The product was opened and/or used; some capsules were missing - returned. No really sure what else to say about this.</li>
            <li> Try this and you&#x27;ll be a believer. It makes the skin instantly smoother. I decided to give this product a try after reading about it in New Beauty magazine. glad I did. It&#x27;s a splurge but I love the way my skin feels after I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li> I do not like these. They don&#x27;t feel like they absorb into the skin, they just feel like I&#x27;m putting a layer of silicone on my face. It just felt artificial and unhealthy. The little capsules are wasteful and pointless. I ended up using these up on my hair before blowdrying it, which looked pretty ok. I would not recommend this product to anyone and I&#x27;m glad I was given it for free and used it up quickly.</li>
            <li> I really like the entire Lumene line, but these capsules are among my favorite items. I use one a night for a month, and they make my skin SO smooth and soft. They are on the expensive side for me, so I don&#x27;t use them year round, but I&#x27;m sure that if I did my skin would love it!  I recommend these capsules if you&#x27;re looking to even out your skin tone and feel soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft after I apply it. I will order it again</li>
            <li> I use this twice a day and have seen a pretty dramatic improvement in my skin texture. It literally feels like silk when you put it on. I dab a little on each section of my face and also my neck. I&#x27;m 38 and my skin has a nice healthy glow and is a great base before moisturizer. I&#x27;ve noticed my foundation goes on more smoothly and the individual capsules are great for those who travel. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> First of all I have really sensitive skin and I somewhat like the product because when I put it on my skin has a nice matte finish, however; this product makes my skin itch and once I scratch it stings.  I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because my skin doesn&#x27;t like a lot of stuff except for the other products I reviewed.  I&#x27;m not sure what it&#x27;s really doing except making me itch.  Now since I&#x27;m a product junky I did want to atleast try it, everyone&#x27;s skin is different and since I like the Lumene Nectar I could atleast give this a try.  I changed how often I put this on at night, I use this about every other night or maybe 2-3 times a week.  I&#x27;m almost out so I&#x27;ll be trying something else, but I&#x27;ll keep with the Lumene Nectar that stuff is great.  So bascially I gave it 3 stars because my face has a mind of it&#x27;s own and starts to get an attitude so it might just be me.</li>
            <li> Love this radiance in a little tube.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed to find out that this product is not truly Vitamin C, but rather Ascorbic Acid. I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now and love the way it makes my skin feel but will be using real Vitamin C going forward as I&#x27;m interested in treating fine lines/wrinkles, etc....rather than the way it makes my skin feel. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my face so smooth! I use it sometimes in place of powder and it gives my face a matte and smoothed over look.  It lasts longer than powder too.  Everytime I use this on my face my boyfriend tells me how pretty I am.  Other than that I am not really sure if I am getting any other benefits because I use so many other creams on my face before bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;Oh ya did I forget to mention this stuff smells awesome?!  It&#x27;s got this light airy citrusy scent that I adore.</li>
            <li> Paid too much on these at Ulta first.  Work very well!  I noticed the brightening, smoothing effect after ~1w.  This goes on similar to a &amp;#34;blur&amp;#34; primer.  Immediately makes your face tone more even, non shiny, etc. and lays well under makeup.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Loce these beads. They make my skin feel so good.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see the point of the drops. The Body Shop offers the same product in a pump style. Much more convenient. I do love how soft my skin feels after these are applied to my face.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so soft and luminous.  Results are quick.  Have received many complements.  Am 72 years of age...Still gorgeous.</li>
            <li> Have used this product before. Makes my skin so soft and I noticed less break outs when using it. It arrived quickly and can&#x27;t wait to start seeing results again.</li>
            <li> The box arrived open....and arrived quickly but I did not expect that arivasse with open box!!!!</li>
            <li> The stuff in these capsules makes my skin feel really smooth and I love the way it smells! Works well with other moisturizers too.</li>
            <li> In the past I have used very expensive products, for my face.  But since trying Lumene, I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else! I love it!</li>
            <li> These are by far the best skin product I use. I am 55 yrs old and grew up without the benefit odd sunscreen. As a red head, fair skinned individual I was sure i would get a bad report from the dermatologist butt she said&amp;#34;I don&#x27;t  know what you are doing but keep it up. Your skin is damage free and looks great. &amp;#34; I give full credit to these little drops.!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> Immediate and lasting difference using this product.  I use it before bedtime - ONE little capsule is all you need.  My face looks smoother and feels so much better than many creams I have tried.  Some creams cause my skin to burn so I was happy to discover this product that  doesn&#x27;t and nor does it have a smell.  It absorbs immediately and isn&#x27;t heavy feeling at all.  Love it and plan to continue using it.</li>
