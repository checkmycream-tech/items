    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is the best polish I have.</li>
            <li>They have an awesome holographic effect and I get compliments all the time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll cut to the chase: the holographic effect is perfect.</li>
            <li>The rainbow effect still works wonderfully even without a surface buff of the nail.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with it otherwise.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When used with Seche Vite top coat (which is the best top coat on this earth), holographic look is maintained but chipping STILL happened within 24 hours!</li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love!!!</li>
            <li>Takes like 4 coats to get good coverage and it chips very easily.  </li>
            <li>dudes, this one is so much better!  </li>
            <li>Enjoy these polishes!!  </li>
            <li>I love these polishes!</li>
            <li>I expect more for $15 polish!</li>
            <li>This polish is very easy to control.</li>
            <li>Looks amazing in the sun but tends to scatch off easily</li>
            <li>So, besides that, I am thrilled with this polish, and it came VERY quickly.</li>
            <li>my favorite polish of all time</li>
            <li>As in, I like it better than Gosh Holographic.  </li>
            <li>And I think these polishes wear better without base/top coats.  </li>
            <li>So, that&#x27;s another way to wear them and get the most out of it.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to get the layla nail buffing file to prep nail.  </li>
            <li>I love this polish.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to apply and the colors are very pretty in the sun or under bright lighting.</li>
            <li>but I just put a top coat on every two days and its fine.</li>
            <li>It looks very cool, but it took 3 coats to cover and within a couple days it had rubbed off.</li>
            <li>but it dries quickly, is easy to work with and the results are fantastic :)</li>
            <li>polish also is really easy to paint with.</li>
            <li>Anyway, then I applied 2 coats of layla flash black, and it works perfectly!  </li>
            <li>Like many of the reviews here, I have found this polish to be very, very pretty, but that it chips almost immediately.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The rainbow effect is really very pretty and magical.</li>
            <li>It takes a few layers to make the effect pop, I find 4 layers to be just perfect.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>Cool for a special occasion but not practical for multi-day wear.</li>
            <li>sweet lord is this shimmer something else.</li>
            <li>With that, I can get the polish to last through a day or two of light activity (mostly just typing, but I can wash dishes and go about most of my day).</li>
            <li>Personally, I always liked the Kaleidoscope collection more than OMG because the holo effect is more pronounced being that they have larger particles to catch the light.  </li>
            <li>I like this polish because it dries quickly and is somewhat holographic.</li>
            <li>Polish appears different colors depending on the lighting and angle of viewing, which makes it very interesting.</li>
            <li>Fun splurge buy.</li>
            <li>&#x27;n Wild does not chip for days with their top</li>
            <li>but so worth it.</li>
            <li>This is like the Macys brand of polish and its worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Still fun though.</li>
            <li>I paid close to $16 for this bottle of polish, totally worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>RIGHT</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still good and dark considering the wealth of color in the sheen.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Goes on very light, and after a few coats it&#x27;s okay...</li>
            <li>love it so much that it is now my new #1 favorite polish, and I immediately went for a back up bottle.  </li>
            <li>I was really excited to get this polish, it was way more than I would normally spend, but I wanted something different.</li>
            <li>I love holo polish, but I only had one before ordering the Layla holo effect polish.</li>
            <li>Great hologram effect and long lasting.  </li>
            <li>Not nearly the SUPER COOL finish I was expecting and willing to pay $15-20 for.  </li>
            <li>Price is very high though.  </li>
            <li>Looks best in sunlight, but still visible in artificial lighting</li>
            <li>in, this polish is holo even in very low light.  </li>
            <li>Rainbows everywhere, like I said, even in low light situations.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really want to be going through it too fast reapplying</li>
            <li>It also dries really quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After using it a few times, I&#x27;m still not convinced it&#x27;s worth the premium price most stores charge for it.</li>
            <li>Love this nail polish, but a few things to note if you really want to get the full holographic effect:  use multiple layers (I do at least 3, but can get away with using just 2 if I have a dark grey color underneath already), and use a really shiny top coat (I love Seche Vite top coat with this one)!!</li>
            <li>But as others have said, it&#x27;s a little fragile without a top coat (easy to chip), and using a top coat dulls the holo effect.</li>
            <li>Maybe the other colors are more vibrant.</li>
            <li>Apparently the goal is to get your bare (no base coats or treatments) nails as smooth and shiny as possible.  </li>
            <li>Anyways, I put it on with a good base and top coat, but within a matter of hours it chipped!</li>
            <li>I wanted to edit this review as I have some new info/tips!</li>
            <li>I used the blue side first to buff out ridges (lightly) and then the white side to get my nails squeaky shiny!  </li>
            <li>OK, now, I&#x27;ve come across a few holographic polishes in my day.</li>
            <li>Seriously looks like you have top coat on!  </li>
            <li>I expected it to be a bit darker, but it goes on more like a grey color.  </li>
            <li>trick I&#x27;ve found to get it to last is to first put on a nice base coat, then two or thee coats of this polish, put on a top coat, and then another coat.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a fun specialty item, but I won&#x27;t be going out and stocking up on the other colors any time soon.</li>
            <li>I was holding this polish to a high standard given the price of it and</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It dried lightning quick</li>
            <li>Usually, with darker colors, you need to be more careful not to get any paint on the nail or the cuticles.</li>
            <li>My nails are consistently distracting me from everyday tasks, and that should be the goal of any holographic polish.</li>
            <li>, I use Nfu Oh aqua base with all my holos, then I only need 2 coats and they apply beautifully for me.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Not sure on the other colors from this line, but the black is PHENOMENAL.  </li>
            <li> I was slightly disappointed that you can only see the hologram effect if you are fairly close to the nails you have painted.</li>
            <li> The black is not terribly black</li>
            <li> looks like grey with holographic flecks in it.  </li>
            <li> I used a base coat but noticed that the polish went on kind of patchy and left bald streaks.</li>
            <li> When I tried this on my toenails, I was let down because from that far away, it just looks like a dark gray/slightly matte nail polish.</li>
            <li> I was hoping everyone else was crazy when they said it chipped easily.</li>
            <li> (And if you know Seche Vite, you know even Wet</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are a couple things I saw in other reviews that I want to address based on my experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I cant wait to buy the other colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was odd, and I had to be really careful applying the polish.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe if you use a base coat you&#x27;ll have more luck with the chipping, but if you ask me, ain&#x27;t nobody got time for that.</li>
            <li> They havent released anything Im not happy with so far.  </li>
            <li> I then did some research and discovered that for holo polishes, it is highly recommended to use a special base coat for holos!</li>
            <li> Let me say that up until I tried this polish (layla flash black)</li>
            <li> Chips easily, which was very disappointing for the price.</li>
            <li> I like to keep a look on for a few days in a row, and given the price of this little bottle</li>
            <li> A few months after purchase the color had changed and there was no hologram effect at all.</li>
            <li> and so it takes a few layers to get it opaque</li>
            <li> By the next day it was rubbed off in spots and chipped like crazy in others.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The reviews on this page forced my to buy this product.</li>
            <li> the formula is a bit thin</li>
            <li> Terrible, waste of money.</li>
            <li> It is almost impossible to find in stores in my area.</li>
            <li> So I tried the Revlon Crazy Shine Nail Buffer and it works like a charm!  </li>
            <li> No nail prepping routine or base coat required to see the holographic color&lt;</li>
            <li> Just like I had the aqua base on.</li>
            <li> I got the Nfu Aqua Base base coat (can&#x27;t remember the vendor), and that is supposed to solve all my problems.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!</li>
            <li> You wont be disappointed!</li>

            <li> Polish appears different colors depending on the lighting and angle of viewing, which makes it very interesting. Price is very high though.  Fun splurge buy.</li>
            <li> Argh! I was hoping everyone else was crazy when they said it chipped easily. I&#x27;m happy with it otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a couple things I saw in other reviews that I want to address based on my experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- No nail prepping routine or base coat required to see the holographic color&lt;br /&gt;- Looks best in sunlight, but still visible in artificial lighting&lt;br /&gt;- When used with Seche Vite top coat (which is the best top coat on this earth), holographic look is maintained but chipping STILL happened within 24 hours! (And if you know Seche Vite, you know even Wet &#x27;n Wild does not chip for days with their top coat)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe if you use a base coat you&#x27;ll have more luck with the chipping, but if you ask me, ain&#x27;t nobody got time for that.</li>
            <li> OK, now, I&#x27;ve come across a few holographic polishes in my day. I&#x27;ve owned a lot of them, in fact.  Let me say that up until I tried this polish (layla flash black) my favorite polish of all time (holo or otherwise) was China Glaze Let&#x27;s Do It In 3D.  Similar idea, charcoal holographic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But dudes, this one is so much better!  Personally, I always liked the Kaleidoscope collection more than OMG because the holo effect is more pronounced being that they have larger particles to catch the light.  But somehow layla has come up with a formula with smaller particles that still catch a TON of light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As in, this polish is holo even in very low light.  As in, I like it better than Gosh Holographic.  And ladies, that&#x27;s saying something!?!  Right!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it so much that it is now my new #1 favorite polish, and I immediately went for a back up bottle.  Not sure on the other colors from this line, but the black is PHENOMENAL.  Rainbows everywhere, like I said, even in low light situations.  You&#x27;ll be staring at your nails all day (and night)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw, I use Nfu Oh aqua base with all my holos, then I only need 2 coats and they apply beautifully for me.  Just a thought.  Pricey but so worth it. Hope this helps! &#x3D;0)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** I wanted to edit this review as I have some new info/tips! May 10, 2012**&lt;br /&gt;I saw Scrangie&#x27;s review of the layla hologram polishes and she did use the nail buffer they recommend.  She also says that you can use any nail buffer to do the same thing. Apparently the goal is to get your bare (no base coats or treatments) nails as smooth and shiny as possible.  So I tried the Revlon Crazy Shine Nail Buffer and it works like a charm!  I used the blue side first to buff out ridges (lightly) and then the white side to get my nails squeaky shiny!  This thing rocks for that. Seriously looks like you have top coat on!  Anyway, then I applied 2 coats of layla flash black, and it works perfectly!  Just like I had the aqua base on. And I think these polishes wear better without base/top coats.  So, that&#x27;s another way to wear them and get the most out of it.  Just thought I&#x27;d share!  Enjoy these polishes!!  &#x3D;0)</li>
            <li> I love holo polish, but I only had one before ordering the Layla holo effect polish. I used a base coat but noticed that the polish went on kind of patchy and left bald streaks. It was odd, and I had to be really careful applying the polish. I then did some research and discovered that for holo polishes, it is highly recommended to use a special base coat for holos! I got the Nfu Aqua Base base coat (can&#x27;t remember the vendor), and that is supposed to solve all my problems. So, besides that, I am thrilled with this polish, and it came VERY quickly. I would definitely order from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love!!! This is the best polish I have. Great hologram effect and long lasting.  Be sure to get the layla nail buffing file to prep nail.  Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> It looks very cool, but it took 3 coats to cover and within a couple days it had rubbed off. I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again</li>
            <li> Takes like 4 coats to get good coverage and it chips very easily.  Cool for a special occasion but not practical for multi-day wear.</li>
            <li> I love this polish.  They havent released anything Im not happy with so far.  This is like the Macys brand of polish and its worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I love these polishes! They have an awesome holographic effect and I get compliments all the time. Have  these in 4 colors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll cut to the chase: the holographic effect is perfect. I was holding this polish to a high standard given the price of it and within two coats I knew it had met that. The black is not terribly black (I wanted my nails to look like the carapace of a beetle) but it&#x27;s still good and dark considering the wealth of color in the sheen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It dried lightning quick but there was one downside: it does not last. By the next day it was rubbed off in spots and chipped like crazy in others. I put on a third coat but that wore off hours later. I like to keep a look on for a few days in a row, and given the price of this little bottle I don&#x27;t really want to be going through it too fast reapplying touch-up coats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally that would be enough for me to lower a rating but sweet lord is this shimmer something else. My nails are consistently distracting me from everyday tasks, and that should be the goal of any holographic polish.</li>
            <li> Goes on very light, and after a few coats it&#x27;s okay... looks like grey with holographic flecks in it.  Not nearly the SUPER COOL finish I was expecting and willing to pay $15-20 for.  Phooey.</li>
            <li> I like this polish because it dries quickly and is somewhat holographic. I was slightly disappointed that you can only see the hologram effect if you are fairly close to the nails you have painted. When I tried this on my toenails, I was let down because from that far away, it just looks like a dark gray/slightly matte nail polish. Still fun though. Maybe the other colors are more vibrant.</li>
            <li> Like many of the reviews here, I have found this polish to be very, very pretty, but that it chips almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick I&#x27;ve found to get it to last is to first put on a nice base coat, then two or thee coats of this polish, put on a top coat, and then another coat.  With that, I can get the polish to last through a day or two of light activity (mostly just typing, but I can wash dishes and go about most of my day).</li>
            <li> Terrible, waste of money. A few months after purchase the color had changed and there was no hologram effect at all. It chipped within hours.</li>
            <li> Looks amazing in the sun but tends to scatch off easily but I just put a top coat on every two days and its fine.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this polish, it was way more than I would normally spend, but I wanted something different. Anyways, I put it on with a good base and top coat, but within a matter of hours it chipped! I expect more for $15 polish!</li>
            <li> I expected it to be a bit darker, but it goes on more like a grey color.  It&#x27;s definitely holographic, though.  Chips easily, which was very disappointing for the price.</li>
            <li> Love this nail polish, but a few things to note if you really want to get the full holographic effect:  use multiple layers (I do at least 3, but can get away with using just 2 if I have a dark grey color underneath already), and use a really shiny top coat (I love Seche Vite top coat with this one)!!</li>
            <li> the formula is a bit thin and so it takes a few layers to get it opaque but it dries quickly, is easy to work with and the results are fantastic :)</li>
            <li> I just got my Layla polish in the mail today. I had to paint it on my nails RIGHT AWAY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reviews on this page forced my to buy this product. Let me tell you, YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED! The rainbow effect is really very pretty and magical. I paid close to $16 for this bottle of polish, totally worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviews and people I&#x27;ve talked to say that you should file and buff your nails so the surface is shiny. It defiantly DOES help, but please know that it&#x27;s not necessary! The rainbow effect still works wonderfully even without a surface buff of the nail. It takes a few layers to make the effect pop, I find 4 layers to be just perfect. I cant wait to buy the other colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This polish also is really easy to paint with. Usually, with darker colors, you need to be more careful not to get any paint on the nail or the cuticles. This polish is very easy to control. It also dries really quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re debating because of the price, just take the plunge. You wont be disappointed! Buy this polish!</li>
            <li> This was just what I was looking for! It is almost impossible to find in stores in my area. Must have color!</li>
            <li> Everyone always raves about these polishes, so I decided to spring for a bottle and see what the fuss was about. It was easy to apply and the colors are very pretty in the sun or under bright lighting. But as others have said, it&#x27;s a little fragile without a top coat (easy to chip), and using a top coat dulls the holo effect. After using it a few times, I&#x27;m still not convinced it&#x27;s worth the premium price most stores charge for it. I think it&#x27;s a fun specialty item, but I won&#x27;t be going out and stocking up on the other colors any time soon.</li>
