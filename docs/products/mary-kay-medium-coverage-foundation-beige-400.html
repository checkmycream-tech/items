I love it!</li>
            <li> I got a gift basket for a bunch of Mary Kay cosmetics.  I was thrilled with their quality.  I tried this out and was equally happy.  This foundation is lightweight and blends well.  Plus it lasts unlike a lot of the other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>

            <li> I have been using this foundation for about 8 years.
