            <li>Great Tease Brush for a good price.</li>
            <li>This worked awesome to tease and add volume to my fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have struggled for awhile to make a good backcomb bump.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it for teasing,but it&#x27;s still good.</li>
            <li>Cheap, works great!</li>
            <li>Good deal.</li>
            <li>So depending on the amount of volume you want in our hair, this can be a good way to go.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with this brush.</li>
            <li>I really love the results!</li>
            <li>I love this brush!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>The price was amazing.</li>
            <li>Nice brush.</li>
            <li>WAY better than a teasing comb if you need some good lift.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have a nice finish:  </li>
            <li>they seem kind of raggedly cut off.  </li>
            <li>This teasing brush is one of the best that I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and this brush gives it the volume it needs.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, but a lot of it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy to have finally found them and at a great price too.</li>
            <li>I love this brush1</li>
            <li>it just  grazes the top of the hair and makes it frizzy.</li>
            <li>pleased with the quality.&lt;br /&gt;ive</li>
            <li>but I think there are probably better brushes out there...or maybe the problem is my technique.  </li>
            <li>Brush is just ok... sure not as sturdy as one I had before.</li>
            <li>I love this tease brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even sure I want to use it on my hair.</li>
            <li>So take it easy and you get a pretty great bump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Super Satisfied!</li>
            <li>This makes a pretty good pet brush.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also good to use will straightening your hair to make sure all your strands get straight.</li>
            <li>and I like them better than my original.</li>
            <li>The backcombing is really easy with the brush</li>
            <li>Smooths out my hair nicely and overall its a good brush to have.</li>
            <li>The problem is that my hair is fine and doesn&#x27;t take as well to styling as some hairtypes.  </li>
            <li>This may be fine for someone else</li>
            <li>I received a brush with silver metal bristles, but it still works fine.</li>
            <li>My hair was huge.  </li>
            <li>Pet brushes are just too huge for some reason and there is nothing that gets in between the front legs where all the darn stickers lodge like a teaser brush.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so cheap, why not get it?</li>
            <li>So far so good and the price is unbeatable.  </li>
            <li>It takes forever for me to tease my very fine hair with a regular comb and it probably isn&#x27;t very healthy for it, so I bought this brush.</li>
            <li>I was recently looking over some hair books and each of the professional hairstylist suggested a teasing brush for those perfect backcombing styles.  </li>
            <li>End is great to help scoot loose hairs around</li>
            <li>It is a cute brush and it works really well especially for the price, it was a good buy .</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly</li>
            <li>I thought they sure are cheap enough, what the heck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only kind of brush that works on my springy, curly gray hair.  </li>
            <li>If you tease your hair like I do this is the exact tool that you want it&#x27;s got multi bristles in it</li>
            <li>brush works pretty well, the ends all have that rattail so that you can section off hair.  </li>
            <li>The first time I did it</li>
            <li>I was trying to find one exactly like the ones I used to use.....</li>
            <li>This works for exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>If you want a brush that you can make your hair thick this is great.</li>
            <li>She was so pleased with it and uses it daily.</li>
            <li>To say the least, this has helped a great deal.</li>
            <li>The boar bristle mixed with nylon types seem better for that.</li>
            <li>but I actually think this works better.  </li>
            <li>They came in a pack of three and were exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I wear my hair up everyday and this really helps to smooth the hair down for a perfect look.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to any lady that needs a good stiff, slim hair brush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to create large bumps or simply volume.</li>
            <li>To smooth out your style later I would suggest using a boar bristle brush or if you have thicker hair a combination boar bristle and nylon brush will smooth the hair and give you a professional looking finish.</li>
            <li>Especially if you want to rock a super smooth high pony.</li>
            <li>and it certainly creates a lot of height.  </li>
            <li>I am planning to buy a few more just to have backups!</li>
            <li>many reviewers said this worked for their fine hair, I&#x27;m not comfortable using a wig brush on my natural hair</li>
            <li>These little gems are almost as good as my old one.  </li>
            <li>So I learned that for the teasing brush you don&#x27;t need to put in nearly as much effort as you do with a comb.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work very well</li>
            <li>I used it today to add a fullness to my hair, I tease my normally straight hair while blow drying.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Maya</li>
            <li>Thanks again, Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>It is nice stiff nylon bristles.  </li>
            <li>It does a decent job with teasing</li>
            <li>It splays out just a little more and the ends of the plastic bristles have a nicer finish.  </li>
            <li>I love this brush, I keep it in my purse for everyday use.</li>
            <li>I still haven&#x27;t been able to find it, but I have some hope it&#x27;ll pop up once I&#x27;m cleaning everything out to move in a few months.</li>
            <li>It will tear a normal head of hair apart.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a nice thick teaser.</li>
            <li>Also the bristles seem like they were plastic and cheap, which is not worth the price.</li>
            <li>The bristles are like plastic...very hard and not brushing fine hair around the temples!</li>
            <li>I like it and use it frequently.</li>
            <li>I actually used a sapphire nail file on the ends in attempt to smooth them a little.  </li>
            <li>The handle is plastic, though, I won&#x27;t be surprised if it breaks in the near future.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This may work great for you, but I&#x27;m disgruntled by the fact that this wasn&#x27;t clearly described and unfortunately, at this price point, it&#x27;s not worth it to try to return it.</li>
            <li>The bristles are cheap plastic, very stiff.  </li>
            <li>A regular small cheap thin bristled comb works much better.</li>
            <li>Firstly, the comb came in a tacky purple color even though the picture was green.</li>

            <li> /&gt;This may work great for you, but I&#x27;m disgruntled by the fact that this wasn&#x27;t clearly described and unfortunately, at this price point, it&#x27;s not worth it to try to return it.</li>
            <li> The bristles are cheap plastic, very stiff.  </li>
            <li> A regular small cheap thin bristled comb works much better.</li>
            <li> Firstly, the comb came in a tacky purple color even though the picture was green.</li>
            <li> So once I think I have a good bump going, I brush it back, style and shortly after become disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Just so folks are aware, this a very stiff bristle brush that is labeled a \\&quot;wig brush\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I can tell it won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I use it daily and have been using this for a long time.</li>
            <li> Also because the brush is long and narrow it can also been turned the other way and be used for brushing the whole cat.  </li>
            <li> I have an old nylon teaser brush from the 60&#x27;s or the 70&#x27;s which is a little nicer than this brush.  </li>
            <li> Nothing fancy, but works for my long hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought this brush for grooming a long haired cat.  </li>
            <li> Have been looking for these for a long time.</li>
            <li> Since the entire thing is plastic, I couldn&#x27;t justify why I paid $3 (another star down).</li>
            <li> Not really a teaser comb.</li>
            <li> With that said, the brush isn&#x27;t terrible, it does work just find with teasing, although, the plastic bristles are pretty harsh on my fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have long thin hair and this brith only ripped my hair.</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be the ends of the plastic bristles</li>
            <li> They are (one star down).</li>
            <li> I have broken combs trying to tease &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; enough.  </li>
            <li> Can NOT live without this !!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush under the assumption that the bristles were not going to be made out of stiff plastic, since I couldn&#x27;t find anywhere that says they aren&#x27;t, and I couldn&#x27;t tell by the picture.</li>
            <li> It just sits in  a drawer now because the multiple times and strategies I used failed each time.</li>
            <li> I have used rat-tail combs in the past</li>
            <li> The bristles are too stiff and it&#x27;s hard on the head.  </li>
            <li> Another small complaint</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m afraid of damage (as if teasing wasn&#x27;t damage enough, I know).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seller sent me a weird round purple &amp;#34;shampoo massage brush&amp;#34; and demanded that I take a picture of it and send it to them to verify that they made a mistake.</li>
            <li> I was way too busy never got to it, and ended up with a stupid massage brush.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t make it past Halloween weekend with my friends all using it before we went out.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush and was a little shocked when it arrived.</li>
            <li> They are difficult to find in stores anymore, thank you.</li>
            <li> I think you can&#x27;t go wrong for this price.</li>
            <li> Sorry I bought it.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t use this on very thin hair as it may hurt</li>

            <li> I would recommend it to any lady that needs a good stiff, slim hair brush.  I had looked everywhere for one.</li>
            <li> If you tease your hair like I do this is the exact tool that you want it&#x27;s got multi bristles in it and it&#x27;s a nice thick teaser. End is great to help scoot loose hairs around</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and this brush gives it the volume it needs.  Very pleased with this brush.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t tease, but like the way this brush reaches to my scalp.</li>
            <li> Had a similar one for years.  Nothing I could find locally could do the job of back-combing my \\&quot;do.\\&quot;  These little gems are almost as good as my old one.  Now I have one for each of my travel cases.</li>
            <li> I have struggled for awhile to make a good backcomb bump.  I have tried using smaller pieces of hair and backcombing that.  The problem is that my hair is fine and doesn&#x27;t take as well to styling as some hairtypes.  So once I think I have a good bump going, I brush it back, style and shortly after become disappointed.  I was recently looking over some hair books and each of the professional hairstylist suggested a teasing brush for those perfect backcombing styles.  I thought they sure are cheap enough, what the heck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush works pretty well, the ends all have that rattail so that you can section off hair.  The backcombing is really easy with the brush and it certainly creates a lot of height.  The first time I did it I think I would have scared cast members of the movie hairspray.  My hair was huge.  So I learned that for the teasing brush you don&#x27;t need to put in nearly as much effort as you do with a comb.  So take it easy and you get a pretty great bump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did get to use this to make an awesome beehive too.  I could not have been happier with the results.  To smooth out your style later I would suggest using a boar bristle brush or if you have thicker hair a combination boar bristle and nylon brush will smooth the hair and give you a professional looking finish.</li>
            <li> And finally found a brush like this!  Even my hair stylist gave a thumbs up.</li>
            <li> I was trying to find one exactly like the ones I used to use.....it is close.  They are difficult to find in stores anymore, thank you.</li>
            <li> Just so folks are aware, this a very stiff bristle brush that is labeled a \\&quot;wig brush\\&quot;.  No where in the description of the product here on Amazon (that I could find), does this say \\&quot;wig brush\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While many reviewers said this worked for their fine hair, I&#x27;m not comfortable using a wig brush on my natural hair and I&#x27;m afraid of damage (as if teasing wasn&#x27;t damage enough, I know).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may work great for you, but I&#x27;m disgruntled by the fact that this wasn&#x27;t clearly described and unfortunately, at this price point, it&#x27;s not worth it to try to return it.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, but a lot of it. To get any volume I need a lot of help. This brush is great! It has a lot of bristles that are different lengths and materials. They do a great job of grabbing my hair and teasing it. I&#x27;m able to create large bumps or simply volume. Very effective.</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome!  I wear my hair up everyday and this really helps to smooth the hair down for a perfect look.</li>
            <li> This works for exactly what I wanted. Works great for victory rolls. Teasing and smoothing turns out great! Wouldn&#x27;t use this on very thin hair as it may hurt</li>
            <li> Can NOT live without this !!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush under the assumption that the bristles were not going to be made out of stiff plastic, since I couldn&#x27;t find anywhere that says they aren&#x27;t, and I couldn&#x27;t tell by the picture. They are (one star down). Since the entire thing is plastic, I couldn&#x27;t justify why I paid $3 (another star down). With that said, the brush isn&#x27;t terrible, it does work just find with teasing, although, the plastic bristles are pretty harsh on my fine hair. I definitely don&#x27;t recommend combing with this brush, as it does cause some breakage. I&#x27;m planning to invest in a boar bristle brush instead. I don&#x27;t personally recommend this, since you can probably find this in a dollar store.</li>
            <li> I have been using my 1 rattail for years and was concerned that I might lose it. So I went online and hunted for replacements as these do not seem to be carried by brick-and-mortar stores. Found these and I like them better than my original.</li>
            <li> Firstly, the comb came in a tacky purple color even though the picture was green. Also the bristles seem like they were plastic and cheap, which is not worth the price. I wouldnt order it again.</li>
            <li> I love this brush1 Works great! I really love the results! If you want a brush that you can make your hair thick this is great. I reccomend this! -Shari Giacoma</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush and was a little shocked when it arrived. It had silver bristles that were bent various ways. It didn&#x27;t work very well but when should I expect for 3.00?</li>
            <li> I have long thin hair and this brith only ripped my hair. A regular small cheap thin bristled comb works much better. It just sits in  a drawer now because the multiple times and strategies I used failed each time. It doesn&#x27;t even brush hair it just  grazes the top of the hair and makes it frizzy.</li>
            <li> Great Tease Brush for a good price.</li>
            <li> Seller sent me a weird round purple &amp;#34;shampoo massage brush&amp;#34; and demanded that I take a picture of it and send it to them to verify that they made a mistake. Pathetic. I was way too busy never got to it, and ended up with a stupid massage brush. Never ordering from them again.</li>
            <li> Great brush to add to the collection!!!!!!!! I use it all the time!</li>
            <li> Picture shows bristles but when they arrived they were metal.</li>
            <li> I love this brush, I keep it in my purse for everyday use. It&#x27;s works great for teasing or just combing your hair. Especially if you want to rock a super smooth high pony. It&#x27;s like a life saver, that wrangles all your baby hairs in place. It&#x27;s also good to use will straightening your hair to make sure all your strands get straight.</li>
            <li> It is a cute brush and it works really well especially for the price, it was a good buy .</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it for teasing,but it&#x27;s still good. Smooths out my hair nicely and overall its a good brush to have.</li>
            <li> Nice brush. I used it today to add a fullness to my hair, I tease my normally straight hair while blow drying.</li>
            <li> Great deal and great product. It didn&#x27;t pull out my hair and did the job of giving me great volume.</li>
            <li> This brush is great in terms of teasing and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  The handle is plastic, though, I won&#x27;t be surprised if it breaks in the near future.  Another small complaint, I ordered two of them and was charged double for shipping, i.e. no break for consolidation.</li>
            <li> item arrived in a purple color.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with the quality.&lt;br /&gt;ive used it several times now. I am always happy !</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my sister. She has been looking for this brush for years. She was so pleased with it and uses it daily.</li>
            <li> I love this brush! Cheap, works great! Shipped quickly I am planning to buy a few more just to have backups! Definitely recommend and will buy again!</li>
            <li> I bought this for $5, including shipping. It does a decent job with teasing but I think there are probably better brushes out there...or maybe the problem is my technique.  I think you can&#x27;t go wrong for this price.</li>
            <li> This worked awesome to tease and add volume to my fine hair. Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t make it past Halloween weekend with my friends all using it before we went out. It got lost somewhere :( I still haven&#x27;t been able to find it, but I have some hope it&#x27;ll pop up once I&#x27;m cleaning everything out to move in a few months.</li>
            <li> It takes forever for me to tease my very fine hair with a regular comb and it probably isn&#x27;t very healthy for it, so I bought this brush. It&#x27;s so cheap, why not get it? I like it and use it frequently. Good deal.</li>
            <li> This may be fine for someone else but it was not what I was looking for.  The bristles are too stiff and it&#x27;s hard on the head.  Maybe this is supposed to be used for a wig?</li>
            <li> This is one of China&#x27;s poorest quality products.  It will tear a normal head of hair apart.  The bristles are cheap plastic, very stiff.  Sorry I bought it.</li>
            <li> Brush is just ok... sure not as sturdy as one I had before. I can tell it won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great brush.  WAY better than a teasing comb if you need some good lift.  It makes the root of your hair tease tighter and fuller than a comb does.  So depending on the amount of volume you want in our hair, this can be a good way to go.  I have one of those haircuts that is shorter in the back than front, so it&#x27;s all about the volume with this hair style.  I have broken combs trying to tease &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; enough.  To say the least, this has helped a great deal. Plus you can&#x27;t beat the price to give it a try.</li>
            <li> The bristles are like plastic...very hard and not brushing fine hair around the temples! Mistake to buy...in the trash! Gone!</li>
            <li> Nothing fancy, but works for my long hair.  So far so good and the price is unbeatable.  Thanks to Maya</li>
            <li> I received a brush with silver metal bristles, but it still works fine. I just wanted it for teasing roots, and it does that well.</li>
            <li> I love this tease brush. It works great . I use it daily and have been using this for a long time.</li>
            <li> This does say it is a wig brush on the package.  It is nice stiff nylon bristles.  My only complaint would be the ends of the plastic bristles don&#x27;t have a nice finish:  they seem kind of raggedly cut off.  I actually used a sapphire nail file on the ends in attempt to smooth them a little.  I bought this brush for grooming a long haired cat.  Pet brushes are just too huge for some reason and there is nothing that gets in between the front legs where all the darn stickers lodge like a teaser brush.  Also because the brush is long and narrow it can also been turned the other way and be used for brushing the whole cat.  Very nice for getting around cockapoo paws too. I have an old nylon teaser brush from the 60&#x27;s or the 70&#x27;s which is a little nicer than this brush.  It splays out just a little more and the ends of the plastic bristles have a nicer finish.  I bought this brush for one of my pet sitting clients.  This makes a pretty good pet brush.  I don&#x27;t know if I would use it for teasing hair though.  The boar bristle mixed with nylon types seem better for that.</li>
            <li> A hair brush is a hair brush. I like the tail part for parting. Works great.</li>
            <li> Tried all over to find a brush like this. So happy to have found it on Amazon. The price was amazing. Super Satisfied!</li>
            <li> This comes in a package describing it as a &amp;#34;wig brush&amp;#34;. Not really a teaser comb.</li>
            <li> This is a great teasing brush and at a very good price.  I have used rat-tail combs in the past but I actually think this works better.  It says &amp;#34;wig brush&amp;#34; when you get it, but don&#x27;t freak out, its gives great volume!</li>
            <li> Have been looking for these for a long time. I&#x27;m so happy to have finally found them and at a great price too.</li>
            <li> We all used to carry these around in our purses during the &amp;#34;big-hair&amp;#34; 80&#x27;s. I forgot how great they work to tease hair. Excellent.</li>
            <li> For years, I have searched for a replacement for my one-and-only &amp;#34;rat-tailed&amp;#34; hair brush.  It&#x27;s the only kind of brush that works on my springy, curly gray hair.  When I found these in Amazon.com, I ordered them immediately.  They came in a pack of three and were exactly what I wanted.  Now, I&#x27;m happier with my hair, and I have a &amp;#34;Tease Brush&amp;#34; in three convenient places.  Thanks again, Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> This teasing brush is one of the best that I&#x27;ve tried so far. The tease from this brush lasts longer than and rat tailed comb I&#x27;ve used. I love it!</li>
            <li> I know nothing about brushes, but the fact that this brush specified it was for wigs bothered me.  There must be some reason for this description.  I&#x27;m not even sure I want to use it on my hair.</li>
