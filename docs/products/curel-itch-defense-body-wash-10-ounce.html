    <ol>
            <li>It is best used with a wash cloth or brush.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, this body wash was is a perfect winner.</li>

            <li>I am happy to say that I have stopped itching my arms until they bleed.  </li>
            <li>The product has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>So perhaps it would be fair to say that it doesn&#x27;t create a problem or solve one.</li>
            <li>It is always great to have a body wash like Curel, who has proven effective to relieve itching, making a body wash as good as this one.</li>
            <li>Another excellent use for this is to relieve those funny itches you cannot find.</li>
            <li>This truly is an effective moisturizing cleaner.</li>
            <li>Curel is a nice foaming body wash, but I haven&#x27;t found it helped with any itching</li>
            <li>It lathers nice and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a nice body wash and lathers well - if you like that - I do.</li>
            <li>I have not noticed the lotion does anything to lessen the dryness, but it does have a nice, creamy texture.</li>
            <li>I am more than thrilled to have this product</li>
            <li>The more I age, the drier my skin becomes.  </li>
            <li>My skin felt better and didn&#x27;t have any greasy or filmy feeling after showering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Amongst its formula&#x27;s ingredients, there&#x27;s hydrating jojoba, olive oil, glycerine and more.  </li>
            <li>I also felt confident about using it, since it earned the National Eczema Association (NEA) seal of acceptance, which means they tested it and met their criteria.  </li>
            <li>I love Curel, so I was glad to try the Itch Defense.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a problem with itching for more than 10 years - so I&#x27;ve tried lots of products.</li>
            <li>Lovely stuff.</li>
            <li>I thoroughly enjoyed this body wash, but must point out I always use lotion after completing a shower session.</li>
            <li>I feel so much better and will keep using this product to keep my skin from itching and flaking off.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and would recommend it to anyone suffering from  &amp;#34;itchiness&amp;#34; from an allergic reaction, sun burn or a chronic skin condition.</li>
            <li>I use it in the shower on my face mostly</li>
            <li>She really enjoyed this body wash because it did not exacerbate her allergies at all.</li>
            <li>I really like this as a neutral soap itself, but the anti itch is great.</li>
            <li>I will like to thank Vine, for delivering this fine product right to my doorsteps, and giving me the chance to experience its good</li>
            <li>In any event, the product works very well and is pleasant to use.</li>
            <li>It says it&#x27;s fragrance free, but it does have an ever so light scent - so it was a nice body wash to use.</li>
            <li>This product is gender friendly in that it appears suitable to be used by all genders.  </li>
            <li>This is an okay shower wash that cleans fine, foams well, and has no scent.</li>
            <li>It comes in a bottle that is easy to grip and hold.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to dispense from the &amp;#34;upside down&amp;#34; bottle.  </li>
            <li>and I have a strong sense of smell.</li>
            <li>The smell is mild and clean, and the texture is nice and foamy.</li>
            <li>It makes a nice lather and you don&#x27;t have to use much of it.  </li>
            <li>This Curel body wash kept Tammy&#x27;s skin smooth and never caused her to have a skin reaction.  </li>
            <li>Not only did I feel immediate relief after showering with it, but haven&#x27;t experienced the itchiness after using it for a couple of days.  </li>
            <li>Having used this fabulous body wash, I can why it&#x27;s been endorsed by one of the foremost allergy/eczema foundations.</li>
            <li>Curel Itch Defense Body Wash with jojoba and olive oil is a good alternative to soaps for those of us with sensitive</li>
            <li>If I noticed any kind of relief from the itching or the eczema, I would have highly recommended this wash.  </li>
            <li>think that the moment is at hand, where besides a product like a body wash delivering a clean body, it also delivered additional benefits while using it.</li>
            <li>The bottle rests on its large top.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall: its a nice body wash for sensitive skin people who want and unscented product</li>
            <li>notice it most when I&#x27;m ready to go to sleep</li>
            <li>Wash.  What I discovered is that my skin feels good without the need for the extra in-shower moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I develop a mild itch over every exposed body part.</li>
            <li>I can see myself buying many more bottles in the future.</li>
            <li>I would have to admit that it is rare to use a body wash, that is truly exceptional, but this is one is certainly good enough for daily use.</li>
            <li>This body wash has a nice, fine, creamy lather with a very light scent that left my skin feeling super soft.</li>
            <li>if you aren&#x27;t looking for itch relief, this is a good product for those seeking a non-fragranced, non-irritating body wash that leaves skin feeling clean and smooth and less prone to drying out.</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant as many other sensitive skin products don&#x27;t have any aroma.  </li>
            <li>In other words this body wash is also a good moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It lathers very well and my skin feels clean and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>I am happy to have Curel Itch Defense Body Wash, We live in a very dry climate so my skin has been itching me to pieces</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m back to my good old Ivory soap.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any particular anti-itch effect, but it did rinse clean and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is not a product I would use again, although I do like the Curel Lotions very much.</li>
            <li>We were surprised by the lack of effectiveness of this product, having had great experience with other kinds of skin care things from Curel.  </li>
            <li>It is completely fragrance free (a plus for the chemically sensitives).</li>
            <li>This Curel product works really well!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Where this product does excel with its first use is moisturizing.</li>
            <li>In fact, now I am hyper aware of the times I do itch because I haven&#x27;t been doing it.</li>
            <li>More importantly, it works really well to reduce the itching of dry skin or sensitive skin after a shower.  </li>
            <li>The product has natural oils, moisturizers and gentle cleansers even for the most sensitive skin  like mine.  </li>
            <li>Body washes don&#x27;t dry my skin like most soaps do.  </li>
            <li>First thing I liked was that there was no strong fragrance.</li>
            <li>It is not fragrance free, but the fragrance is minimal, mild and inoffensive.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty decent body wash.  </li>
            <li>This wash is very creamy.  </li>
            <li>It has no fragrance, is very creamy and lathers well.  </li>
            <li>Someone else may really like it.  </li>
            <li>The Curel Itch Defense Body Wash is a luxurious body wash that I can enjoy using on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, the liquid is always ready to come out when opened.  </li>
            <li>I have eczema on my lower legs, which causes itchy spots with redness, dryness, and even blistering, if I scratch too much.  </li>
            <li>and I highly recommend using Curel Itch Defense Body Wash!</li>
            <li>Fragrance-free and lathers up really well.</li>
            <li>This product seems to really reduce that itch as well as moisturize my face.  </li>
            <li>What they really need is a pump bottle.</li>
            <li>a basic body wash, you&#x27;ll get a better lather if you use a wash cloth or sponge, as I didn&#x27;t get much applying it directly to the skin or rubbing my hands together.</li>
            <li>so I was eager to try this Curel product (I also use some of their body lotions and am very pleased with several designed specifically for very dry, itchy skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yet, as we are using it, it does seem to be helping more than other moisturizing body washes.</li>
            <li>body wash has very little scent and lathers nicely.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have dry skin but in the summer time I do get more sensitive (allergies, sun, heat, sweating, etc).</li>
            <li>The competition for Body Wash products is fierce, to say the least, and every day, it seems more and more types of body washes are announced, by the same companies that seem to dominate the market.</li>
            <li>The Curel Itch Defense Body Wash does make my skin feel better and noticeably less itchy/</li>
            <li>Mild itching for a very short time.&lt;br /&gt;Days</li>
            <li>At first, I thought the body wash was unscented, but I did detect a faint, pleasant citrusy smell.</li>
            <li>that are highly scented cause her skin to break out into a rash.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The bottle  design is good, and its lack of dominant scent is positive, but its advertised strengths are minimal to missing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep using it though and update this review if I feel strongly one way or the other, but for now the jury is still out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After using for a few days, the effect was even more noticeably.  </li>
            <li>It does not have any offensive odor and acts about like a normal shower gel type wash.  </li>
            <li>We find that we are slathering on less lotion We even have stopped using after shower wet applied moisturizers as Curel Itch Defense seems to leave the same kind of light coating on our skin.</li>
            <li>So far, I haven&#x27;t discerned a noticeable difference regarding its main selling point of being anti-itch.</li>
            <li>used it last night for the first time, applying it before going to bed.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m not super careful what products I use, I pay a pretty hefty price that can take many days to go away.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;Skin feels soft but not slick or greasy post showering with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is neither masculine nor feminine in appearance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As someone with sensitive, itchy skin I don’t want to leave residue from a body wash on my skin, and it wasn’t a lotion or moisturizing residue, it was soapy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But since using this product, I have not found myself having those wild itching fits.</li>
            <li>I live in high desert, which means my skin is always dry and flaking and I use tons of lotion.</li>
            <li>my skin, in general, is sensitive and prone to itching.</li>
            <li>My doctor suggested that I refrain from hot showers and that I not use soap on my lower back where I was getting dry spots.</li>
            <li>Additionally, I&#x27;m not sure it really does much to relieve itch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling comfortably soft.</li>
            <li>, I have used them in the past, always to very positive results.</li>
            <li>Lotions help, but this product really helps tone down the itch.  </li>
            <li>This actually felt a little bothersome at first, a bit like sunscreen, but it wasn&#x27;t unbearable.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Curel Itch for several days and am probably showering in slightly less hot water; the dry patches are gone.</li>

            <li> so I was eager to try this Curel product (I also use some of their body lotions and am very pleased with several designed specifically for very dry, itchy skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yet, as we are using it, it does seem to be helping more than other moisturizing body washes.</li>
            <li> body wash has very little scent and lathers nicely.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dry skin but in the summer time I do get more sensitive (allergies, sun, heat, sweating, etc).</li>
            <li> The competition for Body Wash products is fierce, to say the least, and every day, it seems more and more types of body washes are announced, by the same companies that seem to dominate the market.</li>
            <li> The Curel Itch Defense Body Wash does make my skin feel better and noticeably less itchy/</li>
            <li> Mild itching for a very short time.&lt;br /&gt;Days</li>
            <li> At first, I thought the body wash was unscented, but I did detect a faint, pleasant citrusy smell.</li>
            <li> that are highly scented cause her skin to break out into a rash.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The bottle  design is good, and its lack of dominant scent is positive, but its advertised strengths are minimal to missing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep using it though and update this review if I feel strongly one way or the other, but for now the jury is still out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using for a few days, the effect was even more noticeably.  </li>
            <li> It does not have any offensive odor and acts about like a normal shower gel type wash.  </li>
            <li> We find that we are slathering on less lotion We even have stopped using after shower wet applied moisturizers as Curel Itch Defense seems to leave the same kind of light coating on our skin.</li>
            <li> So far, I haven&#x27;t discerned a noticeable difference regarding its main selling point of being anti-itch.</li>
            <li> used it last night for the first time, applying it before going to bed.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m not super careful what products I use, I pay a pretty hefty price that can take many days to go away.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;Skin feels soft but not slick or greasy post showering with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is neither masculine nor feminine in appearance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As someone with sensitive, itchy skin I don’t want to leave residue from a body wash on my skin, and it wasn’t a lotion or moisturizing residue, it was soapy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But since using this product, I have not found myself having those wild itching fits.</li>
            <li> I live in high desert, which means my skin is always dry and flaking and I use tons of lotion.</li>
            <li> my skin, in general, is sensitive and prone to itching.</li>
            <li> My doctor suggested that I refrain from hot showers and that I not use soap on my lower back where I was getting dry spots.</li>
            <li> Additionally, I&#x27;m not sure it really does much to relieve itch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling comfortably soft.</li>
            <li> , I have used them in the past, always to very positive results.</li>
            <li> Lotions help, but this product really helps tone down the itch.  </li>
            <li> This actually felt a little bothersome at first, a bit like sunscreen, but it wasn&#x27;t unbearable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Curel Itch for several days and am probably showering in slightly less hot water; the dry patches are gone.</li>
            <li> Itch Defense Body Wash, 10 Ounce ( a little on the small size) delivers on its promise, and is a fine addition to all the products made by Curely.</li>
            <li> Out of the bottle I was a little put off by a slightly medicinal smell, but that quickly went away and did not linger after my shower.</li>
            <li> when standing cap down in the shower, it retains water that gets into it, so you feel like you need to upend it to clear the water out of it before you can use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely use this again for my dry skin and for my son&#x27;s supersensitive skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s far less drying than soaps, but isn&#x27;t a &#x27;cure&#x27; for itchy skin.  </li>
            <li> tend to have sensitive skin, especially to soaps that have heavily fragrances.  </li>
            <li> It may be that I personally have a particular problem with itchy shins and ankles, and it&#x27;s hard to use a body wash in the shower hunched over working the bottom of your legs unless you have a shower bench.</li>
            <li> I am not typically very itchy, but I do get some irritation after being in the sun for a while, especially when mowing the lawn.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not constant and it&#x27;s not intense</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to harsh smells</li>
            <li> so it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> It is intended for those of us, like myself, who suffer from dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I used the body wash all over, including my scalp and as claimed I did not suffer any dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have have dry skin that gets itchy if I don&#x27;t take care of it.</li>
            <li> Only after a few weeks of using this body wash I have noticed a  big difference.</li>
            <li> I have pretty severe eczema and have been struggling with it during the past few months.</li>
            <li> The liquid soap is a bit more on the thin side rather than thick.</li>
            <li> That alone makes this a desirable product.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;White liquid, neither too thick or thin, that glides onto skin and washes off easily with no apparent residue.</li>
            <li> I have very dry itchy skin and sometimes suffer from dry spots (eczema).</li>
            <li> My skin felt softer and less dry than when using traditional soaps and body washes, and if this is what leads to reducing itch then they may be onto something.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure this product does enough to justify the price over a regular bar of soap or cheaper wash.</li>
            <li> Not only does it not lather as much as a similar amount of other brands, it did not relieve itching as well as plain water.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My daughter and I both deal with auto-immune diseases that can cause very dry, itchy skin. I hoped that Curel Itch Defense Body Wash might help, admittedly basing that on the reputation of the Curel name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After receiving this product, and reading the list of ingredients, I was disappointed as it read very similar to products that we already had. Yet, as we are using it, it does seem to be helping more than other moisturizing body washes. We find that we are slathering on less lotion We even have stopped using after shower wet applied moisturizers as Curel Itch Defense seems to leave the same kind of light coating on our skin. As a bonus. body wash has very little scent and lathers nicely.</li>
            <li> I got this body wash because I have eczema.  I don&#x27;t know if it does anything for my itchy skin.  My skin is still itchy after having used it for two weeks.  But that just may be me.  My eczema is extremely flared up at the moment!  This wash is very creamy.  It makes a nice lather and you don&#x27;t have to use much of it.  A word of warning, though.  It makes the floor of your shower slick!  After washing my feet, I have to be extremely careful or I will slip down.  If I noticed any kind of relief from the itching or the eczema, I would have highly recommended this wash.  But since I didn&#x27;t, I can&#x27;t recommend it.  It has no fragrance, is very creamy and lathers well.  Someone else may really like it.  I&#x27;m back to my good old Ivory soap.  I was hopeful.</li>
            <li> The more I age, the drier my skin becomes.  In my shower, bars of soap have been replaced with bottles of body wash.  Body washes don&#x27;t dry my skin like most soaps do.  Recently, I received a bottle of Curel Itch Defense Body Wash.  It is intended for those of us, like myself, who suffer from dry skin.  I must use a body lotion every day, especially during the cold winter months, or my skin becomes dry and begins to literally itch and burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The Curel Itch Defense Body Wash is a luxurious body wash that I can enjoy using on a daily basis.  It&#x27;s scentless, white, pearlescent liquid lathers quite well.  It comes in a bottle that is easy to grip and hold.  The bottle rests on its large top.  Therefore, the liquid is always ready to come out when opened.  This product is gender friendly in that it appears suitable to be used by all genders.  It is neither masculine nor feminine in appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The Curel Itch Defense Body Wash is also intended for those who suffer from allergies.  My girlfriend, Tammy, loves this body wash because it is scentless.  Body washes, body lotions, deodorants, etc., that are highly scented cause her skin to break out into a rash.  This Curel body wash kept Tammy&#x27;s skin smooth and never caused her to have a skin reaction.  She has used a multitude of other Curel products because of their ability to heal dry skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dry skin but in the summer time I do get more sensitive (allergies, sun, heat, sweating, etc). The Curel Itch Defense Body Wash does make my skin feel better and noticeably less itchy/sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle has the lid on the bottom, which all bath products should IMHO.  It is completely fragrance free (a plus for the chemically sensitives). I prefer scented body washes, but don&#x27;t mind if it&#x27;s unscented. The liquid soap is a bit more on the thin side rather than thick. It is best used with a wash cloth or brush.  It foams up well and didn&#x27;t leave any residue when rinsed. My skin felt better and didn&#x27;t have any greasy or filmy feeling after showering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: its a nice body wash for sensitive skin people who want and unscented product</li>
            <li> The Curel looks and feels like hair conditioner: silky, thick. At first, I thought the body wash was unscented, but I did detect a faint, pleasant citrusy smell. I used the body wash all over, including my scalp and as claimed I did not suffer any dry skin. This truly is an effective moisturizing cleaner. Notice I don&#x27;t say soap since Curel is emphasizing that this is a &amp;#34;non-soap&amp;#34; wash, probably because of the association of soap and dryness. In any event, the product works very well and is pleasant to use. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read some of the other reviews and I share some points I agree with: (1) There&#x27;s nothing in here that should relieve itch, not even oatmeal. (2) It&#x27;s a pretty decent body wash.  If nothing else, this will suffice as a body wash, but you could buy another body wash for less.  HOWEVER, I found that this actually works on me. I am not typically very itchy, but I do get some irritation after being in the sun for a while, especially when mowing the lawn. I develop a mild itch over every exposed body part. Showering with this immediately relieves the itch. Just as an experiment, I showered with this as a prophylactic and it worked; I wasn&#x27;t itchy after mowing the yards.  Judging by how my skin feels after using this, my theory is that it leaves a behind a film that keeps the skin hydrated and seals out irritants. This actually felt a little bothersome at first, a bit like sunscreen, but it wasn&#x27;t unbearable.  Another excellent use for this is to relieve those funny itches you cannot find. You know the ones where you end up scratching head-to-toe with no relief. Just jump in the shower with this and I&#x27;m relieved.</li>
            <li> I have eczema on my lower legs, which causes itchy spots with redness, dryness, and even blistering, if I scratch too much.  Therefore, when I had the opportunity to try Cur&amp;eacute;l&#x27;s dermatologist recommended body wash, I took it.  I am so glad I did.  Not only did I feel immediate relief after showering with it, but haven&#x27;t experienced the itchiness after using it for a couple of days.  Amongst its formula&#x27;s ingredients, there&#x27;s hydrating jojoba, olive oil, glycerine and more.  (I&#x27;ve used oatmeal base soaps in the past, which help soothe the itchiness, but only temporarily.)  I also felt confident about using it, since it earned the National Eczema Association (NEA) seal of acceptance, which means they tested it and met their criteria.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I got the body wash two days ago and will be updating this review as I use it. I have suffered for years from on again off again itching on my calves.  It&#x27;s not constant and it&#x27;s not intense but it&#x27;s distracting --I notice it most when I&#x27;m ready to go to sleep and it keeps me awake.  I&#x27;m hoping this wash will help it. I&#x27;m hoping this wash will help it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 1 --I used it last night for the first time, applying it before going to bed. Mild itching for a very short time.&lt;br /&gt;Days 2 and 3 --no itch!&lt;br /&gt;Five days and no troubles.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll only come back on to edit this if I start to have problems with itching but it looks like this stuff works!</li>
            <li> I love Curel, so I was glad to try the Itch Defense. I&#x27;ve had a problem with itching for more than 10 years - so I&#x27;ve tried lots of products. When I used this product the itch stopped and lasted for a longer period of time - a great relief for me. This Itch defense took the offense for me! Jesus&#x27; Blessings and Peace</li>
            <li> I have very dry itchy skin and sometimes suffer from dry spots (eczema). If I&#x27;m not super careful what products I use, I pay a pretty hefty price that can take many days to go away. Having used this fabulous body wash, I can why it&#x27;s been endorsed by one of the foremost allergy/eczema foundations. This body wash has a nice, fine, creamy lather with a very light scent that left my skin feeling super soft. I didn&#x27;t feel any skin irritation from it at all. It left my skin feeling comfortably soft. There is just one flaw in the cap design - when standing cap down in the shower, it retains water that gets into it, so you feel like you need to upend it to clear the water out of it before you can use it. Otherwise, this body wash was is a perfect winner. I can see myself buying many more bottles in the future. Lovely stuff.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  From time to time the skin on my back will itch with no rash or irritation visible. Lotions help, but this product really helps tone down the itch.  Only after a few weeks of using this body wash I have noticed a  big difference. It lathers very well and my skin feels clean and refreshed.  This product will be stocked for when that annoying itching returns.</li>
            <li> I thoroughly enjoyed this body wash, but must point out I always use lotion after completing a shower session. I like Curel and their product line, I have used them in the past, always to very positive results. The competition for Body Wash products is fierce, to say the least, and every day, it seems more and more types of body washes are announced, by the same companies that seem to dominate the market. It is always great to have a body wash like Curel, who has proven effective to relieve itching, making a body wash as good as this one. I would have to admit that it is rare to use a body wash, that is truly exceptional, but this is one is certainly good enough for daily use. I will like to thank Vine, for delivering this fine product right to my doorsteps, and giving me the chance to experience its good points.&lt;br /&gt;I think that the moment is at hand, where besides a product like a body wash delivering a clean body, it also delivered additional benefits while using it. Some of these body washes can be used for shaving, washing hair and body wash, making them, at one time or another, extremely helpful.&lt;br /&gt;Curel Itch Defense Body Wash, 10 Ounce ( a little on the small size) delivers on its promise, and is a fine addition to all the products made by Curely. 4 Stars.</li>
            <li> Curel is a nice foaming body wash, but I haven&#x27;t found it helped with any itching and I&#x27;ve used it a month. If you are sensitive to harsh smells Curel Itch Defense is great. It lathers nice and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot so it lasts for a long time. My itching is due to a medication I take so this was a last ditch effort to find something to help.</li>
            <li> I have have dry skin that gets itchy if I don&#x27;t take care of it. I cycle through different products, but I usually use Cetaphil or Aveeno. I use Curel a lot during winter, so I was happy to try this product. First thing I liked was that there was no strong fragrance. The second thing is that the body wash was thick and moisturizing without feeling goopy (like you&#x27;re using lotion in the shower).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that it&#x27;s made to stand in the shower, so the product is always to the bottom. All in all, it&#x27;s what I would expect from Curel!</li>
            <li> The product has a pleasant scent. More importantly, it works really well to reduce the itching of dry skin or sensitive skin after a shower.  After using for a few days, the effect was even more noticeably.  I&#x27;ll definitely use this again for my dry skin and for my son&#x27;s supersensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This body wash did not stop the itch at all; I threw it away.</li>
            <li> My wife and I both have very dry skin and are prone to itchy skin from time to time. To help prevent this from happening we both use one of those &amp;#34;wet skin in-shower&amp;#34; moisturizers before we get out of the shower. We both tried this Curel Itch Defense Body Wash.  What I discovered is that my skin feels good without the need for the extra in-shower moisturizer.  In other words this body wash is also a good moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body wash has no noticeable fragrance.  Provides a lot of lather  with a small amount. You&#x27;ll notice that your skin still feels slippery silky as you towel off.</li>
            <li> I am happy to have Curel Itch Defense Body Wash, We live in a very dry climate so my skin has been itching me to pieces and my skin has been flaking off.  I have used the Curel Itch Defense Body Wash 5 times in the shower.  I am happy to say that I have stopped itching my arms until they bleed.  I feel so much better and will keep using this product to keep my skin from itching and flaking off.  The product has natural oils, moisturizers and gentle cleansers even for the most sensitive skin  like mine.  I am more than thrilled to have this product and I highly recommend using Curel Itch Defense Body Wash!</li>
            <li> I suffer from sever plaque psoriasis and was looking for a body wash they would relieve some of the itch I experience.  This shower gel does eliminate the itch while moisturizing my skin.  The scent is pleasant as many other sensitive skin products don&#x27;t have any aroma.  I love this product and would recommend it to anyone suffering from  &amp;#34;itchiness&amp;#34; from an allergic reaction, sun burn or a chronic skin condition.</li>
            <li> Fragrance-free and lathers up really well. I didn&#x27;t notice any particular anti-itch effect, but it did rinse clean and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the packaging though: the lid feels like it&#x27;s going to fall off every time I flip it open, and also some product escapes whenever I open it.</li>
            <li> This Curel product works really well!  I use it in the shower on my face mostly, I have a beard and mustache that sometimes itch quite a lot.  This product seems to really reduce that itch as well as moisturize my face.  It does not have any offensive odor and acts about like a normal shower gel type wash.  It is easy to dispense from the &amp;#34;upside down&amp;#34; bottle.  I would recommend this product to anyone with a persistent itch.</li>
            <li> It works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no fragrance or heavy feel (common with other body washes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to have sensitive skin, especially to soaps that have heavily fragrances.  I have no idea how it works but it works.</li>
            <li> We were surprised by the lack of effectiveness of this product, having had great experience with other kinds of skin care things from Curel.  Not only does it not lather as much as a similar amount of other brands, it did not relieve itching as well as plain water. The bottle  design is good, and its lack of dominant scent is positive, but its advertised strengths are minimal to missing.</li>
            <li> Curel Itch Defense Body Wash with jojoba and olive oil is a good alternative to soaps for those of us with sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works as well as the Cetaphil and Dove that we normally use, but it&#x27;s no better as far as we can see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband likes that has no added fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s far less drying than soaps, but isn&#x27;t a &#x27;cure&#x27; for itchy skin.  So perhaps it would be fair to say that it doesn&#x27;t create a problem or solve one.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s get the worst out of the way. Curel Body Wash does not have the consistency of ketchup, so putting the cap on the bottom is crazy. What they really need is a pump bottle. Additionally, I&#x27;m not sure it really does much to relieve itch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, they product inside the crazy bottle does have a lot going for it. It cleans the skin without drying like soap would. In addition, there are no fragrances added. It is not fragrance free, but the fragrance is minimal, mild and inoffensive. My doctor suggested that I refrain from hot showers and that I not use soap on my lower back where I was getting dry spots. I&#x27;ve been using Curel Itch for several days and am probably showering in slightly less hot water; the dry patches are gone.</li>
            <li> I have a tendency to get big welts and hives (cause as yet undetermined) and my skin, in general, is sensitive and prone to itching. I am always on the lookout for skin products that are specifically designed to either prevent itching or help minimize it when it occurs. To that end, I use a number of Aveeno body lotions and handcreams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had yet to hear of or try any type of shower/body wash so I was eager to try this Curel product (I also use some of their body lotions and am very pleased with several designed specifically for very dry, itchy skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;No fragrance. None that I could detect and I have a strong sense of smell. That alone makes this a desirable product.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;White liquid, neither too thick or thin, that glides onto skin and washes off easily with no apparent residue. (Some products, you rinse and rinse and still feel too slick/greasy.)&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;Skin feels soft but not slick or greasy post showering with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for its soothing properties, my skin did feel a bit less prone to itchiness/dryness post showering. Did it prevent hives and welts? No, but then how could it and I haven&#x27;t used it to shower when they arise (often in middle of night) to see if it &amp;#34;calms&amp;#34; them down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you aren&#x27;t looking for itch relief, this is a good product for those seeking a non-fragranced, non-irritating body wash that leaves skin feeling clean and smooth and less prone to drying out.</li>
            <li> I used the Curel Itch Defense Body Wash along with Curel Itch Defense Lotion, as recommended, but unfortunately I didn’t experience any relief from my itchy skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a nice body wash and lathers well - if you like that - I do. It says it&#x27;s fragrance free, but it does have an ever so light scent - so it was a nice body wash to use. It was a little difficult to rinse off, and we have hard water, so it might be even more difficult for those with soft water to rinse. As someone with sensitive, itchy skin I don’t want to leave residue from a body wash on my skin, and it wasn’t a lotion or moisturizing residue, it was soapy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice there are a lot of chemical ingredients in this body wash, and one that I know tends to irritate my skin - which is Cocamidopropyl Betaine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a product I would use again, although I do like the Curel Lotions very much. The lotions have never irritated my skin - so those I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I let my sister use this body wash because she has a multitude of allergies and cannot use any products that are scented. Consequently, there are very few body washes that she can use. She really enjoyed this body wash because it did not exacerbate her allergies at all.</li>
            <li> This is an okay shower wash that cleans fine, foams well, and has no scent. I live in high desert, which means my skin is always dry and flaking and I use tons of lotion. I have not noticed the lotion does anything to lessen the dryness, but it does have a nice, creamy texture. I&#x27;m not sure this product does enough to justify the price over a regular bar of soap or cheaper wash.</li>
            <li> I have mixed feelings about this body wash. So far, I haven&#x27;t discerned a noticeable difference regarding its main selling point of being anti-itch. It may be that I personally have a particular problem with itchy shins and ankles, and it&#x27;s hard to use a body wash in the shower hunched over working the bottom of your legs unless you have a shower bench. I&#x27;ll keep using it though and update this review if I feel strongly one way or the other, but for now the jury is still out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a basic body wash, you&#x27;ll get a better lather if you use a wash cloth or sponge, as I didn&#x27;t get much applying it directly to the skin or rubbing my hands together. Out of the bottle I was a little put off by a slightly medicinal smell, but that quickly went away and did not linger after my shower. If you want a fragrance though, this body wash doesn&#x27;t have it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where this product does excel with its first use is moisturizing. My skin felt softer and less dry than when using traditional soaps and body washes, and if this is what leads to reducing itch then they may be onto something. At very least it allows you to wash and moisturize in a single step rather than having to use soap then use a moisturizer when out of the shower. That quality alone may be enough for me to keep using it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this a few days ago and have used it about 3 times. I have pretty severe eczema and have been struggling with it during the past few months. I bought this because I have a million creams and lotions, but nothing treated the itch which perpetuated the irritation. I gave this a shot because I needed a non-irritating soap, I figured if it doesn&#x27;t relieve itch, at least it won&#x27;t cause it. But since using this product, I have not found myself having those wild itching fits. In fact, now I am hyper aware of the times I do itch because I haven&#x27;t been doing it. Now my skin is been clearing up with use of a topical cream and my lack of itching. The smell is mild and clean, and the texture is nice and foamy. I really like this as a neutral soap itself, but the anti itch is great.</li>
