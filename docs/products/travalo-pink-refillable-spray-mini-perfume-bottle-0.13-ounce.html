            <li>Its a good product but</li>

            <li>the pure model is great!</li>
            <li>It does not leak and it works amazingly well.</li>
            <li>I chose this rating because this product is amazing</li>
            <li>so everything I own doesn&#x27;t end up smelling like perfume.</li>
            <li>Buy at your own risk.</li>
            <li>and I thought it would be nice for my perfume</li>
            <li>I received a set of these as a gift and was thrilled to have an option to travel with my fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love these and want to order more great gifts and stocking stuffers</li>
            <li>and I like having it in my purse for refreshing, cheerful, pick-me-up of a great smelling perfume during the day.</li>
            <li>Very easy to fill with perfume.</li>
            <li>It slips into the travel ziploc very easy in-between the 3 oz bottles.  </li>
            <li>VERY easy to do......</li>
            <li>This morning I went to get something out of my cosmetic case and was hit with the very strong scent of my perfume</li>
            <li>Oh, yes and so easy to fill!  </li>
            <li>I am okay with my purchase and now I can have my favorite perfume handy at all times.</li>
            <li>It was very easy to fill from my perfume bottle, and love the fact that there is no glass.  </li>
            <li>Like many users of this product, I would agree that it is very easy to fill.</li>
            <li>The Travalo is so easy to refill and has no screw-on top to leak!</li>
            <li>Just place on perfume after removing top and pump.</li>
            <li>Am so glad I have my favorite perfume with me in the Himalayas, and plan to buy for Christmas presents.  </li>
            <li>: the color is slightly more purple than it shows in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>I guess the product works OK.</li>
            <li>I thought I would be able to pour the perfume in here</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I decided to buy it</li>
            <li>Cute and compact .</li>
            <li>When the sprayer broke, I was left with just the plastic tube sticking out the top of the perfume bottle, making it perfect for use with this product.</li>
            <li>I saw this item on a YouTube channel (Gregory Gorgeous), and thought it was worth while.</li>
            <li>I love it, love it, love it.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>I just got this and love that I can carry my favorite perfume with me when I&#x27;m out.</li>
            <li>Just be sure your perfume bottle has a removable spray top.</li>
            <li>What an ingenious idea...</li>
            <li>My daughter wanted a purser for her favorite cologne</li>
            <li>Will buy more of them for her.</li>
            <li>Bought more for gift-giving.</li>
            <li>I purchased one for each of my favorite perfumes.</li>
            <li>My favorite perfume doesn&#x27;t come in a rollerball to carry around with me in my purse or for travel</li>
            <li>This has been incredibly durable so far and no leakages.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so cute, pretty and a good size for purses,</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t leak which is fantastic and they are very easy to fill.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and perfect for toting around extra smell</li>
            <li>Very well made &amp; incredibly handy!</li>
            <li>Mine didn&#x27;t leak and was so quick and easy to use, you&#x27;ll LOVE it!</li>
            <li>I filled with my favorite spray perfume and</li>
            <li>This handy gadget has made bringing my favorite perfume on airplanes so much easier!</li>
            <li>the top was securely on</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s the best money I&#x27;ve spent in a while.</li>
            <li>This is a brilliant idea that actually works.</li>
            <li>And it is so cool and easy to refill!</li>
            <li>My wife has filled it up with her favorite perfume, and it works fine.  </li>
            <li>Be sure you check to see if the plastic pump part is accessible before purchasing.</li>
            <li>Easy to fill with perfume.  </li>
            <li>Easy to fill, no leaking as of yet.</li>
            <li>Extremely easy to use</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not an easy solution.&lt;br /&gt;The convenience of it outweighs the cons.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to pump and fill up</li>
            <li>Easy to fill .</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t as easy to fill as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>Easy to fill</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to fill.</li>
            <li>However, it leaks and you lose product (e.g, perfume) very quickly.</li>
            <li>The Spray Mini is easy to fill, does not leak (I carried it on a trans-Atlantic flight), and is an unobtrusive size for one&#x27;s purse.</li>
            <li>I like how easy it is to use, and how portable it is.</li>
            <li>and it was easy and it does not leak.</li>
            <li>Although I loved the perfume dispenser it was not the bright pink color as shown in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>worked fine</li>
            <li>I bought one of these in a store and it worked fine.  </li>
            <li>it worked great until suddenly</li>
            <li>It is tiny, you can take it in your purse, it doesn&#x27;t leak and it works great.</li>
            <li>But I got enough in to be happy.</li>
            <li>At time of writing this review Ive had in about a month and filled it twice and maybe sprayed it 5</li>
            <li>I filled it up once</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cheap knock off.</li>
            <li>Cheap and will leak.</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be cheap.  </li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t available.</li>
            <li>i filled it up an tossed it to the end of my bed to remember to take to put in my purse..</li>
            <li>I loved it and ordered a couple more for personal use as well as gifts for others.</li>
            <li>Was easy to fill, fits perfectly in my purse and looks pretty in pink.</li>
            <li>Came in very handy on my trip, didn&#x27;t want to carry around the big bottle.</li>
            <li>so it was easy and quick.</li>
            <li>Innovative, easy, fast way to fill your purse spray.</li>
            <li>I know the original box from store.</li>
            <li>but it was all worth it!</li>
            <li>I plan to order more in different colors for my favorite colognes!</li>
            <li>It is still mostly full</li>
            <li>The window on the side allows you to gauge how full it is, so overfilling it is never or shouldn&#x27;t be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray nozzle of this product is robust and is well made.  </li>
            <li>This is really cool...</li>
            <li>Really cool gift idea.</li>
            <li>It good if you use the same perfume.</li>
            <li>and it was okay - noticed that it seemed to be emptying out fast.</li>
            <li>very small, perfect for travel.  </li>
            <li>She had no idea there were such things as mini perfume bottles that you could fill with your own perfume, and since she often asks for small roller balls as gifts, she loved that she could just choose any one of her favorite perfumes and have it with her anywhere!</li>
            <li>Luckily the cosmetic case was one of those quilted ones</li>
            <li>I liked the cute pink one the one I got</li>
            <li>I love mine and highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>Very pretty color.  </li>
            <li>They fill up easily and something that goes straight through security without issue.</li>
            <li>Love the idea - and one of the two I ordered worked really well - but one seems to be leaking, though I can&#x27;t tell how or from where exactly.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li>Holds a lot while being nice and tiny for the purse or makeup bag.</li>
            <li>For my bachelorette my sister took me to a boutique beauty store where I got to create my own signature scent (!)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just glad it wasn&#x27;t my purse as the smell took weeks to clear from my car.</li>
            <li>I loved the first one so much that I needed a second one.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s not a way to rinse out the travalo easily to avoid clashing scents when loading with a new scent.</li>
            <li>I bought this , filled it easily with my perfume, and then left it in my car to use while traveling.  </li>
            <li>hopefully they fulfill their promise and send a new one free of charge since i haven&#x27;t had it for 10 years or 10,000 uses according to their website.</li>
            <li>However, that&#x27;s a very minor inconvenience, and my wife is thrilled with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great if you want to carry different brands, you could get a different color for each fragrance!  </li>
            <li>I thought it must not hold very much liquid because I bought it at Xmas and maybe used it 5 times.</li>
            <li>I was pleased that it has not leaked at all and only</li>
            <li>so I can take it on several more trips.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I simply buy the larger bottle of my favorite scent and then use this refillable bottle to pump my favorite perfume into it.</li>
            <li>I decided to buy two more of these for myself in different colors.</li>
            <li>but im sure if i hadnt done that and used it on a regular snap off cap</li>
            <li>I filled it up completely and it didn&#x27;t do it again, so maybe that was the issue.</li>
            <li>first I was worried that it may leak.</li>
            <li>you so much!</li>
            <li>the Travalo that I filled 3/4 full had about 1/4 left inside.  </li>
            <li>only bought one in the retail store for my favorite perfume because I was convinced it wouldn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li>so it absorbed much of the spill, but</li>
            <li>I already own a couple of these and decided to purchase a pink one.</li>
            <li>When I tried to re-fill it a second time it started leaking all over the place from the top.</li>
            <li>I might buy more but in a different color.</li>
            <li>This product starts out ok but over time (not even 6 months later)</li>
            <li>- there was no leakage, either from the bottom or the top and the evaporation rate was low.  </li>
            <li>price and fast delivery !</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li>I cant afford to waste good perfume, and if I knew then what I know now</li>
            <li>Very handy for someone who travels and wants to bring a small amount of perfume with them.</li>
            <li>I was wrong, it is AMAZING!!  </li>
            <li>The bottle was easy to fill from a larger atomizer perfume bottle.  </li>
            <li>Just fill it from your large spray bottle.</li>
            <li>I bought 2 of the one of the model and one of the Travalo pure model and this one is garbage.</li>
            <li>Going to buy a few more for my friends!</li>
            <li>Easy to fill - has a window to see fluid level, fits well in a clutch - size of a lipstick, and seams very durable.</li>
            <li>It fills the reservoir and boom - you&#x27;re ready to go!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t appear to have leaked much in handbag.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping though.</li>
            <li>the color, the size and the very &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34; mist that the product sprays!&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>day.&lt;br /&gt;I filled it last night, put it in my cosmetics case and into my suitcase.</li>
            <li>Really bummed.</li>
            <li>If you travel a lot like I do (flight attendant)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cheap and not the same</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t want to buy a small expensive bottle of my favorite cologne just for travel, so this will work great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering more for my other scents and for my girlfriends so they can experience Travalo.  </li>
            <li>Buy a bigger handbag and tote around the full size perfume instead of wasting your money on this product.</li>
            <li>- just take the spray top off your cologne bottle, insert the end of the device, and push down repeatedly.  </li>
            <li>Half of it comes out the top and squirts all over my fingers when I spray it.  </li>
            <li>It lasts a decent time.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this cute pink travalo mini perfume bottle and recieved a gold capped clear body travalo mini perfume bottle.</li>
            <li>Its just better to buy a small empty spray bottle and fill it with your favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>My wife saw a similar item in SkyMall, on a recent trip, and I found this, nearly identical item, at Amazon at a much better deal.  </li>
            <li>The first time I took this on a trip, my whole cosmetic bag ended up being covered in perfume with no product left in the tube.</li>
            <li>im upset that i broke it, the perfume bottle i originally bought this for was unfortunately not a cap but one of those fancy types with little hose and the balloon pump, and i couldn&#x27;t take the cap off</li>
            <li>I saw this on YouTube recently and ordered it right away.</li>
            <li>Love this little guy!</li>
            <li>Everything was going fine at first, albeit slowly, and perfume was beginning to collect in the Travalo.</li>
            <li>This product only works with certain types of spray bottles.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your time/money on this go for the more expensive better looking model!</li>
            <li>It has a little hole in the bottom where you then take the top off your perfume bottle, but the straws or whatever they are called are all too big on all my perfumes!  </li>
            <li>I was really surprised at how well this product worked.</li>
            <li>easy to use, very little spill while you pump it out of your bottle.  </li>
            <li>No mess.</li>
            <li>this is not a true travalo brand and within two days it had leaked out the full canister into my purse.  </li>
            <li>only very little went in which is ok.</li>
            <li>This is the second Travalo mini spray perfume bottle that I&#x27;ve owned and I highly recommend them.  </li>
            <li>No way to open it and only certain perfume can be added to this thing.  </li>
            <li>Leaks while filling, can&#x27;t be filled few month later</li>
            <li>I bought the other model because it was pretty</li>
            <li>Also it&#x27;s filled with perfume, so a little leak goes a long way.</li>
            <li>The little window on the bottle lets you know when it is full, or getting low.</li>
            <li>It is very rare that I write negative review, but I don&#x27;t like it when they think they deceive people</li>
            <li>I just have to refill it more often because then there is less waste.</li>
            <li>Only complaint is that the spray stream is not straight/a fine spray.  </li>
            <li>Small but just right for the purse or car.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Its a good product but</li>
            <li> Surprisingly there have been products like this for years, they are called refillable atomizers (I always find out after I have bought the product).</li>

            <li> Works great, easy to fill.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing perfume holder of your favorite perfume!</li>
            <li> the pure model is great!</li>
            <li> It does not leak and it works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because this product is amazing</li>
            <li> so everything I own doesn&#x27;t end up smelling like perfume.</li>
            <li> Buy at your own risk.</li>
            <li> and I thought it would be nice for my perfume</li>
            <li> I received a set of these as a gift and was thrilled to have an option to travel with my fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love these and want to order more great gifts and stocking stuffers</li>
            <li> and I like having it in my purse for refreshing, cheerful, pick-me-up of a great smelling perfume during the day.</li>
            <li> Very easy to fill with perfume.</li>
            <li> It slips into the travel ziploc very easy in-between the 3 oz bottles.  </li>
            <li> VERY easy to do......</li>
            <li> This morning I went to get something out of my cosmetic case and was hit with the very strong scent of my perfume</li>
            <li> Oh, yes and so easy to fill!  </li>
            <li> I am okay with my purchase and now I can have my favorite perfume handy at all times.</li>
            <li> It was very easy to fill from my perfume bottle, and love the fact that there is no glass.  </li>
            <li> Like many users of this product, I would agree that it is very easy to fill.</li>
            <li> The Travalo is so easy to refill and has no screw-on top to leak!</li>
            <li> Just place on perfume after removing top and pump.</li>
            <li> Am so glad I have my favorite perfume with me in the Himalayas, and plan to buy for Christmas presents.  </li>
            <li> : the color is slightly more purple than it shows in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> I guess the product works OK.</li>
            <li> I thought I would be able to pour the perfume in here</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I decided to buy it</li>
            <li> Cute and compact .</li>
            <li> When the sprayer broke, I was left with just the plastic tube sticking out the top of the perfume bottle, making it perfect for use with this product.</li>
            <li> I saw this item on a YouTube channel (Gregory Gorgeous), and thought it was worth while.</li>
            <li> I love it, love it, love it.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> I just got this and love that I can carry my favorite perfume with me when I&#x27;m out.</li>
            <li> Just be sure your perfume bottle has a removable spray top.</li>
            <li> What an ingenious idea...</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted a purser for her favorite cologne</li>
            <li> Will buy more of them for her.</li>
            <li> Bought more for gift-giving.</li>
            <li> I purchased one for each of my favorite perfumes.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume doesn&#x27;t come in a rollerball to carry around with me in my purse or for travel</li>
            <li> This has been incredibly durable so far and no leakages.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so cute, pretty and a good size for purses,</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t leak which is fantastic and they are very easy to fill.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and perfect for toting around extra smell</li>
            <li> Very well made &amp; incredibly handy!</li>
            <li> Mine didn&#x27;t leak and was so quick and easy to use, you&#x27;ll LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I filled with my favorite spray perfume and</li>
            <li> This handy gadget has made bringing my favorite perfume on airplanes so much easier!</li>
            <li> the top was securely on</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s the best money I&#x27;ve spent in a while.</li>
            <li> This is a brilliant idea that actually works.</li>
            <li> And it is so cool and easy to refill!</li>
            <li> My wife has filled it up with her favorite perfume, and it works fine.  </li>
            <li> Be sure you check to see if the plastic pump part is accessible before purchasing.</li>
            <li> Easy to fill with perfume.  </li>
            <li> Easy to fill, no leaking as of yet.</li>
            <li> Extremely easy to use</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an easy solution.&lt;br /&gt;The convenience of it outweighs the cons.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to pump and fill up</li>
            <li> Easy to fill .</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as easy to fill as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Easy to fill</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to fill.</li>
            <li> However, it leaks and you lose product (e.g, perfume) very quickly.</li>
            <li> The Spray Mini is easy to fill, does not leak (I carried it on a trans-Atlantic flight), and is an unobtrusive size for one&#x27;s purse.</li>
            <li> I like how easy it is to use, and how portable it is.</li>
            <li> and it was easy and it does not leak.</li>
            <li> Although I loved the perfume dispenser it was not the bright pink color as shown in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> worked fine</li>
            <li> I bought one of these in a store and it worked fine.  </li>
            <li> it worked great until suddenly</li>
            <li> It is tiny, you can take it in your purse, it doesn&#x27;t leak and it works great.</li>
            <li> But I got enough in to be happy.</li>
            <li> At time of writing this review Ive had in about a month and filled it twice and maybe sprayed it 5</li>
            <li> I filled it up once</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cheap knock off.</li>
            <li> Cheap and will leak.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be cheap.  </li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t available.</li>
            <li> i filled it up an tossed it to the end of my bed to remember to take to put in my purse..</li>
            <li> I loved it and ordered a couple more for personal use as well as gifts for others.</li>
            <li> Was easy to fill, fits perfectly in my purse and looks pretty in pink.</li>
            <li> Came in very handy on my trip, didn&#x27;t want to carry around the big bottle.</li>
            <li> so it was easy and quick.</li>
            <li> Innovative, easy, fast way to fill your purse spray.</li>
            <li> I know the original box from store.</li>
            <li> but it was all worth it!</li>
            <li> I plan to order more in different colors for my favorite colognes!</li>
            <li> It is still mostly full</li>
            <li> The window on the side allows you to gauge how full it is, so overfilling it is never or shouldn&#x27;t be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray nozzle of this product is robust and is well made.  </li>
            <li> This is really cool...</li>
            <li> Really cool gift idea.</li>
            <li> It good if you use the same perfume.</li>
            <li> and it was okay - noticed that it seemed to be emptying out fast.</li>
            <li> very small, perfect for travel.  </li>
            <li> She had no idea there were such things as mini perfume bottles that you could fill with your own perfume, and since she often asks for small roller balls as gifts, she loved that she could just choose any one of her favorite perfumes and have it with her anywhere!</li>
            <li> Luckily the cosmetic case was one of those quilted ones</li>
            <li> I liked the cute pink one the one I got</li>
            <li> I love mine and highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Very pretty color.  </li>
            <li> They fill up easily and something that goes straight through security without issue.</li>
            <li> Love the idea - and one of the two I ordered worked really well - but one seems to be leaking, though I can&#x27;t tell how or from where exactly.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> Holds a lot while being nice and tiny for the purse or makeup bag.</li>
            <li> For my bachelorette my sister took me to a boutique beauty store where I got to create my own signature scent (!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just glad it wasn&#x27;t my purse as the smell took weeks to clear from my car.</li>
            <li> I loved the first one so much that I needed a second one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s not a way to rinse out the travalo easily to avoid clashing scents when loading with a new scent.</li>
            <li> I bought this , filled it easily with my perfume, and then left it in my car to use while traveling.  </li>
            <li> hopefully they fulfill their promise and send a new one free of charge since i haven&#x27;t had it for 10 years or 10,000 uses according to their website.</li>
            <li> However, that&#x27;s a very minor inconvenience, and my wife is thrilled with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great if you want to carry different brands, you could get a different color for each fragrance!  </li>
            <li> I thought it must not hold very much liquid because I bought it at Xmas and maybe used it 5 times.</li>
            <li> I was pleased that it has not leaked at all and only</li>
            <li> so I can take it on several more trips.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I simply buy the larger bottle of my favorite scent and then use this refillable bottle to pump my favorite perfume into it.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy two more of these for myself in different colors.</li>
            <li> but im sure if i hadnt done that and used it on a regular snap off cap</li>
            <li> I filled it up completely and it didn&#x27;t do it again, so maybe that was the issue.</li>
            <li> first I was worried that it may leak.</li>
            <li> you so much!</li>
            <li> the Travalo that I filled 3/4 full had about 1/4 left inside.  </li>
            <li> only bought one in the retail store for my favorite perfume because I was convinced it wouldn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> so it absorbed much of the spill, but</li>
            <li> I already own a couple of these and decided to purchase a pink one.</li>
            <li> When I tried to re-fill it a second time it started leaking all over the place from the top.</li>
            <li> I might buy more but in a different color.</li>
            <li> This product starts out ok but over time (not even 6 months later)</li>
            <li> - there was no leakage, either from the bottom or the top and the evaporation rate was low.  </li>
            <li> price and fast delivery !</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> I cant afford to waste good perfume, and if I knew then what I know now</li>
            <li> Very handy for someone who travels and wants to bring a small amount of perfume with them.</li>
            <li> I was wrong, it is AMAZING!!  </li>
            <li> The bottle was easy to fill from a larger atomizer perfume bottle.  </li>
            <li> Just fill it from your large spray bottle.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of the one of the model and one of the Travalo pure model and this one is garbage.</li>
            <li> Going to buy a few more for my friends!</li>
            <li> Easy to fill - has a window to see fluid level, fits well in a clutch - size of a lipstick, and seams very durable.</li>
            <li> It fills the reservoir and boom - you&#x27;re ready to go!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t appear to have leaked much in handbag.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping though.</li>
            <li> the color, the size and the very &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34; mist that the product sprays!&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> day.&lt;br /&gt;I filled it last night, put it in my cosmetics case and into my suitcase.</li>
            <li> Really bummed.</li>
            <li> If you travel a lot like I do (flight attendant)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cheap and not the same</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t want to buy a small expensive bottle of my favorite cologne just for travel, so this will work great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering more for my other scents and for my girlfriends so they can experience Travalo.  </li>
            <li> Buy a bigger handbag and tote around the full size perfume instead of wasting your money on this product.</li>
            <li> - just take the spray top off your cologne bottle, insert the end of the device, and push down repeatedly.  </li>
            <li> Half of it comes out the top and squirts all over my fingers when I spray it.  </li>
            <li> It lasts a decent time.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this cute pink travalo mini perfume bottle and recieved a gold capped clear body travalo mini perfume bottle.</li>
            <li> Its just better to buy a small empty spray bottle and fill it with your favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> My wife saw a similar item in SkyMall, on a recent trip, and I found this, nearly identical item, at Amazon at a much better deal.  </li>
            <li> The first time I took this on a trip, my whole cosmetic bag ended up being covered in perfume with no product left in the tube.</li>
            <li> im upset that i broke it, the perfume bottle i originally bought this for was unfortunately not a cap but one of those fancy types with little hose and the balloon pump, and i couldn&#x27;t take the cap off</li>
            <li> I saw this on YouTube recently and ordered it right away.</li>
            <li> Love this little guy!</li>
            <li> Everything was going fine at first, albeit slowly, and perfume was beginning to collect in the Travalo.</li>
            <li> This product only works with certain types of spray bottles.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time/money on this go for the more expensive better looking model!</li>
            <li> It has a little hole in the bottom where you then take the top off your perfume bottle, but the straws or whatever they are called are all too big on all my perfumes!  </li>
            <li> I was really surprised at how well this product worked.</li>
            <li> easy to use, very little spill while you pump it out of your bottle.  </li>
            <li> No mess.</li>
            <li> this is not a true travalo brand and within two days it had leaked out the full canister into my purse.  </li>
            <li> only very little went in which is ok.</li>
            <li> This is the second Travalo mini spray perfume bottle that I&#x27;ve owned and I highly recommend them.  </li>
            <li> No way to open it and only certain perfume can be added to this thing.  </li>
            <li> Leaks while filling, can&#x27;t be filled few month later</li>
            <li> I bought the other model because it was pretty</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s filled with perfume, so a little leak goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The little window on the bottle lets you know when it is full, or getting low.</li>
            <li> It is very rare that I write negative review, but I don&#x27;t like it when they think they deceive people</li>
            <li> I just have to refill it more often because then there is less waste.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that the spray stream is not straight/a fine spray.  </li>
            <li> Small but just right for the purse or car.  </li>
            <li> Luckily I only put linen spray in it now now my tote bag smells nice, but my expensive linen spray has been wasted.</li>
            <li> The only down side is that there&#x27;s no way to rinse it out between different types of perfume, short of filling it with water, and cleaning it that way.  </li>
            <li> everywhere you can buy not the same but very similar less than 10 $ i saw similar at nordstorm.com with 20 saudi Riyal , guess its 5 or 6 $ !</li>
            <li> I was really excited about the Travalo because I had an expensive bottle of perfume, and the little silver sprayer had broken off the top of it</li>
            <li> When I received the item it was slightly smaller than expected (about the length of your pinky finger).</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t get the bottle open any other way.</li>
            <li> I travel frequently and have broken many large perfume bottles in my travels, so lately I have not taken any perfume with me because it is expensive</li>
            <li> I carry on luggage every week so you can easily be limited by the 1QT plastic bag.  </li>
            <li> when i went to pick it up the next morning half had leaked onto my bed....</li>
            <li> I like the compact size and the sprayer works well with only a little in the bottle.</li>
            <li> a few weeks later went from Texas to Europe.  </li>
            <li> 2 units one gold, one pink, sold by Zehui.</li>
            <li> Gives you an opportunity to use the perfume out of that big bottle that&#x27;s sitting at home.&lt;br /&gt;Occasionally, this product will have some trouble with stubborn perfume bottle nozzle.</li>
            <li> then i expected it to be and doesn&#x27;t work for all perfumes plus i guarantee it will leak during the time you have it.</li>
            <li> To fill it up, it takes about 25/30 pumps and to empty</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious if it&#x27;s because of air in the bottle.</li>
            <li> The only downside is the pink is darker than the picture shown it&#x27;s not a light pink.</li>
            <li> pink refillable spray mini perfume bottle  </li>
            <li> Product is arrived as expected based on the description.</li>
            <li> a small amount of it disappeared which was due to usage on the trip - not due to leaking.  </li>
            <li> Such a neat little invention!</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re not sure how big it is.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews that warned against using mid-flight as it causes the container to leak</li>
            <li> and I know they assume people will be lazy to send it back.</li>
            <li> Small enough for your purse or even a clutch.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this so that I can stop having to carry around a ridiculously large bottle of perfume to reapply throughout the day, but I was very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Weeks later I went to use it and my glove compartment smelled thickly of perfume..and my Travelo was empty...</li>
            <li> Within one week of use,(it was almost empty) it began to spay in a stream (not a mist but something like a little water hose).</li>
            <li> I was not able to figure out how to get it apart to fill - not what was expected when purchased.</li>
            <li> However the packaging is NOT original Travalo packaging, it is a black box they made with no Travalo sign on it.</li>
            <li> Took a little longer to get here</li>
            <li> , there&#x27;s still a little bit perfume in it</li>
            <li> Totally waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> i like it and its very useful but its very expensive !</li>
            <li> am really not sure why another reviewer had a problem with their perfume leaking out within a few days</li>
            <li> travalo got a small dent almost immediately after I put it in my purse.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I got a defective one</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> ; What&#x27;s worse than the money wasted on these is that my fragrance was wasted as well.</li>
            <li> Too late to return now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about the size of a small pack of gum(Like DOUBLEMINT or Juicy Fruit!).</li>
            <li> I end up with a mess in  my handbag and the loss of expensive perfume.....</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perfume does not leak from this item (or at least I&#x27;ve never experienced it in the 5 years I&#x27;ve used them) and it does not seem to evaporate at all from the container.  </li>
            <li> This product leaked out all of my expensive perfume within a few days.</li>
            <li> Poorly made.</li>
            <li> so I tried to spray it, then sadly, it&#x27;s totally broken</li>
            <li> and it was difficult to refill without leaking and</li>
            <li> Therefore, this product was completely useless.</li>
            <li> not real happy... disappointed..</li>
            <li> My biggest disappointment is that the picture appears to have glass surrounded by metal.  </li>
            <li> Useless!  </li>
            <li> perfume all over myself and my bag :(  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product was TERRIBLE!</li>
            <li> This travel perfume sprayer is terrible.</li>
            <li> Awful, awful product - stay away!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very pretty color.  Perfect size.  Easy to fill with perfume.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Very easy to fill with perfume. Just place on perfume after removing top and pump. Very simple. Great purchase. No problems.</li>
            <li> I loved it! It: pumped from the bottom so it was easy and quick. It also sprayed just enough perfume. Only problem is that it&#x27;s smaller than I though it was. So if you&#x27;re not sure how big it is. It&#x27;s about the size of a small pack of gum(Like DOUBLEMINT or Juicy Fruit!).</li>
            <li> I purchased this at a travel store (so sadly paid more for it than if I had purchased at Amazon).  I filled with my favorite spray perfume and a few weeks later went from Texas to Europe.  I read other reviews that warned against using mid-flight as it causes the container to leak so I didn&#x27;t use it until we reached our destination.  I was pleased that it has not leaked at all and only a small amount of it disappeared which was due to usage on the trip - not due to leaking.  It is still mostly full so I can take it on several more trips.&lt;br /&gt;I am really not sure why another reviewer had a problem with their perfume leaking out within a few days - I didn&#x27;t have this problem at all.  I would highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t figure out how to open it and it did not come with instructions</li>
            <li> The bottle was easy to fill from a larger atomizer perfume bottle.  My biggest disappointment is that the picture appears to have glass surrounded by metal.  The one I received is all glass so my concern will be breakage while travelling.  Time will tell.  Oh well as a former art professor used to say &amp;#34;A picture is only 5% correct.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> it worked great until suddenly it didn&#x27;t.  i kept great care of it, and about 3 months in it leaked when i opened the cap one time to use it. perfume all over myself and my bag :(  hopefully they fulfill their promise and send a new one free of charge since i haven&#x27;t had it for 10 years or 10,000 uses according to their website.</li>
            <li> Easy to fill, no leaking as of yet. I ordered another one!</li>
            <li> The travalo is a great idea. Very handy for someone who travels and wants to bring a small amount of perfume with them. However, mine leaks. Not a lot of liquid, but enough. Also it&#x27;s filled with perfume, so a little leak goes a long way. I&#x27;ve taken to putting mine in a ziplock bag when I take it places so everything I own doesn&#x27;t end up smelling like perfume.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so cute, pretty and a good size for purses, pockets whatever I want to throw my fav perfume in and carry with me.  Oh, yes and so easy to fill!  I had no problems.  Innovative, easy, fast way to fill your purse spray.</li>
            <li> Really great way to travel with perfume.  I carry on luggage every week so you can easily be limited by the 1QT plastic bag.  I bought 2 of these so I could have some options on the road.  They don&#x27;t leak which is fantastic and they are very easy to fill.  Only complaint is that the spray stream is not straight/a fine spray.  It does the job but not the same as the spray from a perfume bottle.</li>
            <li> This is the second Travalo mini spray perfume bottle that I&#x27;ve owned and I highly recommend them.  Best aspect about this item is ease of fill and no wastage of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfume does not leak from this item (or at least I&#x27;ve never experienced it in the 5 years I&#x27;ve used them) and it does not seem to evaporate at all from the container.  The window on the side allows you to gauge how full it is, so overfilling it is never or shouldn&#x27;t be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray nozzle of this product is robust and is well made.  All in all this is a great product, a wonderful invention for traveling and a must have.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife this Christmas and she loves it!  Easy to fill - has a window to see fluid level, fits well in a clutch - size of a lipstick, and seams very durable.</li>
            <li> This is really cool... very small, perfect for travel.  Extremely easy to use - just take the spray top off your cologne bottle, insert the end of the device, and push down repeatedly.  It fills the reservoir and boom - you&#x27;re ready to go!&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t want to buy a small expensive bottle of my favorite cologne just for travel, so this will work great!</li>
            <li> The Travalo mini perfume bottle is perfect for long-distance travel as it is light and durable.  It was very easy to fill from my perfume bottle, and love the fact that there is no glass.  It slips into the travel ziploc very easy in-between the 3 oz bottles.  Am so glad I have my favorite perfume with me in the Himalayas, and plan to buy for Christmas presents.  Great product.</li>
            <li> 2 units one gold, one pink, sold by Zehui. Arrived from Singapore with out retail packaging and instructions. These were to be gifts. I had to prepare instructions and package them to make them presentable as a gift.</li>
            <li> I travel frequently and have broken many large perfume bottles in my travels, so lately I have not taken any perfume with me because it is expensive and I don&#x27;t want to keep replacing or having to find perfumes that are no longer being made.  I saw this Travalo spray bottle in an in-flight magazine and tore out the page to check it out when I got home.  I decided to order from amazon.com rather than the Travalo site as it was cheaper, and now that I have gotten it, I wish I had known about it years before.  It is tiny, you can take it in your purse, it doesn&#x27;t leak and it works great.</li>
            <li> Really cool gift idea. They work well.</li>
            <li> Love this little guy! Easy to use and perfect for toting around extra smell goods.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: the color is slightly more purple than it shows in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;You have to hold the travalo perfectly straight when loading or you will waste perfume. Both the perfume bottle and the travalo have to be level.&lt;br /&gt;My travalo got a small dent almost immediately after I put it in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s not a way to rinse out the travalo easily to avoid clashing scents when loading with a new scent. You can use a spray bottle from the travel section at the grocery store to load water into your travalo and then spray it all out and repeat several times... But like I said... It&#x27;s not an easy solution.&lt;br /&gt;The convenience of it outweighs the cons. I love mine and highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> My travalo simply BROKE when I tried to fill it!!! It leaked all over the place and then simply dismantled!!</li>
            <li> This refillable aerator has allowed me to save money by not having to replace my roll-on perfume. I simply buy the larger bottle of my favorite scent and then use this refillable bottle to pump my favorite perfume into it. I carry this in my purse, so if I forget to apply my perfume or I need a touch up, I just pull it out and apply it! It does not leak and it works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> This product was TERRIBLE! I didn&#x27;t even get to finish pumping the perfume into it before it started leaking! When I tried to spray it, it came out as a stream (not a spray) about two times and then stopped coming out except as an ooze. I DO NOT recommend this product. Buy at your own risk.</li>
            <li> This travel perfume sprayer is terrible. It leaked perfume all over my purse. Poorly made. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I guess the product works OK. I haven&#x27;t used it enough to try. However the packaging is NOT original Travalo packaging, it is a black box they made with no Travalo sign on it. I know the original box from store. i ordered one to give as a gift and this box can not be a gift. It is very rare that I write negative review, but I don&#x27;t like it when they think they deceive people and I know they assume people will be lazy to send it back.</li>
            <li> This handy gadget has made bringing my favorite perfume on airplanes so much easier! It&#x27;s also great if you want to carry different brands, you could get a different color for each fragrance!  I find it very easy to fill! Great product!  I have bought them for many family members as gifts &amp; it will probably be my gift of choice for all my girlfriends this coming Christmas!</li>
            <li> i like it and its very useful but its very expensive ! everywhere you can buy not the same but very similar less than 10 $ i saw similar at nordstorm.com with 20 saudi Riyal , guess its 5 or 6 $ !</li>
            <li> Great for carrying in your purse. Gives you an opportunity to use the perfume out of that big bottle that&#x27;s sitting at home.&lt;br /&gt;Occasionally, this product will have some trouble with stubborn perfume bottle nozzle.</li>
            <li> I have used for about a week and it was difficult to refill without leaking and only very little went in which is ok. I just have to refill it more often because then there is less waste. I like the compact size and the sprayer works well with only a little in the bottle. Didn&#x27;t appear to have leaked much in handbag. I am okay with my purchase and now I can have my favorite perfume handy at all times.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product! Took a little longer to get here but it was all worth it! Perfect gift idea.</li>
            <li> This product only works with certain types of spray bottles. Be sure you check to see if the plastic pump part is accessible before purchasing.</li>
            <li> No way to open it and only certain perfume can be added to this thing.  I can&#x27;t use it.  I thought I would be able to pour the perfume in here but you can&#x27;t open it!  It has a little hole in the bottom where you then take the top off your perfume bottle, but the straws or whatever they are called are all too big on all my perfumes!  Useless!  Fast shipping though.</li>
            <li> I love this thing!  Holds a lot while being nice and tiny for the purse or makeup bag.</li>
            <li> perfume leaked out in my purse.. the top was securely on so I don&#x27;t know why or how that happened.</li>
            <li> these things are an awesome space saver. I purchased a couple for my brides maids, and am going to but a good perfume in them.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. No spills. No leaks. No mess. It&#x27;s easy to pump and fill up and I carry this thing around with me everywhere! I&#x27;m so glad I decided to buy it, it&#x27;s the best money I&#x27;ve spent in a while. I decided to buy two more of these for myself in different colors. Travalo&#x27;s are just perfect. Wish I would&#x27;ve known about them sooner!</li>
            <li> Broke it trying to figure out how to refill the tube.</li>
            <li> I bought this to keep in my purse and it leaks all on my purse I dont recommend this product</li>
            <li> Although I loved the perfume dispenser it was not the bright pink color as shown in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;It worked fine but I ordered it for  you for a reason.</li>
            <li> Its a good product but im upset that i broke it, the perfume bottle i originally bought this for was unfortunately not a cap but one of those fancy types with little hose and the balloon pump, and i couldn&#x27;t take the cap off so i tried to open it to pour it in, and therefor breaking the cap:/ So yea but im sure if i hadnt done that and used it on a regular snap off cap it wouldve worked perfectly</li>
            <li> I bought one of these in a store and it worked fine.  The one I received from amazon would not fill with perfume.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Came in very handy on my trip, didn&#x27;t want to carry around the big bottle. Was easy to fill, fits perfectly in my purse and looks pretty in pink.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Cute and compact . Easy to fill . Going to buy a few more for my friends!</li>
            <li> It good if you use the same perfume. This one doesn&#x27;t leak as my red one.</li>
            <li> I only had the travalo for 3 days and it broke while I was adding perfume into it. Everything leaked out and a piece came off which didn&#x27;t allow me to use it anymore.</li>
            <li> This leaked all over my purse.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about the Travalo because I had an expensive bottle of perfume, and the little silver sprayer had broken off the top of it and I couldn&#x27;t get the bottle open any other way. When the sprayer broke, I was left with just the plastic tube sticking out the top of the perfume bottle, making it perfect for use with this product. (You press the bottom of the Travalo against the plastic tube on the perfume bottle.) Everything was going fine at first, albeit slowly, and perfume was beginning to collect in the Travalo. Then, suddenly, perfume was everywhere. There is a tiny piece of rubber inside the bottom of the Travalo, where you connect it to the perfume, and this piece of rubber keeps perfume from spilling out once it is in the bottle. This came out, causing the perfume to spill out everywhere. I tried to put it back in, but once it broke, it wouldn&#x27;t stay.</li>
            <li> This product was so much smaller then i expected it to be and doesn&#x27;t work for all perfumes plus i guarantee it will leak during the time you have it. Its just better to buy a small empty spray bottle and fill it with your favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> bueno, practico, c&amp;oacute;modo, econ&amp;oacute;mico y el mejor invento del mundo despu&amp;eacute;s de las bombillas... jajaja es en serio!!! se los recomiendo!!!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this so that I can stop having to carry around a ridiculously large bottle of perfume to reapply throughout the day, but I was very disappointed with this product. I&#x27;m not sure if I got a defective one but this did not work on any of my perfumes. I thought maybe the nozzle was too short so I tried it on several different ones and nothing happened.</li>
            <li> I saw this item on a YouTube channel (Gregory Gorgeous), and thought it was worth while. Surprisingly there have been products like this for years, they are called refillable atomizers (I always find out after I have bought the product). When I received the item it was slightly smaller than expected (about the length of your pinky finger). I like the Travalo. To fill it up, it takes about 25/30 pumps and to empty it take about 50 sprays. Within one week of use,(it was almost empty) it began to spay in a stream (not a mist but something like a little water hose). I filled it up completely and it didn&#x27;t do it again, so maybe that was the issue.</li>
            <li> I love it, love it, love it.&lt;br /&gt;Love the color, the size and the very &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34; mist that the product sprays!&lt;br /&gt;At first I was worried that it may leak. I started by putting it in a regular pocketbook... since I didn&#x27;t want it to leak and bag be ruined. But rest assured, NO LEAKS... WHATSOEVER. I carry it in my Louis Vuitton bag without an ounce of worry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I just got this and love that I can carry my favorite perfume with me when I&#x27;m out. It wasn&#x27;t as easy to fill as I thought it would be. It took a lot of \\&quot;pumping\\&quot; and I couldn&#x27;t get it to fill ALL the way up. I&#x27;m curious if it&#x27;s because of air in the bottle. But I got enough in to be happy. I also love the color!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing perfume holder of your favorite perfume! Small enough for your purse or even a clutch. Just fill it from your large spray bottle. VERY easy to do...... Instructions included.</li>
            <li> I received it on time and it was package well. However, when I followed the directions to put my perfume in the mini perfume bottle, no perfume actually went into the bottle. Rather, I got perfume on my hands, and everywhere else. Therefore, this product was completely useless.</li>
            <li> It seemed like the perfect gift to give at Christmas, then I decided to buy one for myself too.  I wish I had nicer things to say about the product but I will be as objective as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to use, very little spill while you pump it out of your bottle.  Had no complaints but after 2 weeks it needed to be refilled again.  I thought it must not hold very much liquid because I bought it at Xmas and maybe used it 5 times. At time of writing this review Ive had in about a month and filled it twice and maybe sprayed it 5 times.&lt;br /&gt;2nd time I refilled it I noticed the bottom was leaking the perfume.  I would dab it and look 10 min later and another drop had leaked out.  I finally left it alone and by the next morning the Travalo that I filled 3/4 full had about 1/4 left inside.  I cant afford to waste good perfume, and if I knew then what I know now I would never have given them as gifts.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with my purchase! Have used refillable spray perfume bottles for years.&lt;br /&gt;Always a pain to refill and often leaked. The Travalo is so easy to refill and has no screw-on top to leak! The little window on the bottle lets you know when it is full, or getting low. I plan to order more in different colors for my favorite colognes! Just be sure your perfume bottle has a removable spray top.</li>
            <li> What an ingenious idea...only bought one in the retail store for my favorite perfume because I was convinced it wouldn&#x27;t work for me.  I was wrong, it is AMAZING!!  I&#x27;m ordering more for my other scents and for my girlfriends so they can experience Travalo.  Mine didn&#x27;t leak and was so quick and easy to use, you&#x27;ll LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Small but just right for the purse or car.  Easy to fill but you must pump perfume bottle while filing.  It lasts a decent time.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item to take to my destination wedding. For my bachelorette my sister took me to a boutique beauty store where I got to create my own signature scent (!) but it only came in a big bottle so I definitely needed an atomizer so I could take it with me to wear it on the big day.&lt;br /&gt;I filled it last night, put it in my cosmetics case and into my suitcase. This morning I went to get something out of my cosmetic case and was hit with the very strong scent of my perfume - the atomizer had leaked almost all of the perfume! Luckily the cosmetic case was one of those quilted ones so it absorbed much of the spill, but all of my makeup, brushes, etc. are all oily. Awful, awful product - stay away!</li>
            <li> I already own a couple of these and decided to purchase a pink one. I filled it up once and it was okay - noticed that it seemed to be emptying out fast. When I tried to re-fill it a second time it started leaking all over the place from the top. Really bummed. Too late to return now.</li>
            <li> Such a neat little invention! I keep it in my purse or in my backpack whatever I have for the day. The only downside is the pink is darker than the picture shown it&#x27;s not a light pink.</li>
            <li> I was not able to figure out how to get it apart to fill - not what was expected when purchased.</li>
            <li> I have 4 big bottles of perfume and they are to big for my purse so I bought this  Travalo  pink refillable spray mini perfume bottle  I might buy more but in a different color. It makes it  easer to carry in my purse.</li>
            <li> Leaks while filling, can&#x27;t be filled few month later actually this is only the third time I fill it. Totally waste of money.  updated on 3/8/2015, I&#x27;m doing spring cleaning today, and found this in my perfume drawer, there&#x27;s still a little bit perfume in it so I tried to spray it, then sadly, it&#x27;s totally broken I can&#x27;t spray anything out at all,  DON&#x27;T buy it!</li>
            <li> IT LEAKS!!! I bought 2 of the one of the model and one of the Travalo pure model and this one is garbage. Luckily I only put linen spray in it now now my tote bag smells nice, but my expensive linen spray has been wasted. I bought the other model because it was pretty and I thought it would be nice for my perfume thank God I did! If you travel a lot like I do (flight attendant) the pure model is great! Don&#x27;t waste your time/money on this go for the more expensive better looking model!</li>
            <li> This is a brilliant idea that actually works. It&#x27;s easy to fill. It&#x27;s perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> I bought this , filled it easily with my perfume, and then left it in my car to use while traveling.  Weeks later I went to use it and my glove compartment smelled thickly of perfume..and my Travelo was empty...This did not work as stated..leaky and unreliable..I&#x27;m just glad it wasn&#x27;t my purse as the smell took weeks to clear from my car.</li>
            <li> My Wife was looking for something she could travel with. I was really surprised at how well this product worked. The quality was great and she has not had any issues at all with them. They fill up easily and something that goes straight through security without issue. I went back and bought one each for my daughters and myself as well. Good product that meets the need.</li>
            <li> This product starts out ok but over time (not even 6 months later) it leaks.  I have 3 others which I purchased and they all do the same thing.  I end up with a mess in  my handbag and the loss of expensive perfume.....Buy a bigger handbag and tote around the full size perfume instead of wasting your money on this product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. It&#x27;s a cheap knock off. It&#x27;s not even in any proper packaging. Cheap and will leak.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought three travalos from perfume stores in the mall before, and all were great - there was no leakage, either from the bottom or the top and the evaporation rate was low.  I wanted to save a trip to the mall so I purchased here from Camrose Trading...and did not receive the same product.  this is not a true travalo brand and within two days it had leaked out the full canister into my purse.  Half of it comes out the top and squirts all over my fingers when I spray it.  it&#x27;s cheap and not the same product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be cheap.  Buy from the perfume stores!</li>
            <li> My wife saw a similar item in SkyMall, on a recent trip, and I found this, nearly identical item, at Amazon at a much better deal.  My wife has filled it up with her favorite perfume, and it works fine.  The only down side is that there&#x27;s no way to rinse it out between different types of perfume, short of filling it with water, and cleaning it that way.  However, that&#x27;s a very minor inconvenience, and my wife is thrilled with it.</li>
            <li> I received a set of these as a gift and was thrilled to have an option to travel with my fragrance. I noticed that shortly after filling the Travalo, it would leak in my bag. Basically, everything in my bag smelled wonderful because it was doused in my perfume. The second in the set was not as obvious, but when I went to use the perfume, there was none there. When I noticed this, I contacted Travalo. Twice. No response despite having a &amp;#34;warranty.&amp;#34; What&#x27;s worse than the money wasted on these is that my fragrance was wasted as well. Save your money!!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful! Bought one for me &amp; my Mom. Very well made &amp; incredibly handy! I would recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> I gave two as gifts and kept one for myself! My daughter wanted a purser for her favorite cologne but it wasn&#x27;t available. This was my answer!</li>
            <li> A friend had given me one of these Travalo Mini Perfume bottles as a gift. I loved it and ordered a couple more for personal use as well as gifts for others. It is terrific for travelers and bottle held enough spray to carry me through 3weeks of vacation. Great product!</li>
            <li> Product was just as promised. Works wonderful and is easy to fill and doesn&#x27;t leak. I would definately purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love the idea - and one of the two I ordered worked really well - but one seems to be leaking, though I can&#x27;t tell how or from where exactly.</li>
            <li> Like many users of this product, I would agree that it is very easy to fill. However, it leaks and you lose product (e.g, perfume) very quickly. The first time I took this on a trip, my whole cosmetic bag ended up being covered in perfume with no product left in the tube. Waste of money!</li>
            <li> The Spray Mini is easy to fill, does not leak (I carried it on a trans-Atlantic flight), and is an unobtrusive size for one&#x27;s purse.</li>
            <li> Spend the extra money and order this product from the actual Travalo website. This product leaked out all of my expensive perfume within a few days.</li>
            <li> I gave this product as a gift to my mother and she loved it! She had no idea there were such things as mini perfume bottles that you could fill with your own perfume, and since she often asks for small roller balls as gifts, she loved that she could just choose any one of her favorite perfumes and have it with her anywhere! This was a big hit with her!</li>
            <li> Product is a great concept, but it leaks, which really sucks if you have expensive perfume in it.</li>
            <li> Perfect to have in your purse .good price and fast delivery !</li>
            <li> i got one of these for xmas and loved it.. so i ordered another one same brand and everything... i filled it up an tossed it to the end of my bed to remember to take to put in my purse.. when i went to pick it up the next morning half had leaked onto my bed.... not real happy... disappointed..</li>
            <li> I saw this on YouTube recently and ordered it right away. It&#x27;s exactly as shown, excellent quality. Perfect for on the go. Works great, easy to fill. Lasts forever.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because this product is amazing and I love it! I like how easy it is to use, and how portable it is. I dislike that you can only use one size of bottle though. I ordered this product about a month ago, and I love it! I would defiantly recommend this to friends, and in fact, I have!</li>
            <li> I ordered this cute pink travalo mini perfume bottle and recieved a gold capped clear body travalo mini perfume bottle. It will work great so there is no issue in usage it&#x27;s just not what I ordered. I liked the cute pink one the one I got has travalo written all over it.</li>
            <li> This item is great gift, My wife has a favorite perfume and put it in the travalo and it was easy and it does not leak. Will buy more of them for her.</li>
            <li> Great product. Easy to use, no leakage, perfect design. Bought more for gift-giving. My local Sephora lets me &amp;#34;sample&amp;#34; 3 pumps of fragrance per purchase.</li>
            <li> Product is arrived as expected based on the description.</li>
            <li> This is my second Travalo refillable perfume bottle.  I loved the first one so much that I needed a second one.  I travel often and am away for a month at a time. This is the perfect travel mate.</li>
            <li> I love these and want to order more great gifts and stocking stuffers</li>
            <li> This atomizer is the perfect size and refills so easily.  I purchased one for each of my favorite perfumes. So handy!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for and I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with my purchase.  My favorite perfume doesn&#x27;t come in a rollerball to carry around with me in my purse or for travel so I was looking for a way to take my perfume with me.  This is the perfect solution.  It fits about 10 sprays of perfume which enough for a 10 day trip for me and I like having it in my purse for refreshing, cheerful, pick-me-up of a great smelling perfume during the day. This has been incredibly durable so far and no leakages. And it is so cool and easy to refill! I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product!</li>
            <li> The price on these can&#x27;t be beat.  Packaged well and just like the one&#x27;s you would buy in the store only cheaper.</li>
