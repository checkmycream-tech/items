            <li> great product and love the bows!  I have red nails with white bows for Christmas. And they are not too cutesie.</li>
            <li> I was amaze at this product.It was just as they describe it.All the details it had were used on the nails.I will totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This was my first konad plate and I love it!  It&#x27;s adorable and the only image I had trouble with was the double-heart (at the bottom).</li>

            <li> The m59 is a great plate to use if you want to over lap designs . Its very cute and girly with its hearts and bows. All in all a good plate also it is a real konad plate . if you want to check on the plates before you order them and after you get them you can go on [...]</li>
            <li> This is a great stamping plate. Bought this one for the snowflakes! They always turn out great. I use these in my salon for quick nail art! You can use them with normal polish or the Konad polish(recomended)!!</li>
            <li> THE PATTERNS IN THIS PLATE ALMOST SEEMS TO BE FITTED FOR A CHILD. MOST PLATES HAVE NICE PATTERNS. I WILL SUGGEST BUYING A DIFFERENT BRAND IF YOU HAVE SLIGHLY LARGER NAILS THAN AVERAGE. FOR NOW I AM USING ONLY THE PATTERNS THAT DO NOT REQUIRE YOUR ENTIRE NAIL.</li>
            <li> Love it it works great all the images work and it works with different polish not only konad which is great</li>
            <li> I love these designs, they look great! I think I&#x27;ll use them during the holidays too. Can&#x27;t wait to see them in a variety of colors.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this purchase. The seller is great, I got everything I ordered:) Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;I have some Konad plates which aren&#x27;t as good as this one...I am writing about the print quality, this one is great!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this Konad plate!!!! I bought it for the polka dot bow, but love the solid bow and the hearts on it. . I am not so keen of the snowflake shapes on here and wish there had been a polka dot pattern or another type of bow &amp; ribbon on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Konad always makes quality stamping plates and this one was no exception. The polish filled the plate and was easy to stamp with.</li>
            <li> This plate is awesome! Although Konad is rather expensive it is a great plate with designs I haven&#x27;t found any where else.</li>
            <li> I found that the bows in particular are a bit too big to fit on my nails even on my thumb nails. I think this particular image plate is better suited for your pedicures. Other than that it&#x27;s really cute.</li>
            <li> I bought this plate ONLY for the snowflakes and it&#x27;s great! Snowflakes stamp amazingly well and you get a professional looking manicure with ease!</li>
            <li> This worked great! It was exactly what I wanted. I do my nails alot and was very satisfied with this!</li>

            <li> I love konad plates they are worth the price! They are the most easiest to stamp. For some reason better than any other brand I have.</li>
            <li> I wanted to get a Christmas-themed design.  There are two different snow flake designs but I only use just one of them.  There is no way in million years I will stamp these way too girlish bows on my nails, so even though it was on sale, I feel like I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> Use these plates for quick and easy nail art in my salon! My clients love that the art is always crisp and clear.</li>
            <li> Beautiful designs I recommend it to all those nail art fanatics. They are easy to use and look beautiful on a regular manicure. Inexpensive art designs that will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping and authentic Konad plate.  The bows are pretty big.  May be too big for kids or people with small hands.  BUT these are darling images.  Also the snow flakes are great for seasonal nail art.  (there are other plates with smaller bows)</li>
            <li> Works as all my other KONAD plates do.  It&#x27;s nice that it has 2 snowflake designs - and very tiny hearts (perfect for my daughter&#x27;s tiny toes).</li>
            <li> The images fit my nails really nicely. They stamped with no problem, and worked with regular nail polish. I used Sally Hansen brand polishes and Konad stamper and scraper. Very impressed!!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT....adding to my collection of plates! It is hard to find all the different plates in the stores. Thanks AMAZON!</li>
            <li> Love the Konad plates, they work so well!  Great images everytime.  In my opinion the Konad polish is the best for nail stamping plates.  Other work but Konad&#x27;s work the best.</li>
            <li> Plate works wonderfully and I will definitely recommend this plate. It is a must have plate with all the pretty girly designs!!</li>
            <li> I was very new to this kind of stamping when I ordered this disc. Now that I have tried several diffrent kind I prefer Konad becuse they have beep inprints that allow you to get a nice crisp stamp each time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for a teenage girl.  These products make it so simple and fun to create your own professional nail designs.  Provides for great bonding time as well:).</li>
            <li> It did it&#x27;s job ! Arrived on time.  Works like a charm each and every time it is put to use.</li>
            <li> I love my stamper. I know some people have a hard time using them, but I do too sometimes I just take my time with them. If you have the stuff for stamping plates I would recamend this to them.</li>
            <li> well maybe i would love it but the cie nevert send it to me even after couple of e-mails telling me should be coming never did i place the order on May 31st 2013 and we are now July 2 2013 not really normal</li>
            <li> I used this plate for my 30th birthday nails! Great designs, especially with the 80&#x27;s coming back into style. Awesome</li>
            <li> I wanted this because of the cute bows; snowflakes and hearts. This is the only Konad plate I have so far; but I will get more.
