            <li>SUDS UP WONDERFULLY AND KEEP BABY ENTERTAINED</li>
            <li>And the price is awesome through a subscription.  </li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t impressed with this one.  </li>
            <li>Best bubble bath ever.  </li>
            <li>I like the fact that this soap is somewhat more conscientious of its ingredients, but I&#x27;m not convinced that its the best for my baby or the best out there.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff</li>
            <li>this will be great for them.</li>
            <li>My two issues with this product deal with its toxicity and its ability to make great bubbles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These seem to be doing a good job.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t smell that great, nor does it make that many bubbles.</li>
            <li>They produce a good amount of bubbles and smell nice.</li>
            <li>While I am not convinced this is the best out there, it is a step in the right direction.  </li>
            <li>Then we discovered Yes to Baby Carrots - LOVE!  </li>
            <li>We love this bubble bath!  </li>
            <li>The kids liked it.</li>
            <li>We get nice bubbles from this, more than with Burts bees.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve come up with my own method of dealing with this product&#x27;s inability to produce strong bubbles.  </li>
            <li>this soap is \\&quot;tear free\\&quot;, and almost all the baby products that I&#x27;ve researched from organic sites say that the additives that make a product \\&quot;tear free\\&quot; are not always safe.  </li>
            <li>I like many of the Yes to products</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t bubble much nor does it have an attractive scent that has some staying power through a bath nor a shower.</li>
            <li>I love this brand for my kids and myself.  </li>
            <li>Just signed up to have it delivered every six months, easy. :)</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find a natural bubble bath for my daughter.</li>
            <li>I would not use anything else because the natural quality of this product is great.</li>
            <li>I had to return a couple items that couldn&#x27;t be easily cleaned or that I didn&#x27;t want to risk damage like the amp.</li>
            <li>It is not overly greasy either and rinses very quickly.</li>
            <li>There is also strong evidence of it being a skin toxicant.</li>
            <li>THIS IS SUCH A GREAT BUUBLE BATH PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>If the spout pops up during transit there is nothing stopping the bubble bath from freely flowing</li>
            <li>It gave me much more work than it was worth.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve found them to be good for her sensitive skin as well.</li>
            <li>So I had a couple of spots in my house to clean up after I found what had happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is 100&amp; natural unlike Earth&#x27;s Best which is only 70% and gave him a rash as well Babyganics bubble bath.</li>
            <li>This is a nice natural bubble bath formula.  </li>
            <li>I put a little more of the liquid in my bath than require but it was still good for me.</li>
            <li>The scent is mild, and it makes lots of bubbles.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried reviving the bath by adding more soap and turning on the faucet or even using the hand-held shower head to get more bubbles going.  </li>
            <li>My toddler gets so excited when she sees her bath and gets in right away.  </li>
            <li>Generally a good brand as long as it is hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and natural and fragrance free, but regular soap will bubble more than this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this line of products but the bubbles are not excessive from this bubble bath.</li>
            <li>I do keep an eye open for it in the stores though as it did work well and bubbled pretty nicely.</li>
            <li>It all seems great until she destroys a body-sized portion when she sits down, and then many other fist-sized portions as she plays.  </li>
            <li>The plant-derived fragrance also receives a higher warning rating than the others for its neurotoxicity, and allergies/</li>
            <li>First, I pour in some soap and fill the tub using the shower because it stirs up more of the bubbles and create a giant 5 inch layer of bubbles.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not too hot.  </li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s more natural than other bubble bath products out there.</li>
            <li>I also like it because instead of screwing the cap off, it pushes open and I can easily pour it into the stream of water without getting any water inside the bottle.  </li>
            <li>This stuff feels, smells, and washes PURE.  </li>
            <li>This chemical has created tumors in animals with large doses.  </li>
            <li>You only need a little to make great bubbles.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s much cheaper than at the market.</li>
            <li>If your kid is really into bubbles</li>
            <li>and I would keep buying on Amazon if the cost didn&#x27;t go up so much.</li>
            <li>A very affordable bubble bath product made with ingredients I trust for my children&#x27;s safety.</li>
            <li>She has always had super sensitive skin with eczema, and these bubbles are gentle and natural for her skin - no problems with skin flare ups.</li>
            <li>and/or use the shower head on high pulse to help generate the suds.   </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make tons of suds but enough for my son to have fun with.  </li>
            <li>The smell is mild and it doesn&#x27;t seem to make my daughters skin dry.</li>
            <li>We used to use Burt&#x27;s Bees - 96.5% natural was better than the crazy chemical-filled products on most store shelves for kids.</li>
            <li>I like it so far!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s available on subscription for less, between that and our Amazon mom discount</li>
            <li>You will need to heat up the water a bit more than regular, because it cools down somewhat as it shoots through the air into the tub.  </li>
            <li>had ordered several items along the bubble bath all of which arrived in a large box.</li>
            <li>my daughter would have a reaction so I can&#x27;t compare it wity non natural brands.</li>
            <li>Also when I first picked up the box to bring it inside and then set it on the counter to open, I couldn&#x27;t see nor tell that the middle of the box of soaked with bubble bath.</li>
            <li>If you are dead set on ordering I&#x27;d advice ordering it with something that could easily be cleaned up in case you experience a similar incident; like diapers since they come in shrink wrap bundles anyway.</li>
            <li>Finally an organic product that doesn&#x27;t irritate my 1 year old&#x27;s skin!</li>
            <li>Not impressed although it&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s organic...</li>
            <li>but I enjoyed it for myself and it does have tiny little bubbles, yes lots of tiny little bubbles.</li>

            <li> Comparing to other natural bubble bath products this is bubbly.</li>
            <li> ALL THE WHILE NOT BEING EXPOSED TO MAJOR CHEMICALS IN OTHER PRODUCTS</li>
            <li> Bubble bath products with sodium laureth sulfate is so cheap I can&#x27;t imagine that making one without it is that expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming this is because the soap has broken much of the surface tension and now the bubbles do not form or keep as well as they did in the beginning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> On average it produces about a 2 inch thick layer of fluffy white bubbles.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this soap less than a month ago, because my husband was using Dawn dish soap in the tub to entertain our toddler.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say the layer lasts about 5-7 minutes on average, and thereafter you have a few stragglers clinging together for life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It just doesn&#x27;t seem to be the safest bubble bath product out there, and that probably matters to you a little if you&#x27;re buying this instead of some soap-filled Dora</li>
            <li> the fluffy and a little bit too airy bubbles start filling up my tub.  </li>
            <li> I Also this soap has fragrance added, so I am not sure how it can be hypoallergenic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That said, test the temperature as usual</li>
            <li> she might be pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product has a faint scent and when I washed my grandson with it, I could hardly smell anything.</li>
            <li> Every other product from this brand that are not hypoallergenic are awful &amp; cause a rash, burning, inflammation on me &amp; my kid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a mr bubbles type brand because im afraid</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I was so happy to find a natural bubble bath for my daughter. The scent is mild, and it makes lots of bubbles. I can use it without worrying about chemicals!</li>
            <li> We used to use Burt&#x27;s Bees - 96.5% natural was better than the crazy chemical-filled products on most store shelves for kids. Then we discovered Yes to Baby Carrots - LOVE!  This stuff feels, smells, and washes PURE.  PLENTY of bubbles in the tub if you pour it in under the tap and/or use the shower head on high pulse to help generate the suds.   Great stuff and so grateful it&#x27;s available on subscription for less, between that and our Amazon mom discount it&#x27;s much cheaper than at the market. Just signed up to have it delivered every six months, easy. :)</li>
            <li> I bought this bubble bath because I was looking for something without harmful chemicals.  While I am not convinced this is the best out there, it is a step in the right direction.  The kids liked it.</li>
            <li> THIS IS SUCH A GREAT BUUBLE BATH PRODUCT. SUDS UP WONDERFULLY AND KEEP BABY ENTERTAINED ALL THE WHILE NOT BEING EXPOSED TO MAJOR CHEMICALS IN OTHER PRODUCTS</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I was looking for a bubble bath product without sodium laureth sulfate.  You only need a little to make great bubbles.  I also like it because instead of screwing the cap off, it pushes open and I can easily pour it into the stream of water without getting any water inside the bottle.  I gave 4 stars for the price.  Bubble bath products with sodium laureth sulfate is so cheap I can&#x27;t imagine that making one without it is that expensive.</li>
            <li> I use the shower gels from yes to cucumber &amp; carrots and they smell yummy! This product has a faint scent and when I washed my grandson with it, I could hardly smell anything. Oh well, some people may not like stronger smells &amp; this will be great for them.</li>
            <li> I purchased this soap less than a month ago, because my husband was using Dawn dish soap in the tub to entertain our toddler.  She LOVES bubbles, but she also loves to drink the bathwater (even though I try to discourage it).  I like the fact that this soap is somewhat more conscientious of its ingredients, but I&#x27;m not convinced that its the best for my baby or the best out there.  My two issues with this product deal with its toxicity and its ability to make great bubbles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toxicity:&lt;br /&gt;For starters this soap is \\&quot;tear free\\&quot;, and almost all the baby products that I&#x27;ve researched from organic sites say that the additives that make a product \\&quot;tear free\\&quot; are not always safe.  For example, J&amp;J baby shampoo uses 1,4-dioxane to get their shampoo to be \\&quot;tear free.\\&quot; This chemical is a known carcinogen. I Also this soap has fragrance added, so I am not sure how it can be hypoallergenic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked up this product at ewg.org and found a breakdown of its ingredients.  It looks as if the ingredient of the largest concern would be the Retinyl Acetate (Vitamin A).  This chemical has created tumors in animals with large doses.  There is also strong evidence of it being a skin toxicant. The plant-derived fragrance also receives a higher warning rating than the others for its neurotoxicity, and allergies/immunotoxicity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It just doesn&#x27;t seem to be the safest bubble bath product out there, and that probably matters to you a little if you&#x27;re buying this instead of some soap-filled Dora dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bubble Factor:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product definitely lacks in this area. I start the bath, squirt in the soap, and watch as the fluffy and a little bit too airy bubbles start filling up my tub.  On average it produces about a 2 inch thick layer of fluffy white bubbles.  My toddler gets so excited when she sees her bath and gets in right away.  It all seems great until she destroys a body-sized portion when she sits down, and then many other fist-sized portions as she plays.  Pretty soon you have no more bubbles left. I&#x27;d say the layer lasts about 5-7 minutes on average, and thereafter you have a few stragglers clinging together for life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried reviving the bath by adding more soap and turning on the faucet or even using the hand-held shower head to get more bubbles going.  This does not seem to work.  Once the bubble bath has happened, the water cannot be revived.  I&#x27;m assuming this is because the soap has broken much of the surface tension and now the bubbles do not form or keep as well as they did in the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve come up with my own method of dealing with this product&#x27;s inability to produce strong bubbles.  First, I pour in some soap and fill the tub using the shower because it stirs up more of the bubbles and create a giant 5 inch layer of bubbles.  These bubbles last a lot longer. You will need to heat up the water a bit more than regular, because it cools down somewhat as it shoots through the air into the tub.  That said, test the temperature as usual so it&#x27;s not too hot.  The water still can not be revived once the bubbles are gone, but the shower-created bubbles last almost the entire time she&#x27;s in the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be looking for another bubble bath for my toddler, but this has kept the Dawn away for now!</li>
            <li> We love this bubble bath!  She has always had super sensitive skin with eczema, and these bubbles are gentle and natural for her skin - no problems with skin flare ups.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and natural and fragrance free, but regular soap will bubble more than this stuff. If your kid is really into bubbles he/she might be pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t comment on the bubbliness or gentleness of the product since I never had to chance to use mine and I will not order a replacement after the incident I had with the bubble bath ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer doesn&#x27;t put a plastic shrink wrap seal over the spout nor a seal over the bottle lip if you remove the cap (like ketchup bottles have). If the spout pops up during transit there is nothing stopping the bubble bath from freely flowing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had ordered several items along the bubble bath all of which arrived in a large box. Upon opening the box I discovered that the entire contents, 12 oz, of the bubble bath emptied during transit. Everything had bubble bath liquid on it. A box with an amp took the brunt of it, it&#x27;s side was soaked in bubble bath. I had to return a couple items that couldn&#x27;t be easily cleaned or that I didn&#x27;t want to risk damage like the amp. Also when I first picked up the box to bring it inside and then set it on the counter to open, I couldn&#x27;t see nor tell that the middle of the box of soaked with bubble bath. So I had a couple of spots in my house to clean up after I found what had happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not order this product again. Why chance it. It gave me much more work than it was worth. If you are dead set on ordering I&#x27;d advice ordering it with something that could easily be cleaned up in case you experience a similar incident; like diapers since they come in shrink wrap bundles anyway.</li>
            <li> And the price is awesome through a subscription.  I love that it&#x27;s more natural than other bubble bath products out there.</li>
            <li> We get nice bubbles from this, more than with Burts bees.  I&#x27;ve never used a mr bubbles type brand because im afraid my daughter would have a reaction so I can&#x27;t compare it wity non natural brands.</li>
            <li> This bubble bath works well and I would keep buying on Amazon if the cost didn&#x27;t go up so much. I do keep an eye open for it in the stores though as it did work well and bubbled pretty nicely.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t smell that great, nor does it make that many bubbles. Not impressed although it&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s organic...I guess...</li>
            <li> I like many of the Yes to products but I wasn&#x27;t impressed with this one.  It doesn&#x27;t bubble much nor does it have an attractive scent that has some staying power through a bath nor a shower.</li>
            <li> This is the only bubble bath that does not cause a rash on my kid. Generally a good brand as long as it is hypoallergenic. Every other product from this brand that are not hypoallergenic are awful &amp; cause a rash, burning, inflammation on me &amp; my kid.</li>
            <li> I love this line of products but the bubbles are not excessive from this bubble bath. I would not use anything else because the natural quality of this product is great. It is not overly greasy either and rinses very quickly.</li>
            <li> Finally an organic product that doesn&#x27;t irritate my 1 year old&#x27;s skin! This is 100&amp; natural unlike Earth&#x27;s Best which is only 70% and gave him a rash as well Babyganics bubble bath.</li>
            <li> Best bubble bath ever.  My son loves the bubbles and it doesnt irritate his skin like the ones with perfumes and dyes</li>
            <li> These seem to be doing a good job. They produce a good amount of bubbles and smell nice. My daughter loves taking a bath with these bubbles and I&#x27;ve found them to be good for her sensitive skin as well.</li>
            <li> I like this bubble bath. It is for Children but I enjoyed it for myself and it does have tiny little bubbles, yes lots of tiny little bubbles. I put a little more of the liquid in my bath than require but it was still good for me. I recommend this for adults and children.</li>
            <li> I love this brand for my kids and myself.  A very affordable bubble bath product made with ingredients I trust for my children&#x27;s safety.</li>
            <li> Comparing to other natural bubble bath products this is bubbly. You need to get use your hands to help it along to make lots of bubbles. The smell is mild and it doesn&#x27;t seem to make my daughters skin dry. I like it so far!</li>
            <li> This is a nice natural bubble bath formula.  It doesn&#x27;t make tons of suds but enough for my son to have fun with.  If we turn on the jets, they make tons of bubbles of course.</li>
