            <li>Very good value for the money.</li>
            <li>If you have tags this is a great product.</li>
            <li>This is fresh and wonderful!</li>
            <li>I am sure this product is good for something</li>
            <li>So far, I am not that impressed when relating to my once and a while acne break outs.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely  love tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>Roll on is good to use on fresh acnes, it dries them out.</li>
            <li>Wart remover works much better and is cheaper.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, for me, I think it was a better option than surgery.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>The smell is rather strong; a lot like tea tree oil</li>
            <li>otherwise I&#x27;m fairly certain people will be able to smell it on you!</li>
            <li>The Tea Tree Oil is fine however.</li>
            <li>I felt what I can best describe as a slight irritation.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but honestly I didn&#x27;t notice much effect.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a natural remedy for my acne scars and this sounded like a good idea.</li>
            <li>After being pregnant  I had what seemed to be A LOT of skin tags on my armpits and neck area.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I have seen any quick results.  </li>
            <li>but I rarely ever put this on my face.</li>
            <li>After a while it got a really funky smell, which is saying a lot since tea tree is a pretty strong scent in itself.</li>
            <li>I understand that the product is good for other things, but it did not work for the issue for which I purchased it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep trying it out and try to use it more frequently and update if it ends up working out better with multiple applications.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>I purchased this product and my tags started falling off in the first week.  </li>
            <li>Ok, the Tea tree oil actually does work.  </li>
            <li>and it does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>I get razor burn fairly often and sometimes rashes due to my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It smells strong, but definitely works.</li>
            <li>A drop too much oil</li>
            <li>I feel I probably paid too much for what I got.</li>
            <li>Smells like motor oil and didn&#x27;t so much.  </li>
            <li>Used the whole bottle and no results.</li>
            <li>and I will try it more on other things and see.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was not painful, but occasional</li>
            <li>The first several weeks were discouraging, because it seem like nothing was happening.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m not super excited about this one.</li>
            <li>Will finish the whole bottle before I finally decide.</li>
            <li>So far it hasn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>and the smell is a little strong (not unpleasant but heavy)  </li>
            <li>This really shrunk it down to nothing.</li>
            <li>It helps clear up a little quicker than normal</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Absolutely  love tea tree oil. I read previous  reviews about this product, and researched how to get rid of skin tags. After being pregnant  I had what seemed to be A LOT of skin tags on my armpits and neck area. Tea tree oil worked and removed  my skin tags (very small) in 2-3 days. I applied the oil just on a q-tip, rubbed around and on skin tags. Instantly dried them up and fell off. Completely  not invasive once so ever. Definitely  recommend.</li>
            <li> I received this a month ago and have used every day 7 8 times a day it does not remove skin tags as advertised</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural remedy for my acne scars and this sounded like a good idea. It stinks like hell and it does some improvement but honestly I didn&#x27;t notice much effect. Roll on is good to use on fresh acnes, it dries them out. Overall it&#x27;s ok, I&#x27;m not super excited about this one.</li>
            <li> Iwas searching for something to remove tags.  I saw the As Seen on TV product, but the reviews I read was poor. I purchased this product and my tags started falling off in the first week.  I only used it once a day. If you have tags this is a great product.</li>
            <li> Purchased for use on skin tags.&lt;br /&gt;No instructions with product.&lt;br /&gt;Applied to skin tags 2 times a day for a week. Nothing happened.&lt;br /&gt;I just smelled like turpintine.</li>
            <li> I have previously bought tea tree oil that was not this high of a grade. After a while it got a really funky smell, which is saying a lot since tea tree is a pretty strong scent in itself. This is fresh and wonderful! I bought this to help fight bad skin but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be the miracle tonic that it claims to be. I get razor burn fairly often and sometimes rashes due to my sensitive skin and I always dab a little TT oil on. It helps clear up a little quicker than normal but I rarely ever put this on my face. A drop too much oil and I&#x27;ll be in break out city!&lt;br /&gt;The blemish stick I&#x27;ve used a few times and can&#x27;t really say it helps speed up the healing process of break outs. I&#x27;ll keep trying it out and try to use it more frequently and update if it ends up working out better with multiple applications. The smell is rather strong; a lot like tea tree oil but you can smell the other oils in it as well. I would recommend letting the oil set in for 10 minutes prior to going out somewhere otherwise I&#x27;m fairly certain people will be able to smell it on you!</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews I bought the tea trea oil thinking it would help my flare up of acne. It helped in the beginning but after using it for a few weeks I started to notice peeling and dryness. I also felt like after those few weeks of improvement my skin was beginning to look overall-worse. I understand that everyone&#x27;s skin is different but if your reading this review, just keep these effects in mind.</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil works for a lot of various ailments. I am still waiting for my &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; roll-on blemish stick. I feel I probably paid too much for what I got.</li>
            <li> So far, I am not that impressed when relating to my once and a while acne break outs.  I don&#x27;t think I have seen any quick results.  And wonder, what is it doing.  I end up putting castor oil on an acne bump and that seems to come to a head and heal faster.  I am sure this product is good for something and I will try it more on other things and see.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 1 month twice a day with absolutely no results yet.  Will let you know if anything changes.  Will finish the whole bottle before I finally decide.</li>
            <li> When I received my Tea Tree Oil the blemish stick was not in the box. I contacted the supplier and never heard back from them. The Tea Tree Oil is fine however.</li>
            <li> You have to be patient and apply it over several weeks, but you will definitely see a difference and can see the affects.  It smells strong, but definitely works.</li>
            <li> Smells like motor oil and didn&#x27;t so much.  Wart remover works much better and is cheaper.  Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Ok, the Tea tree oil actually does work.  The downside is it took months of applying the oil several times a day on a mole.  The first several weeks were discouraging, because it seem like nothing was happening.  In addition, I was worried I smelled like pine-sol to people around me. Eventually, the mole began to fade a bit so I was encouraged and kept applying.  It became like dry skin peeling off.  End the end, the dark color was gone, and the &amp;#34;bump&amp;#34; had slowly flaked off.  I can still see an outline of the mole, a bit like a slight scare.&lt;br /&gt;It was not painful, but occasional I felt what I can best describe as a slight irritation.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, for me, I think it was a better option than surgery.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product because I heard tea tree oil could remove skin tags.  So far it hasn&#x27;t and the smell is a little strong (not unpleasant but heavy)  but it does look as though some of the smaller tags are drying out.  Hopefully it will happen soon.  Very good value for the money.</li>
            <li> This product smells terrible and doesn&#x27;t work.  My son has used it daily for a few weeks and his acne actually got worse!  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product!</li>
            <li> I search for something to help with breakouts on my neck, and jaw. I bought Tea Tree Oil and the Roll On Blemish Stick and it does exactly what it says. It takes away any red zit or blemish. I even use it when it looks like I am getting a red spot and it prevents them from reappearring. I LOVE this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on two skin tags since I could not find anything in a local store. After six months the skin tags are still there and I am out of product. Used the whole bottle and no results. I would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> I could not use this product ,I tried,  but after an hour after application, I could not tolerate the odor and I got rid of the bottle</li>
            <li> That damn skin tag thing on my neck has driven me crazy for 30 years of shaving. This really shrunk it down to nothing. Hope it stays that way. Recommended!</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use on skin tags, and even after applying the oil for six weeks, the skin tags showed no change.  I understand that the product is good for other things, but it did not work for the issue for which I purchased it.</li>
            <li> The blemish stick actually seems to work however, I bought the product for the Tea Tree oil as reviews claimed it made skin tags disappear.  Well, needless to say, I have tried it on several different tags on my neck (standard run of the mill skin tags) and they are still there.  Unless, I am doing something wrong, this does not work on skin tags.</li>
            <li> Did not do a thing to my skin tags. Sad. Not much else to be said. Applied daily, smelled like it might do something, but nada.</li>
