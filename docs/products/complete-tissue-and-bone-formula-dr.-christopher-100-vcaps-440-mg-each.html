            <li>Everything we need for a happy healthy existence is provided to us by the earth, not by doctors, surgery, synthetic pills or chemical additives in everything we consume.  : )</li>

            <li>This is one of the Best herbal formulas for back problems.</li>
            <li>Will purchase more for sure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many treatments, injections, chiropractic, PT, exercises....</li>
            <li>I need more time to see if this product works with the other&lt;br /&gt;products</li>

            <li>The gum also feels better and  stronger.  </li>

            <li>Joint Pain Much Better.</li>
            <li>The product arrived in great shape and I&#x27;m taking them hoping for promising results.  </li>
            <li>and how to keep ourselves healthy.</li>
            <li>A friend told me about this product, I take it for sore hands, they get sore from over use, this helps them feel better.</li>
            <li>For months I&#x27;ve not been able to bend or extend my knee without lots of pain and discomfort.</li>

            <li>/&gt;You might need to start with more than the recommended dosage to make an affect.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a great price as well!</li>
            <li>I am satisfied as well as my dentist</li>
            <li>I believe it is working, still need to give it more time.</li>
            <li>dozes 3 times a day and some days more.  </li>
            <li>The product was okay, but could be better, I prefer Hammer nutrition tissue rejuvenator to this, but this is alot cheaper.</li>
            <li>and I am sharing these benefits with many of my friends and neighbors.</li>
            <li>The price is better than what I was paying for it at the Health Food Store -- when they would have it which I couldn&#x27;t count on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m not paying the shipping.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Google all the wonderful uses for this product too long for me to list</li>
            <li>GREAT NATURAL REMEDY.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only received rave reviews on Dr. Christophers products and I&#x27;m sure that this one is great too.</li>
            <li>They are easy to take</li>
            <li>In September 2014 I was diagnosed with diverticulitis and was put on two extremely strong antibiotics.</li>
            <li>feeling much better even when I take  sweet</li>
            <li>This product seems to work fine and the shipping was prompt, but we haven&#x27;t seen huge changes from using it, but it might take more time for any significant changes to occur.  </li>
            <li>I started taking the Bone formula along with the Great Mender tea pills and the swelling was pretty much gone in four days.</li>
            <li>and he is doing fine with these.</li>
            <li>and I have noticed a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>Huge improvement in carpal tunnel syndrome and tendonitis.</li>
            <li>But the sensitivity issue is a huge thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had a huge bruise come up on my leg</li>
            <li>or I may have some more improvement, but either way, it is certainly worth the price.</li>
            <li>THIS IS GOOD GOD NATURAL STUFF and Dr. Christopher won with his combinations.</li>
            <li>I can bond it easily and full weight bearing.</li>
            <li>I see a remarkable improvement in my fingernails and my skin is not nearly as dry, even as winter weather and indoor heat arrives.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: My husband has been using this for over a year now, he uses it daily to alleviate the aches and pains of getting older, still very impressed with the product and the results!</li>
            <li>find his products to be so well made and formulated with the intention of healing people and not getting rich on the wave of holistic medicine.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t tried this yet but based on the reviews I have read about it I am excited to try it.</li>
            <li>I have carpal tunnel ( which is the original reason why I ordered)</li>
            <li>That cami will never be fit for anything else, but a worthy sacrifice).</li>
            <li>I was impressed because the doctor told me to come back in a month because it would take that long to heal, but I felt much, much better after 2 weeks, and I do think it was this product.</li>
            <li>I really like using natural healing and the herbs in these capsules are excellent for many different issues.  </li>
            <li>doubt this is a cure for the problems I have, but it has certainly been helpful and I plan on sticking with it for a couple months to see more improvement.</li>
            <li>I give it 5 stars for the fast reduction in pain which has made me feel more energetic, mobile and positive.  </li>
            <li>Herbs for the bones, rolfing for the soft tissue, it was an amazing recovery at 58.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good about this product.</li>
            <li>, felt good overall, sex drive was up too.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li>Sometimes things you eat can nullify the beneficial effects of this and other great herbal combinations.</li>
            <li>it arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>These two in combination are tremendous.</li>
            <li>I have Chondromalaica Patella and Christophers Bone and Tissue formula has helped me tremendously.  </li>
            <li>Always quick shipping.</li>
            <li>The product is always delivered quickly.  </li>
            <li>this helps  tremendously with my CP.</li>
            <li>but it goes away quickly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using the same mascara, but suddenly my eyelashes look pretty awesome!</li>
            <li>That was amazing to me, and the pain has not come back.  </li>
            <li>i have amazing personal healing experiences using any and all dr christopher products.</li>
            <li>Have used the ointment and oil with much success and decided to use this in conjunction with them.  </li>
            <li>I would still recommend it for those who find it&#x27;s properties useful for their condition.</li>
            <li>This product, Dr. Christopher&#x27;s Complete Tissue &amp; Bone Formula, kept coming up with such great recommendations, I just had to try it.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, i have poor joints and I feel better when taking it, and</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>WORTH IT.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Complete Tissue &amp; Bone for a month now and just ordered 3 more bottles.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are more easily absorbed than most other products on the market.  </li>
            <li>I have rotator cuff damage in my right shoulder  and this formula is healing it.</li>
            <li>Has helped with low back pain that I experienced quite often.</li>
            <li>It was packed very well and shipped to us quickly by this vendor.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that there was some kind of huge improvement because I didn&#x27;t have any major issues prior to wanting to take this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: I experienced more than usual breast swelling/tenderness/soreness after taking this product 3 pills 3x daily for a couple weeks.  </li>
            <li>Plus I dont live in town, I live way out past where the road turns to dirt, so 48hrs is awesome.</li>
            <li>Knees much better after taking only a couple of weeks</li>
            <li>I think it works pretty well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost finished with my first bottle.</li>
            <li>and I feel better internally.  </li>
            <li>Within the first couple days my pain had reduced dramatically.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>because I couldn&#x27;t really figure out why I had  bought it!  </li>
            <li>I feel pretty.....</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I love the ointment of the same name.  </li>
            <li>I can say that I am going to purchase more for one simple reason:  </li>
            <li>More often than not, this type of fracture requires surgery to pin the bones of the foot back together.</li>
            <li>I also ordered the Dr. Christopher&#x27;s Complete Tissue &amp; Bone Ointment, which is also available here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I felt my back getting better...</li>
            <li>Product was delivered fast!</li>
            <li>On the fifth day I went in for more x-rays as my doctor was back in the office in my area.</li>
            <li>For the first time in his life (20 years old)he felt no pain in his knees or shoulders and he even did not need the brace.</li>
            <li>The most debilitating for them both is the leg &amp; back</li>
            <li>thanks!  </li>
            <li>I really have no idea what this did for my bones, but I think it helped rid me of candida!</li>
            <li>Got this and the companion ointment for my husband, the results of the two have been amazing, his arthritis, carpel tunnel, and general back and leg pain have seen tremendous</li>
            <li>ALL I CAN SAY IS WOW!!!!  </li>
            <li>My husband felt the same way good overall.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Meanwhile, I didn&#x27;t even think about the positive benefits it would have on my nails.</li>
            <li>At first, I didn&#x27;t think much of it.  </li>
            <li>Other people get such great results from the formula.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am the mother of six young children, and I work in the medical field, and I can honestly say that I&#x27;m blown away by how much this supplement has helped me.</li>
            <li>Well, in walk this little magic potion!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing and help heal cuts and sores in half the time.</li>
            <li>Even with the strong connective tissue, it was MuTu System that finally helped me close the gap.</li>
            <li>He uses this product and notices that his knee pain has lessened since taking it - he even asks me to buy more when he runs out which is not normal!  </li>
            <li>but I have never seen any directions or research to say how much.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Going to try out the comfrey herb, since this one didn&#x27;t come with it, but still very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gonna&#x27; buy another batch very soon.</li>
            <li>Thanks for reading my review.</li>
            <li>it has to get in your system before you can tell if it really works.  </li>
            <li>It has really helped me.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t bother me that much like before.  </li>
            <li>worked great, along with Rolfing, to fix my broken wrist after surgery.  </li>
            <li>I was in a lot of pain and didn&#x27;t have signs of much improvement.  </li>
            <li>This product helped me more than I expected.</li>
            <li>Did I really need???  </li>
            <li>After I used it for two days in November, I had a severe coughing fit in a public place where I could not catch my breath.  </li>
            <li>My PT and Chiro were blown away by how much movement I have</li>
            <li>So disipointed I really wanted to be a ninja</li>
            <li>He works with his hands and without them we were very worried.</li>
            <li>Very valuable.</li>
            <li>Healed fast.  </li>
            <li>Pros: Fast Shipping --</li>
            <li>I still have to stay in the aircast for another four weeks, but the doctor says my foot should continue to heal well, as long as I continue to take it easy, keep it in the aircast at all times, and don&#x27;t fall on it again.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>but they need to get over the comfrey scare and put the comfrey powder back in like it originally had.</li>
            <li>Originally called B, F &amp; S for bones, flesh and sinew it has been renamed numerous times.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d just like to add an addition to my original comments above.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>Less muscle fatigue, better muscle reaction, smoother feeling joint motion.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering a half a dozen more bottles soon</li>
            <li>Most doctors will tell you surgery is the only fix, where they stitch the muscles back together with mesh to hold it since the connective tissue has ripped.</li>
            <li>His back healed quickly as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m at 1 finger wide, and I can feel how strong the tissue is now.</li>
            <li>Almost 3 weeks into it, my whole back pain on my right side which I hurt from the gym</li>
            <li>/&gt;Christopher&#x27;s fits the bill in that regard, but taking 6 capsules of anything every day is a bit much, esp if you&#x27;re also trying to fit in a multivitamin or any other supplement.</li>
            <li>Also, I have developed very sore breasts, it is not that time of month</li>
            <li>he was quite surprised at how much it had healed in just a month.</li>
            <li>he walks normally.</li>
            <li>will take a few more bottles before I know.</li>
            <li>Threw it away and got a new chair.  </li>
            <li>I do have to laugh as these two little bottles are delivered in a very large box.  </li>
            <li>and  always  very sensitive.  </li>
            <li>Small amounts are said to be safe</li>
            <li>has completely healed!  </li>
            <li>Nonetheless as created and recommended by the late but still reliable Dr. Christopher, it is a great healer for wounds and other breaks.</li>
            <li>This is no magic pill still waiting on the result reviewers have boasted about, the magic hasn&#x27;t happened for me yet..</li>
            <li>This product helped me to become pain free as well as take the swelling down.  </li>
            <li>After a week on this product I felt less pain and huge improvement with my flexibility.</li>
            <li>Got the product quickly and as expected.  </li>
            <li>: I&#x27;ve taken this pill for several months and haven&#x27;t seen any positive results or any results at all.</li>
            <li>It was still kind of weak.</li>
            <li>I had a small wound on my hand and while taking this it healed pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>So far, I cannot tell a difference between before and after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I really feel that my back is healing.</li>
            <li>Again to early to tell...</li>
            <li>I have purchased to reduce or provide complete recovery for the condition</li>
            <li>This works well in conjunction with Dr. Christopher&#x27;s Complete Tissue and Bone Ointment.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I started taking Dr. Christopher&#x27;s Complete Tissue and Bone 3 pills 3 x a day.  </li>
            <li>I developed pain in my lower back/right hip</li>
            <li>Take as directed for at least 2 weeks, and you will feel something change for the better.</li>
            <li>I had taken up tai chi and yoga along with daily stretching, but didn&#x27;t see much improvement.</li>
            <li>I am so grateful for companies like this who take the natural and DO NOT GOUGE the customer as if they made rocket science.  </li>
            <li>When it happened to me a month ago, my podiatrist (who&#x27;s also a surgeon} put my foot in a soft aircast.</li>
            <li>so was looking for any natural remedies.</li>
            <li>This item gave me just what I needed for my tissues and bones to become complete.</li>
            <li>I think the pills helped in not setting me back to much.</li>
            <li>After an all day sport event (40 days into taking \\&quot;Complete Tissue and Bone</li>
            <li>I will continue with this together with the ointment Complete tissue and bone ..</li>
            <li>Definitely my natural remedy go to from now on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural so why not get a boost of herbs and roots?</li>
            <li>Within a few days, everything felt better, including the left elbow.  </li>
            <li>But works as well with any kind of post surgery situation as well, even broken but repaired injuries.</li>
            <li>the other hand, I&#x27;ve been taking Dr Christopher&#x27;s Herbal Calcium since last September and that seems to be fine.</li>
            <li>my proof it&#x27;s actually doing SOMETHING Is my super thin bendy nail get so strong and long when I am taking this, which is just a bonus.</li>
            <li>It looks like it&#x27;s been helping all the major scarring on my legs and the tissue around my chest feels fuller.</li>
            <li>I tried all kinds of both herbal and medicinal products as I have slight bone damage in my right hand, this product made no difference to the pain or bone density.</li>
            <li>Especially used for our boys when young and receiving playground injuries.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s called Nature&#x27;s Way Alive Calcium Bone formula - only 2 tablets per day).</li>
            <li>I bought this in conjunction with the complete back salve.  </li>
            <li>If you buy Dr Christopher&#x27;s book the &amp;#34;School of Natural Healing&amp;#34; it gives all the formulas with their proportions in the back of the book.  </li>
            <li>My foot blew up like a balloon … and just when the swelling was going down from the first injury.</li>
            <li>The only thing different I had added to my diet was the Dr Christopher&#x27;s Complete Tissue and Bone Formula.  </li>
            <li>This stuff heals broken bones, cuts and tissue damage very quickly.</li>

            <li> /&gt;You might need to start with more than the recommended dosage to make an affect.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a great price as well!</li>
            <li> I am satisfied as well as my dentist</li>
            <li> I believe it is working, still need to give it more time.</li>
            <li> dozes 3 times a day and some days more.  </li>

            <li> and I am sharing these benefits with many of my friends and neighbors.</li>
            <li> The price is better than what I was paying for it at the Health Food Store -- when they would have it which I couldn&#x27;t count on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m not paying the shipping.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Google all the wonderful uses for this product too long for me to list</li>
            <li> GREAT NATURAL REMEDY.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only received rave reviews on Dr. Christophers products and I&#x27;m sure that this one is great too.</li>
            <li> They are easy to take</li>
            <li> In September 2014 I was diagnosed with diverticulitis and was put on two extremely strong antibiotics.</li>
            <li> feeling much better even when I take  sweet</li>
            <li> This product seems to work fine and the shipping was prompt, but we haven&#x27;t seen huge changes from using it, but it might take more time for any significant changes to occur.  </li>
            <li> I started taking the Bone formula along with the Great Mender tea pills and the swelling was pretty much gone in four days.</li>
            <li> and he is doing fine with these.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> Huge improvement in carpal tunnel syndrome and tendonitis.</li>
            <li> But the sensitivity issue is a huge thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a huge bruise come up on my leg</li>
            <li> or I may have some more improvement, but either way, it is certainly worth the price.</li>
            <li> THIS IS GOOD GOD NATURAL STUFF and Dr. Christopher won with his combinations.</li>
            <li> I can bond it easily and full weight bearing.</li>
            <li> I see a remarkable improvement in my fingernails and my skin is not nearly as dry, even as winter weather and indoor heat arrives.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: My husband has been using this for over a year now, he uses it daily to alleviate the aches and pains of getting older, still very impressed with the product and the results!</li>
            <li> find his products to be so well made and formulated with the intention of healing people and not getting rich on the wave of holistic medicine.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried this yet but based on the reviews I have read about it I am excited to try it.</li>
            <li> I have carpal tunnel ( which is the original reason why I ordered)</li>
            <li> That cami will never be fit for anything else, but a worthy sacrifice).</li>
            <li> I was impressed because the doctor told me to come back in a month because it would take that long to heal, but I felt much, much better after 2 weeks, and I do think it was this product.</li>
            <li> I really like using natural healing and the herbs in these capsules are excellent for many different issues.  </li>
            <li> doubt this is a cure for the problems I have, but it has certainly been helpful and I plan on sticking with it for a couple months to see more improvement.</li>
            <li> I give it 5 stars for the fast reduction in pain which has made me feel more energetic, mobile and positive.  </li>
            <li> Herbs for the bones, rolfing for the soft tissue, it was an amazing recovery at 58.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good about this product.</li>
            <li> , felt good overall, sex drive was up too.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li> Sometimes things you eat can nullify the beneficial effects of this and other great herbal combinations.</li>
            <li> it arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> These two in combination are tremendous.</li>
            <li> I have Chondromalaica Patella and Christophers Bone and Tissue formula has helped me tremendously.  </li>
            <li> Always quick shipping.</li>
            <li> The product is always delivered quickly.  </li>
            <li> this helps  tremendously with my CP.</li>
            <li> but it goes away quickly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using the same mascara, but suddenly my eyelashes look pretty awesome!</li>
            <li> That was amazing to me, and the pain has not come back.  </li>
            <li> i have amazing personal healing experiences using any and all dr christopher products.</li>
            <li> Have used the ointment and oil with much success and decided to use this in conjunction with them.  </li>
            <li> I would still recommend it for those who find it&#x27;s properties useful for their condition.</li>
            <li> This product, Dr. Christopher&#x27;s Complete Tissue &amp; Bone Formula, kept coming up with such great recommendations, I just had to try it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, i have poor joints and I feel better when taking it, and</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Complete Tissue &amp; Bone for a month now and just ordered 3 more bottles.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are more easily absorbed than most other products on the market.  </li>
            <li> I have rotator cuff damage in my right shoulder  and this formula is healing it.</li>
            <li> Has helped with low back pain that I experienced quite often.</li>
            <li> It was packed very well and shipped to us quickly by this vendor.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that there was some kind of huge improvement because I didn&#x27;t have any major issues prior to wanting to take this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: I experienced more than usual breast swelling/tenderness/soreness after taking this product 3 pills 3x daily for a couple weeks.  </li>
            <li> Plus I dont live in town, I live way out past where the road turns to dirt, so 48hrs is awesome.</li>
            <li> Knees much better after taking only a couple of weeks</li>
            <li> I think it works pretty well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost finished with my first bottle.</li>
            <li> and I feel better internally.  </li>
            <li> Within the first couple days my pain had reduced dramatically.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> because I couldn&#x27;t really figure out why I had  bought it!  </li>
            <li> I feel pretty.....</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I love the ointment of the same name.  </li>
            <li> I can say that I am going to purchase more for one simple reason:  </li>
            <li> More often than not, this type of fracture requires surgery to pin the bones of the foot back together.</li>
            <li> I also ordered the Dr. Christopher&#x27;s Complete Tissue &amp; Bone Ointment, which is also available here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I felt my back getting better...</li>
            <li> Product was delivered fast!</li>
            <li> On the fifth day I went in for more x-rays as my doctor was back in the office in my area.</li>
            <li> For the first time in his life (20 years old)he felt no pain in his knees or shoulders and he even did not need the brace.</li>
            <li> The most debilitating for them both is the leg &amp; back</li>
            <li> thanks!  </li>
            <li> I really have no idea what this did for my bones, but I think it helped rid me of candida!</li>
            <li> Got this and the companion ointment for my husband, the results of the two have been amazing, his arthritis, carpel tunnel, and general back and leg pain have seen tremendous</li>
            <li> ALL I CAN SAY IS WOW!!!!  </li>
            <li> My husband felt the same way good overall.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Meanwhile, I didn&#x27;t even think about the positive benefits it would have on my nails.</li>
            <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t think much of it.  </li>
            <li> Other people get such great results from the formula.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am the mother of six young children, and I work in the medical field, and I can honestly say that I&#x27;m blown away by how much this supplement has helped me.</li>
            <li> Well, in walk this little magic potion!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and help heal cuts and sores in half the time.</li>
            <li> Even with the strong connective tissue, it was MuTu System that finally helped me close the gap.</li>
            <li> He uses this product and notices that his knee pain has lessened since taking it - he even asks me to buy more when he runs out which is not normal!  </li>
            <li> but I have never seen any directions or research to say how much.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Going to try out the comfrey herb, since this one didn&#x27;t come with it, but still very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gonna&#x27; buy another batch very soon.</li>
            <li> Thanks for reading my review.</li>
            <li> it has to get in your system before you can tell if it really works.  </li>
            <li> It has really helped me.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t bother me that much like before.  </li>
            <li> worked great, along with Rolfing, to fix my broken wrist after surgery.  </li>
            <li> I was in a lot of pain and didn&#x27;t have signs of much improvement.  </li>
            <li> This product helped me more than I expected.</li>
            <li> Did I really need???  </li>
            <li> After I used it for two days in November, I had a severe coughing fit in a public place where I could not catch my breath.  </li>
            <li> My PT and Chiro were blown away by how much movement I have</li>
            <li> So disipointed I really wanted to be a ninja</li>
            <li> He works with his hands and without them we were very worried.</li>
            <li> Very valuable.</li>
            <li> Healed fast.  </li>
            <li> Pros: Fast Shipping --</li>
            <li> I still have to stay in the aircast for another four weeks, but the doctor says my foot should continue to heal well, as long as I continue to take it easy, keep it in the aircast at all times, and don&#x27;t fall on it again.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> but they need to get over the comfrey scare and put the comfrey powder back in like it originally had.</li>
            <li> Originally called B, F &amp; S for bones, flesh and sinew it has been renamed numerous times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d just like to add an addition to my original comments above.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> Less muscle fatigue, better muscle reaction, smoother feeling joint motion.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering a half a dozen more bottles soon</li>
            <li> Most doctors will tell you surgery is the only fix, where they stitch the muscles back together with mesh to hold it since the connective tissue has ripped.</li>
            <li> His back healed quickly as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m at 1 finger wide, and I can feel how strong the tissue is now.</li>
            <li> Almost 3 weeks into it, my whole back pain on my right side which I hurt from the gym</li>
            <li> /&gt;Christopher&#x27;s fits the bill in that regard, but taking 6 capsules of anything every day is a bit much, esp if you&#x27;re also trying to fit in a multivitamin or any other supplement.</li>
            <li> Also, I have developed very sore breasts, it is not that time of month</li>
            <li> he was quite surprised at how much it had healed in just a month.</li>
            <li> he walks normally.</li>
            <li> will take a few more bottles before I know.</li>
            <li> Threw it away and got a new chair.  </li>
            <li> I do have to laugh as these two little bottles are delivered in a very large box.  </li>
            <li> and  always  very sensitive.  </li>
            <li> Small amounts are said to be safe</li>
            <li> has completely healed!  </li>
            <li> Nonetheless as created and recommended by the late but still reliable Dr. Christopher, it is a great healer for wounds and other breaks.</li>
            <li> This is no magic pill still waiting on the result reviewers have boasted about, the magic hasn&#x27;t happened for me yet..</li>
            <li> This product helped me to become pain free as well as take the swelling down.  </li>
            <li> After a week on this product I felt less pain and huge improvement with my flexibility.</li>
            <li> Got the product quickly and as expected.  </li>
            <li> : I&#x27;ve taken this pill for several months and haven&#x27;t seen any positive results or any results at all.</li>
            <li> It was still kind of weak.</li>
            <li> I had a small wound on my hand and while taking this it healed pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> So far, I cannot tell a difference between before and after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I really feel that my back is healing.</li>
            <li> Again to early to tell...</li>
            <li> I have purchased to reduce or provide complete recovery for the condition</li>
            <li> This works well in conjunction with Dr. Christopher&#x27;s Complete Tissue and Bone Ointment.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I started taking Dr. Christopher&#x27;s Complete Tissue and Bone 3 pills 3 x a day.  </li>
            <li> I developed pain in my lower back/right hip</li>
            <li> Take as directed for at least 2 weeks, and you will feel something change for the better.</li>
            <li> I had taken up tai chi and yoga along with daily stretching, but didn&#x27;t see much improvement.</li>
            <li> I am so grateful for companies like this who take the natural and DO NOT GOUGE the customer as if they made rocket science.  </li>
            <li> When it happened to me a month ago, my podiatrist (who&#x27;s also a surgeon} put my foot in a soft aircast.</li>
            <li> so was looking for any natural remedies.</li>
            <li> This item gave me just what I needed for my tissues and bones to become complete.</li>
            <li> I think the pills helped in not setting me back to much.</li>
            <li> After an all day sport event (40 days into taking \\&quot;Complete Tissue and Bone</li>
            <li> I will continue with this together with the ointment Complete tissue and bone ..</li>
            <li> Definitely my natural remedy go to from now on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural so why not get a boost of herbs and roots?</li>
            <li> Within a few days, everything felt better, including the left elbow.  </li>
            <li> But works as well with any kind of post surgery situation as well, even broken but repaired injuries.</li>
            <li> the other hand, I&#x27;ve been taking Dr Christopher&#x27;s Herbal Calcium since last September and that seems to be fine.</li>
            <li> my proof it&#x27;s actually doing SOMETHING Is my super thin bendy nail get so strong and long when I am taking this, which is just a bonus.</li>
            <li> It looks like it&#x27;s been helping all the major scarring on my legs and the tissue around my chest feels fuller.</li>
            <li> I tried all kinds of both herbal and medicinal products as I have slight bone damage in my right hand, this product made no difference to the pain or bone density.</li>
            <li> Especially used for our boys when young and receiving playground injuries.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s called Nature&#x27;s Way Alive Calcium Bone formula - only 2 tablets per day).</li>
            <li> I bought this in conjunction with the complete back salve.  </li>
            <li> If you buy Dr Christopher&#x27;s book the &amp;#34;School of Natural Healing&amp;#34; it gives all the formulas with their proportions in the back of the book.  </li>
            <li> My foot blew up like a balloon … and just when the swelling was going down from the first injury.</li>
            <li> The only thing different I had added to my diet was the Dr Christopher&#x27;s Complete Tissue and Bone Formula.  </li>
            <li> This stuff heals broken bones, cuts and tissue damage very quickly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to make unreasonable claims about this or any product or portray it as a miracle drug, but I personally expect to continue taking it for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have not taken it long enough.  </li>
            <li> I previously had the ointment complete bone and tissue.</li>
            <li> His joints felt in place and solid (they were always loose, so they popped out at times).</li>
            <li> Perhaps I needed to give it longer, but it&#x27;s difficult to take this many tablets (in addition to all my other vitamins and supplements) as a long-term solution or preventative</li>
            <li> my back pain is at a minimal now.</li>
            <li> After using this formula along with the Tissue and Bone Ointment for only 1 week, the incision has finally closed and the swelling is gone.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my symptoms, and it took me as long to recover as my doctor said it would.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed as long as I&#x27;m taking this stuff</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge believer in natural medicine or quack practitioners trying to rip people off, however, Dr. Christopher&#x27;s products have opened my eyes a bit.</li>
            <li> OTC products work better and are less expensive.</li>
            <li> I turned to a master herbalist for help, and he recommended this formula in combination with several other Dr. Christopher&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> He told me that while the other formulas he was recommending would do various things to help me, this was the one that would heal me.</li>
            <li> it has helped heal a little what ever was wrong, will keep taking it and order more when i run out.</li>
            <li> My jaw seemed to improve VERY slightly, but the bottle only lasted me a couple of weeks because the dose is 2 tablets, 3 times a day (6 per day in total).</li>
            <li> My wife went in for a bunionectomy where they cut the big toe bone in half slide the upper portion over and then shave the bone until it is even with the other portion.  </li>
            <li> In addition to that, I had fallen down the stairs and injured my left elbow and could not straighten out my arm.  </li>
            <li> He wanted surgery to be a last resort (as did I!), so he said he would see if there was a slight chance that the bones would heal by themselves.</li>
            <li> The bottle is still over half the bottle left.</li>
            <li> Right before I started taking two capsules three times a day, I&#x27;d trimmed my nails all the way down because I was tired of them breaking all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I do notice a little difference in pain when I take these on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li> also really help with broken bones</li>
            <li> I followed Julie Tupler&#x27;s technique and closed it 4 times</li>
            <li> Now with the combination of the two, the diastasis is almost closed.</li>
            <li> I used this with the ointment applied topically (be careful, it stains.</li>
            <li> I usually not  write review because I am very lazy.  </li>
            <li> Not really in pain like before...</li>
            <li> The  supply always arrives before the expected date</li>
            <li> /&gt;Looking for other vegetarian options . . .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my other aches and pains have vanished.</li>
            <li> if take as directed but would help if in a lot of pain and cheaper than other alternatives.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husbands severe carpal tunnel pain in one wrist that no amount of bracing seemed to help (the braces actually made it worse even though he only used them in order to sleep without shooting pain).</li>
            <li> I may feel a little stiff the next day</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift to a person who fell off of a ladder, and complained of back pain.</li>
            <li> All of the negative reviews I&#x27;ve found I could personally see their errors.  </li>
            <li> I am now down to 8 a day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking this supplement for a few weeks now, due to knee issues.</li>
            <li> I noticed again some slight breast tenderness but the pain in my lower back/hip/joint area</li>
            <li> I can now walk with less pain..</li>
            <li> literally within a week he was reporting dramatic improvement and within a couple weeks he was back to work as usual (he works on antique cars which requires extensive use of wrists and hands).</li>
            <li> My massage therapist recommended this to my husband who suffers from knee pain (he needs replacement but isn&#x27;t ready!).  </li>
            <li> (I started at 4 fingers wide), but the slightest wrong move and it ripped open again.</li>
            <li> Within a few weeks, his tumors were also gone.</li>
            <li> I have taken this since my fall a few weeks ago</li>
            <li> is 80% decreased after only one day of taking tissue and bone formula.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I will have to update this after using the product for a few months.  </li>
            <li> I firmly believe that it was the Tissue &amp; Bone capsules and Tissue &amp; Bone ointment which helped my foot to heal.</li>
            <li> The metal plates and poor setting causes her constant pain which worsens of course in the winter.</li>
            <li> I am getting this for my mom who shattered her ankle a few years back and had a botched patch up at kaiser (you can see how poor it was even looking at her scar</li>
            <li> I had a bad fall about a month ago and fractured the fifth metatarsal of my right foot.</li>
            <li> husband takes these has not said much about it takes other pills also  but has not said any thing bad either</li>
            <li> The problem is that I don&#x27;t know whether the pain reduction is due to actual healing or merely the blockage/numbing of pain?  </li>
            <li> They both have fibromyalgia,  which causes chonic pain &amp; muscle spasms, along with a whole host of other painful symptoms.</li>
            <li> I have patellar tendinitis and stiff knee issues.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, when I returned to work this morning after a week&#x27;s vacation and got on my computer to look busy, I realized there&#x27;s some substantial growth that was not there a mere five days ago - past the tips of my fingers in just a week&#x27;s time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was skeptical whether it would work or not, but I had pain in all of my joints and could barely move.  </li>
            <li> I quit three years ago and that&#x27;s when my teeth started feeling loose and weak.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately I was left sore and bruised.</li>
            <li> I have found no better remedy, and this one is where I started.</li>
            <li> No more pain and no more braces.</li>
            <li> I fractured my spine and was in desperate need of relief, and wanting to keep in line with my all natural remedies.  </li>
            <li> So, am not really sure what to expect from using this but, to me, it&#x27;s worthless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using some oil that also works on the joints/pain, so I&#x27;m not sure which is doing what.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff on and off for the past 3 years.  </li>
            <li> I seem to heal up faster after a hard day of riding horses now that I am taking this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to judge the quality of something you cannot see, touch or feel.  </li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;d probably need to purchase at least 3 bottles to see if it would have the desired result.</li>
            <li> It made my hair and nails thick.</li>
            <li> (it was bad) to moderately moving my shoulder.</li>
            <li> My teeth are  no  good</li>
            <li> hope that  can be  helpful  for  somebody who are no good with their  teeth.</li>
            <li> It was so painful that I couldn&#x27;t take a deep breath.  </li>
            <li> Not that I was looking to have tough bones</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t discover this supplement until I was three weeks into recovery with a broken leg.</li>
            <li> Purchased to help my broken wrist heal faster.  </li>
            <li> I bought thinking it contained comfrey for accelerated broken bone healing</li>
            <li> they are NOT easily found ! ! !</li>
            <li> I broke my toe and after two and a half weeks fell on my bad foot and sprained it.</li>
            <li> Also, had twisted my knee about 6 months ago.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about trying this</li>
            <li> I believe it either exaggerated the symptoms of breast pain</li>
            <li> If you keep making the &amp;#34;Review&amp;#34; so difficult I will not ever  order anything from you.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In combination with other forumulas I have to say my bones feel TOUGH!!!!  </li>
            <li> I have some bad connective tissue cells and scar from things like bug bites and deal with some poor blood circulation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely afraid to try it again.  </li>
            <li> He also stood around instead of sitting, and was driving me crazy because he was always looming over me.</li>
            <li> In about two weeks I went from screaming bloody murder every time I breathed the wrong way or sat the wrong way or God forbid decided to go to sleep</li>
            <li> This stuff has the bad stuff removed.</li>
            <li> Too bad.  </li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t say anything bad about since I&#x27;m not facing any adverse problems.</li>
            <li> Had bad tendinitis in my ankle and thought this might help with healing.  </li>
            <li> A client of mine recommended this for my frozen shoulders, which are extremely painful, as well as a neck problem created from my work.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of weeks but I am feeling a noticable difference in my heel spur. Could be a coincidence, but I am happy! Also, had twisted my knee about 6 months ago. It was still kind of weak. Doing wonderful! I can bond it easily and full weight bearing. Again may be coincidental. . .</li>
            <li> I see a remarkable improvement in my fingernails and my skin is not nearly as dry, even as winter weather and indoor heat arrives.  GREAT NATURAL REMEDY.</li>
            <li> This formula is amazing. It helped my daughters dog recover from degenerative disk disease.  Of course it reoccurs but when he becomes paralyzed I just give it to him and he walks again in just about two days.by the end of two weeks he walks normally.</li>
            <li> This stuff heals broken bones, cuts and tissue damage very quickly. When I get banged up I take these pills. You cannot take comfrey internally by itself with out running the risk of kidney damage. Small amounts are said to be safe but I have never seen any directions or research to say how much. This stuff has the bad stuff removed.</li>
            <li> I will continue using this..</li>
            <li> Have been taking two a day because of knee joint pain. Knees much better after taking only a couple of weeks</li>
            <li> works like a charm my back pain is at a minimal now. Dr Christopher reeh for me love those are all good</li>
            <li> Work great for my daughter and myself.</li>
            <li> Not sure what the first bottle did for me soooo, purchasing a 3-pack. I figure by the time I finish those, I&#x27;ll get a sense of what&#x27;s happening if anything. Everything arrived on time and the product was packed well. Exp. date is 05/2019 so it&#x27;s good for awhile.</li>
            <li> I just appreciate all of Dr. Christopher&#x27;s items and find that they have helped me.  I keep this item (as well as two of  the pain rubs) on hand.  To me - a trusted product that works.</li>
            <li> This seems to be working...at my age, it helps to have the extra help in repairing whatever muscles or bones I happen to bruise while riding, gardening or whatever. I seem to heal up faster after a hard day of riding horses now that I am taking this. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and help heal cuts and sores in half the time. also really help with broken bones</li>
            <li> How does a duck go?  Quack. Quack.  And that is what this is.  Doesn&#x27;t work, despite going thru entire bottle, 2 pills 3x day.</li>
            <li> Great formula, heals and generates regrowth.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good about this product. A number of years ago, my daughter was diagnosed with a tumor in her leg. We never found out if it was malignant - the doctor simply told her it would need to be removed surgically. She began taking this formula and about 6 weeks later, the tumor was gone. In 2014, her husband was diagnosed with two tumors and was told they couldn&#x27;t rule out the possibility that it might be cancer. Remembering her own experience, my daughter suggested that her husband take the formula as well. Within a few weeks, his tumors were also gone. In September 2014 I was diagnosed with diverticulitis and was put on two extremely strong antibiotics. I had very bad reactions to both of them. I turned to a master herbalist for help, and he recommended this formula in combination with several other Dr. Christopher&#x27;s products. He told me that while the other formulas he was recommending would do various things to help me, this was the one that would heal me. I would have to have a cat scan to know if my inflammation is gone, but I am feeling and doing a lot better than when I began. I don&#x27;t want to make unreasonable claims about this or any product or portray it as a miracle drug, but I personally expect to continue taking it for a long time.</li>
            <li> I heard Dr Christopher speak in the 1980&#x27;s. I still believe in his products today!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking this supplement for a few weeks now, due to knee issues. So far, I cannot tell a difference between before and after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have some relatives taking Osteo Biflex who swear by the stuff, but since I am vegetarian, I was looking for a vegan option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christopher&#x27;s fits the bill in that regard, but taking 6 capsules of anything every day is a bit much, esp if you&#x27;re also trying to fit in a multivitamin or any other supplement. Wish I had known that was the recommended dosage prior to purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking for other vegetarian options . . .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this formula for years.  The body is marvelous at healing itself if you give it the right building blocks.  This herbal formula is a potent form of good food which the body needs to get the job done.  We used it on my husband to regrow skin and tissue after a motorcyle accident (there was no scarring).  We took up to 15-20 pills a day and bandaged areas with a liberal application of the ointment.  I often use the ointment on any skin, bone or tissue problem.  I ALWAYS have this formula on hand!  I love it!</li>
            <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t think much of it.  Was even considering surgery, but decided to try out this formula.  Found him on youtube with his lecture on the School Of Healing, so I tried it out.  Almost 3 weeks into it, my whole back pain on my right side which I hurt from the gym has completely healed!  Now I can move my arm around without it hurting my back anymore.  Going to try out the comfrey herb, since this one didn&#x27;t come with it, but still very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hello, I&#x27;m here again!  It comes to find out that the chair I was using was messing up my back.  Threw it away and got a new chair.  During that time, my back on the side hurt like hell.  So I went back to the Bone and Tissue formula.  Within a week when taking it, that back pain has now FINALLY healed--AGAIN!  This stuff truly works.  Gonna&#x27; buy another batch very soon.</li>
            <li> Great product. Very pleased with all of Dr. Christopher&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok..... My feet still hurt maybe nothing will work</li>
            <li> This is one of the Best herbal formulas for back problems. I have taken this since my fall a few weeks ago and I really feel that my back is healing. Another great herb that I take for pain is Cayenne pepper. It starts to work within 15 mins. Great herbs!!! And, they work and don&#x27;t have any side effects. Thanks for reading my review. If you would like to read Dr Christophers Herbal legacy testimonials...click on the link or type it in....[...]</li>
            <li> I had a small wound on my hand and while taking this it healed pretty quickly.  I think it works pretty well, felt good overall, sex drive was up too. That is always a plus. My husband felt the same way good overall.</li>
            <li> very happy with product !  Has helped with low back pain that I experienced quite often. Will purchase more for sure.</li>
            <li> After having several kids, I ended up with a diastasis recti (separation of the abdominal muscles). Most doctors will tell you surgery is the only fix, where they stitch the muscles back together with mesh to hold it since the connective tissue has ripped. I followed Julie Tupler&#x27;s technique and closed it 4 times (I started at 4 fingers wide), but the slightest wrong move and it ripped open again. I finally found out about this supplement. I have been taking it for 3 months, and my connective tissue is very strong. Even with the strong connective tissue, it was MuTu System that finally helped me close the gap. Now with the combination of the two, the diastasis is almost closed. I&#x27;m at 1 finger wide, and I can feel how strong the tissue is now. I used this with the ointment applied topically (be careful, it stains. I wore a cami over the ointment to protect my clothes. That cami will never be fit for anything else, but a worthy sacrifice). There is one side effect I&#x27;ve noticed. I swear my eyelashes have gotten longer. I&#x27;m using the same mascara, but suddenly my eyelashes look pretty awesome! I&#x27;m thrilled about that! It could be something else, but I can&#x27;t imagine what. Even my husband noticed.</li>
            <li> I have not taken it long enough.  it has to get in your system before you can tell if it really works.  will take a few more bottles before I know.</li>
            <li> A client of mine recommended this for my frozen shoulders, which are extremely painful, as well as a neck problem created from my work. I&#x27;m almost finished with my first bottle. I&#x27;ve had many treatments, injections, chiropractic, PT, exercises....but the pain remained. Not now! This stuff is simply a miracle! I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s working, but it is!</li>
            <li> It works!  Reduced my dog arthritis pain.  She is walking now.  No medication just the herbals alone.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about trying this but I have to say it WORKS!!! Four months post-op from having 8 pins and a plate removed from my ankle, the incision was still not healed.  It was very red, swollen and draining.  After using this formula along with the Tissue and Bone Ointment for only 1 week, the incision has finally closed and the swelling is gone.  Amazing stuff!</li>
            <li> Again to early to tell...I need more time to see if this product works with the other&lt;br /&gt;products I have purchased to reduce or provide complete recovery for the condition&lt;br /&gt;being treated.</li>
            <li> I have osteoporosis and the owner of my health food store suggested this supplement and since I began taking this in combination with Ulta Silica my bone density keeps going up.</li>
            <li> This works well in conjunction with Dr. Christopher&#x27;s Complete Tissue and Bone Ointment. It has really helped me.I like all of Dr. Christopher&#x27;s formulas. I have rotator cuff damage in my right shoulder  and this formula is healing it. It beats having to endure surgery to repair it. It didn&#x27;t work over night, but it is helping. I&#x27;ve noticed my other aches and pains have vanished.</li>
            <li> My son plays sports.  He is taking this supplement on a regular basis and has felt the benefits.  It helps to keep the bones and tissue healthy.</li>
            <li> I have been having lots of pain and soreness for 7 months now caused by surgery, when will I learn to avoid doctors?  Anyway, I started taking Dr. Christopher&#x27;s Complete Tissue and Bone 3 pills 3 x a day.  I&#x27;ve also noticed improved digestion and I feel better internally.  I&#x27;m going to try this for a month to see if it stimulates actual healing.  Within the first couple days my pain had reduced dramatically.  I give it 5 stars for the fast reduction in pain which has made me feel more energetic, mobile and positive.  The problem is that I don&#x27;t know whether the pain reduction is due to actual healing or merely the blockage/numbing of pain?  Also, I have developed very sore breasts, it is not that time of month so I am contributing it to the formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I experienced more than usual breast swelling/tenderness/soreness after taking this product 3 pills 3x daily for a couple weeks.  I believe it either exaggerated the symptoms of breast pain/swelling before cycle or induced my menstrual cycle.  I stopped taking it during the cycle and then unrelated I developed pain in my lower back/right hip/joint issue which did not go away for several days.  I restarted 3 capsules twice in one day.  I noticed again some slight breast tenderness but the pain in my lower back/hip/joint area is 80% decreased after only one day of taking tissue and bone formula.</li>
            <li> My teeth are  no  good and  always  very sensitive.  After taking this for a week, ( but only taking 4 /day) ,  I noticed  my teeth  feeling much better even when I take  sweet and it doesn&#x27;t bother me that much like before.  The gum also feels better and  stronger.  I usually not  write review because I am very lazy.  But for this,  I think I should  share my experience and  hope that  can be  helpful  for  somebody who are no good with their  teeth.</li>
            <li> Only 10 day supply if take as directed but would help if in a lot of pain and cheaper than other alternatives.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that my husband benefited from this product.</li>
            <li> worked great, along with Rolfing, to fix my broken wrist after surgery.  I returned to working as a manual therapist with my arms and hands after six weeks and the doctor said he could not see where the break was on the X-ray.  Herbs for the bones, rolfing for the soft tissue, it was an amazing recovery at 58. Doc though I&#x27;d be out for 3 to 6 months.  I am now recommending it to,others plus I think it helped reduce all over pain and inflammation.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, have been taking with his Joint formula and feel they are helping. Looking forward to upping dosage as recommended to see how well they can help me.&lt;br /&gt;Very impressed with the purity and concentration and variety of herbs. It would be so expensive to buy so many of what he has in these formulas.&lt;br /&gt;I find his products to be so well made and formulated with the intention of healing people and not getting rich on the wave of holistic medicine.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t rate it not for me husband takes these has not said much about it takes other pills also  but has not said any thing bad either</li>
            <li> Have used this stuff for 25 yrs. I love ALL Dr Christopher&#x27;s herbs. Used to be called BFC for Bone, Flesh, &amp; Cartledge. Will order from here again!!  Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!  I am only taking this product once a day instead of the recommended 3 (because that is all I can remember to do) and I have noticed a huge difference.  no joint pain!!!</li>
            <li> All Dr. Christopher formulations are excellent.  This has helped my injured tendons!</li>
            <li> Cleans and freshens, whether it changes condition of gums? I don&#x27;t know, I cannot tell but it does an ok job and no fluoride bulshit!</li>
            <li> ALL I CAN SAY IS WOW!!!!  IT WORKS!!! MY BONES FEELS STRONGER AND MORE FLEX IN MY KNEE. GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and the product is great!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t discover this supplement until I was three weeks into recovery with a broken leg. I was in a lot of pain and didn&#x27;t have signs of much improvement.  After a week of starting to take these capsules (9 to 10 a day) the pain and swelling began to improve swiftly. I also used the Tissue and Bone Ointment by Dr. Christopher.  The stuff works.</li>
            <li> Felt no difference after taking the product for a month in combination with ointment. Waste of money.  OTC products work better and are less expensive.</li>
            <li> If the overall &#x27;health&#x27; and feel of your body&#x27;s muscle and connective tissue needs some help, this will help. Take as directed for at least 2 weeks, and you will feel something change for the better. Seems great for Fibromyalgia. Less muscle fatigue, better muscle reaction, smoother feeling joint motion. One bottle convinced me, I&#x27;ll be ordering another shortly. It works great in conjunction with yoga.</li>
            <li> This product helped me more than I expected. It&#x27;s great and I give it two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Great product but they need to get over the comfrey scare and put the comfrey powder back in like it originally had.</li>
            <li> Dr. Christophers Tissue &amp; Bone is a great product.  Have used the ointment and oil with much success and decided to use this in conjunction with them.  I feel like it has helped my knees.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical whether it would work or not, but I had pain in all of my joints and could barely move.  In addition to that, I had fallen down the stairs and injured my left elbow and could not straighten out my arm.  After 6 weeks of rest, ice, etc. and a CT scan I had been referred to an orthopedic doctor.  In the meantime, I started taking this.  Within a few days, everything felt better, including the left elbow.  It has been about 3 weeks and I still have some pain, but I am encouraged to keep taking it.  This may be as good as it gets or I may have some more improvement, but either way, it is certainly worth the price.</li>
            <li> I started taking these pills because I have issues with my knees.  I took it for about three days, and the pain that I was feeling in my knee went away.  That was amazing to me, and the pain has not come back.  I love this product.</li>
            <li> Joint Pain Much Better. Great Product</li>
            <li> Got this and the companion ointment for my husband, the results of the two have been amazing, his arthritis, carpel tunnel, and general back and leg pain have seen tremendous improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: My husband has been using this for over a year now, he uses it daily to alleviate the aches and pains of getting older, still very impressed with the product and the results!</li>
            <li> have gotten them for a long time and like them good product will buy again when needed good good good</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift to a person who fell off of a ladder, and complained of back pain. He said the product seemed to lessen the pain.</li>
            <li> The product arrived in great shape and I&#x27;m taking them hoping for promising results.  I&#x27;ve only received rave reviews on Dr. Christophers products and I&#x27;m sure that this one is great too.</li>
            <li> My wife went in for a bunionectomy where they cut the big toe bone in half slide the upper portion over and then shave the bone until it is even with the other portion.  I started my wife on these about two weeks before the surgery.  At four weeks after the surgery, my wife went back to work, and the Dr. said her progress was equivalent to someone at six weeks recovery.  At each visit with the Dr., he is is very pleased with her progress.  She is still taking six a day.</li>
            <li> Dr. Christopher and his children/grandchildren provide instruction in how to make formulas, teas, etc. and how to keep ourselves healthy. I recommend all his products and books.</li>
            <li> Huge improvement in carpal tunnel syndrome and tendonitis. Truly amazing herbs.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this before as per my Chiropractor.  Definitely helps with torn ligaments.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a year.</li>
            <li> Originally called B, F &amp; S for bones, flesh and sinew it has been renamed numerous times. Nonetheless as created and recommended by the late but still reliable Dr. Christopher, it is a great healer for wounds and other breaks. Especially used for our boys when young and receiving playground injuries. But works as well with any kind of post surgery situation as well, even broken but repaired injuries.</li>
            <li> A friend told me about this product, I take it for sore hands, they get sore from over use, this helps them feel better.</li>
            <li> My husband is taking the VegCaps, and within about 5 days he could tell a difference.  We are greatly pleased!</li>
            <li> it arrived quickly.  when i use this it helped my heel it has been very painful and i was being told that i probably needed foot surgery on it and i did not want any kind of surgery done on my feet so i started taking this it it has helped heal a little what ever was wrong, will keep taking it and order more when i run out.</li>
            <li> This product seems to work fine and the shipping was prompt, but we haven&#x27;t seen huge changes from using it, but it might take more time for any significant changes to occur.  I would still recommend it for those who find it&#x27;s properties useful for their condition.</li>
            <li> Not it&#x27;s fault - I sent it back unopened  because I couldn&#x27;t really figure out why I had  bought it!  Did I really need???  I just got caught up in the hype.</li>
            <li> Cant tell if the formula works or not for my cat yet, but doesnt seem to have any side effect after feeding her for a month now.</li>
            <li> I think I may be allergic to something in the formula.  After I used it for two days in November, I had a severe coughing fit in a public place where I could not catch my breath.  It scared the hell out of me.  I haven&#x27;t had one since.  The only thing different I had added to my diet was the Dr Christopher&#x27;s Complete Tissue and Bone Formula.  I&#x27;m definitely afraid to try it again.  Too bad.  Other people get such great results from the formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, I&#x27;ve been taking Dr Christopher&#x27;s Herbal Calcium since last September and that seems to be fine.</li>
            <li> Helped heal my husband&#x27;s Achilles tendon! :) Would buy again!</li>
            <li> The stitches in my hand healed in record time. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Seems to have helped as I am no longer in pain from 3 herniated discs.  I&#x27;m also wearing biomagscience magnets.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge believer in natural medicine or quack practitioners trying to rip people off, however, Dr. Christopher&#x27;s products have opened my eyes a bit. This product is remarkable! I have patellar tendinitis and stiff knee issues. For months I&#x27;ve not been able to bend or extend my knee without lots of pain and discomfort. I had taken up tai chi and yoga along with daily stretching, but didn&#x27;t see much improvement. After a week on this product I felt less pain and huge improvement with my flexibility. My PT and Chiro were blown away by how much movement I have regained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I doubt this is a cure for the problems I have, but it has certainly been helpful and I plan on sticking with it for a couple months to see more improvement. I&#x27;ll post a review after a couple months to follow-up.</li>
            <li> It made my hair and nails thick. The pills have no weight to them be sure and take them with food. So disipointed I really wanted to be a ninja but unfortunately I was left sore and bruised.</li>
            <li> Started here: See my review for the Cayenne formula. These two in combination are tremendous. I have found no better remedy, and this one is where I started. Relief was instant and prolonged. I have used these formulas every day since I began using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the formula. It will work wonders!  Thank you</li>
            <li> I purchased this initially to help strengthen my teeth -- they are in fakakta shape because I smoked for 27 years. I quit three years ago and that&#x27;s when my teeth started feeling loose and weak. I think the tar and nicotine helped cement them in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ve been taking these capsules a couple of weeks now, and the sensitivity I was experiencing disappeared. I&#x27;ve not seen a lot of tightening yet gum-wise, but feel confident that if I stick with this it will happen. But the sensitivity issue is a huge thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, I didn&#x27;t even think about the positive benefits it would have on my nails. Right before I started taking two capsules three times a day, I&#x27;d trimmed my nails all the way down because I was tired of them breaking all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, when I returned to work this morning after a week&#x27;s vacation and got on my computer to look busy, I realized there&#x27;s some substantial growth that was not there a mere five days ago - past the tips of my fingers in just a week&#x27;s time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**singing** I feel pretty.....</li>
            <li> Got the product quickly and as expected.  This is a great product!</li>
            <li> what excellent product for skin. Google all the wonderful uses for this product too long for me to list</li>
            <li> I have Chondromalaica Patella and Christophers Bone and Tissue formula has helped me tremendously.  I took 12 a day for a month and thats when I noticed the difference.  I am now down to 8 a day.  You have to play with herbs to see what it is your body needs and you have to keep up on them.  They are not a pill you take once and it works.  It takes time for the benefits to be noticed.  I hope it works for you!</li>
            <li> Great product! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> my sister in law recommended this to me......so forever she will remain my friend,If you have any bone or back pain this might help.It works for me</li>
            <li> Really good stuff.  Look up on the Internet all the good stuff this guy does.  I am so grateful for companies like this who take the natural and DO NOT GOUGE the customer as if they made rocket science.  THIS IS GOOD GOD NATURAL STUFF and Dr. Christopher won with his combinations.</li>
            <li> I love the ointment of the same name.  I use it to negate the pain I feel from tendonitis and from osteoarthritis.  I have been using the capsules for about 3 weeks now and I do notice a little difference in pain when I take these on a regular basis.  I will have to update this after using the product for a few months.  I can say that I am going to purchase more for one simple reason:  When I take this formula, I do not need NSAIDs.</li>
            <li> I had a bad fall about a month ago and fractured the fifth metatarsal of my right foot. It&#x27;s a very bad break also known as a Jones fracture (one of the worst fractures you can get..Google it!). More often than not, this type of fracture requires surgery to pin the bones of the foot back together. When it happened to me a month ago, my podiatrist (who&#x27;s also a surgeon} put my foot in a soft aircast. He wanted surgery to be a last resort (as did I!), so he said he would see if there was a slight chance that the bones would heal by themselves. He was giving me a month in the cast, and if he saw no signs of healing then, he was going to schedule surgery. I left his office and did my research on the internet that night. This product, Dr. Christopher&#x27;s Complete Tissue &amp; Bone Formula, kept coming up with such great recommendations, I just had to try it. I ordered one bottle of it here on Amazon. I took it as recommended, 2 capsules 3x daily. I also ordered the Dr. Christopher&#x27;s Complete Tissue &amp; Bone Ointment, which is also available here on Amazon. I rubbed that ointment on my foot 3x daily.  I saw the doctor yesterday, and I&#x27;m thrilled to report that the bones of my foot are 65% healed, and he has ruled out surgery. I still have to stay in the aircast for another four weeks, but the doctor says my foot should continue to heal well, as long as I continue to take it easy, keep it in the aircast at all times, and don&#x27;t fall on it again.&lt;br /&gt;Even he was quite surprised at how much it had healed in just a month. I told him about the Dr. Christopher&#x27;s formulas. He had never heard of them, but he told me to keep on doing whatever it was that I was doing...lol! I firmly believe that it was the Tissue &amp; Bone capsules and Tissue &amp; Bone ointment which helped my foot to heal. It&#x27;s a wonderful supplement! I am the mother of six young children, and I work in the medical field, and I can honestly say that I&#x27;m blown away by how much this supplement has helped me. I do not even mind spending another four weeks in the aircast, now knowing that surgery is off the table.  I will continue to use the Tissue &amp; Bone for the next four weeks while I&#x27;m still in the cast, and I will always have a bottle on hand in my house in the future!&lt;br /&gt;(Also, I want to say that in addition to the Tissue &amp; Bone formulas, I took a calcium supplement which I think is also very good. It&#x27;s called Nature&#x27;s Way Alive Calcium Bone formula - only 2 tablets per day). You can get it at any vitamin store, and it&#x27;s also sold here on Amazon).</li>
            <li> I purchased this product hoping it would help with my TMJ disorder. I needed something to help repair the cartilage in my jaw joint. I used it in conjunction with the Dr. Christopher&#x27;s Ointment (applied externally). My jaw seemed to improve VERY slightly, but the bottle only lasted me a couple of weeks because the dose is 2 tablets, 3 times a day (6 per day in total). Perhaps I needed to give it longer, but it&#x27;s difficult to take this many tablets (in addition to all my other vitamins and supplements) as a long-term solution or preventative measure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that the bottle of this stuff is gone I&#x27;m trying glucosamine sulphate instead. It&#x27;s cheaper, the dose is 2 tablets/day, and a bottle will last me several months. If that doesn&#x27;t help my jaw improve then I might consider trying this again over a longer period of time. However, I&#x27;d probably need to purchase at least 3 bottles to see if it would have the desired result.</li>
            <li> My massage therapist recommended this to my husband who suffers from knee pain (he needs replacement but isn&#x27;t ready!).  He uses this product and notices that his knee pain has lessened since taking it - he even asks me to buy more when he runs out which is not normal!  It was packed very well and shipped to us quickly by this vendor.  All in all GREAT STUFF.</li>
            <li> Have been using almost a month. I felt my back getting better...Not really in pain like before...I think it could be help my bone...Thank you</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husbands severe carpal tunnel pain in one wrist that no amount of bracing seemed to help (the braces actually made it worse even though he only used them in order to sleep without shooting pain). I do not agree with surgery as an option so was looking for any natural remedies. I came across the Christopher&#x27;s site and started reading testimonials. I found one that a gentleman had written about his wife&#x27;s carpal tunnel being dramatically improved/cured with this product as well as the comfrey ointment so I decided to try both. He didn&#x27;t like the ointment so I just had him take two capsules of this every morning and literally within a week he was reporting dramatic improvement and within a couple weeks he was back to work as usual (he works on antique cars which requires extensive use of wrists and hands). I couldn&#x27;t believe it!  and neither could he. This product is a life saver. He works with his hands and without them we were very worried. No problems at all now : ) No more pain and no more braces. He took this product for a total of three weeks and there has yet to be any type of recurrence of symptoms. The bottle is still over half the bottle left. Truly fantastic!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope people continue to wake up to the world of healing herbs, vitamins and minerals all around them. Everything we need for a happy healthy existence is provided to us by the earth, not by doctors, surgery, synthetic pills or chemical additives in everything we consume.  : )</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. This item gave me just what I needed for my tissues and bones to become complete.</li>
            <li> I love this product and take it along with my Osteo BiFlex.</li>
            <li> Great for my knees.  Only took for a week and stopped.  Haven&#x27;t had any issues since.  Very valuable.</li>
            <li> This herb blend is great and has done wonders for my husband&#x27;s knee injury. Use it along with the ointment. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> Great product,  it was recommended to me by my holistic doc. The ingredients are more easily absorbed than most other products on the market.  I heartily recommend Dr  Christopher&#x27;s products!</li>
            <li> Product was delivered fast! I broke my toe and after two and a half weeks fell on my bad foot and sprained it. My foot blew up like a balloon … and just when the swelling was going down from the first injury. I started taking the Bone formula along with the Great Mender tea pills and the swelling was pretty much gone in four days. On the fifth day I went in for more x-rays as my doctor was back in the office in my area. I seem to be doing well on healing. I think the pills helped in not setting me back to much.</li>
            <li> I used this product for my son&#x27;s back after an injury with his spine. His knee used to dislocate along with his shoulder at times. He has had to wear a brace for extended walking or/and sports.I started him on 10 a day. After an all day sport event (40 days into taking \\&quot;Complete Tissue and Bone Formula\\&quot;), he came home to thank me.For the first time in his life (20 years old)he felt no pain in his knees or shoulders and he even did not need the brace. His joints felt in place and solid (they were always loose, so they popped out at times). His back healed quickly as well. His chiropractor was AMAZED at the results and the speedy recovery; he says , this formula rebuilds the connecting tissues. After two months, he now takes 4-6 a day for maintenance. To help him heal properly, I also bought him the cleanse formulas, also by Dr. Christopher. In order for the body to heal, we have to detox and cleanse. During his treatment he ate a healthy wholesome diet too. No meats and no dairy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might need to start with more than the recommended dosage to make an affect. It works if you give it time. Remember; they are herbs, so no side effects. Excellent product! Thank you, Dr. Christopher!</li>
            <li> Iam taking that product for several years and it has improofed my condition. If you keep making the &amp;#34;Review&amp;#34; so difficult I will not ever  order anything from you.&lt;br /&gt;That goes for the rest of items I ordered.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter &amp; my aunt. They both have fibromyalgia,  which causes chonic pain &amp; muscle spasms, along with a whole host of other painful symptoms. The most debilitating for them both is the leg &amp; back pain.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered 2 bottles on Dec. 3 &amp; they were delivered on Dec. 5. Plus I dont live in town, I live way out past where the road turns to dirt, so 48hrs is awesome. Theyve only used the tissue &amp; bone for 4 days, but both have noticed a decrease in pain &amp; an increase in motion. Which is what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> Dr Christopher&#x27;s products are awesome..  I previously had the ointment complete bone and tissue. I had a huge bruise come up on my leg rubbed it on a couple of times and it vanished... I am in hopes this will help some stomach issues I have been having..</li>
            <li> Product arrived in good condition</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, i have poor joints and I feel better when taking it, and my proof it&#x27;s actually doing SOMETHING Is my super thin bendy nail get so strong and long when I am taking this, which is just a bonus. I am getting this for my mom who shattered her ankle a few years back and had a botched patch up at kaiser (you can see how poor it was even looking at her scar, it&#x27;s uneven and wobbly up the straight part of her ankle). The metal plates and poor setting causes her constant pain which worsens of course in the winter. Hope this will help. I&#x27;ve also recommended this to anyone complaining of  injuries not healing well.</li>
            <li> I love Dr. Christopher&#x27;s products, I have had a great reduction in my pain since using it, there are many days where I don&#x27;t hurt at all!</li>
            <li> I have been in pain for almost 2 years with some problem in my hips and since I took this product from Dr. Christopher..(been taking this for about a week) .. I can feel there is improvement  in my hips I can now walk with less pain..I will continue with this together with the ointment Complete tissue and bone ..Will keep ordering before I run out of supplies..The  supply always arrives before the expected date how great this  company..And of course Amazon my favorite..Thank you</li>
            <li> Worth the money. Dr. Chris works. Need to reorder. The vegcap are great because I didn&#x27;t feel like I was choking. (I hate pills!)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product. My husband was suffering from sciatica, and hated taking longer car rides. He also stood around instead of sitting, and was driving me crazy because he was always looming over me. Well, in walk this little magic potion! His sciatica is GREATLY improved (I don&#x27;t know about cured.. Because what actually causes it?) BUT he can sit, take car rides and is just generally much more pleasant to be around. For the price, even if it takes for the rest of time, I consider it TOTALLY. WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> I bought this in conjunction with the complete back salve.  I fractured my spine and was in desperate need of relief, and wanting to keep in line with my all natural remedies.  This product helped me to become pain free as well as take the swelling down.  Definitely my natural remedy go to from now on.</li>
            <li> Awesome!!! Just as discribed. Shipped on time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking one pill a day for about a month now and there are no side effects of any kind. I can&#x27;t say that there was some kind of huge improvement because I didn&#x27;t have any major issues prior to wanting to take this. I have some bad connective tissue cells and scar from things like bug bites and deal with some poor blood circulation. It looks like it&#x27;s been helping all the major scarring on my legs and the tissue around my chest feels fuller. I also think it&#x27;s making my nails grow faster-- which is always a plus. Of course, I have no idea if this is what is doing it but I can&#x27;t say anything bad about since I&#x27;m not facing any adverse problems. It&#x27;s all natural so why not get a boost of herbs and roots? :) It&#x27;s such a great price as well!</li>
            <li> Helps my dental implant to heal faster.. My Dentist was so happy for the result.. I am satisfied as well as my dentist</li>
            <li> This product was delivered promptly! I am using it in conjunction with the ointment I purchased...I believe it is working, still need to give it more time.</li>
            <li> I tried all kinds of both herbal and medicinal products as I have slight bone damage in my right hand, this product made no difference to the pain or bone density. Save your money and eat a proper diet.</li>
            <li> Purchased to help my broken wrist heal faster.  Within a week of starting, I had progressively worsening muscle weakness in my legs.  Stopped taking it last week and the weakness is almost gone now.  It was the only change to my meds/supplements so I have to conclude it was the cause.</li>
            <li> Just finished one of two bottles. Bought them since my vertebra disks are worn and this might help to restore them. We&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> Good product! Always quick shipping.</li>
            <li> This stuff seems to make my belly a bit queezy but Does add to  the effects of using the ointment,Again i have to mention the possibilty of a placibo effect .Regardless i intend on using this to maximize the effect in my treatment of my joint,connective tissue and tendons on the arm that has been giving me troubles..</li>
            <li> Healed fast.  I was taking 4 pill dozes 3 times a day and some days more.  In about two weeks I went from screaming bloody murder every time I breathed the wrong way or sat the wrong way or God forbid decided to go to sleep (it was bad) to moderately moving my shoulder.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference</li>
            <li> I have been using the Complete Tissue &amp; Bone for a month now and just ordered 3 more bottles. I have a torn meniscus and the constant pain and inability to put weight on it and walk has dramatically improved. I&#x27;m impressed and relieved!  I&#x27;m glad I gave this a try! Surgery was NOT on my &amp;#34;things I want to do&amp;#34; list!</li>
            <li> Had bad tendinitis in my ankle and thought this might help with healing.  Didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my symptoms, and it took me as long to recover as my doctor said it would.</li>
            <li> Time will tell if this product helps . . . I am healing from a foot surgery. I&#x27;m hoping this product will help strengthen bone and replace damaged tissue.</li>
            <li> The product was okay, but could be better, I prefer Hammer nutrition tissue rejuvenator to this, but this is alot cheaper.</li>
            <li> Miracle worker!  I use with the cream to give my relief for my fibromyalgia.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a great bone and tissue product. I will be ordering a half a dozen more bottles soon and I am sharing these benefits with many of my friends and neighbors.</li>
            <li> I sent this to my elderly mother in England for her bursitis pain in her leg. She had no relief from medications, but immediate relief from the ointment and pills. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried this yet but based on the reviews I have read about it I am excited to try it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to judge the quality of something you cannot see, touch or feel.  Hoping these supplements work.  They are easy to take</li>
            <li> I buy 2 bottles of this product every couple months.  I am taking it because it was recommended.  I am assuming it is doing its job.  The price is better than what I was paying for it at the Health Food Store -- when they would have it which I couldn&#x27;t count on. The product is always delivered quickly.  I actually got it this time a day before I was expecting it.  I do have to laugh as these two little bottles are delivered in a very large box.  I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m not paying the shipping.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before, so I knew that it did not have ingredients that I am allergic to in it.  I was very happy to be able to purchase Christopher&#x27;s Bone and Tissue online.</li>
            <li> I have an issue with my SI binding up so whenever that happens I take 2 capsules every couple hours and it seems to help.  I really like using natural healing and the herbs in these capsules are excellent for many different issues.  I would recommend having them on hand as I hear they are great for bones as well.</li>
            <li> Hoping this is working. Can&#x27;t tell.</li>
            <li> thanks!  great product, and shipped quick.</li>
            <li> Pros: Fast Shipping -- Good Service&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I&#x27;ve taken this pill for several months and haven&#x27;t seen any positive results or any results at all. I think after I&#x27;m done w/ this bottle, I&#x27;m not going to take it anymore bc nothing is happening. I had used the balm too. I don&#x27;t see any results w/ that either. So, am not really sure what to expect from using this but, to me, it&#x27;s worthless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it did actually do something for you, that&#x27;s awesome but, for me, it just didn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> This is no magic pill still waiting on the result reviewers have boasted about, the magic hasn&#x27;t happened for me yet..</li>
            <li> I really have no idea what this did for my bones, but I think it helped rid me of candida!</li>
            <li> On Memorial Day, I fell and cracked some ribs.  It was so painful that I couldn&#x27;t take a deep breath.  I had heard about this product from a friend so decided to give it a try.  I was impressed because the doctor told me to come back in a month because it would take that long to heal, but I felt much, much better after 2 weeks, and I do think it was this product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I have carpal tunnel ( which is the original reason why I ordered) this helps  tremendously with my CP. I&#x27;ve also noticed as I am taking this my back and neck doesn&#x27;t hurt and ache all the time.</li>
            <li> WAS NOT DOING ANYTHING FOR ME  WAS NOT WHAT I THOUGHT I STOPED TAKING THEM AFTER IT WAS UPSETING MY STOMACH</li>
            <li> I believe it&#x27;s fighting off some of the pain I should be feeling at this point in my life.  I&#x27;m using some oil that also works on the joints/pain, so I&#x27;m not sure which is doing what.  However, since I&#x27;m feeling so good, I think I will continue taking this product and also use the oil.  I have and will continue to recommend this product to friends/family.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for a couple years now when I found out I had chornic form of leukemia.  In combination with other forumulas I have to say my bones feel TOUGH!!!!  Not that I was looking to have tough bones but I&#x27;ve noticed that my joints feel great and I can run like when I was a kid.  If you don&#x27;t notice a difference drink plenty of water and review your nutrition.  Sometimes things you eat can nullify the beneficial effects of this and other great herbal combinations. All of the negative reviews I&#x27;ve found I could personally see their errors.  I think others who have used this can see the same errrors.  This stuff is great!!! 12/18/2015   I&#x27;d just like to add an addition to my original comments above.  I&#x27;ve been using this stuff on and off for the past 3 years.  I&#x27;ve noticed as long as I&#x27;m taking this stuff regularly I don&#x27;t get sore muscles after sports or strenuous work.  I may feel a little stiff the next day but it goes away quickly.  If you buy Dr Christopher&#x27;s book the &amp;#34;School of Natural Healing&amp;#34; it gives all the formulas with their proportions in the back of the book.  A lot of times I buy the formulas but sometimes I make them up myself with variation (of course) according to what my body needs.</li>
            <li> All of Dr. Christopher&#x27;s herbs have worked well for us.  Bought these for a friend with a tender stomach and he is doing fine with these.</li>
            <li> I bought thinking it contained comfrey for accelerated broken bone healing but when it arrived, it has no comfrey in it. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> seller did a great job of getting the product to us in a timely fashion...thank you!&lt;br /&gt;it is a good thing to carry Dr. Christopher&#x27;s herbal blends......they are NOT easily found ! ! !&lt;br /&gt;Christopher has great blends, and this is good for  &amp;#34;tissue and bone&amp;#34;, as well as for respiratory ills or digestive ills!</li>
            <li> i have amazing personal healing experiences using any and all dr christopher products. they never dissapoint!!</li>
