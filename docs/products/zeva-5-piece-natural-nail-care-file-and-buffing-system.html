            <li> I also purchased this kit to replace a kit from another company that I had for many years. I had tried using the drugstore brand buffing systems but they did not last for more than a couple of months. This Zeva kit looks exactly like my original kit and the quality seems to be very good. I have used it with excellent results.</li>
            <li> I have a bad habit of picking at my cuticles and the skin around my nails.  They always look terrible and dry.  Cuticle cutters only perpetuate the picking.  The first time i used the crystal file and oil on my cuticles and skin around my nails i was AMAZED how great they looked.  Better than any manicure ive gotten.  I will never use a cuticle cutter again.  So impressed!</li>
            <li> Best nail system ever!</li>
            <li> This is second one ... for a gift.  Works great.</li>
            <li> for a twenty-year-old kit.  Zeva makes a good product; this one looks like it will last as long as my original from another maker.</li>
            <li> I have been using Zeva&#x27;s nail care system for over five years. I am continuously impressed by the way Zeva&#x27;s products keep my nails healthy, and enjoy that Zeva products are all natural. I would recommend Zeva&#x27;s products to anyone who is looking for a way to maintain healthy nails. Zeva has remained the easiest, most effective, and only nail care system that I use. I plan to remain a Zeva customer for many years.</li>
            <li> My mother has been looknig for a set like this since her last one was no longer usable.  Unfortunatly, the company she bought from was out of business.  She found this set and loved them even more.  great product!</li>
            <li> This kit makes a self manicure the easiest thing you can do for beautiful, clean, natural nails.  I finish with the Nail Bright, and my nails look beautiful and clean.</li>

            <li> Very effective, efficient, and cost effective nail buffing kit. The nail file is great and works really well on fragile nails. The buffing system is very nice; you shouldn&#x27;t use the more abrasive ones more often that once or twice a week though you can shine them daily. The cuticle oil is moisturizing but not oily. It does have a noticeable tea tree oil scent but it is not objectionable. I also like that you can purchase the buffing files separately to keep the system up to date.</li>
            <li> This set has everything you need to take care of you nails. All files are of good quality and the case is nice and sturdy enough both for storage and for travel. I also liked the included oil pen for the cuticle.</li>
            <li> I have had one of these, nail care systems before and love it. It really does help your nails to grow stronger. I was happy to find it on Amazon as the one I originally bought was beginning to wear out. I had my original set for several years so it is worth the money. Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This is my second Zeva set. I had the first one for 13 years! The main crystal file was still fine, but the other 3 had finally started to wear out. I would say this set is well worth the money since it lasted so long. It works GREAT on my nails. I really love it.</li>

            <li> I bought a similar nail care set 10 years ago and lost the file.  I tried several replacements which were very inferior.  I stumbled upon this set and MAN, AM I GLAD I DID!  The file is almost exactly like the one I lost.  It seals up the tip and prevents peeling and splitting.  The buffing pads leave your nail surface shiny and smooth.  I love it!  If its like my last set, it&#x27;ll last for years.  Good buy!</li>
            <li> Great products with use and care instructions. Very fast well packaged shipment, thank you.</li>
            <li> My nails have improved beyond my expectations!  They are smooth and even, no snags or splitting.  I love this system!</li>
            <li> I love how fine this files in comparison to the glass files without taking too much length from the nail.  I haven&#x27;t used the buffing files yet!  No need to, that&#x27;s how good the ruby crystal file is!!!</li>
            <li> Love it! Lasts for years.</li>
            <li> It really helps to make my nails stay clean and looking healthy, whether I use polish or not.</li>
