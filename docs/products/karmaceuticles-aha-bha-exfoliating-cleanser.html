            <li>I liked it but those with sensitivity to citrus oils may want to reconsider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>also be used as a mask, and I find it works better if you exfoliate before</li>

            <li>love the smell and feel of this cleanser</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle and the exfoliating granules are extremely fine but the product is very effective.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, makes my face feel smooth and polished.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that it &amp;#34;reduced&amp;#34; any fine lines.</li>

            <li>Love this face wash, exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Can</li>
            <li>But my faces feels clean after washing without any dryness.</li>
            <li>Rinses off well, leaves skin &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean.  </li>
            <li>I used this cleanser as a part of my evening skin routine and it left my skin feeling nice and clean.</li>
            <li>Of all the products my dermatologist recommended, this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>I rarely get them anymore.</li>
            <li>However, since using the CeraVe line, my face is not so sensitive any more, but this product still feels too grainy for my taste.</li>
            <li>It has lots of great ingredients (such as glycolic and lactic acids) and natural jojoba beads.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Neutral: This cleanser has a distinct citrus scent.</li>

            <li>it leaves my skin feeling clean, smooth, refreshed and gives it an extra glow.  </li>
            <li>Do consult a dermo or esthetician before ordering however, as it may or may not be right for your skin type, or may need to be combined with other products to be wholly effective.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this would be a softer exfoliating cleanser than others (including high end brands) - and it its...but not as fine grained as I need for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>A gentle exfoliator that softens the skin and doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol.</li>
            <li>is much cheaper.</li>
            <li>: I&#x27;ve been looking for an exfoliating cleanser and thought this one looked promising.</li>
            <li>It does a nice job of cleansing the skin without being harsh.</li>
            <li>This review is based on my experience with my (mostly) normal</li>

            <li> A gentle exfoliator that softens the skin and doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol. I don&#x27;t know that it &amp;#34;reduced&amp;#34; any fine lines. But my faces feels clean after washing without any dryness.</li>
            <li> Of all the products my dermatologist recommended, this is by far my favorite. I use it once a day, in the morning, and my skin feels so soft all day long. Very gentle and the exfoliating granules are extremely fine but the product is very effective. I&#x27;m 50+ but would recommend this to women of all ages.</li>
            <li> Love this face wash, exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Can also be used as a mask, and I find it works better if you exfoliate before and after you apply the cleanser.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Fabulous!  Best exfoliating cleanser I have ever used and smells great.  Wonderful lemon scent.</li>
            <li> Great smelling, great exfoliating face wash that is a pleasure to use. Rinses off well, leaves skin &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean.  Clears up dry skin patches and blackheads!  Makes skin look fabulous.  This one is a keeper- great price for a good amount, it does just what it says it does and more, smells great and improved skin condition!&lt;br /&gt;Even has the larger refill bottle!  Great find on AMAZON!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, makes my face feel smooth and polished. I bought a few bottles so I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> WHAT A FIND! If your dermatologist recommends this product, buy it here instead and save $20-$40! AHA and BHA foaming wash w/Jojoba Oil micro beads leave skin free of flakes and smooth, as well as helping to combat redness and/or rosacea. Do consult a dermo or esthetician before ordering however, as it may or may not be right for your skin type, or may need to be combined with other products to be wholly effective.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cleanser for the last 3 years and my cystic acne has been healed. I rarely get them anymore. I was introduced to this cleanser by the woman who does my facials and buying from Amazon is much cheaper. I use this along with the sage and citrus moisturizer.</li>
            <li> LOVE THE PRODUCT ! However it came in a busted bottle.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would be a softer exfoliating cleanser than others (including high end brands) - and it its...but not as fine grained as I need for my sensitive skin.  However, since using the CeraVe line, my face is not so sensitive any more, but this product still feels too grainy for my taste.</li>
            <li> this cleanser is a little too harsh for my sensitive skin to use everyday.</li>
            <li> Caveat: Different skin, different results. This review is based on my experience with my (mostly) normal skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: I&#x27;ve been looking for an exfoliating cleanser and thought this one looked promising. It has lots of great ingredients (such as glycolic and lactic acids) and natural jojoba beads. I used this cleanser as a part of my evening skin routine and it left my skin feeling nice and clean. I also liked the pump dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutral: This cleanser has a distinct citrus scent. I liked it but those with sensitivity to citrus oils may want to reconsider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: While it was cleansing, I am not sure it was exfoliating as I did not notice any smoothing or brightening of my skin. The jojoba beads sank to the bottom due to the thin consistency of the cleanser. Of course, I did not realize this until it ran out of beads within a week or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Considering the cost, I was hoping for much more from this cleanser. I will not be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cleanser,  it leaves my skin feeling clean, smooth, refreshed and gives it an extra glow.  My skin feels great every time I have used this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it 2x a day and follow with my face serum.</li>
            <li> love the smell and feel of this cleanser</li>
            <li> Did not do anything for my skin. Half the bottle had to be discarded.</li>
            <li> great for your skin and it was just as recommended by a close friend</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Cleared up my blemishes quickly and exfoliates my skin very well.  Great buy!</li>
            <li> I have aging, dryer skin and have been using this cleanser daily for over a year and I love it!  It does a nice job of cleansing the skin without being harsh.</li>
