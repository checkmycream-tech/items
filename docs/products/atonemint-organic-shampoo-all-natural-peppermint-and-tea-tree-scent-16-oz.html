            <li>Great shampoo.</li>
            <li>Smells good, cleans great, and is organic.</li>
            <li>I seldom write reviews, but I find the lack of reviews for this product to be surprising.  </li>
            <li>It has a very pleasant aroma to it that doesn&#x27;t come off too strong.</li>
            <li>Very good clean product!</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo because there are no harmful chemicals, and you don&#x27;t need to use alot to get a great wash.</li>
            <li>A very refreshing mint scent emits from the bottle.</li>
            <li>I initially liked the smell, and how well it suds up.</li>
            <li>Not to fragrant, lasts a while, effective, and reduces flakes</li>
            <li>Leaves hair feeling clean and smelling great.</li>
            <li>I know natural products don&#x27;t always work the best</li>
            <li>The natural tea-tree oil is an excellent scalp moisturizer, which helps keep dandruff from occurring, and also smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>real clean ,sans chemicals</li>
            <li>This product is ok but not what I was hoping for.  </li>
            <li>I thought it would be a bit more minty</li>
            <li>No problem with it but looking for something more.</li>
            <li>Plus, I should note that my package contained some flyers on men’s health and a sample of another Fromonda product, which I enjoyed.</li>
            <li>I have tried many shampoo products .</li>
            <li>All organic and vegan approved isn&#x27;t important to me, but it&#x27;s made in the USA, which I&#x27;m glad to support.</li>
            <li>After a lifetime of using cheap shampoo, I decided to try something better and see if it made a difference.</li>
            <li>Good quantity at a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is excellent on all counts, and I really don&#x27;t want to go back to the cheap stuff, so I think we have a winner.</li>
            <li>All natural, smells good, leaves me feeling clean.</li>
            <li>I prefer a shampoo that leaves my head feeling squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li>I still wanted it to get my hair clean, though, so the search was on to find just the right product to fit this balance.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s overall a good product</li>
            <li>They told me that nowhere does it say all in one product, which is true, and the shipping was not based on 5 lbs.</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something more natural-</li>
            <li>Always a plus right?</li>
            <li>I was looking for something a little more natural, so I was pleased when I read into more of the details for &amp;</li>
            <li>shampoo is clear, not runny enough to pour out of my hand, and smells pleasantly minty- though not aggressively so.  </li>
            <li>Definitely buying more when this bottle runs out.</li>
            <li>Putting it on gives the clear indication that there is peppermint oil in the shampoo, without burning my skin or eyes, and gives me a clean feeling while waking me up.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Ultimately, it fulfilled everything I was looking for in a largely organic, nice-smelling, cleaning shampoo.  </li>
            <li>and we are much happier with that.</li>
            <li>It washes out clean, with no oily residue or excessive rinsing, and leaves my hair smelling nice for the entire rest of the day.  </li>
            <li>The smell, in particular... I&#x27;m going to go an see if they make an air freshener like this now.</li>
            <li>little bit of backstory: I had been using the “Every Man Jack” shampoo for a while, since it offered a relatively natural and pleasant smelling set of ingredients, but ultimately found it lacking.</li>

            <li>So then I thought maybe I wasn&#x27;sn&#x27;t washing it out completely and started using it again.</li>
            <li>When deciding on just which of these to use, I wanted something primarily natural and essential-oil based.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very cheap for an organic shampoo but trust me that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s a lesser product.</li>

            <li> Gets the job done well and leaves a subtle, fresh, smell in my hair for the day.  </li>

            <li> Overall, I have been using this for a few months now and my hair is still the same color and not balding.</li>
            <li> company also included some general wellness info and small product samples in the box.  </li>
            <li> NO THANKS!</li>
            <li> Going to try other products from this company.</li>
            <li> There are plenty of &amp;#34;Mint&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Tea Tree&amp;#34; shampoos around these days, from stuff by Paul Mitchell to &amp;#34;Every Man Jack&amp;#34; Shampoo, which I was previously using.  </li>
            <li> No suds, I have to dump half the bottle each time to wash my hair!</li>
            <li> The smell isnt very strong (in comparison to Paul Mitchel) and the lather was terrible!</li>
            <li> Not just small itchy spots, but it felt like I had lice.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s less expensive and not quite</li>
            <li> We both have very thick hair which is no problem at all for this shampoo.</li>
            <li> This was disappointing.</li>

            <li> I initially liked the smell, and how well it suds up. After a week of use I started getting itchy spots on my scalp. Not just small itchy spots, but it felt like I had lice. Once I realized it could be the shampoo I quit using it, and switched to another product for a week. The itchiness went away after a day. So then I thought maybe I wasn&#x27;sn&#x27;t washing it out completely and started using it again. Only this time I throughly rinsed my hair. But the ichiness came back after a couple of days of use. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something more natural- a version of Paul Mitchel Tea Tree shampoo- as my husband loves that stuff! This was disappointing. The smell isnt very strong (in comparison to Paul Mitchel) and the lather was terrible! I know natural products don&#x27;t always work the best but we have since found Arbonne and we are much happier with that.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling great, and smells like mint too. I love this shampoo because there are no harmful chemicals, and you don&#x27;t need to use alot to get a great wash.</li>
            <li> This product is ok but not what I was hoping for.  I thought it would be a bit more minty/refreshing.  No problem with it but looking for something more.</li>
            <li> I seldom write reviews, but I find the lack of reviews for this product to be surprising.  I was on the prowl for an alternative to the &amp;#34;Peppermint Cleanse&amp;#34; shampoo that I used for years, and this is definitely it.  Good quantity at a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my short buzzed haircut I prefer a shampoo that leaves my head feeling squeaky clean.  This product does just that without having to use a lot of product.  As advertised, it also has a great smell.  It also has a thicker consistency, so it doesn&#x27;t try to run out of your hand before you put it to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company also included some general wellness info and small product samples in the box.  I haven&#x27;t tried them, but my impression is that they put a lot of effort into their products.  All organic and vegan approved isn&#x27;t important to me, but it&#x27;s made in the USA, which I&#x27;m glad to support.</li>
            <li> I switched to this organic product from Paul Mitchell tea tree it&#x27;s less expensive and not quite the tingle but it&#x27;s overall a good product</li>
            <li> No suds, I have to dump half the bottle each time to wash my hair!</li>
            <li> There are plenty of &amp;#34;Mint&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Tea Tree&amp;#34; shampoos around these days, from stuff by Paul Mitchell to &amp;#34;Every Man Jack&amp;#34; Shampoo, which I was previously using.  When deciding on just which of these to use, I wanted something primarily natural and essential-oil based.  I still wanted it to get my hair clean, though, so the search was on to find just the right product to fit this balance.  I believe I’ve found that with &amp;#34;AtoneMint&amp;#34; by Fromonda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little bit of backstory: I had been using the “Every Man Jack” shampoo for a while, since it offered a relatively natural and pleasant smelling set of ingredients, but ultimately found it lacking. It contained Menthol to add that cooling sensation, and the “Tea Tree” aspect of the shampoo turned out to be only a fragrance, and not the addition of actual plant oil.  I was looking for something a little more natural, so I was pleased when I read into more of the details for &amp;#34;AtoneMint&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is clear, not runny enough to pour out of my hand, and smells pleasantly minty- though not aggressively so.  Putting it on gives the clear indication that there is peppermint oil in the shampoo, without burning my skin or eyes, and gives me a clean feeling while waking me up.  It washes out clean, with no oily residue or excessive rinsing, and leaves my hair smelling nice for the entire rest of the day.  The natural tea-tree oil is an excellent scalp moisturizer, which helps keep dandruff from occurring, and also smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, it fulfilled everything I was looking for in a largely organic, nice-smelling, cleaning shampoo.  Gets the job done well and leaves a subtle, fresh, smell in my hair for the day.  Plus, I should note that my package contained some flyers on men’s health and a sample of another Fromonda product, which I enjoyed.</li>
            <li> Got only ONE USE out of this before my girlfriend started making me share. We both have very thick hair which is no problem at all for this shampoo. It&#x27;s very cheap for an organic shampoo but trust me that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s a lesser product. A little bit goes a long way because it lathers up very well. It has a very pleasant aroma to it that doesn&#x27;t come off too strong. Definitely buying more when this bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> I have tried many shampoo products . This one seems to be great and I plan to continue using it. A great buy for the money.</li>
            <li> A very refreshing mint scent emits from the bottle. It does contain organic tea tree and peppermint. It also lacks sodium lauryl sulfate so your hair will not dry out as fast. Overall, I have been using this for a few months now and my hair is still the same color and not balding. Always a plus right?</li>
            <li> real clean ,sans chemicals</li>
            <li> I have rated this item before. It smells great. I rated last time that I thought the item was an all in one and did not like the amount of shipping. I was emailed by the company and corrected. They told me that nowhere does it say all in one product, which is true, and the shipping was not based on 5 lbs. Well I double checked the add again, and it does say shipping weight is 5 lbs. Then they proceeded to ask me to wait for new products in the future.  Umm not used to being berated and then solicited. NO THANKS!</li>
            <li> Dad swears by this and loves it</li>
            <li> They said it was organic but they left out the part where their ingredients say&lt;br /&gt;Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate&lt;br /&gt;Cocamidopropyl Betaine&lt;br /&gt;Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate&lt;br /&gt;Phenoxyethanol&lt;br /&gt;Tetrasodium EDTA</li>
            <li> Awesome item. Very good clean product!</li>
            <li> All natural, smells good, leaves me feeling clean.</li>
            <li> Smells good, cleans great, and is organic. There are some ingredients that have scientific sounding names but they are plant based organic extracts.</li>
            <li> After a lifetime of using cheap shampoo, I decided to try something better and see if it made a difference. Since I was going to spend real money, I wanted something that had no sulfates or any other problematic chemical, plus I wanted to like the smell and how it made my hair feel. This is excellent on all counts, and I really don&#x27;t want to go back to the cheap stuff, so I think we have a winner. The smell, in particular... I&#x27;m going to go an see if they make an air freshener like this now.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo. Leaves hair feeling clean and smelling great. Going to try other products from this company.</li>
            <li> Not bad. Not to fragrant, lasts a while, effective, and reduces flakes it seems. Doesn&#x27;t look a thing like the picture, but as shampoo that doesn&#x27;t matter. Its just odd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can be a little hard to get it to clean all your hair, but having no itching scalp makes up for it.</li>
