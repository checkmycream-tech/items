            <li>but once you do they work great!  </li>
            <li>this is the best product.  </li>
            <li>Very good product and price.</li>
            <li>i receive it in very good conditions</li>
            <li>These wraps work great.</li>
            <li>I feel an educated guest is a happy one</li>
            <li>I think they are great for removing the shellac polish.</li>
            <li>They are well made and the idea is great if it worked.  </li>
            <li>If you have someone helping you, they would be great.  </li>
            <li>I got a great bargain online and will buy them again.</li>
            <li>These wraps work great for taking off the gel polish.  </li>
            <li>works great as I am allergic to acrylic and no problems with this product.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>But, if you don&#x27;t mind paying for it, it&#x27;s a great idea.</li>
            <li>Great lov them good price</li>
            <li>I find them easy to use, and they do an excellent job of removing the shellac polish, without damaging my nail.</li>
            <li>Have faith, there are competent, intelligent and EXPERIENCED providers out there</li>
            <li>The wraps are a good concept but should be easier to adhere...</li>
            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>I tried them today and loved them.</li>
            <li>Band-aids (adhesive bandages) work just as good as wraps and at  fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>Using a cotton ball and foil is just as good.</li>
            <li>Once you get them on they work great, but when I&#x27;m doing my own nails</li>
            <li>The wraps are good quality</li>
            <li>Excellent and amazing product I recommended for every one because its a very interesting and useful product so buy it now!</li>
            <li>do not forget to buff all the shine off of you gelish top coat!</li>
            <li>I really love this product!</li>
            <li>Love them!  </li>
            <li>LOVE THESE!</li>
            <li>Lining it up can be a bit tricky, but once you got it, its very effective and easy to use.</li>
            <li>If you are doing your own nails</li>
            <li>I do my own shellac at home.</li>
            <li>Even so I wouldn&#x27;t want to do my own allergy injections</li>
            <li>If you are spending a fortune at the salon getting your nails done like I was, then you need to just buy your own kit and do them yourself.</li>
            <li>But to be honest, they are not the easiest to use on yourself.  </li>
            <li>You need to get your own acetone to soak the cotton pads on these</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>I bought these because I do my own soak off gel nails</li>
            <li>But they&#x27;re not 100% effective because they don&#x27;t always remove Shellac along the sides of most nails.</li>
            <li>The wraps are the best, so far.  </li>
            <li>These make it so easy to remove your gel/shellac nail polish!  </li>
            <li>THESE ARE VERY IMPORTANT...</li>
            <li>This product is OK.  </li>
            <li>I bought this item after reading some of the reviews that mentioned how they protected the hands from the drying effects of the acetone used to remove CND Shellac more than using cotton balls &amp; tin foil did.</li>
            <li>Also, that method seemed to work better, but maybe that was because the acetone on the wraps evaporated while I was</li>
            <li>*Invest in one of those pump top nail polish remover bottles -</li>
            <li>The ones that were literally dripping with Acetone worked much better.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know of any method that is better...</li>
            <li>I think they work better than the cotton ball method.  </li>
            <li>Most of the pieces will remain in the wrap.</li>
            <li>While both method&#x27;s work, I will continue to use the wraps since I find them to be more convienent, cleaner, better for my fingertips</li>
            <li>So glad I found them.</li>
            <li>The wraps are okay, but don&#x27;t seem to do anything better than at the salon where they use tinfoil and cotton balls.</li>
            <li>It takes some getting used to putting them on if you are doing it on yourself ( like me), but I love them now.</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ll order some more soon.</li>
            <li>If you practice doing each hand by itself, you will be able to wrap both hands at once, in no time.</li>
            <li>I read most of the reviews before deciding to purchase.</li>
            <li>I was able to apply them without any assistance; the material that they are made out of is stretchable and clingy without any adhesive.</li>
            <li>Not one of them slipped or fell off, and after about 13 minutes I removed them and most of the gel came off.</li>
            <li>work alot better.</li>
            <li>This will affect your future manicures as they work best on healthy nails...</li>
            <li>I would be ok with them if they were soaked with acetone, but they&#x27;re just a way to upsell a service.    </li>
            <li>The seller should have stated these do not come with acetone, if they did you&#x27;d have another issue with them drying out and would have to buy more (or use what you have at home).  </li>
            <li>I personally think these are a wonderful asset to use in removing your shellac polish.</li>
            <li>Would work better in a salon setting with someone else applying.</li>
            <li>You can wrap the cotton balls on your finger with some tin foil (this is how many salons do it).</li>
            <li>These were more of a hassle for me than a benefit.  </li>
            <li>The twisting motion gets most of the shellac off and the rest can be scraped off with an orange stick.  </li>
            <li>Glad I did . . .</li>
            <li>Much better.</li>
            <li>The 100 pack makes it more cost-effective.</li>
            <li>You would be better off just soaking your fingernails in a manicure bowl with acetone which works every time.</li>
            <li>really love these things.  </li>
            <li>Much better than the cotton ball and foil method.  </li>
            <li>Cotton balls wrapped with aluminum foil works way better for pennies.</li>
            <li>Aluminum foil works better.  </li>
            <li>Use this shellac weekly on my nails, love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping to find better instructions than I&#x27;ve used to make the purchase worthwhile.</li>
            <li>I would love to return them.  </li>
            <li>Why do I have to use so many words just to tell you I love it?</li>
            <li>I love the CND Shellac product</li>
            <li>Love these</li>
            <li>Perhaps I&#x27;ll get better with practice.</li>
            <li>- this allows me to preserve the most dexterity.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>These make changing polish from gel nail polish perfect super easy and not messy at all and can still use fingers while waiting for polish to come off!</li>
            <li>says:  As many professionals choose the cheap route as non-professionals.</li>
            <li>I was able to get a snug fit on my dominant hand</li>
            <li>This seems like a good idea, but it is much easier (and cheaper) to let the salon do this for you.  </li>
            <li>The wraps are easy to use and they keep the acetone on your nails and not on your hands.</li>
            <li>They are easy to  apply by yourself to either hand - unlike the salon foil method.  </li>
            <li>easy to use and wrap around the nails.</li>
            <li>Its easy and there are plenty of youtube videos to watch that will show you how to do them.  </li>
            <li>The shellac is easy to scrape off after about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Received the product very quickly.  </li>
            <li>So easy.  </li>
            <li>.makes removing the gel shellac easy.</li>
            <li>It takes me 20-25 minutes of soaking to get the Gelish to remove easily</li>
            <li>I felt it would be better to post a full review instead</li>
            <li>I love gel nails, and I think that using these at home is the easy quick way to get the removal taken care of.</li>
            <li>I knew when I was ordering them that they are coming w/o the acetone which was fine with me.</li>
            <li>I must not have read fine print</li>
            <li>The problem I had was that they are HUGE on my nails.</li>
            <li>However they&#x27;re not lying - the entire product line is GREAT.  </li>
            <li>To me it is worth the money, and I&#x27;m sure I will get faster with time.</li>
            <li>We go to a service provider to be pampered and to enjoy a relaxing experience.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t sound like you had either</li>
            <li>To use the pads that I do have, I cut the tabs off and cut 10 slices of tin foil, soak the pads and secure them on with the tin foil.</li>
            <li>I cannot and will not ever be happy with regular polish again.</li>
            <li>Very cumbersome to apply on your own.  </li>
            <li>the wrap around design securely tightens to my fingers, unlike the foil.    </li>
            <li>it made removal of shellac polish easy and a quick process.  </li>
            <li>and I think are worth the effort!</li>
            <li>and I am more than willing to keep them \\&quot;in the loop\\&quot; as it were.</li>
            <li>I find for me it is just best to soak the nails in a small dish instead.</li>
            <li>I love the shellac system, but am not so hot about these CND wraps.  </li>
            <li>It took a little practice to be able to wrap my fingers myself but they work great.</li>
            <li>I found a great video on youtube that shows a little of the removal and application :)   </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s well worth the 25 cents per finger for easy shellac removal.</li>
            <li>and I had nothing to clean up but to toss the wraps in the trash.</li>
            <li>I do a better job and take far better care of my nails than the \\&quot;professionals\\&quot; do.</li>
            <li>good way to take off shellac, not messy, easy and gentle on your nails and skin, i would recommend, enjoy</li>
            <li>the investment in the right products (like these wraps!)      </li>
            <li>Much easier, though more drying to the skin around the nail.</li>
            <li>therefore they do not make contact with the nail well enough to do a good job removing the gel.  </li>
            <li>Now that does sound exciting, tho</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true, using cotton pads/balls soaked in acetone, placing them on the nails and then wrapping each fingertip with foil</li>
            <li>You may need some help putting them on your dominant hand, but other than that they are great.</li>
            <li>Super Quality.</li>
            <li>Those work much better, particularly when used with plastic gloves.  </li>
            <li>A cotton swab, acetone and foil are adequate for this job and don&#x27;t cost 20+ dollars.</li>
            <li>I use these for Gelish removal and find that they work as quickly as the cotton ball and tin-foil method.</li>
            <li>I purchased these for my own usage but found that it&#x27;s not easy to manipulate on your own hands.  </li>
            <li>They are a great if your doing someone else&#x27;s nails but a complete waste of time if your doing your own.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and works fast to wrap your nails.</li>
            <li>Using cotton balls saturated in acetone and held in place with a little piece of foil is heck of a lot cheaper and much more effective.</li>
            <li>I will be replacing them with the kind that have the stretchy sticky bandage wrap similar to the ones OPI sells.  </li>
            <li>I found their instructions for salon professionals (which I am not) and thought you&#x27;d find it useful.  </li>
            <li>have compared both methods and found the wraps to be worth the price.</li>
            <li>word to the wise, the longer your nails are, the harder the wraps are to apply.</li>
            <li>For a manicure that lasts well over 2 weeks, without chipping, it&#x27;s totally worth</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t stay on - even after the video - and aren&#x27;t worth the price.</li>
            <li>Bottom-line, in my opinion, the remover wraps are a specific tool designed to be used specifically on your nails and that limits exposure to the drying effects of the acetone and holds the acetone more securely to the product during the 10 minutes required to sit with the wraps on, as opposed to using the cotton ball/foil method.  </li>
            <li>For me personally, it&#x27;s worth it, so I&#x27;ll use them over the cotton ball/foil method every time.</li>
            <li>To be perfectly honest, the end result is the same</li>
            <li>They are only partially effective, leaving the corners of your nails virtually untouched by the acetone.</li>
            <li>This product is useful if you don&#x27;t mind spending money on something you can do yourself.  </li>
            <li>For me the remover wraps stay on my fingers more securely so that I can perform light activities (i.e. use the remote of the TV)</li>
            <li>Clean the nail with pure acetone</li>
            <li>I ended up using half-rounds of cotton and tin foil on my right hand, and that was a lot easier to do.  </li>
            <li>so, i use these wraps and they work just right.</li>
            <li>I could do the right hand</li>
            <li>I am a licensed cosmetologist in California and it is true that most of the products and tools I use can be purchased from various retail outlets.</li>
            <li>You can only apply one hand at a time and the wraps fall off very easily.  </li>
            <li>You do have to leave them on for a full 15 minutes for them to really get the gel to come off, but if you do the polish scrapes right off no problem.  </li>
            <li>So far, the shellac has been peeling easily.  </li>
            <li>good product for shellac removal, little tricky to put on alone.</li>
            <li>The only difference I found was that these wraps are nicely packaged and have a little sticky tab to keep them in place where the foil/acetone soaked cotton ball is a do-it-yourself kind of project.</li>
            <li>It works exactly the way I had hoped it would.</li>
            <li>Ultimately, I got most of the shellac off using these wraps.  </li>
            <li>I find that the CND nail wraps are very difficult to get on when doing my own nails, though they&#x27;re great when working on someone else.  </li>
            <li>As a further tip, someone suggested roughing up the gel nail before soaking to allow more of the remover to soak in.  </li>
            <li>and then you&#x27;re ready for a re-Shellac service!    </li>
            <li>as I feel this item does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>If you choose to do your service at home and you are using the proper tools then more power to you.    </li>
            <li>okay, as I am left handed, but</li>
            <li>Guess I&#x27;ll trust their counting skills because I&#x27;m surely not double checking :).</li>
            <li>I initially bought these wraps because I read that they work better than the foil method of removing shellac.  </li>
            <li>Will absolutely buy again!</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly without the desired effect.</li>
            <li>These wraps are pretty to look at.</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend, much better than cotton pads and foil to get gel nails off.</li>
            <li>and I do not file the shine off the top as I have found that it takes the same amount of time either way.</li>
            <li>but I am able to put them on all of my fingers myself and with about the same difficulty as foil.</li>
            <li>it makes getting the right amount of acetone on the cotton ball much easier.  </li>
            <li>This item was designed to be used by the provider so they can quickly remove the gel coat and start a new service.</li>
            <li>I really think if they came in different sizes that would make it more practical.  </li>
            <li>If you have very long nails, you may more than 3 inches, so cut the foil in two or three pieces instead of four.  </li>
            <li>The wraps are much larger than I thought, and they can sometimes fall off easily.  </li>
            <li>The shellac will dry up and you won&#x27;t be able to remove it.  </li>
            <li>The remaining residue was easily removed with the wooden stick that was enclosed in the package.    </li>
            <li>Better to get a little container and fill it with acetone, comes off quickly and saves you money.</li>
            <li>I would certainly purchase this product again</li>
            <li>&#x27;S&#x27; - Saturate the cotton pad with pure acetone  </li>
            <li>These little things are amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had shellac manicures removed once \\&quot;professionally\\&quot; by soaking in a bowl of pure acetone &amp; scraping off the remnants, then I removed my own the second time (the same way I saw the manicurist do it).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised at the reasonable price for 10 polish removal&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>I have had shellac done by a manicurist, but recently began doing it myself after purchasing all the supplies and UV light.  </li>
            <li>Neither of those methods worked very well, as I still had to have the nails scraped to remove the shellac residue, with the result being some damage to my nail plate.     </li>
            <li>I had to do one hand at a time, but the Shellac came off much easier than any gel nail</li>
            <li>I recommend REALLY saturating the pads before using.  </li>
            <li>This works very well in removing the Shellac polish from my fingers fast and efficiently.  </li>
            <li>I really believe in the Shellac products.   </li>
            <li>I really like the CND shellac wraps.</li>
            <li>so they don&#x27;t seal well and because of that they don&#x27;t really keep the acetone off your finger and just on your nail.  </li>
            <li>If you repeatedly soak your whole finger (like you are doing when you smash a soaked cotton ball in tin foil)</li>
            <li>So much nicer than soaking your nails and fingers in acetone.</li>
            <li>I got the whole set up to do shellac gel polish for  myself.  </li>
            <li>While it is a neat concept, they don&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>They did not stay in place well and my shellac took much longer to remove than when I used some aluminum foil and part of a piece of cotton ball.</li>
            <li>which is no big deal since it&#x27;s so cheap to buy</li>
            <li>However, I question the whole concept of letting your nails soak in acetone.  </li>
            <li>These are very convenient but in all honesty just using aluminum foil and cotton pads work just as well and are a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t need these.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>and these seemed really convenient.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it&#x27;s nice to save a few bucks and remove it yourself.</li>
            <li>My 17 year old did ok, but I think I&#x27;ll ask my husband to do it next time.</li>
            <li>Mar. 19, 2011 11:24 AM PDT      J. Koester says:  Professionals (at least the good ones) recommend products or services because we think they will BENEFIT our clients.    </li>
            <li>You have to put your own acetone on them, and the pad area is HUGE, so I&#x27;m not sure how I will keep it from saturating the entire pad (which will then soak my fingers).  </li>
            <li>I was glad I read other reviews.  </li>
            <li>It took me 30 minutes to clean up all ten nails and it used to take me an hour with the foil method.  </li>
            <li>More effective than soaking, less messy --</li>
            <li>Ocassionally had my husband help me (which took the experience to a whole new level), but still too much time instucting and not getting the result that I was seeking.    </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not expensive, and they&#x27;re not messy.</li>
            <li>does work (for I tried it after reading the previous review instead of buying the wraps; I found the wraps to work better for my tastes).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These are decent wraps.</li>
            <li>These are a little hard to get wrapped tightly enough by yourself, but they work great and are so much better than soaking your fingers in acetone for 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I do believe the key is to be sure the cotton pad is soaked adequately with the acetone, that the wrap is as tight as you can get it</li>
            <li>I used my dominant right hand to put the wraps on my left hand, and I still really struggled to get them on by myself.</li>
            <li>For what it&#x27;s worth, I haven&#x27;t been a nail tech since the 80&#x27;s, but I have been on both sides of the nail business, so here is my personal opinion on the Shellac system, particularly the remover wraps.    </li>
            <li>After using the Remover Wraps last night, I have to say that they did a much better job than the other methods I&#x27;ve tried, and in fact, did a better job that I expected.  </li>
            <li>The portion of the wrap that is the pad is as large as my entire first knuckle.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These were also extremely hard to put on to my own fingers.</li>
            <li>but then again, when your fingers are covered with a wrap, it&#x27;s kind of hard to do anything else...</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s much cheaper than in the professional beauty supply store</li>
            <li>Great concept, but difficult to keep them on your fingers</li>
            <li>I LOVE the Shellac manicure but the Remover Wraps are a WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
            <li>All good things are worth the extra little few seconds to get the right effect.</li>
            <li>but they do a great job and are less messy than cottonballs.</li>
            <li>Although these remover wraps are not the only way to remove your shellac manicure, they do make it easy - especially for DIY.  </li>
            <li>Left on 10 minutes and polish came right off.</li>
            <li>I also experienced a quicker, cleaner and more complete removal of the shellac product from my fingernails requiring less cleaning from an orange stick and less exposure length to the acetone, for I found the foil didn&#x27;t keep the ball in place on the nail bed as well as the forms, requiring me to reposition and frequently keeping them on a little longer to sufficiently soften the product for removal.    </li>
            <li>This seems to keep my skin, particularly the tips of my fingers, from becoming so dried out from the acetone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather use my money for a new CND Shellac color than this product.</li>
            <li>How did I ever live with out them?</li>
            <li>Unless you have man size fingers, or someone available to help you secure these on your fingertips, it is too frustrating to use.  </li>
            <li>The fluid is simply acetone and the remover wraps ARE important.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Caveat:  This was my first time using the wraps, so maybe it gets easier with time (after all, I still have 95 of them left!)</li>
            <li>I guess with practice hopefully I&#x27;ll be able to wrap my off hand properly and because of that acetone still made contact with my skin and caused peeling several days later.</li>
            <li>There are better nail wraps out there that i have used in the past.</li>
            <li>Glad I tried them, but will likely go back to old fashioned soaking the nail the next.</li>
            <li>If you are looking to do the gel to your own nails, these wraps are very hard to apply to yourself.</li>
            <li>(Use 100% pure acetone) on the pad, wrapped each finger as shown on the video and waited the ten minutes.  </li>
            <li>They stay tight to your finger and the polish came off alot better than with the foil method after ten minutes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only problem was that it&#x27;s easy to put on one hand, but help is needed to get the product on the other hand.</li>
            <li>I find that the nail polish almost peels off naturally when you try to loosen it, anyway.</li>
            <li>In place...place the cotton pad directly over the natural nail  </li>
            <li>It is much easier to place cotton balls soaked with acetone on the nail, then wrap the entire fingertip with foil.</li>
            <li>If the pad doesn&#x27;t have close/tight contact with the nail, it won&#x27;t dissolve it nearly as well.  </li>
            <li>and frankly that&#x27;s why they are marketed for PROFESSIONAL USE.</li>
            <li>You go to a professional because they are SUPPOSED to know what they are doing.</li>
            <li>Just take some time, and really learn how to use them proper.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re all pleasantly surprised when Ii whip them out of my purse.</li>
            <li>On initial examination, the product seemed like it would work very well.  </li>
            <li>Really that&#x27;s the only con</li>
            <li>If you are a manicurist and want to look professional, buy these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I felt like I could hold onto the rabbit ears of an old TV set to improve the reception.  </li>
            <li>I see that the HandsDown wraps are more expensive than the Shellac wraps, but it is worth it to me.</li>
            <li>I thought the idea was cool when Shellac first came out, but after using them I didn&#x27;t find them practical in the least.</li>
            <li>I found I could do my left hand--and then reuse the same wraps on my right.</li>
            <li>If you have any other questions about this product (or any other) you can contact me directly :)</li>
            <li>Place finger near the middle of the foil strip, nail down, and press lightly to keep the cotton ball in place.</li>
            <li>It dries so fast that even if you soaked for a long time, you had to keep some nails in the solution while scraping others.        </li>
            <li>These really make taking shellac off easier as long as they are used correctly.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately though, upon application I found that one really would need the help of someone else to apply them properly on their own fingers.  </li>
            <li>I hate using foil and cotton so these really work great for me.</li>
            <li>start with the pro&#x27;s: Very easy to use for fingers and toes, concentrates the acetone on the nail not the surrounding skin, lets your fingers breathe while wrapped which decreases the \\&quot;hot\\&quot; feeling foil wrapping cause, quick to apply (all 10 fingers in less than 3 minutes), doesn&#x27;t leave fuzz behind like using cotton balls will, and allows you to still pick things up and do basic things without having to worry about the wraps coming off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>that doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;ll start trying to give myself a deep tissue massage :)</li>
            <li>Major rip off.  </li>
            <li>These are fun, and make your fingers look like little mummies.</li>
            <li>Cool idea but don&#x27;t waste your money!  </li>
            <li>Work well but difficult to manage when you are doing this on your own nails.  </li>
            <li>this also generates heat -- polish comes right off after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>The first few we only saturated the pads enough to cover the padding and what you would normally use on a cotton ball.  </li>
            <li>The first 2-3 fingers are ok, but after that it is nearly impossible to do it by yourself.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product to use on my own and it is impossible to get a tight enough fit for them to actually stay on your fingers when applying yourself.</li>
            <li>Just apply a small amount of remover, wrap your nails, wait 10 minutes, and the polish comes right off.  </li>
            <li>Since I was new to the Shellac process I wanted to have all the little things to make doing my nails at home easier and help them look professionally done.  </li>
            <li>They really need to be wrapped so that they are air tight.  </li>
            <li>I find these hard to get on tight and once you have a few fingers done it really gets challenging.</li>
            <li>and I had a little mess of flaked polish to clean up.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> The product is perfect.</li>
            <li> *Use a Scotch Gift Wrap Cutter to cut the foil - works great!    </li>
            <li> The best way to remove Shellac!  </li>
            <li> I was highly impressed with the seller; item arrived 6 days before estimated delivery.</li>

            <li> but once you do they work great!  </li>
            <li> this is the best product.  </li>
            <li> Very good product and price.</li>
            <li> i receive it in very good conditions</li>
            <li> These wraps work great.</li>
            <li> I feel an educated guest is a happy one</li>
            <li> I think they are great for removing the shellac polish.</li>
            <li> They are well made and the idea is great if it worked.  </li>
            <li> If you have someone helping you, they would be great.  </li>
            <li> I got a great bargain online and will buy them again.</li>
            <li> These wraps work great for taking off the gel polish.  </li>
            <li> works great as I am allergic to acrylic and no problems with this product.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> But, if you don&#x27;t mind paying for it, it&#x27;s a great idea.</li>
            <li> Great lov them good price</li>
            <li> I find them easy to use, and they do an excellent job of removing the shellac polish, without damaging my nail.</li>
            <li> Have faith, there are competent, intelligent and EXPERIENCED providers out there</li>
            <li> The wraps are a good concept but should be easier to adhere...</li>
            <li> Good luck.</li>
            <li> I tried them today and loved them.</li>
            <li> Band-aids (adhesive bandages) work just as good as wraps and at  fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> Using a cotton ball and foil is just as good.</li>
            <li> Once you get them on they work great, but when I&#x27;m doing my own nails</li>
            <li> The wraps are good quality</li>
            <li> Excellent and amazing product I recommended for every one because its a very interesting and useful product so buy it now!</li>
            <li> do not forget to buff all the shine off of you gelish top coat!</li>
            <li> I really love this product!</li>
            <li> Love them!  </li>
            <li> LOVE THESE!</li>
            <li> Lining it up can be a bit tricky, but once you got it, its very effective and easy to use.</li>
            <li> If you are doing your own nails</li>
            <li> I do my own shellac at home.</li>
            <li> Even so I wouldn&#x27;t want to do my own allergy injections</li>
            <li> If you are spending a fortune at the salon getting your nails done like I was, then you need to just buy your own kit and do them yourself.</li>
            <li> But to be honest, they are not the easiest to use on yourself.  </li>
            <li> You need to get your own acetone to soak the cotton pads on these</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> I bought these because I do my own soak off gel nails</li>
            <li> But they&#x27;re not 100% effective because they don&#x27;t always remove Shellac along the sides of most nails.</li>
            <li> The wraps are the best, so far.  </li>
            <li> These make it so easy to remove your gel/shellac nail polish!  </li>
            <li> THESE ARE VERY IMPORTANT...</li>
            <li> This product is OK.  </li>
            <li> I bought this item after reading some of the reviews that mentioned how they protected the hands from the drying effects of the acetone used to remove CND Shellac more than using cotton balls &amp; tin foil did.</li>
            <li> Also, that method seemed to work better, but maybe that was because the acetone on the wraps evaporated while I was</li>
            <li> *Invest in one of those pump top nail polish remover bottles -</li>
            <li> The ones that were literally dripping with Acetone worked much better.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know of any method that is better...</li>
            <li> I think they work better than the cotton ball method.  </li>
            <li> Most of the pieces will remain in the wrap.</li>
            <li> While both method&#x27;s work, I will continue to use the wraps since I find them to be more convienent, cleaner, better for my fingertips</li>
            <li> So glad I found them.</li>
            <li> The wraps are okay, but don&#x27;t seem to do anything better than at the salon where they use tinfoil and cotton balls.</li>
            <li> It takes some getting used to putting them on if you are doing it on yourself ( like me), but I love them now.</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ll order some more soon.</li>
            <li> If you practice doing each hand by itself, you will be able to wrap both hands at once, in no time.</li>
            <li> I read most of the reviews before deciding to purchase.</li>
            <li> I was able to apply them without any assistance; the material that they are made out of is stretchable and clingy without any adhesive.</li>
            <li> Not one of them slipped or fell off, and after about 13 minutes I removed them and most of the gel came off.</li>
            <li> work alot better.</li>
            <li> This will affect your future manicures as they work best on healthy nails...</li>
            <li> I would be ok with them if they were soaked with acetone, but they&#x27;re just a way to upsell a service.    </li>
            <li> The seller should have stated these do not come with acetone, if they did you&#x27;d have another issue with them drying out and would have to buy more (or use what you have at home).  </li>
            <li> I personally think these are a wonderful asset to use in removing your shellac polish.</li>
            <li> Would work better in a salon setting with someone else applying.</li>
            <li> You can wrap the cotton balls on your finger with some tin foil (this is how many salons do it).</li>
            <li> These were more of a hassle for me than a benefit.  </li>
            <li> The twisting motion gets most of the shellac off and the rest can be scraped off with an orange stick.  </li>
            <li> Glad I did . . .</li>
            <li> Much better.</li>
            <li> The 100 pack makes it more cost-effective.</li>
            <li> You would be better off just soaking your fingernails in a manicure bowl with acetone which works every time.</li>
            <li> really love these things.  </li>
            <li> Much better than the cotton ball and foil method.  </li>
            <li> Cotton balls wrapped with aluminum foil works way better for pennies.</li>
            <li> Aluminum foil works better.  </li>
            <li> Use this shellac weekly on my nails, love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping to find better instructions than I&#x27;ve used to make the purchase worthwhile.</li>
            <li> I would love to return them.  </li>
            <li> Why do I have to use so many words just to tell you I love it?</li>
            <li> I love the CND Shellac product</li>
            <li> Love these</li>
            <li> Perhaps I&#x27;ll get better with practice.</li>
            <li> - this allows me to preserve the most dexterity.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> These make changing polish from gel nail polish perfect super easy and not messy at all and can still use fingers while waiting for polish to come off!</li>
            <li> says:  As many professionals choose the cheap route as non-professionals.</li>
            <li> I was able to get a snug fit on my dominant hand</li>
            <li> This seems like a good idea, but it is much easier (and cheaper) to let the salon do this for you.  </li>
            <li> The wraps are easy to use and they keep the acetone on your nails and not on your hands.</li>
            <li> They are easy to  apply by yourself to either hand - unlike the salon foil method.  </li>
            <li> easy to use and wrap around the nails.</li>
            <li> Its easy and there are plenty of youtube videos to watch that will show you how to do them.  </li>
            <li> The shellac is easy to scrape off after about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Received the product very quickly.  </li>
            <li> So easy.  </li>
            <li> .makes removing the gel shellac easy.</li>
            <li> It takes me 20-25 minutes of soaking to get the Gelish to remove easily</li>
            <li> I felt it would be better to post a full review instead</li>
            <li> I love gel nails, and I think that using these at home is the easy quick way to get the removal taken care of.</li>
            <li> I knew when I was ordering them that they are coming w/o the acetone which was fine with me.</li>
            <li> I must not have read fine print</li>
            <li> The problem I had was that they are HUGE on my nails.</li>
            <li> However they&#x27;re not lying - the entire product line is GREAT.  </li>
            <li> To me it is worth the money, and I&#x27;m sure I will get faster with time.</li>
            <li> We go to a service provider to be pampered and to enjoy a relaxing experience.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t sound like you had either</li>
            <li> To use the pads that I do have, I cut the tabs off and cut 10 slices of tin foil, soak the pads and secure them on with the tin foil.</li>
            <li> I cannot and will not ever be happy with regular polish again.</li>
            <li> Very cumbersome to apply on your own.  </li>
            <li> the wrap around design securely tightens to my fingers, unlike the foil.    </li>
            <li> it made removal of shellac polish easy and a quick process.  </li>
            <li> and I think are worth the effort!</li>
            <li> and I am more than willing to keep them \\&quot;in the loop\\&quot; as it were.</li>
            <li> I find for me it is just best to soak the nails in a small dish instead.</li>
            <li> I love the shellac system, but am not so hot about these CND wraps.  </li>
            <li> It took a little practice to be able to wrap my fingers myself but they work great.</li>
            <li> I found a great video on youtube that shows a little of the removal and application :)   </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s well worth the 25 cents per finger for easy shellac removal.</li>
            <li> and I had nothing to clean up but to toss the wraps in the trash.</li>
            <li> I do a better job and take far better care of my nails than the \\&quot;professionals\\&quot; do.</li>
            <li> good way to take off shellac, not messy, easy and gentle on your nails and skin, i would recommend, enjoy</li>
            <li> the investment in the right products (like these wraps!)      </li>
            <li> Much easier, though more drying to the skin around the nail.</li>
            <li> therefore they do not make contact with the nail well enough to do a good job removing the gel.  </li>
            <li> Now that does sound exciting, tho</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true, using cotton pads/balls soaked in acetone, placing them on the nails and then wrapping each fingertip with foil</li>
            <li> You may need some help putting them on your dominant hand, but other than that they are great.</li>
            <li> Super Quality.</li>
            <li> Those work much better, particularly when used with plastic gloves.  </li>
            <li> A cotton swab, acetone and foil are adequate for this job and don&#x27;t cost 20+ dollars.</li>
            <li> I use these for Gelish removal and find that they work as quickly as the cotton ball and tin-foil method.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my own usage but found that it&#x27;s not easy to manipulate on your own hands.  </li>
            <li> They are a great if your doing someone else&#x27;s nails but a complete waste of time if your doing your own.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and works fast to wrap your nails.</li>
            <li> Using cotton balls saturated in acetone and held in place with a little piece of foil is heck of a lot cheaper and much more effective.</li>
            <li> I will be replacing them with the kind that have the stretchy sticky bandage wrap similar to the ones OPI sells.  </li>
            <li> I found their instructions for salon professionals (which I am not) and thought you&#x27;d find it useful.  </li>
            <li> have compared both methods and found the wraps to be worth the price.</li>
            <li> word to the wise, the longer your nails are, the harder the wraps are to apply.</li>
            <li> For a manicure that lasts well over 2 weeks, without chipping, it&#x27;s totally worth</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t stay on - even after the video - and aren&#x27;t worth the price.</li>
            <li> Bottom-line, in my opinion, the remover wraps are a specific tool designed to be used specifically on your nails and that limits exposure to the drying effects of the acetone and holds the acetone more securely to the product during the 10 minutes required to sit with the wraps on, as opposed to using the cotton ball/foil method.  </li>
            <li> For me personally, it&#x27;s worth it, so I&#x27;ll use them over the cotton ball/foil method every time.</li>
            <li> To be perfectly honest, the end result is the same</li>
            <li> They are only partially effective, leaving the corners of your nails virtually untouched by the acetone.</li>
            <li> This product is useful if you don&#x27;t mind spending money on something you can do yourself.  </li>
            <li> For me the remover wraps stay on my fingers more securely so that I can perform light activities (i.e. use the remote of the TV)</li>
            <li> Clean the nail with pure acetone</li>
            <li> I ended up using half-rounds of cotton and tin foil on my right hand, and that was a lot easier to do.  </li>
            <li> so, i use these wraps and they work just right.</li>
            <li> I could do the right hand</li>
            <li> I am a licensed cosmetologist in California and it is true that most of the products and tools I use can be purchased from various retail outlets.</li>
            <li> You can only apply one hand at a time and the wraps fall off very easily.  </li>
            <li> You do have to leave them on for a full 15 minutes for them to really get the gel to come off, but if you do the polish scrapes right off no problem.  </li>
            <li> So far, the shellac has been peeling easily.  </li>
            <li> good product for shellac removal, little tricky to put on alone.</li>
            <li> The only difference I found was that these wraps are nicely packaged and have a little sticky tab to keep them in place where the foil/acetone soaked cotton ball is a do-it-yourself kind of project.</li>
            <li> It works exactly the way I had hoped it would.</li>
            <li> Ultimately, I got most of the shellac off using these wraps.  </li>
            <li> I find that the CND nail wraps are very difficult to get on when doing my own nails, though they&#x27;re great when working on someone else.  </li>
            <li> As a further tip, someone suggested roughing up the gel nail before soaking to allow more of the remover to soak in.  </li>
            <li> and then you&#x27;re ready for a re-Shellac service!    </li>
            <li> as I feel this item does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> If you choose to do your service at home and you are using the proper tools then more power to you.    </li>
            <li> okay, as I am left handed, but</li>
            <li> Guess I&#x27;ll trust their counting skills because I&#x27;m surely not double checking :).</li>
            <li> I initially bought these wraps because I read that they work better than the foil method of removing shellac.  </li>
            <li> Will absolutely buy again!</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly without the desired effect.</li>
            <li> These wraps are pretty to look at.</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend, much better than cotton pads and foil to get gel nails off.</li>
            <li> and I do not file the shine off the top as I have found that it takes the same amount of time either way.</li>
            <li> but I am able to put them on all of my fingers myself and with about the same difficulty as foil.</li>
            <li> it makes getting the right amount of acetone on the cotton ball much easier.  </li>
            <li> This item was designed to be used by the provider so they can quickly remove the gel coat and start a new service.</li>
            <li> I really think if they came in different sizes that would make it more practical.  </li>
            <li> If you have very long nails, you may more than 3 inches, so cut the foil in two or three pieces instead of four.  </li>
            <li> The wraps are much larger than I thought, and they can sometimes fall off easily.  </li>
            <li> The shellac will dry up and you won&#x27;t be able to remove it.  </li>
            <li> The remaining residue was easily removed with the wooden stick that was enclosed in the package.    </li>
            <li> Better to get a little container and fill it with acetone, comes off quickly and saves you money.</li>
            <li> I would certainly purchase this product again</li>
            <li> &#x27;S&#x27; - Saturate the cotton pad with pure acetone  </li>
            <li> These little things are amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had shellac manicures removed once \\&quot;professionally\\&quot; by soaking in a bowl of pure acetone &amp; scraping off the remnants, then I removed my own the second time (the same way I saw the manicurist do it).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised at the reasonable price for 10 polish removal&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li> I have had shellac done by a manicurist, but recently began doing it myself after purchasing all the supplies and UV light.  </li>
            <li> Neither of those methods worked very well, as I still had to have the nails scraped to remove the shellac residue, with the result being some damage to my nail plate.     </li>
            <li> I had to do one hand at a time, but the Shellac came off much easier than any gel nail</li>
            <li> I recommend REALLY saturating the pads before using.  </li>
            <li> This works very well in removing the Shellac polish from my fingers fast and efficiently.  </li>
            <li> I really believe in the Shellac products.   </li>
            <li> I really like the CND shellac wraps.</li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t seal well and because of that they don&#x27;t really keep the acetone off your finger and just on your nail.  </li>
            <li> If you repeatedly soak your whole finger (like you are doing when you smash a soaked cotton ball in tin foil)</li>
            <li> So much nicer than soaking your nails and fingers in acetone.</li>
            <li> I got the whole set up to do shellac gel polish for  myself.  </li>
            <li> While it is a neat concept, they don&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> They did not stay in place well and my shellac took much longer to remove than when I used some aluminum foil and part of a piece of cotton ball.</li>
            <li> which is no big deal since it&#x27;s so cheap to buy</li>
            <li> However, I question the whole concept of letting your nails soak in acetone.  </li>
            <li> These are very convenient but in all honesty just using aluminum foil and cotton pads work just as well and are a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t need these.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> and these seemed really convenient.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s nice to save a few bucks and remove it yourself.</li>
            <li> My 17 year old did ok, but I think I&#x27;ll ask my husband to do it next time.</li>
            <li> Mar. 19, 2011 11:24 AM PDT      J. Koester says:  Professionals (at least the good ones) recommend products or services because we think they will BENEFIT our clients.    </li>
            <li> You have to put your own acetone on them, and the pad area is HUGE, so I&#x27;m not sure how I will keep it from saturating the entire pad (which will then soak my fingers).  </li>
            <li> I was glad I read other reviews.  </li>
            <li> It took me 30 minutes to clean up all ten nails and it used to take me an hour with the foil method.  </li>
            <li> More effective than soaking, less messy --</li>
            <li> Ocassionally had my husband help me (which took the experience to a whole new level), but still too much time instucting and not getting the result that I was seeking.    </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not expensive, and they&#x27;re not messy.</li>
            <li> does work (for I tried it after reading the previous review instead of buying the wraps; I found the wraps to work better for my tastes).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These are decent wraps.</li>
            <li> These are a little hard to get wrapped tightly enough by yourself, but they work great and are so much better than soaking your fingers in acetone for 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I do believe the key is to be sure the cotton pad is soaked adequately with the acetone, that the wrap is as tight as you can get it</li>
            <li> I used my dominant right hand to put the wraps on my left hand, and I still really struggled to get them on by myself.</li>
            <li> For what it&#x27;s worth, I haven&#x27;t been a nail tech since the 80&#x27;s, but I have been on both sides of the nail business, so here is my personal opinion on the Shellac system, particularly the remover wraps.    </li>
            <li> After using the Remover Wraps last night, I have to say that they did a much better job than the other methods I&#x27;ve tried, and in fact, did a better job that I expected.  </li>
            <li> The portion of the wrap that is the pad is as large as my entire first knuckle.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These were also extremely hard to put on to my own fingers.</li>
            <li> but then again, when your fingers are covered with a wrap, it&#x27;s kind of hard to do anything else...</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s much cheaper than in the professional beauty supply store</li>
            <li> Great concept, but difficult to keep them on your fingers</li>
            <li> I LOVE the Shellac manicure but the Remover Wraps are a WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
            <li> All good things are worth the extra little few seconds to get the right effect.</li>
            <li> but they do a great job and are less messy than cottonballs.</li>
            <li> Although these remover wraps are not the only way to remove your shellac manicure, they do make it easy - especially for DIY.  </li>
            <li> Left on 10 minutes and polish came right off.</li>
            <li> I also experienced a quicker, cleaner and more complete removal of the shellac product from my fingernails requiring less cleaning from an orange stick and less exposure length to the acetone, for I found the foil didn&#x27;t keep the ball in place on the nail bed as well as the forms, requiring me to reposition and frequently keeping them on a little longer to sufficiently soften the product for removal.    </li>
            <li> This seems to keep my skin, particularly the tips of my fingers, from becoming so dried out from the acetone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather use my money for a new CND Shellac color than this product.</li>
            <li> How did I ever live with out them?</li>
            <li> Unless you have man size fingers, or someone available to help you secure these on your fingertips, it is too frustrating to use.  </li>
            <li> The fluid is simply acetone and the remover wraps ARE important.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Caveat:  This was my first time using the wraps, so maybe it gets easier with time (after all, I still have 95 of them left!)</li>
            <li> I guess with practice hopefully I&#x27;ll be able to wrap my off hand properly and because of that acetone still made contact with my skin and caused peeling several days later.</li>
            <li> There are better nail wraps out there that i have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Glad I tried them, but will likely go back to old fashioned soaking the nail the next.</li>
            <li> If you are looking to do the gel to your own nails, these wraps are very hard to apply to yourself.</li>
            <li> (Use 100% pure acetone) on the pad, wrapped each finger as shown on the video and waited the ten minutes.  </li>
            <li> They stay tight to your finger and the polish came off alot better than with the foil method after ten minutes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only problem was that it&#x27;s easy to put on one hand, but help is needed to get the product on the other hand.</li>
            <li> I find that the nail polish almost peels off naturally when you try to loosen it, anyway.</li>
            <li> In place...place the cotton pad directly over the natural nail  </li>
            <li> It is much easier to place cotton balls soaked with acetone on the nail, then wrap the entire fingertip with foil.</li>
            <li> If the pad doesn&#x27;t have close/tight contact with the nail, it won&#x27;t dissolve it nearly as well.  </li>
            <li> and frankly that&#x27;s why they are marketed for PROFESSIONAL USE.</li>
            <li> You go to a professional because they are SUPPOSED to know what they are doing.</li>
            <li> Just take some time, and really learn how to use them proper.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re all pleasantly surprised when Ii whip them out of my purse.</li>
            <li> On initial examination, the product seemed like it would work very well.  </li>
            <li> Really that&#x27;s the only con</li>
            <li> If you are a manicurist and want to look professional, buy these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I felt like I could hold onto the rabbit ears of an old TV set to improve the reception.  </li>
            <li> I see that the HandsDown wraps are more expensive than the Shellac wraps, but it is worth it to me.</li>
            <li> I thought the idea was cool when Shellac first came out, but after using them I didn&#x27;t find them practical in the least.</li>
            <li> I found I could do my left hand--and then reuse the same wraps on my right.</li>
            <li> If you have any other questions about this product (or any other) you can contact me directly :)</li>
            <li> Place finger near the middle of the foil strip, nail down, and press lightly to keep the cotton ball in place.</li>
            <li> It dries so fast that even if you soaked for a long time, you had to keep some nails in the solution while scraping others.        </li>
            <li> These really make taking shellac off easier as long as they are used correctly.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately though, upon application I found that one really would need the help of someone else to apply them properly on their own fingers.  </li>
            <li> I hate using foil and cotton so these really work great for me.</li>
            <li> start with the pro&#x27;s: Very easy to use for fingers and toes, concentrates the acetone on the nail not the surrounding skin, lets your fingers breathe while wrapped which decreases the \\&quot;hot\\&quot; feeling foil wrapping cause, quick to apply (all 10 fingers in less than 3 minutes), doesn&#x27;t leave fuzz behind like using cotton balls will, and allows you to still pick things up and do basic things without having to worry about the wraps coming off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> that doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;ll start trying to give myself a deep tissue massage :)</li>
            <li> Major rip off.  </li>
            <li> These are fun, and make your fingers look like little mummies.</li>
            <li> Cool idea but don&#x27;t waste your money!  </li>
            <li> Work well but difficult to manage when you are doing this on your own nails.  </li>
            <li> this also generates heat -- polish comes right off after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> The first few we only saturated the pads enough to cover the padding and what you would normally use on a cotton ball.  </li>
            <li> The first 2-3 fingers are ok, but after that it is nearly impossible to do it by yourself.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product to use on my own and it is impossible to get a tight enough fit for them to actually stay on your fingers when applying yourself.</li>
            <li> Just apply a small amount of remover, wrap your nails, wait 10 minutes, and the polish comes right off.  </li>
            <li> Since I was new to the Shellac process I wanted to have all the little things to make doing my nails at home easier and help them look professionally done.  </li>
            <li> They really need to be wrapped so that they are air tight.  </li>
            <li> I find these hard to get on tight and once you have a few fingers done it really gets challenging.</li>
            <li> and I had a little mess of flaked polish to clean up.  </li>
            <li> Even after soaking the pad in pure acetone and wrapping them on my fingers (which is almost impossible to do yourself) the polish is still pretty much intact after 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> These worked pretty well to remove the polish but hard are to put on the opposite hand.  </li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t quite manage the other hand -- and I&#x27;m always in too much of a rush to do one hand, wait the 10 minutes, then do the other hand.  </li>
            <li> To anyone having trouble with this product, I highly recommend watching the CND video.</li>
            <li> They are a little hard to put on--but once on they work just fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to secure them on tightly and</li>
            <li> Previous removal methods included soaking a cotton ball and wrapping fingertips in foil and soaking fingertips directly in acetone.  </li>
            <li> They are difficult to use in that I couldn&#x27;t get them to fit snug, especially when trying to apply them by myself.</li>
            <li> These are dry wraps only.  </li>
            <li> It worked, but it took longer, was pretty messy for me, and was not worth the headache of saving money on these wraps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> they are expensive - to me they are worth it but obviously are a lot more expensive than cotton balls and foil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It made for a much easier application(instead of trying to wrap with clumsy fingers that already had wraps on).  </li>
            <li> and I understand this reflects negatively on my profession as a whole.</li>
            <li> However, it was taking way too long to remove my gel nails with the foil and cotton method.</li>
            <li> I like not having to soak in the acetone for so long to remove the shellac.</li>
            <li> do not like to remove gelish without these and will continue to buy them as long as I use gel polish.</li>
            <li> On my other hand I soaked for 10 minutes and still needed to push off some persistent pieces of polish with the orange wood stick, even needed to stick my finger back in the acetone.</li>
            <li> Then start over, and do the same thing on your other hand.  </li>
            <li> hard to tighten but does a decent job</li>
            <li> The concept is great, but I found it extremely difficult (frustrating!)</li>
            <li> To all worried about dry skin, do as the pros do and put a dab of vaseline on the tips of your fingers and cuticles and dry skin or damaged nails won&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
            <li> And she was pretty tough on the nail bed with her cuticle pusher.</li>
            <li> I guess in theory you could use a band aid, but I&#x27;m not sure if the pads would soak up the remover as well, or if they are big enough for long nails, however these wraps are.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend them, due to the less mess, and ease in getting off the polish.</li>
            <li> They are loose and did not do the job.</li>
            <li> same , just a mess and all fingers become dry.</li>
            <li> It leaves your fingers very dry though, even though the theory is to just have the acetone on you</li>
            <li> I removed the wraps, rubbing the fingernail in order to take off the Shellac and then used an orange stick to remove the little bit left.  </li>
            <li> These are quite difficult to get on--all ten digits---unless you are really ambedexterous (sp?).  </li>
            <li> especially since they are not cheap like cotton balls.  </li>
            <li> Often, you need a minimal amount of nail scraping, and the Shellac comes off like well-stripped paint.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel they&#x27;re a waste of money because cotton balls and tin foil are way cheaper and faster to apply than positioning the wrap and then wrapping up the flaps tightly enough around the finger.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no instructions with them.  </li>
            <li> I like how this will take off the CND shellac, but the product is big and bulky and to me a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Not everyone is a smoke and dagger professional or one that believe keeping people behind the \\&quot;veil\\&quot; will keep there business in the red.        </li>
            <li> The ends do not wrap around tight enough to hold it on my finger due to the bulkiness of the pad and the excess ends.  </li>
            <li> i tried to do the same with plain cotton, but for some reason it didn&#x27;t work..</li>
            <li> With as long as the gel polish lasts, I&#x27;d guess this package will last me at least 6 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if these actually would do that or not.  </li>
            <li> Please be careful and take care of your hands!  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> /&gt;She is going to purchase for her other clients.&lt;br /&gt;Saved</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the entire Shellac product as I&#x27;ve been disappointed by so many nail products claiming to last as long as gel.  </li>
            <li> I have to say that for me it is worth buying the wraps and using them since the acetone does dry out your hands terribly if you have too much exposure to the skin.  </li>
            <li> Unlike a cotton ball, the pad you wet with acetone does not leave little cotton fiber strands all over your fingertips.</li>
            <li> Too hard to put on...too big</li>
            <li> It is a little difficult to get the hang of putting them on snugly at first</li>
            <li> Wrapping each nail is very time consuming and difficult to do.</li>
            <li> I am not a petite person and have average size nails</li>
            <li> while soaking both hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others have complained of several things:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Overall their soaking pad was thick and absorbable.</li>
            <li> I love gel polish but hate getting it off -- soaking my fingertips is cumbersome and time consuming.  </li>
            <li> Wrap the other side of the foil around tightly, squeeze the bottom to the base of your finger, twist the top and bend it over to hold the foil in place.  </li>
            <li> but now that I have it down, I do prefer this way over using cotton balls and foil.</li>
            <li> After 10 minutes, very little shellac was loose.  </li>
            <li> That being corrected, it takes less time to remove my polish.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The wraps take less prep time.</li>
            <li> she cuts the pads and foil in half -- gets the pads at Sally&#x27;s and the tin foil  at Sam&#x27;s or Costco</li>
            <li> the way you wrap the long piece of plastic up and around and then have to pull the sticker packing off is hard.</li>
            <li> Not cool.</li>
            <li> My husband had to help me put the wraps on because there is no way to get the pad centered over your nail and secured tightly by yourself.  </li>
            <li> Saturate the pad, Wrap TIGHTLY, wait</li>
            <li> You need someone else to wrap the nails, TIGHTLY, for you.  </li>
            <li> do not wrap tight.  </li>
            <li> I tested these wraps by using them on one hand and soaking my other hand in a small bowl of acetone.</li>
            <li> I chuckled a little at the packaging.</li>
            <li> so if you don&#x27;t mind a little DIY, the foil is the cheaper way to go.  </li>
            <li> It has taught me the importance of reading reviews for products with which I am not familiar.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> and these are a convenient way to do that with out overexposing the skin to harsh chemicals.    </li>
            <li> It was not worth the trouble!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on these wraps, as even the salon that I go to won&#x27;t use them.</li>
            <li> are a few cons: They are pricy (about $20 to do your nails 10x).  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste you money on this product.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> you are doing your nails at home, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Just buy one of those nail polish remover tubs with the sponge inside and soak a few nails at a time.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I even took them to a salon to put on for me and the employee had trouble.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Takes off the polish in just a few swipes</li>
            <li> small to medium sized cotton balls and tear them in half or thirds.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not easy taking off gel nail polish by yourself with anything  </li>
            <li> Removing myself was a mess!  </li>
            <li> I have long thin fingers, so wrapping with one hand was a challenge.      </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even try to get them on my right hand anymore. :(</li>
            <li> I found them to be difficult to put on by myself, and it only took off about half the polish - probably in part because I was unable to apply them tightly enough on myself.</li>
            <li> After that, I simply gave each wrap a little twist back and forth and all the shellac came off, except for a small bit of base coat residue that I cleaned up with a cotton ball soaked in acetone.    </li>
            <li> It is a waste of money!</li>
            <li> Use small pieces of foil.    </li>
            <li> Use small cotton balls.    </li>
            <li> Use a small amount of acetone.    </li>
            <li> You just apply the remover and wrap the finger, no more aluminum foil and cotton</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I will even use these.</li>
            <li> Or if you still want to do this at home, just use pads soaked in acetone and wrap finger with a small piece of foil.  </li>
            <li> I tried to buy some of these at the local store, but they were so expensive.  </li>
            <li> I fail to understand how anything is kept a secret when it is clearly posted that acetone is the product used with this item.</li>
            <li> I have been involved in a discussion in response to one of the negative reviews of this product (Don&#x27;t Waste Your Money!, July 1, 2010).</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to know if it&#x27;s me or the product.</li>
            <li> Hard to put on for myself.  </li>
            <li> Hard to work with.  </li>
            <li> but they are hard to use.</li>
            <li> Slow, and not very effective -- plus it smells!  </li>
            <li> Yes, they are not too cheap, but soaking is disgusting.</li>
            <li> you can cause severe drying of the delicate skin around the nail bed as well as the nail itself.</li>
            <li> I have since found that I was applying my foundation layer too thick and that I did not need the ph layer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also nearly impossible to put the wraps on both hands at the same time.     </li>
            <li> Wish they were alittle less expensive.</li>
            <li> I am sorry you did not receive exemplary services at the establishments you visited in the past.</li>
            <li> I find them very hard to put on your nails.  </li>
            <li> These were very hard to use.</li>
            <li> Ridiculous!</li>
            <li> I had very little problem using them, and had husband help me with my BaD hand.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to saturate the cotton pad on the wrap without the acetone leaking through the &#x27;bandage&#x27; part, so</li>
            <li> these are difficult to get on and take a while to remove the polish.</li>
            <li> these were too difficult to do by yourself</li>
            <li> however, these wraps are difficult to put on and get to stay on.</li>
            <li> they are difficult to put on -</li>
            <li> They are difficult to use.  </li>

            <li> I find that trying to apply these wraps with one hand is a bit awkward.</li>
            <li> In either event, they&#x27;re useless and don&#x27;t stay on your fingers!  </li>
            <li> They are also very difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> nail - that is virtually impossible given the size of a nail vs. the pad.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> good product for shellac removal, little tricky to put on alone. Probably would need help from someone like I did but otherwise it works.</li>
            <li> Must have help to apply and even then, they do not stay on.  Would not recommend this product.  It is a waste of money!</li>
            <li> Super Quality.The product is perfect. It works exactly the way I had hoped it would. I would certainly purchase this product again</li>
            <li> The concept is great, but I found it extremely difficult (frustrating!) to put these on by myself.  I have long thin fingers, so wrapping with one hand was a challenge.      Now, I just soak the Shellac off in a bowl of 100% acetone.  Much easier, though more drying to the skin around the nail.</li>
            <li> I decided to try the Remover Wraps after using various methods to remove shellac polish.  I have had shellac done by a manicurist, but recently began doing it myself after purchasing all the supplies and UV light.  Previous removal methods included soaking a cotton ball and wrapping fingertips in foil and soaking fingertips directly in acetone.  Neither of those methods worked very well, as I still had to have the nails scraped to remove the shellac residue, with the result being some damage to my nail plate.     After using the Remover Wraps last night, I have to say that they did a much better job than the other methods I&#x27;ve tried, and in fact, did a better job that I expected.  I do believe the key is to be sure the cotton pad is soaked adequately with the acetone, that the wrap is as tight as you can get it (my husband helped me wrap my fingers), and to leave the product on for a minimum of 10 minutes.  After that, I simply gave each wrap a little twist back and forth and all the shellac came off, except for a small bit of base coat residue that I cleaned up with a cotton ball soaked in acetone.    I will definitely purchase these again - it&#x27;s well worth the 25 cents per finger for easy shellac removal.</li>
            <li> These are quite difficult to get on--all ten digits---unless you are really ambedexterous (sp?).  I do the app in stages reusing the same two or three a couple of times. They work once you get them on and I think are worth the effort!</li>
            <li> This product is OK.  The wraps are much larger than I thought, and they can sometimes fall off easily.  But if you keep your fingers still, they do the job.</li>
            <li> I have tried both the cotton ball and wrap method at home.  I have to say that for me it is worth buying the wraps and using them since the acetone does dry out your hands terribly if you have too much exposure to the skin.  The wraps are easy to use and they keep the acetone on your nails and not on your hands.</li>
            <li> Cool idea but don&#x27;t waste your money!  Unless you have man size fingers, or someone available to help you secure these on your fingertips, it is too frustrating to use.  The wraps are a good concept but should be easier to adhere... especially since they are not cheap like cotton balls.  I&#x27;m going to stick with cotton balls and foil.</li>
            <li> I bought this item after reading some of the reviews that mentioned how they protected the hands from the drying effects of the acetone used to remove CND Shellac more than using cotton balls &amp; tin foil did. I&#x27;m not sure if these actually would do that or not.  It was difficult to saturate the cotton pad on the wrap without the acetone leaking through the &#x27;bandage&#x27; part, so my entire fingertips still ended up getting doused with acetone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These were also extremely hard to put on to my own fingers. I used my dominant right hand to put the wraps on my left hand, and I still really struggled to get them on by myself. I ended up using half-rounds of cotton and tin foil on my right hand, and that was a lot easier to do.  Also, that method seemed to work better, but maybe that was because the acetone on the wraps evaporated while I was wrap-wrestling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caveat:  This was my first time using the wraps, so maybe it gets easier with time (after all, I still have 95 of them left!)</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the entire Shellac product as I&#x27;ve been disappointed by so many nail products claiming to last as long as gel.  However they&#x27;re not lying - the entire product line is GREAT.  As for the wraps, I watched the instructional video on the CND website so I knew these would not come with the acetone.  I put acetone (Use 100% pure acetone) on the pad, wrapped each finger as shown on the video and waited the ten minutes.  I removed the wraps, rubbing the fingernail in order to take off the Shellac and then used an orange stick to remove the little bit left.  I had to do one hand at a time, but the Shellac came off much easier than any gel nail I&#x27;ve ever had.  And it&#x27;s easier than soaking in acetone.  To anyone having trouble with this product, I highly recommend watching the CND video.</li>
            <li> Put these on twice with my husband&#x27;s help. After 10 minutes, very little shellac was loose.  After three attempts, I&#x27;d say 40% of the shellac was removable.  I don&#x27;t want to soak my hands in acetone or allow the salon to \\&quot;buff\\&quot; (aka sand with a grinder) the shellac off my nails.  I also don&#x27;t want to bother trying the foil and cotton ball method.  Ultimately, I got most of the shellac off using these wraps.  The last bits required soaking in acetone... Next time, I&#x27;ll soak a cotton ball in acetone and put it inside the wrap and leave the wraps on for 20 minutes.  OH, and don&#x27;t take all the wraps off at once!  The shellac will dry up and you won&#x27;t be able to remove it.  You have to remove the wrap and the shellac one at a time.     If my method works, I will continue to purchase in order to avoid the acetone dip and \\&quot;buffing\\&quot; at the salon.</li>
            <li> I find that the CND nail wraps are very difficult to get on when doing my own nails, though they&#x27;re great when working on someone else.  There are a number of comments here about how bad for your skin the cotton ball and foil method is and how difficult it is to use the foil.  Here are some tips to alleviate any problems you might have.  1) Use small pieces of foil.    -Tear off several 5 inch pieces of foil from the roll.    -Cut them in four equal pieces so you have 5\\&quot;x3\\&quot; foil pieces.    *Use a Scotch Gift Wrap Cutter to cut the foil - works great!    *If you have very long nails, you may more than 3 inches, so cut the foil in two or three pieces instead of four.  2) Use small cotton balls.    -Buy small to medium sized cotton balls and tear them in half or thirds.  3) Use a small amount of acetone.    -Dampen the cotton ball, don&#x27;t soak it.    *Invest in one of those pump top nail polish remover bottles - it makes getting the right amount of acetone on the cotton ball much easier.  Place one of the 3\\&quot;x5\\&quot; foil pieces on the working surface.  Dampen the cotton ball and place on the nail.  Place finger near the middle of the foil strip, nail down, and press lightly to keep the cotton ball in place. Wrap one side of foil around your finger and tuck it under your finger to keep it snug.  Wrap the other side of the foil around tightly, squeeze the bottom to the base of your finger, twist the top and bend it over to hold the foil in place.  Start your 10 minute timer, and continue on with the rest of your nails!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to know if it&#x27;s me or the product. I will go with user-error since I&#x27;ve only tried them once.  My husband had to help me put the wraps on because there is no way to get the pad centered over your nail and secured tightly by yourself.  I recommend REALLY saturating the pads before using.  The first few we only saturated the pads enough to cover the padding and what you would normally use on a cotton ball.  This was not enough.  It didn&#x27;t even begin to remove the polish after soaking for 15 minutes.  The ones that were literally dripping with Acetone worked much better.  It leaves your fingers very dry though, even though the theory is to just have the acetone on you nail - that is virtually impossible given the size of a nail vs. the pad.  But, I will try them again for the next go-round and see how it goes.  I don&#x27;t know of any method that is better...</li>
            <li> After trying the cotton ball/foil method, I thought I would give these a go.  I think they work better than the cotton ball method.  They stay tight to your finger and the polish came off alot better than with the foil method after ten minutes.&lt;br /&gt;This is what I did:&lt;br /&gt;I put acetone on the pad and pre-wrapped each finger and then slid the wrap back off, when I was done with the ten wraps, I put each of the wraps back on.  It made for a much easier application(instead of trying to wrap with clumsy fingers that already had wraps on).  I left it on for ten minutes and then took off the wraps and used the orange stick to get the remainder off one finger at a time.  It took me 30 minutes to clean up all ten nails and it used to take me an hour with the foil method.  To me it is worth the money, and I&#x27;m sure I will get faster with time.</li>
            <li> This works very well in removing the Shellac polish from my fingers fast and efficiently.  The only problem was that it&#x27;s easy to put on one hand, but help is needed to get the product on the other hand.</li>
            <li> Dont bother with these remover wraps because they are far to difficult to get a snug fit on them therefore they do not make contact with the nail well enough to do a good job removing the gel.  I even tried putting them on and then wrapping my nails with masking tape.  I will be replacing them with the kind that have the stretchy sticky bandage wrap similar to the ones OPI sells.  Those work much better, particularly when used with plastic gloves.  As a further tip, someone suggested roughing up the gel nail before soaking to allow more of the remover to soak in.  That seems to make sense and I will try that next time.  Good luck.</li>
            <li> These are awkward to use. You have to soak the pad with acetone and position it with one hand. I find that the nail polish almost peels off naturally when you try to loosen it, anyway. This was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> The best way to remove Shellac!  Sometimes it&#x27;s nice to save a few bucks and remove it yourself.</li>
            <li> I really believe in the Shellac products.   I knew there had to be a something to these wraps or CND wouldn&#x27;t sell them.  I found their instructions for salon professionals (which I am not) and thought you&#x27;d find it useful.  Here goes (it&#x27;s on the CND website):    Shellac Removal:  The Shellac Remover Wraps are the key to 10-minute, efficient removal. A simple way to remember the steps is with the acronym \\&quot;S.I.T\\&quot;&#x27;:  &#x27;S&#x27; - Saturate the cotton pad with pure acetone  &#x27;I&#x27; - In place...place the cotton pad directly over the natural nail  &#x27;T&#x27; - Tighten for Ten...tighten the wrap snuggly around the finger and set a timer for 10 minutes.    After ten minutes, massage the wrap to break apart the Shellac pieces. Firmly pull the Shellac Wrap straight off the finger to remove. Most of the pieces will remain in the wrap. Flake remaining pieces away with an orangewood stick. Clean the nail with pure acetone and then you&#x27;re ready for a re-Shellac service!    NEVER:    * Soak Shellac nails in a bowl of acetone  * File off Shellac with a file or drill    Please visit cnd.com for helpful &#x27;Shellac In Minutes&#x27; technical videos</li>
            <li> I tested these wraps by using them on one hand and soaking my other hand in a small bowl of acetone. After applying the 100% acetone to the pads on the wraps (no need to soak the entire wrap), I wrapped them on each finger and after ten minutes applied some pressure as I pulled them off and there was NOTHING left on my nails. I didn&#x27;t need to use the orange wood stick at all and ALL the polish was left in the wrap.  My fingers weren&#x27;t pruny from the acetone and I had nothing to clean up but to toss the wraps in the trash. On my other hand I soaked for 10 minutes and still needed to push off some persistent pieces of polish with the orange wood stick, even needed to stick my finger back in the acetone. My finger tips were pruny at the end and I had a little mess of flaked polish to clean up.  While both method&#x27;s work, I will continue to use the wraps since I find them to be more convienent, cleaner, better for my fingertips and it doesn&#x27;t waste as much acetone.  Perhaps you can get the same result from foil and cotton but I just like the no muss, no fuss of these wraps.</li>
            <li> These make it so easy to remove your gel/shellac nail polish!  They are easy to  apply by yourself to either hand - unlike the salon foil method.  So glad I found them.</li>
            <li> The wraps are okay, but don&#x27;t seem to do anything better than at the salon where they use tinfoil and cotton balls. It&#x27;s also nearly impossible to put the wraps on both hands at the same time.     I was highly impressed with the seller; item arrived 6 days before estimated delivery.</li>
            <li> I would hate to do shellac without these wraps. Yes, they are not too cheap, but soaking is disgusting. These wraps work great. No smells ( the fumes of acetone are really bad for you long-term), acetone is only on your nails, not all over your hands as with soaking. It takes some getting used to putting them on if you are doing it on yourself ( like me), but I love them now.</li>
            <li> i love it. easy to use and wrap around the nails. i tried to do the same with plain cotton, but for some reason it didn&#x27;t work.. i even tried to soak my nails in aceton. same , just a mess and all fingers become dry. so, i use these wraps and they work just right. i&#x27;ll order some more soon. and it&#x27;s much cheaper than in the professional beauty supply store</li>
            <li> If you are doing your own nails these are difficult to get on and take a while to remove the polish. I used them one time and have not used them since. Better to get a little container and fill it with acetone, comes off quickly and saves you money.</li>
            <li> Wraps are wonderful! They definitely do the job... I just wish they were easier to put on yourself... but then again, when your fingers are covered with a wrap, it&#x27;s kind of hard to do anything else...</li>
            <li> I use these remover wraps, to remove CND Shellac Power Polish from my nails. I find them easy to use, and they do an excellent job of removing the shellac polish, without damaging my nail. You soak the remover pad with acetone, then wrap it on your nail, and leave it on for 10 minutes. You can see how to use the wraps, by watching the following YouTube video: [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a bit of practice, to wrap the nails on both hands, at the same time.  You can start by wrapping one hand, soaking off the shellac, and removing the wraps.  Then start over, and do the same thing on your other hand.  This is easier to do, but it takes longer.  If you practice doing each hand by itself, you will be able to wrap both hands at once, in no time.</li>
            <li> I really like the CND shellac wraps. I do my own shellac at home. It took a little practice to be able to wrap my fingers myself but they work great.</li>
            <li> I had nails left over from my cruise manicure. This did not remove them. They are loose and did not do the job.</li>
            <li> If you are looking to do the gel to your own nails, these wraps are very hard to apply to yourself. It is much easier to place cotton balls soaked with acetone on the nail, then wrap the entire fingertip with foil.</li>
            <li> I read most of the reviews before deciding to purchase. However, it was taking way too long to remove my gel nails with the foil and cotton method. I have since found that I was applying my foundation layer too thick and that I did not need the ph layer. That being corrected, it takes less time to remove my polish.&lt;br /&gt;I have compared both methods and found the wraps to be worth the price. The wraps take less prep time. You just apply the remover and wrap the finger, no more aluminum foil and cotton cutting.&lt;br /&gt;A word to the wise, the longer your nails are, the harder the wraps are to apply. You will need to wrap the cotton part over the end of the nail as to ensure a proper seal. The tape should be over the cotton area as close to the end as possible. You ultimately want to make a cup at the end of your fingers. If you can see in the holes on the side of the nails your removal will take a lot longer.&lt;br /&gt;And do not forget to buff all the shine off of you gelish top coat!</li>
            <li> These wraps are awesome!  I&#x27;ve had shellac manicures removed once \\&quot;professionally\\&quot; by soaking in a bowl of pure acetone &amp; scraping off the remnants, then I removed my own the second time (the same way I saw the manicurist do it).  Removing myself was a mess!  It dries so fast that even if you soaked for a long time, you had to keep some nails in the solution while scraping others.        These wraps are AWESOME!  Saturate the pad, Wrap TIGHTLY, wait 10 min, twist, and 95% was removed!!!         For a manicure that lasts well over 2 weeks, without chipping, it&#x27;s totally worth the investment in the right products (like these wraps!)      Now a word of warning, You Cannot Do this Alone.  You need someone else to wrap the nails, TIGHTLY, for you.  If the pad doesn&#x27;t have close/tight contact with the nail, it won&#x27;t dissolve it nearly as well.  My 17 year old did ok, but I think I&#x27;ll ask my husband to do it next time.</li>
            <li> They are difficult to use in that I couldn&#x27;t get them to fit snug, especially when trying to apply them by myself. Ocassionally had my husband help me (which took the experience to a whole new level), but still too much time instucting and not getting the result that I was seeking.    I was in Sally&#x27;s on yesterday and saw the HandsDown Soak-Off Gel Nail Wraps. There are 10 to a pack for $2.75. I tried them today and loved them. I was able to apply them without any assistance; the material that they are made out of is stretchable and clingy without any adhesive. Not one of them slipped or fell off, and after about 13 minutes I removed them and most of the gel came off. The remaining residue was easily removed with the wooden stick that was enclosed in the package.    I see that the HandsDown wraps are more expensive than the Shellac wraps, but it is worth it to me.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to remove the shellac polish.&lt;br /&gt;Followed instructions, but just try to put these&lt;br /&gt;things on by yourself, not so easy.&lt;br /&gt;They do not wrap tight.  I found myself&lt;br /&gt;just soaking them and using them like swabs,&lt;br /&gt;rubbing the polish on finger. Maybe if you&lt;br /&gt;had someone placing them on your finger it&lt;br /&gt;would work alot better.</li>
            <li> Too hard to put on...too big so they don&#x27;t seal well and because of that they don&#x27;t really keep the acetone off your finger and just on your nail.  I&#x27;ll try the generic adhesive bandages as suggested by another reviewer.</li>
            <li> EDIT: I found a great video on youtube that shows a little of the removal and application :)   youtube . com / watch?v&#x3D; 38JryY9n66A  Just remove the spaces from the URL.    I have been involved in a discussion in response to one of the negative reviews of this product (Don&#x27;t Waste Your Money!, July 1, 2010). I felt it would be better to post a full review instead as I feel this item does exactly what it is supposed to do. I have copied the conversation here:    J.Koester  The fluid is simply acetone and the remover wraps ARE important. They minimize your skin&#x27;s exposure to the polish remover. If you repeatedly soak your whole finger (like you are doing when you smash a soaked cotton ball in tin foil) you can cause severe drying of the delicate skin around the nail bed as well as the nail itself. This will affect your future manicures as they work best on healthy nails... you can also give yourself a contact dermatitis!    THESE ARE VERY IMPORTANT... and frankly that&#x27;s why they are marketed for PROFESSIONAL USE. Please be careful and take care of your hands!

A pad soaked in acetone will work (as I stated in my last comment that is all the \\&quot;fluid\\&quot; is) but you need to leave it on for 10 minutes and these are a convenient way to do that with out overexposing the skin to harsh chemicals.    This item was designed to be used by the provider so they can quickly remove the gel coat and start a new service. The seller should have stated these do not come with acetone, if they did you&#x27;d have another issue with them drying out and would have to buy more (or use what you have at home).

My manicurist just stuck my hand in a bowl of acetone to remove this product. There&#x27;s nothing \\&quot;targeted\\&quot; about that. And she was pretty tough on the nail bed with her cuticle pusher. The next manicurist did the same. In fact, it was the lack of professionalism and care for the health of my nails (and the so-so result on the french manicure) that drove me to do the Shellac treatment at home. I do a better job and take far better care of my nails than the \\&quot;professionals\\&quot; do. I understand you need to protect your profession with this veil of mystery, but c&#x27;mon.

Now that does sound exciting, tho I fail to understand how anything is kept a secret when it is clearly posted that acetone is the product used with this item. If you choose to do your service at home and you are using the proper tools then more power to you.    I am a licensed cosmetologist in California and it is true that most of the products and tools I use can be purchased from various retail outlets. Did you know you can also purchase medical supplies? Even so I wouldn&#x27;t want to do my own allergy injections *shudder*  I am not sayingthat cosmetic enhancements are on par with clinical treatments but the idea is the same. You go to a professional because they are SUPPOSED to know what they are doing. I respect the fact that my guests have the option to go to any of the 200+ salons in my area and that they choose to come to me. I believe this is the case because I treat them with a level of professionalism that exceeds anything they could do in their bathroom or kitchen.    I am sorry you did not receive exemplary services at the establishments you visited in the past. We go to a service provider to be pampered and to enjoy a relaxing experience. It doesn&#x27;t sound like you had either and I understand this reflects negatively on my profession as a whole. I have had some pretty horrendous massage therapists work on me in the past but that doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;ll start trying to give myself a deep tissue massage :) Have faith, there are competent, intelligent and EXPERIENCED providers out there you just have to find them.    ...and to clarify, I am always open with my clients about the products and services I offer. I feel an educated guest is a happy one and I am more than willing to keep them \\&quot;in the loop\\&quot; as it were. Not everyone is a smoke and dagger professional or one that believe keeping people behind the \\&quot;veil\\&quot; will keep there business in the red.

            <li> I personally think these are a wonderful asset to use in removing your shellac polish. I had very little problem using them, and had husband help me with my BaD hand. I highly recommend them, due to the less mess, and ease in getting off the polish. Just take some time, and really learn how to use them proper. All good things are worth the extra little few seconds to get the right effect. I think they are great for removing the shellac polish.</li>
            <li> Tricky to get them on yourself but they do a great job and are less messy than cottonballs. I use to remove Shellac as directed.</li>
            <li> I got one instead of 100. When I called I had to send them back. It was not worth the trouble!</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use on my own and it is impossible to get a tight enough fit for them to actually stay on your fingers when applying yourself. You definitely need someone to put them on for you, which I don&#x27;t have.  Who knows, maybe even having someone else put them on for you doesn&#x27;t work, either.  In either event, they&#x27;re useless and don&#x27;t stay on your fingers!  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product!</li>
            <li> I received the pads when I purchased my CND Starter Shellac kit. They are a great if your doing someone else&#x27;s nails but a complete waste of time if your doing your own.  Wrapping each nail is very time consuming and difficult to do. I could do the right hand okay, as I am left handed, but the left was a disaster! It&#x27;s hard to secure them on tightly and the way you wrap the long piece of plastic up and around and then have to pull the sticker packing off is hard. I don&#x27;t worry about the length of time the acetone is on my nails as others have posted.  It&#x27;s not on longer than 2 minutes, as the CND removal suggests. To use the pads that I do have, I cut the tabs off and cut 10 slices of tin foil, soak the pads and secure them on with the tin foil. I use these because I received them with my kit but I won&#x27;t purchase them once I run out. A cotton swab, acetone and foil are adequate for this job and don&#x27;t cost 20+ dollars. I&#x27;d rather use my money for a new CND Shellac color than this product.</li>
            <li> I really love this product! If you are spending a fortune at the salon getting your nails done like I was, then you need to just buy your own kit and do them yourself. Its easy and there are plenty of youtube videos to watch that will show you how to do them.  I cannot and will not ever be happy with regular polish again.</li>
            <li> Since I was new to the Shellac process I wanted to have all the little things to make doing my nails at home easier and help them look professionally done.  Although there are mixed reviews I decided to try these just to see.  They are well made and the idea is great if it worked.  I really think if they came in different sizes that would make it more practical.  They have to be saturated with acetone which isn&#x27;t a problem and then placed on your nails.  The problem I had was that they are HUGE on my nails. The portion of the wrap that is the pad is as large as my entire first knuckle.  The ends do not wrap around tight enough to hold it on my finger due to the bulkiness of the pad and the excess ends.  I am not a petite person and have average size nails but these were totally too big for my fingers.</li>
            <li> These wraps do work well for removing gel polish.  But to be honest, they are not the easiest to use on yourself.  I have started doing gel polish for myself.  I find that trying to apply these wraps with one hand is a bit awkward. Would work better in a salon setting with someone else applying.</li>
            <li> I purchased these thinking they were pre-saturated.  You have to put your own acetone on them, and the pad area is HUGE, so I&#x27;m not sure how I will keep it from saturating the entire pad (which will then soak my fingers).  So far, the shellac has been peeling easily.  I&#x27;m not sure if I will even use these.</li>
            <li> So much nicer than soaking your nails and fingers in acetone. I wish all salons used them. They&#x27;re all pleasantly surprised when Ii whip them out of my purse.</li>
            <li> My sisters-in-law are both beauticians, and they showed me this trick of using cotton balls soaked in acetone wrapped in foil around each nail. I tried that. It worked, but it took longer, was pretty messy for me, and was not worth the headache of saving money on these wraps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are decent wraps. They&#x27;re not expensive, and they&#x27;re not messy. If you use gel at home, you can reuse them. (You obviously can&#x27;t do that in a shop.) Unlike a cotton ball, the pad you wet with acetone does not leave little cotton fiber strands all over your fingertips. Often, you need a minimal amount of nail scraping, and the Shellac comes off like well-stripped paint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do my nails now so infrequently a 100 count bag will last over a year. If you don&#x27;t want to reuse them from application to application, you can do one hand at a time. Then, you only need five. Transfer the wraps to the respective fingers on the opposite hands, and when you&#x27;re done, you can trash them.</li>
            <li> I bought these as an alternative to soaking my fingers in acetone. They work, but they are a bit difficult to apply by myself and keep all 10 on my fingers -- one or more tend to fall off. The shellac is easy to scrape off after about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I bought these to take off my CND Shellac manicure at home. I LOVE the Shellac manicure but the Remover Wraps are a WASTE OF MONEY. I thought they would come with the remover fluid on them- they don&#x27;t. They are just big band aids with CND written on them and then they come with an orange wood stick. Save your self the money and buy orange wood sticks and cotton balls. You can wrap the cotton balls on your finger with some tin foil (this is how many salons do it). You will need 100% acetone remover to put on the cotton ball and then wrap the foil around your finger and the cotton ball to keep the cotton ball on your nail- leave on for about 10 minutes and then use an orange wood stick to scrape off the remaining shellac.</li>
            <li> I got the whole set up to do shellac gel polish for  myself.  These worked pretty well to remove the polish but hard are to put on the opposite hand.  If you have someone helping you, they would be great.  I find for me it is just best to soak the nails in a small dish instead.</li>
            <li> I did receive these in a timely fashion. I guess with practice hopefully I&#x27;ll be able to wrap my off hand properly and because of that acetone still made contact with my skin and caused peeling several days later. I chuckled a little at the packaging. They were just stuffed in a big ziploc with no CND insert like pictured. Guess I&#x27;ll trust their counting skills because I&#x27;m surely not double checking :). Overall their soaking pad was thick and absorbable. I was able to get a snug fit on my dominant hand so I do prefer these over the cotton ball and foil method.</li>
            <li> These were more of a hassle for me than a benefit.  Glad I tried them, but will likely go back to old fashioned soaking the nail the next.</li>
            <li> I found them to be difficult to put on by myself, and it only took off about half the polish - probably in part because I was unable to apply them tightly enough on myself. I will probably have to have someone else apply them until the bag is gone, but will not be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> I knew when I was ordering them that they are coming w/o the acetone which was fine with me. The reason why I&#x27;m giving them 2 stars is b/c I find them very hard to put on your nails.  The first 2-3 fingers are ok, but after that it is nearly impossible to do it by yourself.  I love the shellac system, but am not so hot about these CND wraps.  Will probably only use them when I have someone to help me put them on, otherwise I have to stick to cotton balls.  So 2 stars for the fact that they are working if you have help, however I would not recommend them and I definitely wont buy them again!</li>
            <li> These are a little hard to get wrapped tightly enough by yourself, but they work great and are so much better than soaking your fingers in acetone for 10 minutes.  Once all your fingers are wrapped, you can still do things while waiting (I wouldn&#x27;t eat though!) The twisting motion gets most of the shellac off and the rest can be scraped off with an orange stick.  After having one manicurist bleach my fingers with acetone and then use a sander to remove the residue, I decided &#x27;never again.&#x27;  Glad I did . . .</li>
            <li> This seems like a good idea, but it is much easier (and cheaper) to let the salon do this for you.  Or if you still want to do this at home, just use pads soaked in acetone and wrap finger with a small piece of foil.  Just let the salon do it!!</li>
            <li> On initial examination, the product seemed like it would work very well.  Unfortunately though, upon application I found that one really would need the help of someone else to apply them properly on their own fingers.  Very cumbersome to apply on your own.  Other than that, the product works well.</li>
            <li> I tried to return them but seller said, &#x27;no, watch a youtube video.&#x27; Not cool. They don&#x27;t stay on - even after the video - and aren&#x27;t worth the price. Use cotton and tinfoil instead. Much better.</li>
            <li> these were too difficult to do by yourself</li>
            <li> Love them but too expensive. Hard to put on for myself.  Will probably purchase it again later, if it comes on sale.</li>
            <li> For what it&#x27;s worth, I haven&#x27;t been a nail tech since the 80&#x27;s, but I have been on both sides of the nail business, so here is my personal opinion on the Shellac system, particularly the remover wraps.    It&#x27;s true, using cotton pads/balls soaked in acetone, placing them on the nails and then wrapping each fingertip with foil does work (for I tried it after reading the previous review instead of buying the wraps; I found the wraps to work better for my tastes).  The wraps limit the exposure of my skin to the acetone and the wrap around design securely tightens to my fingers, unlike the foil.    This seems to keep my skin, particularly the tips of my fingers, from becoming so dried out from the acetone. I also experienced a quicker, cleaner and more complete removal of the shellac product from my fingernails requiring less cleaning from an orange stick and less exposure length to the acetone, for I found the foil didn&#x27;t keep the ball in place on the nail bed as well as the forms, requiring me to reposition and frequently keeping them on a little longer to sufficiently soften the product for removal.    Bottom-line, in my opinion, the remover wraps are a specific tool designed to be used specifically on your nails and that limits exposure to the drying effects of the acetone and holds the acetone more securely to the product during the 10 minutes required to sit with the wraps on, as opposed to using the cotton ball/foil method.  For me personally, it&#x27;s worth it, so I&#x27;ll use them over the cotton ball/foil method every time.</li>
            <li> Although these remover wraps are not the only way to remove your shellac manicure, they do make it easy - especially for DIY.  The 100 pack makes it more cost-effective.</li>
            <li> While it is a neat concept, they don&#x27;t really work. Even after soaking the pad in pure acetone and wrapping them on my fingers (which is almost impossible to do yourself) the polish is still pretty much intact after 10 minutes. You would be better off just soaking your fingernails in a manicure bowl with acetone which works every time. Don&#x27;t waste your money on these wraps, as even the salon that I go to won&#x27;t use them.</li>
            <li> I initially bought these wraps because I read that they work better than the foil method of removing shellac.  Well, I have officially tried both methods and have to tell you that, to me, they both work the same.  The only difference I found was that these wraps are nicely packaged and have a little sticky tab to keep them in place where the foil/acetone soaked cotton ball is a do-it-yourself kind of project. To be perfectly honest, the end result is the same so if you don&#x27;t mind a little DIY, the foil is the cheaper way to go.  If you have the funds, go for the CND wraps.</li>
            <li> For my purposes, these worked well. They are a little hard to put on--but once on they work just fine. I found I could do my left hand--and then reuse the same wraps on my right. (Just pull the wraps off and wiggle your fingers back in.) Left on 10 minutes and polish came right off.</li>
            <li> These little things are amazing. How did I ever live with out them?</li>
            <li> Band-aids (adhesive bandages) work just as good as wraps and at  fraction of the cost. saturate pad of band-aid with acetone and wrap.</li>
            <li> hard to tighten but does a decent job</li>
            <li> Received the product very quickly.  You do need to order the Red  Carpet Gel Polish Remover separately though.  These are dry wraps only.  I was glad I read other reviews.  Just apply a small amount of remover, wrap your nails, wait 10 minutes, and the polish comes right off.  So easy.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> These were very hard to use. They did not stay in place well and my shellac took much longer to remove than when I used some aluminum foil and part of a piece of cotton ball.</li>
            <li> I feel like these are a pain in the you-know-what to apply. I feel they&#x27;re a waste of money because cotton balls and tin foil are way cheaper and faster to apply than positioning the wrap and then wrapping up the flaps tightly enough around the finger. I thought the idea was cool when Shellac first came out, but after using them I didn&#x27;t find them practical in the least.</li>
            <li> To all of those out there that are assuming these come pre-soaked with acetone, THEY DON&#x27;T.  You need to get your own acetone to soak the cotton pads on these which is no big deal since it&#x27;s so cheap to buy anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lets start with the pro&#x27;s: Very easy to use for fingers and toes, concentrates the acetone on the nail not the surrounding skin, lets your fingers breathe while wrapped which decreases the \\&quot;hot\\&quot; feeling foil wrapping cause, quick to apply (all 10 fingers in less than 3 minutes), doesn&#x27;t leave fuzz behind like using cotton balls will, and allows you to still pick things up and do basic things without having to worry about the wraps coming off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are a few cons: They are pricy (about $20 to do your nails 10x).  Really that&#x27;s the only con I can think of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love these things.  I hate using foil and cotton so these really work great for me.</li>
            <li> I tried to buy some of these at the local store, but they were so expensive.  I got a great bargain online and will buy them again.</li>
            <li> These wraps work great for taking off the gel polish.  It is a little difficult to get the hang of putting them on snugly at first but once you do they work great!  Much better than the cotton ball and foil method.  You do have to leave them on for a full 15 minutes for them to really get the gel to come off, but if you do the polish scrapes right off no problem.  I guess in theory you could use a band aid, but I&#x27;m not sure if the pads would soak up the remover as well, or if they are big enough for long nails, however these wraps are.  Love them!  Will absolutely buy again!</li>
            <li> Work well but difficult to manage when you are doing this on your own nails.  Acetone soaked cotton wrapped in aluminum foil works just as well.</li>
            <li> These really make taking shellac off easier as long as they are used correctly.  They really need to be wrapped so that they are air tight.  It took me a couple times to get the hang of it but now that I have it down, I do prefer this way over using cotton balls and foil.</li>
            <li> I really hate buying something that ends up worthless, and this was definitely $20 thrown away.  I followed the directions exactly without the desired effect. Then I tried it different ways - different nail products and times - and it still did not work well. Cotton balls wrapped with aluminum foil works way better for pennies. I hope this will keep others from wasting their money.  It has taught me the importance of reading reviews for products with which I am not familiar.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste you money on this product.  Aluminum foil works better.  However, I question the whole concept of letting your nails soak in acetone.  I had read articles/reviews of all shellac/gel products re acetone, but the allure of a two week manicure was too inviting.  I had gone to a salon and had shellac done...  Bottom line?  My nails seemed to disintegrate, peel and split.  I invested a lot of money in the uv lamp, shellac, etc.</li>
            <li> good way to take off shellac, not messy, easy and gentle on your nails and skin, i would recommend, enjoy</li>
            <li> Use this shellac weekly on my nails, love it. works great as I am allergic to acrylic and no problems with this product. Easy to use and works fast to wrap your nails.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my own usage but found that it&#x27;s not easy to manipulate on your own hands.  I&#x27;ve had to use alternate means to remove the gel nails.  I&#x27;m hoping to find better instructions than I&#x27;ve used to make the purchase worthwhile.</li>
            <li> These are very convenient but in all honesty just using aluminum foil and cotton pads work just as well and are a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> Lining it up can be a bit tricky, but once you got it, its very effective and easy to use.</li>
            <li> They are the most difficult things to use.  Absolutely no instructions with them.  I would love to return them.  Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Maria Everding</li>
            <li> .makes removing the gel shellac easy. Wish they were alittle less expensive. Why do I have to use so many words just to tell you I love it?</li>
            <li> Hard to work with.  Could not do what it was intended for plus it did not soften the gel polish.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I find these hard to get on tight and once you have a few fingers done it really gets challenging. I doubt if I will get these again. Using a cotton ball and foil is just as good.</li>
            <li> If you are a manicurist and want to look professional, buy these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are doing your nails at home, don&#x27;t waste your money. Just buy one of those nail polish remover tubs with the sponge inside and soak a few nails at a time. Try putting these on all your nails at once by yourself - nearly impossible. They are only partially effective, leaving the corners of your nails virtually untouched by the acetone. Beside the aforementioned alternative, buy this tool to assist in removal of gel/shellac polish [[ASIN:B001B7PVRS Body Toolz Cuticle Pusher]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably throw these things away when I can come to terms with wasting $21.19</li>
            <li> Excellent and amazing product I recommended for every one because its a very interesting and useful product so buy it now!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. What an ordeal to get them on, then they don&#x27;t stay on, then they don&#x27;t remove the shellac. Ridiculous!</li>
            <li> I love gel nails, and I think that using these at home is the easy quick way to get the removal taken care of.</li>
            <li> These wraps are pretty to look at. That&#x27;s all. But they&#x27;re not 100% effective because they don&#x27;t always remove Shellac along the sides of most nails. Using cotton balls saturated in acetone and held in place with a little piece of foil is heck of a lot cheaper and much more effective. I love the CND Shellac product but I&#x27;ll skip buying these wraps in the future.</li>
            <li> This product is useful if you don&#x27;t mind spending money on something you can do yourself.  Since I have to buy the polish remover anyway, I may as well spend an extra dollar or 2 on the cotton balls, orange sticks and foil.  These supplies will undoubtedly last me through several polish changes, making the cotton ball method,way cheaper while providing the same results.  To all worried about dry skin, do as the pros do and put a dab of vaseline on the tips of your fingers and cuticles and dry skin or damaged nails won&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
            <li> I love gel polish but hate getting it off -- soaking my fingertips is cumbersome and time consuming.  however, these wraps are difficult to put on and get to stay on. I must not have read fine print but I thought they would come soaked with remover -- which they don&#x27;t.  my nail person uses makeup remover pads and tin foil -- tin foil actually keeps pad in place and stays on finger tips when crumpled/twisted.  this also generates heat -- polish comes right off after a few minutes.  she cuts the pads and foil in half -- gets the pads at Sally&#x27;s and the tin foil  at Sam&#x27;s or Costco (baked potato wrappers for the restaurant trade).</li>
            <li> Very good product and price. Would definitely recommend, much better than cotton pads and foil to get gel nails off.</li>
            <li> Luv this product. Shared with my nailist&lt;br /&gt;She is going to purchase for her other clients.&lt;br /&gt;Saved my skin from acetone.</li>
            <li> Love these but they are hard to use. Perhaps I&#x27;ll get better with practice. Once you get them on they work great, but when I&#x27;m doing my own nails I don&#x27;t even try to get them on my right hand anymore. :(</li>
            <li> They work as promised. I like not having to soak in the acetone for so long to remove the shellac.</li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t need these. Simply soak a cotton ball in acetone, put it on the nail, wrap in foil for 10 min. Same effect but a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> Great concept, but difficult to keep them on your fingers</li>
            <li> These are fun, and make your fingers look like little mummies. You may need some help putting them on your dominant hand, but other than that they are great.</li>
            <li> I use these for Gelish removal and find that they work as quickly as the cotton ball and tin-foil method. It takes me 20-25 minutes of soaking to get the Gelish to remove easily and I do not file the shine off the top as I have found that it takes the same amount of time either way. For me the remover wraps stay on my fingers more securely so that I can perform light activities (i.e. use the remote of the TV) while soaking both hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others have complained of several things:&lt;br /&gt;- they do not hold enough remover - I have not found this to be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;- they are difficult to put on - the pointer finger and thumbs are the trickiest but I am able to put them on all of my fingers myself and with about the same difficulty as foil. I put them on starting with both pinkies, then both ring fingers, both middle fingers, then the thumbs and then the pointer fingers - this allows me to preserve the most dexterity.&lt;br /&gt;- they are expensive - to me they are worth it but obviously are a lot more expensive than cotton balls and foil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not like to remove gelish without these and will continue to buy them as long as I use gel polish.</li>
            <li> These make changing polish from gel nail polish perfect super easy and not messy at all and can still use fingers while waiting for polish to come off! LOVE THESE!</li>
            <li> i receive it in very good conditions</li>
            <li> Great lov them good price</li>
            <li> My order was a 10 count not a 100 count.  Major rip off.  They are also very difficult to use.  I even took them to a salon to put on for me and the employee had trouble.  Awful!</li>
            <li> I would not recommend these wraps.  They are difficult to use.  You can only apply one hand at a time and the wraps fall off very easily.  There are better nail wraps out there that i have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Great product.</li>
            <li> The wraps are good quality but I don&#x27;t like that I have to use acetone with it because when I wrap my fingers with the acetone on the pads my skin around the nail is like on fire, all the 10 minutes! But I guess it&#x27;s the only way to remove the gel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not easy taking off gel nail polish by yourself with anything  but I find these a bit easier than foil and cotton.</li>
            <li> Waste of money. If you wait about two weeks, the shellac nail polish peels off on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> this is the best product.  it made removal of shellac polish easy and a quick process.  this is the only way to go.</li>
            <li> I tried soaking my nails to remove the Gel polish.  Slow, and not very effective -- plus it smells!  I tried cotton balls with acetone and wrapping that in tin foil.  More effective than soaking, less messy -- but I felt like I could hold onto the rabbit ears of an old TV set to improve the reception.  The wraps are the best, so far.  I find I need to have someone else to help -- with one hand wrapped in these, I can&#x27;t quite manage the other hand -- and I&#x27;m always in too much of a rush to do one hand, wait the 10 minutes, then do the other hand.  I&#x27;m surprised at the reasonable price for 10 polish removal&#x27;s worth.  With as long as the gel polish lasts, I&#x27;d guess this package will last me at least 6 months.</li>
            <li> I like how this will take off the CND shellac, but the product is big and bulky and to me a waste of money. A cotton ball and aluminum foil will do the same. But, if you don&#x27;t mind paying for it, it&#x27;s a great idea.</li>
            <li> I bought these because I do my own soak off gel nails and these seemed really convenient. But... it&#x27;s actually way easier just to soak a cotton ball in acetone and wrap it in aluminium foil.&lt;br /&gt;Pass.</li>
            <li> Takes off the polish in just a few swipes</li>
