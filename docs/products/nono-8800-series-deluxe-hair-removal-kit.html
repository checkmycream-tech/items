    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>/&gt;I have been impressed that it doesn&#x27;t bother my skin (I have to use it on the highest setting too, though I did work up to it).</li>
            <li>I am intrigued by all three, but want to get the best treatment for the money I spend.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t shave often because its winter, so its a perfect time to nono.</li>
            <li>and I know that nothing is 100% perfect.</li>
            <li>The nono works best on my face and it has been a bit of miracle worker for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I am very happy with this product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 100% happy with the Tria 4x!</li>
            <li>awesome right).&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also in all honesty their buffers are not the greatest they are done after 1 or 2</li>
            <li>and it is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I love my no no!!!</li>
            <li>The seller,  however, was very nice when she sold it to me!</li>
            <li>Have a good one!</li>
            <li>Good luck!</li>
            <li>bought a Tria 4x and have had stunningly good results in just two days!</li>
            <li>I bought this product because they salesman said that my fair skin and hair made me the perfect person to use this product.</li>
            <li>bought one for a friend (I do like the results on my legs) who has curly hair, and it works great for her.</li>
            <li>and I have to say that I am happy with my results.</li>
            <li>I am happy to answer any questions.</li>
            <li>I am still using my nono and remain happy with my results.</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t happy with the results within 60 days you can return it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m happy my smoke alarm didn&#x27;t go off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought the nono about three months ago, and it&#x27;s working great.</li>
            <li>and it sounded great.  </li>
            <li>It worked great on my face.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced any burns or anything.</li>
            <li>It works great.</li>
            <li>bottom line have patience and follow their directions and you will get a great product.</li>
            <li>This seemed like a great solution.</li>
            <li>Customer service wasn&#x27;t that great either.</li>
            <li>the people were very nice</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I originally loved this product and had great hopes.  </li>
            <li>This is a good thing and indicates the system is working to remove the hair.</li>
            <li>I have fair, olive-toned skin</li>
            <li>Unlike a lot of the reviewers, my unit is still working after 6 months of continous use, surprisingly.</li>
            <li>As others have mentioned, I read the reviews on the products website before purchasing and thought this was a good product...</li>
            <li>Please don&#x27;t forget to use the nono correctly for good results.</li>
            <li>However, I got great results with my legs though :)&lt;</li>
            <li>So, the more you use the No!No!</li>
            <li>well some of you may be more successful...</li>
            <li>This product is great for virgin and fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have course hair there, and it took care of it nicely.</li>
            <li>This kind of screws up my 6 week review for you</li>
            <li>But lets be honest that is not how the hair grows.</li>
            <li>Also, is there some kind of guarantee or warranty on the product in case it is defective or stops working after some time.</li>
            <li>I also use it effectively on my face and arms.</li>
            <li>claims it is effective on all hair types.</li>
            <li>So, taking matters into my own hand, I called their 888 customer service number.</li>
            <li>Representatives will not divulge that kind of information.</li>
            <li>and it is still good for a lot more uses.</li>
            <li>Thank you for the honest reviews.  </li>
            <li>Your skin looks so nice.</li>
            <li>Nice, I like the Nono</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t imagine how nice it is to not have to worry about shaving all the time.  </li>
            <li>Series Deluxe Hair Removal Kit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>am happy to report that my new nono has been working great.</li>
            <li>The product works wonderful brand spanking new</li>
            <li>I am fair skin, and have light hair...but lets face it ladies, unwanted hair is unwanted hair.   </li>
            <li>I am balder in areas that are easy to reach!</li>
            <li>is very fine.  </li>
            <li>Great product,,  I got results after the first use.</li>
            <li>I notice very smooth and even baby like skin.</li>
            <li>I had very light paech fuzz hair</li>
            <li>aw maybe we&#x27;ve got ourself a cure :)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it once or twice a week since I got it, but do use it on the hair at the appropriate length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love my NONO.  </li>
            <li>The hair on my legs (in addition to lighter and thinner) seems to be beginning to become a bit more sporadic.</li>
            <li>will update when he has more results.</li>
            <li>OK so my NONO is not working correctly.</li>
            <li>It will be interesting to see if the time lapse will effect the hair growth.</li>
            <li>think it will take more than 6 weeks to get the desired results I am looking for.</li>
            <li>I hope my review helps. :)&lt;</li>
            <li>Actually better than I imagined.</li>
            <li>Do not tip the nono forward, more than a 90 degree angle, this always burned me in the beginning.</li>
            <li>The NONO works best on short stubble.</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of letting my hair grow out before getting the NONO (used to having to do so for waxing) and it took me longer to use it and more passes to burn the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried it for 3 weeks more often.</li>
            <li>I also researched in the Internet and there are many risk with it.</li>
            <li>Bikini needs many more treatments.</li>
            <li>it was way more painful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are more cons than pros to using this system.</li>
            <li>I am so happy that I took the time to really research this product before buying it.</li>
            <li>I have more hair now that I had before on my face.</li>
            <li>maybe it&#x27;ll be better as I continue to use it....</li>
            <li>It is so safe I&#x27;d let a teenager or students between ages 13 and up use it.</li>
            <li>It is safe on darker skin.</li>
            <li>like many have said, maybe it is the shape of my face?</li>
            <li>but I am sure glad I did.</li>
            <li>I am just a hairy Armenian girl looking for some relief : )</li>
            <li>are more details of the conversation between me and the customer service rep.  </li>
            <li>So, do some models break more than others?</li>
            <li>Sure.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure, given time and patience, no-no will do what is promised in their advertisement.</li>
            <li>How many replacements will you put up with before calling it quits?</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Then you need to buy more..</li>
            <li>an she couldn&#x27;t be happier :-)</li>
            <li>We had to turn them into the Better Business Bureau after months of being ignored.  </li>
            <li>They do say in the instruction manual that you have to make sure you hold it correctly for it to work</li>
            <li>and they could do better on the instructional DVD.</li>
            <li>ok it works</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>My Mom owns the no no hair series and it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>and it gets it better then</li>
            <li>and she says that it works better than razors for her</li>
            <li>and this works much better and lasts a lot longer.</li>
            <li>and I urge others to not waste time or money on no!no!...!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I have tried many methods for hair removal and the No</li>
            <li>I had lost most of my hair using IPL machine (VISS)</li>
            <li>and since I stopped using that device to give No NO a try, I noticed getting more hair.</li>
            <li>so I am totally okay with that.</li>
            <li>I love nono.  </li>
            <li>I have gotten so many compliments on my face.</li>
            <li>are Argan oil which is a wonderful product I plan on buying in the future.</li>
            <li>Which is probably like most of us</li>
            <li>Razors do better work than this thing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it wasn&#x27;t lie</li>
            <li>My daughter and I were very excited to get this.</li>
            <li>Worked great on my face (hair came off fine), but when I tried it under my arms, the hair is much thicker.</li>
            <li>was a new tip and the rep I got was great, helpful, knew what they were talking about and no problems.</li>
            <li>was a new tip and the rep I got was great, helpful, knew what they were talking about and no problems.</li>
            <li>It is important I always look my best because my job requires a lot of public speaking.</li>
            <li>Any vellus hair I had is gone and the hair that was course is becoming vellus.</li>
            <li>I bought this 2 years ago and really gave it a good college try.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work right at all and costs a lot of money to just lie around in a drawer!!</li>
            <li>Getting just 6 full leg treatments can cost up to $2000!</li>
            <li>If you are still full on hair it is going to be a battle, but it will work!</li>
            <li>The no no is easy to use</li>
            <li>I will not attempt my chin or face since I scar easy.</li>
            <li>I found it fairly easy to use</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to care for and stores or travels well.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t easy to return but they eventually repaid me.</li>
            <li>The smell of burning hair is strong.  </li>
            <li>The only good reviews are probably from within their own company using made up names.</li>
            <li>The internet and Amazon are amazing, thanks!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s kind of like when you first learned to shave your legs with a razor.&lt;br /&gt;Tip</li>
            <li>Also getting your own wax warmer and supplies for in home use is much cheaper than this product!</li>
            <li>If I look closely I can see baby fine hairs.</li>
            <li>This one has been working fine with no problems.</li>
            <li>If you just want to use it to remove fine hair from your face, legs, arms, etc.</li>
            <li>you use it one because your hair is less and thinner and two because you&#x27;ve learned the perfect speed</li>
            <li>It says in fine print that it may take up to six months for results, well I&#x27;m here to tell you that there is no difference.  </li>
            <li>The old saying &amp;#34; if it sounds to good to be true, it probably is&amp;#34; seems appropriate here.  </li>
            <li>My under arms are fine, not hair free but almost.</li>
            <li>I cannot afford itand although $250 is steep, it is still a huge savings.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m all for free enterprise</li>
            <li>My legs are hair free</li>
            <li>Also feel free to ask questions if I have not covered something you would like to know:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I feel it is more powerful.</li>
            <li>It does not leave me smooth and the buffers are a joke.</li>
            <li>I used to feel prickly after shaving no matter what, but now I get those ultra smooth legs like you get with nair.</li>
            <li>No biggie, light a candle.</li>
            <li>I notice the result is like a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>and I have not had a lot of problems burns or with the light turning off while in use</li>
            <li>yes, but I light a candle or my Lampberger and go on with my life.</li>
            <li>I shave two to three times a day to keep my face and neck smooth.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s important for me to be as smooth as possible.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hope this review can help shed some light for those who are considering in purchasing a no-no.</li>
            <li>I visited their website and filled out the contact form with a barrage of questions...</li>
            <li>As for the burnt hair smell they tell you to light a candle.</li>
            <li>I used to use smooth away all the time instead of a razor before they stopped selling them in stores in my area.</li>
            <li>the tip was defective when I put it in the tip light was 1 bar then</li>
            <li>the tip was defective when I put it in the tip light was 1 bar then</li>
            <li>WHEN THE RESULTS, OR NO RESULTS SHOULD I SAY WAS CONFIRMED</li>
            <li>The smell of burnt hair is tolerable, and if people don&#x27;t like it, light a candle.  </li>
            <li>received my Nono and thought the clicking sound meant it was working.  </li>
            <li>So far so good</li>
            <li>The No!No! was very effective to remove hair from my upper lip and chin.</li>
            <li>It works very nicely and I look forward to seeing how it continues to work in the future.</li>
            <li>The fine hair is the first to notice and the thicker more stubborn hair I am still working on</li>
            <li>I am getting excited to see what happens in another month.</li>
            <li>Like everyone else, I was excited to try this.  </li>
            <li>BUT IT IS SOOOOOO WORTH IT IN THE END!</li>
            <li>It takes longer when you are first learning to use and it gets quicker the more</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own will not slow your hair growth.</li>
            <li>The one I received in return was refurbished and they said that the warranty would not be extended to year from the replacement date and the original date of purchase still determined to end of the one year warranty.</li>
            <li>, ONCE I GOT IT, I WAS SO EXCITED AND USED IT AS SOON AS IT WAS DONE</li>
            <li>I paid almost the original price because they sent it to collection agency</li>
            <li>First day of use and it was okay.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to try my</li>
            <li>The hair on my legs is very light and soft, I feel more skin than hair if I run my hand against the growth.</li>
            <li>The results were adequate on lightly haired places.  </li>
            <li>My arms stay clean for a month.</li>
            <li>He started reading a script and tried to get me to jump aboard and take advantage of their special promotion...</li>
            <li>yeah, right!)</li>
            <li>If it has been a successful seller, it is because it is sold late at night on tv when people are apt to purchase anything.</li>
            <li>He has not had a full week yet, I will update when he does.</li>
            <li>I must say it was not painful in any way, nor did I burn myself, as I used one of the lower settings.  </li>
            <li>I had about 8 on my leg and unders arms and maybe 3-4 on my full bikini area.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that I am done with fuzz on my cheeks and sideburns and my makeup goes on so much nicer now.</li>
            <li>is so much faster and so much better.</li>
            <li>Their buffer was only good for one use on my legs, face, underarms and it already wasn&#x27;t working as well after doing my legs before I even did anything else.</li>
            <li>and she is already saying good things in the last 2 1/2</li>
            <li>Both the hair and pro series use the same tips so if you own this one and want to upgrade to the pro you don&#x27;t have to buy more tips right away.</li>
            <li>husband is not using it on a regular basis, so I apoligize for not being able to give more information on his use of the nono.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I am lucky because I have a head start with the lasers.</li>
            <li>Never stop on the skin or you may get a mild burn.</li>
            <li>i was so excited WHEN I SAW THIS AND ORDERED IT RIGHT AWAY</li>
            <li>Everyone is right, it&#x27;s the smell of burning hair, which essentially is all it&#x27;s good for.  </li>
            <li>First of all, it is finicky to use and often did nothing (you can tell because the light was not flashing).</li>
            <li>and when I did it was just so smooth and so fast!</li>
            <li>just finished my 4th week and the hair seems to be getting very fine and soft.</li>
            <li>My suggestion for anyone interested in purchasing this product is to determine the type of hair you have and how you want to use the No!No!</li>
            <li>this product is an absolute No No!!</li>
            <li>If she wants to use it fine, if not, I will donate it.</li>
            <li>hair removal systems-less painful, more effective, effective more quickly, etc?</li>
            <li>He is a body builder and wants a smooth chest.</li>
            <li>so I got the smooth away kit from amazon (actually when you get it it is called silky smooth but is listed as smooth away)</li>
            <li>I noticed more of a difference in the hair on my arms than legs so far.</li>
            <li>But I think it will be worth it.</li>
            <li>So If I have a the patience to see results, it is worth a try.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t feel it was worth the time or money.</li>
            <li>IT IS WELL WORTH</li>
            <li>For what this product does it isn&#x27;t worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I have spent thousands of dollars on laser removal in a Drs office and I loved it.  </li>
            <li>it after several swipes will kind of take off some of the softer hairs...</li>
            <li>(this keeps the hair the right length to use the No-No and takes care of strays), but that&#x27;s huge compared to the fast growing, once a day of before.</li>
            <li>And the fine print on the No-No website says you have to order it directly from them under special conditions to get a refund.</li>
            <li>My face has a range of black \\&quot;stumps\\&quot; from years of plucking my chin to more fine and lightly colored fuzz on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>You have to get the timing just right.</li>
            <li>It takes about 1 hour - 3x a week right now.</li>
            <li>(Surprise surprise, right?)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: This doesn&#x27;t feel right at all to me.</li>
            <li>I received it, charged and used it right away.  </li>
            <li>They tried and tried to convince me to keep it, telling me maybe I hadn&#x27;t used it right???  </li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t burn it right away.</li>
            <li>(but that means it is being done right).</li>
            <li>They got right on it and contacted the company.</li>
            <li>the No!No! I have given up trying to use it under my arms or legs because it took too long and the result wasn&#x27;t as effective as shaving.    </li>
            <li>It can manage only light and fine hair that almost invisible anyway.</li>
            <li>Is it true that certain models have a higher rate of failure?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and you won&#x27;t burn out your tip as quickly by having to use it so much just to do it.</li>
            <li>Show the wrong way to use it and the right way to use it instead of having a model on the DVD looking perfect.  </li>
            <li>He abruptly cut me off and said, \\&quot;thanks for calling, have a good day,\\&quot; and hung up.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was very fortunate about a year and a half ago to have a friend that managed a medi-spa and gave me free laser treatments.</li>
            <li>i better get my money back asap!!  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with it, but I was not expecting miracles, just the same results I got from epilating.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very sneaky amazon!</li>
            <li>just finished my first week of the nono.</li>
            <li>(as they keep starting over my 60 days) or just get my money back and search out the next best way for hair removal.</li>
            <li>(she knew I want to try it first without paying).</li>
            <li>It is too hot even on its lightest setting for my scar on my face.</li>
            <li>First, there is a burning hair smell.</li>
            <li>They are shills written by people paid by the company to promote their product to unwitting people who don&#x27;t look deeper than the first things they see.</li>
            <li>it does work, but this is my first time using it...</li>
            <li>First of all I want to say I am a guy.  </li>
            <li>that I wanted answers to first before dropping $270.00.</li>
            <li>(Although, I&#x27;ve seen a couple of reviews where they&#x27;ve been able to get their warranty got extended because of multiple defective devices and replacements.)</li>
            <li>so just be aware...</li>
            <li>Something else to be aware of.  </li>
            <li>I bought my NoNo a year ago (should have returned it before after the first 3 uses) and it&#x27;s all talk and no results.  </li>
            <li>The only place I found any meaningful reviews is on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It does not remove most of the hair and I have used it religiously for 4 months now.</li>
            <li>However, on the more coarse hair on the legs it did not work at all.</li>
            <li>Now I use the pro series and I have to say I like it better than the hair series because I have some coarse hair on my chin</li>
            <li>The pro series has two tips the one like the hair only it has better control</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I read the reviews prior to purchasing.  </li>
            <li>This product seems like this is more of the same.  </li>
            <li>, IT&#x27;S HOT AND MAKES MY SKIN</li>
            <li>I would much rather stick with a razor!</li>
            <li>I have had the No No for 1 year and although it took some getting use to it and really following directions, I love it.  </li>
            <li>At first I tried to use like a shaver - it isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>$270.00 is too much to spend on a device that might work, don&#x27;t risk it!</li>
            <li>it made more hair grow back</li>
            <li>that was darker and more coarse</li>
            <li>I should have read the reviews on Amazon first.  </li>
            <li>I first thought she wasn’t using it correctly, so I read all the instructions and tried it myself</li>
            <li>All it does is make a funny burning smell.</li>
            <li>When I first tried the NoNo, I had to get the hang of</li>
            <li>I went over the same areas 3 to 4 times to make sure I got as many hairs as possible.  </li>
            <li>Once I got that down to where it rolls smoothly, I had to go over and over one area many times.</li>
            <li>With the black nono 1 pass and the hair burns off.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with my results after 6 weeks.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend was super excited to try this though I had read mixed reviews.  </li>
            <li>I had hoped to do this all winter, and start the summer with smooth skin, but it was far too much work.</li>
            <li>Do this until it is smooth, you may need to wipe away the dried skin and hair off the buffer and where you are doing so that it works better and faster.</li>
            <li>No because her No No Hair was having issues with it clicking, a red light was coming on and it just was not working right.</li>
            <li>I am positive they were not there when this process began.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is quite pricey, so I am sure that even with a significant number of returns, they still profit heavily from those who never get around to mailing it</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for any help you can give me!</li>
            <li>Not true about the risk free!!</li>
            <li>Well, I kept up at it, about 5 times a week, and the hair on my arms is pretty much gone.</li>
            <li>It looked so simple, easy and convincing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and since I have had the lasers before I know that a certain patch may have 10 hairs and another 8 hairs</li>
            <li>My concern is the large number of defective no-no&#x27;s being returned or replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even the fine hair removal left stubble.</li>
            <li>My fine peach fuzz is now a blonde stubble.  </li>
            <li>The buffer is like an extra fine sandpaper and it doesn&#x27;t hurt If you have ever used a buffer instead of a razor</li>
            <li>It works VERY well on fine facial peach fuzz.  </li>
            <li>Armed with this information, I was sure I had nothing to loose but hair!</li>
            <li>Companies like these have a huge budget to pay \\&quot;independent\\&quot; people to write reviews in several forums -- even here in Amazon!</li>
            <li>although it did not seem to remove much hair..  </li>
            <li>have not had much luck with it on my bikini area or under arms.</li>
            <li>He does not have a very hairy chest to begin with but has noticed a slower growth and a thinning in the hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really hope this one is not defective.</li>
            <li>I pull my lips in (as if evening out lipstick) and I stick my toung under my upper lip (depending on the area I am trying to reach) to make a smooth even surface for gliding the nono and not to get burned.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now I can go 3 days before I have that much growth.</li>
            <li>I do have to shave, but I&#x27;ve never had such smooth results after shaving.</li>
            <li>have used it sporadically on my bikini and underarms but have really just been focusing on my legs.</li>
            <li>It all grows just as fast as it did before I used</li>
            <li>I ordered the listed No No and didn&#x27;t know much about them except that my wife wanted one.  </li>
            <li>Move it too fast and it&#x27;s useless!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have to say that I am very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are like me just knowing that there is something to help this much is comforting.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yes, there is a 60-days guarantee where you can try no-no for free, and if you don&#x27;t like it, you can send it back, no questions asked.</li>
            <li>(let&#x27;s say 5...and that&#x27;s being generous), you would really offer no assistance to the customer once their 2-year warranty expires?\\</li>
            <li>thanks Amazon customers.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work.</li>
            <li>It self-adjusts to the temperature it wants to be.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t mind the buffers, but don&#x27;t think they did all that much.</li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing for</li>
            <li>It is really painless</li>
            <li>Very time consuming , not like  shaving or waxing.</li>
            <li>My mom after trying out my pro with her tips wants to upgrade to the pro.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll know what you are doing, if you haven&#x27;t the videos don&#x27;t really explain it too well</li>
            <li>and it will go so much faster</li>
            <li>and my hair is already softer and not growing in as fast as when I was using tweezers and</li>
            <li>VERY time consuming but</li>
            <li>I can&#x60;t imagine how much money was paid to all the models and magazines for the \\&quot;rave reviews\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>and then I don&#x27;t think you could remove the much hair.</li>
            <li>it wasnot very noticable</li>
            <li>time I will go straight to the vendor to purchase.</li>
            <li>It works much like an iron or heating coil from a toaster.</li>
            <li>So much money for an inferior product.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll have to return it &amp; make sure we order the complete set next time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works best on thin hair areas like arms and facial hair.  </li>
            <li>No Hair removal was the least useful and effective method.</li>
            <li>I am good at following skin care and other beauty regimens</li>
            <li>Better than every other day.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions perfectly (which was tedious) and it didn&#x27;t help at all!</li>
            <li>, as long as you have the patience and dedication to actually let this thing work, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any over buffing redness, I only had to go over it a couple times with the silky smooth instead of the normal 15 times when I don&#x27;t use the no</li>
            <li>looks like it&#x27;s breaking down fast though, relies on a Li battery, and need to replace glow wires about as many times as you do with razor</li>
            <li>in the long run its definitely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t leave you all hairless and smooth like how they show in the video, definitely need to use something else along with it at first like an epilator or an electric shaver</li>
            <li>bought the product on a special discount using the promo on the TV commercial.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it for almost the full trial time and then called to send it back.  </li>
            <li>I did start to notice a slight thinning of the hair after 2 weeks but wasn&#x27;t sure if it was my imagination or not.</li>
            <li>this device trully worked I&#x27;d surely see less hair on my face and neck by now.  </li>
            <li>The only issue I&#x27;ve had is if I go over a spot one to many times, it gets red (like razor burn), but I&#x27;ve used it over eczema without increased irritation.</li>
            <li>and there that have nothing, mainly in the underarm</li>
            <li>To fast and the system isn&#x27;t effective, too slow and it won&#x27;t turn on.</li>
            <li>I have been using no no for more than 5 months and only for my facial hair...  </li>
            <li>I spend a moderate amount of money on my physical appearance but nothing over the top...</li>
            <li>I was left with charred, much more obvious, burnt smelling hair on my face which I than had to use a cream hair remover on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>ALSO HAVE MANY DIFFERENT ADS SELLING THIS SAME PRODUCT</li>
            <li>I have been getting laser hair removal done professionally for some time, but I am interested in beginning new areas at home.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ll leave you high and dry...with a $270.00 paperweight...</li>
            <li>Because they had the setting too high.</li>
            <li>AND I DO NOT HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN!!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and everything I expected!</li>
            <li>I stopped using my NO NO and went back to my VISS which gives great results but is more painful and time consuming to use.</li>
            <li>and it does not slow or remove permenantly.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t use the lotion included with the kit, but I washed my face with Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s Deep Cleansing face wash and the chamomile, helped to calm my skin (I use it after I wax my eyebrows, and the redness is gone immediately).  </li>
            <li>hairless\\&quot; in my opinion, but the difference is enough for me to find it worth</li>
            <li>The hair is pretty much everywhere, including my female sideburns.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of a duh</li>
            <li>It is common for me to have three hairs growing at once out of one follicle, so I was thrilled when my underarms became almost hairless before I had to quit going to the office for treatments.  </li>
            <li>I am def encouraged to continue using it every 2 days for more firm results.</li>
            <li>Is this really worth $300 when it only does 1/5 of the work it promised to do?</li>
            <li>However, it is only fair to let any other consumer make the choice to purchase one for themselves by me simply sharing my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Melin</li>
            <li>This is going right back to sender!!  </li>
            <li>Waiting to see if it grows right back</li>
            <li>well after several calls as to perhaps I was not using it right</li>
            <li>On the commercial it shows it being used on a man&#x27;s chest hair and it came right off.</li>
            <li>you are looking for something as quick as shaving, painless, doesn&#x27;t smell, you can do at home and gives long lasing results, slows hair growth and thins it</li>
            <li>you are looking for something as quick as shaving, painless, doesn&#x27;t smell, you can do at home and gives long lasing results, slows hair growth and thins it</li>
            <li>like I did and use their buffers to polish up after you finish buffing with the other one.having issues with it clicking, a red light was coming on and it just was not working right.</li>
            <li>It worked on fine hair if she went over the same area several times.</li>
            <li>When I got the light flashing it was extremely time consuming.</li>
            <li>I used the No No as directed (moving the No No slowly over my leg, with the blue light lit, multiple times per session, 3 times a week for 3 months) and did not see a decrease in my hair growth.  </li>
            <li>It will not take care of dark thick hairs no matter how many times i go over it or how many times i use it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>They said perhaps mine was defective, and offered me a new one.  </li>
            <li>so I will continue to review after I recieve my new nono.</li>
            <li>I just receivedmy new NONO 12-3.</li>
            <li>I was without my NONO for 5 days and did not notice new hair growth or anything to make me think I was set back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Customer service sent me a new NONO and new attachments and started my 60 day trial over.</li>
            <li>So I have a choice to make... get a new nono every 50 days or so</li>
            <li>it was still new on the market</li>
            <li>I now have a new one of each size tip being sent out to me.</li>
            <li>it was still new on the market</li>
            <li>I now have a new one of each size tip being sent out to me.</li>
            <li>All they did was offer to exchange it for a new one.</li>
            <li>I used it over and over, bought new cartridges, etc</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and there is less hair after each use.  </li>
            <li>Again, i have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This is the first time I bought something because of a TV commercial.</li>
            <li>I am not sure that this explanation is actually plausible (which is why I tried</li>
            <li>Consistent usage is key!    </li>
            <li>There is a 60 day money back \\&quot;guarantee\\&quot;, so here is my first week...</li>
            <li>I have dark hair and light skin.</li>
            <li>and I could see the dark hair under my skin so it would look like stubble even if it was smooth.</li>
            <li>that means my hair grows back fast!</li>
            <li>I used it the first time it did make me jump because on the video the lady does it with such ease.</li>
            <li>There is no such thing on the market at this time, but if you are willing to spend the time to use it correctly and buff while say watching TV on the couch before bed</li>
            <li>There is no such thing on the market at this time, but if you are willing to spend the time to use it correctly and buff while say watching TV on the couch before bed</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>junk do not waste you money, spend a few more dollars and get at least a 20x hair or more removal system.</li>
            <li>Today I found out that they pay for shipping costs only if I would have payed the full price and only if you try it for exacly 60 days!</li>
            <li>When google searching for \\&quot;NoNo Product Reviews\\&quot;, you are barraged by a ton of personal blogs and positive customer testimonials...</li>
            <li>2 - 5 - arms are still smooth and there is less hair to clear.</li>
            <li>The case is small enough to fit in your purse but there is no room for the charger nor is there a compartment in which to secure the extra head, that being whichever one that&#x27;s not in use.</li>
            <li>I have used the same large thermicon since the beginning and the indicator shows it to still have 3 bars (measuring 3-0).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but they wouldn&#x27;t refund the shipping until after a certain number of days in which I had to call back.</li>
            <li>I asked for the Black nono this time after the representive made me aware that it is the latest to be released and they have not had the black nonos returned.</li>
            <li>It is ok to tip it back toward the roller a little.</li>
            <li>Huge waste of money</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would also like to clear up some confusion, I have been questioned about my four star rating then</li>
            <li>I suspect one of the reasons results differ so wildly is because of how the hair lies.</li>
            <li>use a loofah while showering to exfoliate the burned hair and then apply a natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li>but I will still post my 6th week to complete my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is not a device that will make you \\&quot;completely</li>
            <li>However, my family can&#x27;t stand the smell and complain frequently about it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the glow wire burns the skin, if you don&#x27;t move it fast enough.</li>
            <li>He didn&#x27;t have clear or concise answers for any of my questions.  </li>
            <li>What does come back is much thinner.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s taking much longer for the results to be seen on my legs, but it&#x27;s definitely working on the bikini line.</li>
            <li>Please do NOT waste your money on this piece of junk.  </li>
            <li>but it is not growing back as fast</li>
            <li>Go over it a few times and your legs will be smooth.</li>
            <li>and if you do it too much your skin will be red</li>
            <li>and she couldn&#x27;t get it fixed or exchange it</li>
            <li>and she couldn&#x27;t get it fixed or exchange it</li>
            <li>The device stopped working completely in about 8 weeks</li>
            <li>As far as it removing the hair permanently perhaps if you are burned and scared no hair is going to grow there.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
            <li>I was highly surprised to receive it before the date of arrival.</li>
            <li>It might \\&quot;look like\\&quot; your legs are touchably soft, but when you touch them they are still prickly.  </li>
            <li>I was completely dissatisfied.</li>
            <li>If there isn&#x27;t a reduction in the amount of hair on my legs and I am going to have to shave too, I&#x27;ll just shave and not waste my time with the No No.  </li>
            <li>this product was a complete dissapointment</li>
            <li>It just burns the hair at the skin level and grows back, just as fast as it did.</li>
            <li>and I will say, it is too early to say &amp;#34;excellent&amp;#34;,</li>
            <li>and I was surprised to receive it.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called Nono direct and sadi there should be a humming noise.  </li>
            <li>A class action law suit is what you all need.</li>
            <li>I got it because i have really sensitive skin on my legs and wanted something besides shaving.</li>
            <li>I have never broken out on my neck before using this product and I&#x27;m only breaking out in the area</li>
            <li>It is nice on my thin face hair</li>
            <li>Now at 3 weeks I am getting a little excited about my results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was a little hard to use at first, but I know after a while I was kind of getting the hang of it.  </li>
            <li>First, I wash my arms and legs with soap and water and dry.</li>
            <li>Not sure about this it didn&#x27;t take the hair off easy and</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does not pick up every single hair, but it was my first time using it, so</li>
            <li>/&gt;2nd time using it - The first time it didn&#x27;t get the stubborn hairs, but my hairs were real long...</li>
            <li>I waited a few years to purchase this item because the original model was not recommended for use on the face and that is what I wanted it for.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nothing more than a piece of wire slightly raised above the skin with electrical current passing through it.</li>
            <li>The hair grows back exactly the same as it was.  </li>
            <li>The speed has to remain steady and there simply isn&#x27;t enough surface on the face to accomplish that.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and dark thick hair and the</li>
            <li>did not use the creams due to parabens, they went right in the trash.</li>
            <li>I would set it on low for my face, and it immediately sets resets to high.</li>
            <li>AT FIRST I THOUGHT I WAS MISTAKEN, SO I called them and asked about the results thinking i must be doing something wrong, BECAUSE IT&#x27;S WAY TOO DIFFERENT FROM THE ADVERTISEMENT, but they said it was normal and try IT for 6 weeks, AND I WILL SEE BETTER RESULTS.</li>
            <li>and at first it will take you a couple of tries to get used to it, which for me it did.</li>
            <li>As I read on and realized the trouble it took to get the refund, I went right to the Better Business Bearau website(bbb.org)and filed a complaint.</li>
            <li>The regular pro works great for me, but for my friend has thick dark coarse hair on her legs, almost like a mans beard on her legs</li>
            <li>I called customer service and they are sending me a new one and starting my 60 days over again.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida where shorts and bathing suits are our basic clothing.  </li>
            <li>The representative suggested to her to get the black no-no (no-no for men) as those rarely got returned.</li>
            <li>Nothing major.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try this because usually I am hesitant to try anything that is from an infomercial.  </li>
            <li>If you have thick hair I&#x27;d suggest the pro 5 series the hair is good for thinner and less coarse hair.</li>
            <li>At $270 it isn&#x27;t worth the money for what little hair it removes.    </li>
            <li>so I have literally been able to count and notice the hairs in a patch getting less and less.</li>
            <li>and just generally stunk up the room, eliciting complaints from my spouse and</li>
            <li>and I am also going to complain to my attorney general.</li>
            <li>The unit left far too much stubble even when I was still shaving my legs on a regular basis, took forever, kept deciding my legs only needed the low temperature setting (</li>
            <li>I can barely see them.</li>
            <li>I use it nearly every 3rd day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a definite NO NO if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It was far too time consuming, taking upwards of an hour per leg since I have coarse, hairy legs like a guy (TMI!)</li>
            <li>Paid extra to have it delivered early but still took four days.  </li>
            <li>BUT I BARELY HAVE TO REMOVE HAIR</li>
            <li>I know it works, but it is slow and does not work like the infomercial where the hairy chested man gets smooth results.</li>
            <li>You have to take it slow and smooth.  </li>
            <li>But with time it gets to the slow and smooth which is the correct way and how the instructions say must be used to work.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Overall, I would try it for a few months before I made any judgements, and I would not pay full price on it just in</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure many people are skeptical about the no-no due to the large number of negative reviews, including this one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another useless, because it&#x27;s only good for flat surfaces!</li>
            <li>After posting my last review, I read the other reviews and learned that I never should have ordered the NONO in the first place.</li>
            <li>I suggest if you have fine hair try their buffers to see how well they work for you if you have thick or coarse hair</li>
            <li>I suggest if you have fine hair try their buffers to see how well they work for you if you have thick or coarse hair</li>
            <li>I imagine it is a much slower process due to me not using the growth inhibiting lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>then go.&lt;br /&gt;It does take longer than shaving with a razor but it lasts longer than a razor and your legs feel smoother and not only does it grow slower the more you use it, as long as you use the lotion with capi slow, your hair gets softer as it goes.</li>
            <li>As far as their claims about less hair coming back and eventually stopping, they are absolutely untrue.</li>
            <li>The small tip makes using this on my bikini area sooooooo much easier!!</li>
            <li>The first 5 months I used it as directed and saw little difference.  </li>
            <li>Why is this company still being allowed to fleece the general public with no repercussions?</li>
            <li>The replacement unit is far worse than the original.  </li>
            <li>Thanks but no thanks to the NONO!!</li>
            <li>The product is also poorly made and can easily cause burns.</li>
            <li>The only thing it is good for is the very very very thin hairs on my face!</li>
            <li>The heads wear out so quickly and my hair isn&#x27;t even that corse or thick.</li>
            <li>Some of the hair on my upper lip and chin is still dark and thick, but most of it is lighter and finer than before.  </li>
            <li>I have very fair skin and thick thick dark hair under my arms, under my chin and various other areas.  </li>
            <li>It works on fine facial hair, but if you want to use it on thicker hair, it will take you forever to remove any hair, and is leaves a lot of hair behind.  </li>
            <li>to use the buffer properly press lightly and go small circular motions in a straight line up and down for like legs or side to side for like the jaw line on your face, then go back in the opposite direction rotating in the opposite direction as well so if you were going clockwise down your leg from the knee to the ankle you would go counter clockwise up your leg from the ankle to the knee.</li>
            <li>Also, how is this particular one different from the other no!no!</li>
            <li>Sunday night, decided I was excited, used it for a half an hour and the tip was dead.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> /&gt;I have been impressed that it doesn&#x27;t bother my skin (I have to use it on the highest setting too, though I did work up to it).</li>
            <li> I am intrigued by all three, but want to get the best treatment for the money I spend.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t shave often because its winter, so its a perfect time to nono.</li>
            <li> and I know that nothing is 100% perfect.</li>
            <li> The nono works best on my face and it has been a bit of miracle worker for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I am very happy with this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 100% happy with the Tria 4x!</li>
            <li> awesome right).&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also in all honesty their buffers are not the greatest they are done after 1 or 2</li>
            <li> and it is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> I love my no no!!!</li>
            <li> The seller,  however, was very nice when she sold it to me!</li>
            <li> Have a good one!</li>
            <li> Good luck!</li>
            <li> bought a Tria 4x and have had stunningly good results in just two days!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because they salesman said that my fair skin and hair made me the perfect person to use this product.</li>
            <li> bought one for a friend (I do like the results on my legs) who has curly hair, and it works great for her.</li>
            <li> and I have to say that I am happy with my results.</li>
            <li> I am happy to answer any questions.</li>
            <li> I am still using my nono and remain happy with my results.</li>
            <li> lol.</li>
            <li> lol.</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t happy with the results within 60 days you can return it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m happy my smoke alarm didn&#x27;t go off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought the nono about three months ago, and it&#x27;s working great.</li>
            <li> and it sounded great.  </li>
            <li> It worked great on my face.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced any burns or anything.</li>
            <li> It works great.</li>
            <li> bottom line have patience and follow their directions and you will get a great product.</li>
            <li> This seemed like a great solution.</li>
            <li> Customer service wasn&#x27;t that great either.</li>
            <li> the people were very nice</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I originally loved this product and had great hopes.  </li>
            <li> This is a good thing and indicates the system is working to remove the hair.</li>
            <li> I have fair, olive-toned skin</li>
            <li> Unlike a lot of the reviewers, my unit is still working after 6 months of continous use, surprisingly.</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned, I read the reviews on the products website before purchasing and thought this was a good product...</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t forget to use the nono correctly for good results.</li>
            <li> However, I got great results with my legs though :)&lt;</li>
            <li> So, the more you use the No!No!</li>
            <li> well some of you may be more successful...</li>
            <li> This product is great for virgin and fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have course hair there, and it took care of it nicely.</li>
            <li> This kind of screws up my 6 week review for you</li>
            <li> But lets be honest that is not how the hair grows.</li>
            <li> Also, is there some kind of guarantee or warranty on the product in case it is defective or stops working after some time.</li>
            <li> I also use it effectively on my face and arms.</li>
            <li> claims it is effective on all hair types.</li>
            <li> So, taking matters into my own hand, I called their 888 customer service number.</li>
            <li> Representatives will not divulge that kind of information.</li>
            <li> and it is still good for a lot more uses.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the honest reviews.  </li>
            <li> Your skin looks so nice.</li>
            <li> Nice, I like the Nono</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t imagine how nice it is to not have to worry about shaving all the time.  </li>
            <li> Series Deluxe Hair Removal Kit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> am happy to report that my new nono has been working great.</li>
            <li> The product works wonderful brand spanking new</li>
            <li> I am fair skin, and have light hair...but lets face it ladies, unwanted hair is unwanted hair.   </li>
            <li> I am balder in areas that are easy to reach!</li>
            <li> is very fine.  </li>
            <li> Great product,,  I got results after the first use.</li>
            <li> I notice very smooth and even baby like skin.</li>
            <li> I had very light paech fuzz hair</li>
            <li> aw maybe we&#x27;ve got ourself a cure :)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it once or twice a week since I got it, but do use it on the hair at the appropriate length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love my NONO.  </li>
            <li> The hair on my legs (in addition to lighter and thinner) seems to be beginning to become a bit more sporadic.</li>
            <li> will update when he has more results.</li>
            <li> OK so my NONO is not working correctly.</li>
            <li> It will be interesting to see if the time lapse will effect the hair growth.</li>
            <li> think it will take more than 6 weeks to get the desired results I am looking for.</li>
            <li> I hope my review helps. :)&lt;</li>
            <li> Actually better than I imagined.</li>
            <li> Do not tip the nono forward, more than a 90 degree angle, this always burned me in the beginning.</li>
            <li> The NONO works best on short stubble.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of letting my hair grow out before getting the NONO (used to having to do so for waxing) and it took me longer to use it and more passes to burn the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried it for 3 weeks more often.</li>
            <li> I also researched in the Internet and there are many risk with it.</li>
            <li> Bikini needs many more treatments.</li>
            <li> it was way more painful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are more cons than pros to using this system.</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I took the time to really research this product before buying it.</li>
            <li> I have more hair now that I had before on my face.</li>
            <li> maybe it&#x27;ll be better as I continue to use it....</li>
            <li> It is so safe I&#x27;d let a teenager or students between ages 13 and up use it.</li>
            <li> It is safe on darker skin.</li>
            <li> like many have said, maybe it is the shape of my face?</li>
            <li> but I am sure glad I did.</li>
            <li> I am just a hairy Armenian girl looking for some relief : )</li>
            <li> are more details of the conversation between me and the customer service rep.  </li>
            <li> So, do some models break more than others?</li>
            <li> Sure.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sure, given time and patience, no-no will do what is promised in their advertisement.</li>
            <li> How many replacements will you put up with before calling it quits?</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Then you need to buy more..</li>
            <li> an she couldn&#x27;t be happier :-)</li>
            <li> We had to turn them into the Better Business Bureau after months of being ignored.  </li>
            <li> They do say in the instruction manual that you have to make sure you hold it correctly for it to work</li>
            <li> and they could do better on the instructional DVD.</li>
            <li> ok it works</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> My Mom owns the no no hair series and it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> and it gets it better then</li>
            <li> and she says that it works better than razors for her</li>
            <li> and this works much better and lasts a lot longer.</li>
            <li> and I urge others to not waste time or money on no!no!...!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried many methods for hair removal and the No</li>
            <li> I had lost most of my hair using IPL machine (VISS)</li>
            <li> and since I stopped using that device to give No NO a try, I noticed getting more hair.</li>
            <li> so I am totally okay with that.</li>
            <li> I love nono.  </li>
            <li> I have gotten so many compliments on my face.</li>
            <li> are Argan oil which is a wonderful product I plan on buying in the future.</li>
            <li> Which is probably like most of us</li>
            <li> Razors do better work than this thing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it wasn&#x27;t lie</li>
            <li> My daughter and I were very excited to get this.</li>
            <li> Worked great on my face (hair came off fine), but when I tried it under my arms, the hair is much thicker.</li>
            <li> was a new tip and the rep I got was great, helpful, knew what they were talking about and no problems.</li>
            <li> was a new tip and the rep I got was great, helpful, knew what they were talking about and no problems.</li>
            <li> It is important I always look my best because my job requires a lot of public speaking.</li>
            <li> Any vellus hair I had is gone and the hair that was course is becoming vellus.</li>
            <li> I bought this 2 years ago and really gave it a good college try.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work right at all and costs a lot of money to just lie around in a drawer!!</li>
            <li> Getting just 6 full leg treatments can cost up to $2000!</li>
            <li> If you are still full on hair it is going to be a battle, but it will work!</li>
            <li> The no no is easy to use</li>
            <li> I will not attempt my chin or face since I scar easy.</li>
            <li> I found it fairly easy to use</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easy to care for and stores or travels well.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t easy to return but they eventually repaid me.</li>
            <li> The smell of burning hair is strong.  </li>
            <li> The only good reviews are probably from within their own company using made up names.</li>
            <li> The internet and Amazon are amazing, thanks!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s kind of like when you first learned to shave your legs with a razor.&lt;br /&gt;Tip</li>
            <li> Also getting your own wax warmer and supplies for in home use is much cheaper than this product!</li>
            <li> If I look closely I can see baby fine hairs.</li>
            <li> This one has been working fine with no problems.</li>
            <li> If you just want to use it to remove fine hair from your face, legs, arms, etc.</li>
            <li> you use it one because your hair is less and thinner and two because you&#x27;ve learned the perfect speed</li>
            <li> It says in fine print that it may take up to six months for results, well I&#x27;m here to tell you that there is no difference.  </li>
            <li> The old saying &amp;#34; if it sounds to good to be true, it probably is&amp;#34; seems appropriate here.  </li>
            <li> My under arms are fine, not hair free but almost.</li>
            <li> I cannot afford itand although $250 is steep, it is still a huge savings.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m all for free enterprise</li>
            <li> My legs are hair free</li>
            <li> Also feel free to ask questions if I have not covered something you would like to know:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I feel it is more powerful.</li>
            <li> It does not leave me smooth and the buffers are a joke.</li>
            <li> I used to feel prickly after shaving no matter what, but now I get those ultra smooth legs like you get with nair.</li>
            <li> No biggie, light a candle.</li>
            <li> I notice the result is like a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> and I have not had a lot of problems burns or with the light turning off while in use</li>
            <li> yes, but I light a candle or my Lampberger and go on with my life.</li>
            <li> I shave two to three times a day to keep my face and neck smooth.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s important for me to be as smooth as possible.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hope this review can help shed some light for those who are considering in purchasing a no-no.</li>
            <li> I visited their website and filled out the contact form with a barrage of questions...</li>
            <li> As for the burnt hair smell they tell you to light a candle.</li>
            <li> I used to use smooth away all the time instead of a razor before they stopped selling them in stores in my area.</li>
            <li> the tip was defective when I put it in the tip light was 1 bar then</li>
            <li> the tip was defective when I put it in the tip light was 1 bar then</li>
            <li> WHEN THE RESULTS, OR NO RESULTS SHOULD I SAY WAS CONFIRMED</li>
            <li> The smell of burnt hair is tolerable, and if people don&#x27;t like it, light a candle.  </li>
            <li> received my Nono and thought the clicking sound meant it was working.  </li>
            <li> So far so good</li>
            <li> The No!No! was very effective to remove hair from my upper lip and chin.</li>
            <li> It works very nicely and I look forward to seeing how it continues to work in the future.</li>
            <li> The fine hair is the first to notice and the thicker more stubborn hair I am still working on</li>
            <li> I am getting excited to see what happens in another month.</li>
            <li> Like everyone else, I was excited to try this.  </li>
            <li> BUT IT IS SOOOOOO WORTH IT IN THE END!</li>
            <li> It takes longer when you are first learning to use and it gets quicker the more</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own will not slow your hair growth.</li>
            <li> The one I received in return was refurbished and they said that the warranty would not be extended to year from the replacement date and the original date of purchase still determined to end of the one year warranty.</li>
            <li> , ONCE I GOT IT, I WAS SO EXCITED AND USED IT AS SOON AS IT WAS DONE</li>
            <li> I paid almost the original price because they sent it to collection agency</li>
            <li> First day of use and it was okay.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to try my</li>
            <li> The hair on my legs is very light and soft, I feel more skin than hair if I run my hand against the growth.</li>
            <li> The results were adequate on lightly haired places.  </li>
            <li> My arms stay clean for a month.</li>
            <li> He started reading a script and tried to get me to jump aboard and take advantage of their special promotion...</li>
            <li> yeah, right!)</li>
            <li> If it has been a successful seller, it is because it is sold late at night on tv when people are apt to purchase anything.</li>
            <li> He has not had a full week yet, I will update when he does.</li>
            <li> I must say it was not painful in any way, nor did I burn myself, as I used one of the lower settings.  </li>
            <li> I had about 8 on my leg and unders arms and maybe 3-4 on my full bikini area.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I am done with fuzz on my cheeks and sideburns and my makeup goes on so much nicer now.</li>
            <li> is so much faster and so much better.</li>
            <li> Their buffer was only good for one use on my legs, face, underarms and it already wasn&#x27;t working as well after doing my legs before I even did anything else.</li>
            <li> and she is already saying good things in the last 2 1/2</li>
            <li> Both the hair and pro series use the same tips so if you own this one and want to upgrade to the pro you don&#x27;t have to buy more tips right away.</li>
            <li> husband is not using it on a regular basis, so I apoligize for not being able to give more information on his use of the nono.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I am lucky because I have a head start with the lasers.</li>
            <li> Never stop on the skin or you may get a mild burn.</li>
            <li> i was so excited WHEN I SAW THIS AND ORDERED IT RIGHT AWAY</li>
            <li> Everyone is right, it&#x27;s the smell of burning hair, which essentially is all it&#x27;s good for.  </li>
            <li> First of all, it is finicky to use and often did nothing (you can tell because the light was not flashing).</li>
            <li> and when I did it was just so smooth and so fast!</li>
            <li> just finished my 4th week and the hair seems to be getting very fine and soft.</li>
            <li> My suggestion for anyone interested in purchasing this product is to determine the type of hair you have and how you want to use the No!No!</li>
            <li> this product is an absolute No No!!</li>
            <li> If she wants to use it fine, if not, I will donate it.</li>
            <li> hair removal systems-less painful, more effective, effective more quickly, etc?</li>
            <li> He is a body builder and wants a smooth chest.</li>
            <li> so I got the smooth away kit from amazon (actually when you get it it is called silky smooth but is listed as smooth away)</li>
            <li> I noticed more of a difference in the hair on my arms than legs so far.</li>
            <li> But I think it will be worth it.</li>
            <li> So If I have a the patience to see results, it is worth a try.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t feel it was worth the time or money.</li>
            <li> IT IS WELL WORTH</li>
            <li> For what this product does it isn&#x27;t worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I have spent thousands of dollars on laser removal in a Drs office and I loved it.  </li>
            <li> it after several swipes will kind of take off some of the softer hairs...</li>
            <li> (this keeps the hair the right length to use the No-No and takes care of strays), but that&#x27;s huge compared to the fast growing, once a day of before.</li>
            <li> And the fine print on the No-No website says you have to order it directly from them under special conditions to get a refund.</li>
            <li> My face has a range of black \\&quot;stumps\\&quot; from years of plucking my chin to more fine and lightly colored fuzz on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> You have to get the timing just right.</li>
            <li> It takes about 1 hour - 3x a week right now.</li>
            <li> (Surprise surprise, right?)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: This doesn&#x27;t feel right at all to me.</li>
            <li> I received it, charged and used it right away.  </li>
            <li> They tried and tried to convince me to keep it, telling me maybe I hadn&#x27;t used it right???  </li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t burn it right away.</li>
            <li> (but that means it is being done right).</li>
            <li> They got right on it and contacted the company.</li>
            <li> the No!No! I have given up trying to use it under my arms or legs because it took too long and the result wasn&#x27;t as effective as shaving.    </li>
            <li> It can manage only light and fine hair that almost invisible anyway.</li>
            <li> Is it true that certain models have a higher rate of failure?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and you won&#x27;t burn out your tip as quickly by having to use it so much just to do it.</li>
            <li> Show the wrong way to use it and the right way to use it instead of having a model on the DVD looking perfect.  </li>
            <li> He abruptly cut me off and said, \\&quot;thanks for calling, have a good day,\\&quot; and hung up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very fortunate about a year and a half ago to have a friend that managed a medi-spa and gave me free laser treatments.</li>
            <li> i better get my money back asap!!  </li>
            <li> I am pleased with it, but I was not expecting miracles, just the same results I got from epilating.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very sneaky amazon!</li>
            <li> just finished my first week of the nono.</li>
            <li> (as they keep starting over my 60 days) or just get my money back and search out the next best way for hair removal.</li>
            <li> (she knew I want to try it first without paying).</li>
            <li> It is too hot even on its lightest setting for my scar on my face.</li>
            <li> First, there is a burning hair smell.</li>
            <li> They are shills written by people paid by the company to promote their product to unwitting people who don&#x27;t look deeper than the first things they see.</li>
            <li> it does work, but this is my first time using it...</li>
            <li> First of all I want to say I am a guy.  </li>
            <li> that I wanted answers to first before dropping $270.00.</li>
            <li> (Although, I&#x27;ve seen a couple of reviews where they&#x27;ve been able to get their warranty got extended because of multiple defective devices and replacements.)</li>
            <li> so just be aware...</li>
            <li> Something else to be aware of.  </li>
            <li> I bought my NoNo a year ago (should have returned it before after the first 3 uses) and it&#x27;s all talk and no results.  </li>
            <li> The only place I found any meaningful reviews is on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> It does not remove most of the hair and I have used it religiously for 4 months now.</li>
            <li> However, on the more coarse hair on the legs it did not work at all.</li>
            <li> Now I use the pro series and I have to say I like it better than the hair series because I have some coarse hair on my chin</li>
            <li> The pro series has two tips the one like the hair only it has better control</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I read the reviews prior to purchasing.  </li>
            <li> This product seems like this is more of the same.  </li>
            <li> , IT&#x27;S HOT AND MAKES MY SKIN</li>
            <li> I would much rather stick with a razor!</li>
            <li> I have had the No No for 1 year and although it took some getting use to it and really following directions, I love it.  </li>
            <li> At first I tried to use like a shaver - it isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> $270.00 is too much to spend on a device that might work, don&#x27;t risk it!</li>
            <li> it made more hair grow back</li>
            <li> that was darker and more coarse</li>
            <li> I should have read the reviews on Amazon first.  </li>
            <li> I first thought she wasn’t using it correctly, so I read all the instructions and tried it myself</li>
            <li> All it does is make a funny burning smell.</li>
            <li> When I first tried the NoNo, I had to get the hang of</li>
            <li> I went over the same areas 3 to 4 times to make sure I got as many hairs as possible.  </li>
            <li> Once I got that down to where it rolls smoothly, I had to go over and over one area many times.</li>
            <li> With the black nono 1 pass and the hair burns off.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with my results after 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend was super excited to try this though I had read mixed reviews.  </li>
            <li> I had hoped to do this all winter, and start the summer with smooth skin, but it was far too much work.</li>
            <li> Do this until it is smooth, you may need to wipe away the dried skin and hair off the buffer and where you are doing so that it works better and faster.</li>
            <li> No because her No No Hair was having issues with it clicking, a red light was coming on and it just was not working right.</li>
            <li> I am positive they were not there when this process began.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is quite pricey, so I am sure that even with a significant number of returns, they still profit heavily from those who never get around to mailing it</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for any help you can give me!</li>
            <li> Not true about the risk free!!</li>
            <li> Well, I kept up at it, about 5 times a week, and the hair on my arms is pretty much gone.</li>
            <li> It looked so simple, easy and convincing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and since I have had the lasers before I know that a certain patch may have 10 hairs and another 8 hairs</li>
            <li> My concern is the large number of defective no-no&#x27;s being returned or replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even the fine hair removal left stubble.</li>
            <li> My fine peach fuzz is now a blonde stubble.  </li>
            <li> The buffer is like an extra fine sandpaper and it doesn&#x27;t hurt If you have ever used a buffer instead of a razor</li>
            <li> It works VERY well on fine facial peach fuzz.  </li>
            <li> Armed with this information, I was sure I had nothing to loose but hair!</li>
            <li> Companies like these have a huge budget to pay \\&quot;independent\\&quot; people to write reviews in several forums -- even here in Amazon!</li>
            <li> although it did not seem to remove much hair..  </li>
            <li> have not had much luck with it on my bikini area or under arms.</li>
            <li> He does not have a very hairy chest to begin with but has noticed a slower growth and a thinning in the hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really hope this one is not defective.</li>
            <li> I pull my lips in (as if evening out lipstick) and I stick my toung under my upper lip (depending on the area I am trying to reach) to make a smooth even surface for gliding the nono and not to get burned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now I can go 3 days before I have that much growth.</li>
            <li> I do have to shave, but I&#x27;ve never had such smooth results after shaving.</li>
            <li> have used it sporadically on my bikini and underarms but have really just been focusing on my legs.</li>
            <li> It all grows just as fast as it did before I used</li>
            <li> I ordered the listed No No and didn&#x27;t know much about them except that my wife wanted one.  </li>
            <li> Move it too fast and it&#x27;s useless!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have to say that I am very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are like me just knowing that there is something to help this much is comforting.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes, there is a 60-days guarantee where you can try no-no for free, and if you don&#x27;t like it, you can send it back, no questions asked.</li>
            <li> (let&#x27;s say 5...and that&#x27;s being generous), you would really offer no assistance to the customer once their 2-year warranty expires?\\</li>
            <li> thanks Amazon customers.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work.</li>
            <li> It self-adjusts to the temperature it wants to be.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t mind the buffers, but don&#x27;t think they did all that much.</li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing for</li>
            <li> It is really painless</li>
            <li> Very time consuming , not like  shaving or waxing.</li>
            <li> My mom after trying out my pro with her tips wants to upgrade to the pro.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll know what you are doing, if you haven&#x27;t the videos don&#x27;t really explain it too well</li>
            <li> and it will go so much faster</li>
            <li> and my hair is already softer and not growing in as fast as when I was using tweezers and</li>
            <li> VERY time consuming but</li>
            <li> I can&#x60;t imagine how much money was paid to all the models and magazines for the \\&quot;rave reviews\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> and then I don&#x27;t think you could remove the much hair.</li>
            <li> it wasnot very noticable</li>
            <li> time I will go straight to the vendor to purchase.</li>
            <li> It works much like an iron or heating coil from a toaster.</li>
            <li> So much money for an inferior product.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll have to return it &amp; make sure we order the complete set next time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works best on thin hair areas like arms and facial hair.  </li>
            <li> No Hair removal was the least useful and effective method.</li>
            <li> I am good at following skin care and other beauty regimens</li>
            <li> Better than every other day.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions perfectly (which was tedious) and it didn&#x27;t help at all!</li>
            <li> , as long as you have the patience and dedication to actually let this thing work, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any over buffing redness, I only had to go over it a couple times with the silky smooth instead of the normal 15 times when I don&#x27;t use the no</li>
            <li> looks like it&#x27;s breaking down fast though, relies on a Li battery, and need to replace glow wires about as many times as you do with razor</li>
            <li> in the long run its definitely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t leave you all hairless and smooth like how they show in the video, definitely need to use something else along with it at first like an epilator or an electric shaver</li>
            <li> bought the product on a special discount using the promo on the TV commercial.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it for almost the full trial time and then called to send it back.  </li>
            <li> I did start to notice a slight thinning of the hair after 2 weeks but wasn&#x27;t sure if it was my imagination or not.</li>
            <li> this device trully worked I&#x27;d surely see less hair on my face and neck by now.  </li>
            <li> The only issue I&#x27;ve had is if I go over a spot one to many times, it gets red (like razor burn), but I&#x27;ve used it over eczema without increased irritation.</li>
            <li> and there that have nothing, mainly in the underarm</li>
            <li> To fast and the system isn&#x27;t effective, too slow and it won&#x27;t turn on.</li>
            <li> I have been using no no for more than 5 months and only for my facial hair...  </li>
            <li> I spend a moderate amount of money on my physical appearance but nothing over the top...</li>
            <li> I was left with charred, much more obvious, burnt smelling hair on my face which I than had to use a cream hair remover on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> ALSO HAVE MANY DIFFERENT ADS SELLING THIS SAME PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I have been getting laser hair removal done professionally for some time, but I am interested in beginning new areas at home.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ll leave you high and dry...with a $270.00 paperweight...</li>
            <li> Because they had the setting too high.</li>
            <li> AND I DO NOT HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and everything I expected!</li>
            <li> I stopped using my NO NO and went back to my VISS which gives great results but is more painful and time consuming to use.</li>
            <li> and it does not slow or remove permenantly.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t use the lotion included with the kit, but I washed my face with Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s Deep Cleansing face wash and the chamomile, helped to calm my skin (I use it after I wax my eyebrows, and the redness is gone immediately).  </li>
            <li> hairless\\&quot; in my opinion, but the difference is enough for me to find it worth</li>
            <li> The hair is pretty much everywhere, including my female sideburns.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of a duh</li>
            <li> It is common for me to have three hairs growing at once out of one follicle, so I was thrilled when my underarms became almost hairless before I had to quit going to the office for treatments.  </li>
            <li> I am def encouraged to continue using it every 2 days for more firm results.</li>
            <li> Is this really worth $300 when it only does 1/5 of the work it promised to do?</li>
            <li> However, it is only fair to let any other consumer make the choice to purchase one for themselves by me simply sharing my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Melin</li>
            <li> This is going right back to sender!!  </li>
            <li> Waiting to see if it grows right back</li>
            <li> well after several calls as to perhaps I was not using it right</li>
            <li> On the commercial it shows it being used on a man&#x27;s chest hair and it came right off.</li>
            <li> you are looking for something as quick as shaving, painless, doesn&#x27;t smell, you can do at home and gives long lasing results, slows hair growth and thins it</li>
            <li> you are looking for something as quick as shaving, painless, doesn&#x27;t smell, you can do at home and gives long lasing results, slows hair growth and thins it</li>
            <li> like I did and use their buffers to polish up after you finish buffing with the other one.having issues with it clicking, a red light was coming on and it just was not working right.</li>
            <li> It worked on fine hair if she went over the same area several times.</li>
            <li> When I got the light flashing it was extremely time consuming.</li>
            <li> I used the No No as directed (moving the No No slowly over my leg, with the blue light lit, multiple times per session, 3 times a week for 3 months) and did not see a decrease in my hair growth.  </li>
            <li> It will not take care of dark thick hairs no matter how many times i go over it or how many times i use it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> They said perhaps mine was defective, and offered me a new one.  </li>
            <li> so I will continue to review after I recieve my new nono.</li>
            <li> I just receivedmy new NONO 12-3.</li>
            <li> I was without my NONO for 5 days and did not notice new hair growth or anything to make me think I was set back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Customer service sent me a new NONO and new attachments and started my 60 day trial over.</li>
            <li> So I have a choice to make... get a new nono every 50 days or so</li>
            <li> it was still new on the market</li>
            <li> I now have a new one of each size tip being sent out to me.</li>
            <li> it was still new on the market</li>
            <li> I now have a new one of each size tip being sent out to me.</li>
            <li> All they did was offer to exchange it for a new one.</li>
            <li> I used it over and over, bought new cartridges, etc</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and there is less hair after each use.  </li>
            <li> Again, i have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This is the first time I bought something because of a TV commercial.</li>
            <li> I am not sure that this explanation is actually plausible (which is why I tried</li>
            <li> Consistent usage is key!    </li>
            <li> There is a 60 day money back \\&quot;guarantee\\&quot;, so here is my first week...</li>
            <li> I have dark hair and light skin.</li>
            <li> and I could see the dark hair under my skin so it would look like stubble even if it was smooth.</li>
            <li> that means my hair grows back fast!</li>
            <li> I used it the first time it did make me jump because on the video the lady does it with such ease.</li>
            <li> There is no such thing on the market at this time, but if you are willing to spend the time to use it correctly and buff while say watching TV on the couch before bed</li>
            <li> There is no such thing on the market at this time, but if you are willing to spend the time to use it correctly and buff while say watching TV on the couch before bed</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> junk do not waste you money, spend a few more dollars and get at least a 20x hair or more removal system.</li>
            <li> Today I found out that they pay for shipping costs only if I would have payed the full price and only if you try it for exacly 60 days!</li>
            <li> When google searching for \\&quot;NoNo Product Reviews\\&quot;, you are barraged by a ton of personal blogs and positive customer testimonials...</li>
            <li> 2 - 5 - arms are still smooth and there is less hair to clear.</li>
            <li> The case is small enough to fit in your purse but there is no room for the charger nor is there a compartment in which to secure the extra head, that being whichever one that&#x27;s not in use.</li>
            <li> I have used the same large thermicon since the beginning and the indicator shows it to still have 3 bars (measuring 3-0).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but they wouldn&#x27;t refund the shipping until after a certain number of days in which I had to call back.</li>
            <li> I asked for the Black nono this time after the representive made me aware that it is the latest to be released and they have not had the black nonos returned.</li>
            <li> It is ok to tip it back toward the roller a little.</li>
            <li> Huge waste of money</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would also like to clear up some confusion, I have been questioned about my four star rating then</li>
            <li> I suspect one of the reasons results differ so wildly is because of how the hair lies.</li>
            <li> use a loofah while showering to exfoliate the burned hair and then apply a natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li> but I will still post my 6th week to complete my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is not a device that will make you \\&quot;completely</li>
            <li> However, my family can&#x27;t stand the smell and complain frequently about it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the glow wire burns the skin, if you don&#x27;t move it fast enough.</li>
            <li> He didn&#x27;t have clear or concise answers for any of my questions.  </li>
            <li> What does come back is much thinner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s taking much longer for the results to be seen on my legs, but it&#x27;s definitely working on the bikini line.</li>
            <li> Please do NOT waste your money on this piece of junk.  </li>
            <li> but it is not growing back as fast</li>
            <li> Go over it a few times and your legs will be smooth.</li>
            <li> and if you do it too much your skin will be red</li>
            <li> and she couldn&#x27;t get it fixed or exchange it</li>
            <li> and she couldn&#x27;t get it fixed or exchange it</li>
            <li> The device stopped working completely in about 8 weeks</li>
            <li> As far as it removing the hair permanently perhaps if you are burned and scared no hair is going to grow there.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
            <li> I was highly surprised to receive it before the date of arrival.</li>
            <li> It might \\&quot;look like\\&quot; your legs are touchably soft, but when you touch them they are still prickly.  </li>
            <li> I was completely dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> If there isn&#x27;t a reduction in the amount of hair on my legs and I am going to have to shave too, I&#x27;ll just shave and not waste my time with the No No.  </li>
            <li> this product was a complete dissapointment</li>
            <li> It just burns the hair at the skin level and grows back, just as fast as it did.</li>
            <li> and I will say, it is too early to say &amp;#34;excellent&amp;#34;,</li>
            <li> and I was surprised to receive it.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called Nono direct and sadi there should be a humming noise.  </li>
            <li> A class action law suit is what you all need.</li>
            <li> I got it because i have really sensitive skin on my legs and wanted something besides shaving.</li>
            <li> I have never broken out on my neck before using this product and I&#x27;m only breaking out in the area</li>
            <li> It is nice on my thin face hair</li>
            <li> Now at 3 weeks I am getting a little excited about my results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was a little hard to use at first, but I know after a while I was kind of getting the hang of it.  </li>
            <li> First, I wash my arms and legs with soap and water and dry.</li>
            <li> Not sure about this it didn&#x27;t take the hair off easy and</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not pick up every single hair, but it was my first time using it, so</li>
            <li> /&gt;2nd time using it - The first time it didn&#x27;t get the stubborn hairs, but my hairs were real long...</li>
            <li> I waited a few years to purchase this item because the original model was not recommended for use on the face and that is what I wanted it for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing more than a piece of wire slightly raised above the skin with electrical current passing through it.</li>
            <li> The hair grows back exactly the same as it was.  </li>
            <li> The speed has to remain steady and there simply isn&#x27;t enough surface on the face to accomplish that.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and dark thick hair and the</li>
            <li> did not use the creams due to parabens, they went right in the trash.</li>
            <li> I would set it on low for my face, and it immediately sets resets to high.</li>
            <li> AT FIRST I THOUGHT I WAS MISTAKEN, SO I called them and asked about the results thinking i must be doing something wrong, BECAUSE IT&#x27;S WAY TOO DIFFERENT FROM THE ADVERTISEMENT, but they said it was normal and try IT for 6 weeks, AND I WILL SEE BETTER RESULTS.</li>
            <li> and at first it will take you a couple of tries to get used to it, which for me it did.</li>
            <li> As I read on and realized the trouble it took to get the refund, I went right to the Better Business Bearau website(bbb.org)and filed a complaint.</li>
            <li> The regular pro works great for me, but for my friend has thick dark coarse hair on her legs, almost like a mans beard on her legs</li>
            <li> I called customer service and they are sending me a new one and starting my 60 days over again.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida where shorts and bathing suits are our basic clothing.  </li>
            <li> The representative suggested to her to get the black no-no (no-no for men) as those rarely got returned.</li>
            <li> Nothing major.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this because usually I am hesitant to try anything that is from an infomercial.  </li>
            <li> If you have thick hair I&#x27;d suggest the pro 5 series the hair is good for thinner and less coarse hair.</li>
            <li> At $270 it isn&#x27;t worth the money for what little hair it removes.    </li>
            <li> so I have literally been able to count and notice the hairs in a patch getting less and less.</li>
            <li> and just generally stunk up the room, eliciting complaints from my spouse and</li>
            <li> and I am also going to complain to my attorney general.</li>
            <li> The unit left far too much stubble even when I was still shaving my legs on a regular basis, took forever, kept deciding my legs only needed the low temperature setting (</li>
            <li> I can barely see them.</li>
            <li> I use it nearly every 3rd day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a definite NO NO if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It was far too time consuming, taking upwards of an hour per leg since I have coarse, hairy legs like a guy (TMI!)</li>
            <li> Paid extra to have it delivered early but still took four days.  </li>
            <li> BUT I BARELY HAVE TO REMOVE HAIR</li>
            <li> I know it works, but it is slow and does not work like the infomercial where the hairy chested man gets smooth results.</li>
            <li> You have to take it slow and smooth.  </li>
            <li> But with time it gets to the slow and smooth which is the correct way and how the instructions say must be used to work.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Overall, I would try it for a few months before I made any judgements, and I would not pay full price on it just in</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure many people are skeptical about the no-no due to the large number of negative reviews, including this one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another useless, because it&#x27;s only good for flat surfaces!</li>
            <li> After posting my last review, I read the other reviews and learned that I never should have ordered the NONO in the first place.</li>
            <li> I suggest if you have fine hair try their buffers to see how well they work for you if you have thick or coarse hair</li>
            <li> I suggest if you have fine hair try their buffers to see how well they work for you if you have thick or coarse hair</li>
            <li> I imagine it is a much slower process due to me not using the growth inhibiting lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> then go.&lt;br /&gt;It does take longer than shaving with a razor but it lasts longer than a razor and your legs feel smoother and not only does it grow slower the more you use it, as long as you use the lotion with capi slow, your hair gets softer as it goes.</li>
            <li> As far as their claims about less hair coming back and eventually stopping, they are absolutely untrue.</li>
            <li> The small tip makes using this on my bikini area sooooooo much easier!!</li>
            <li> The first 5 months I used it as directed and saw little difference.  </li>
            <li> Why is this company still being allowed to fleece the general public with no repercussions?</li>
            <li> The replacement unit is far worse than the original.  </li>
            <li> Thanks but no thanks to the NONO!!</li>
            <li> The product is also poorly made and can easily cause burns.</li>
            <li> The only thing it is good for is the very very very thin hairs on my face!</li>
            <li> The heads wear out so quickly and my hair isn&#x27;t even that corse or thick.</li>
            <li> Some of the hair on my upper lip and chin is still dark and thick, but most of it is lighter and finer than before.  </li>
            <li> I have very fair skin and thick thick dark hair under my arms, under my chin and various other areas.  </li>
            <li> It works on fine facial hair, but if you want to use it on thicker hair, it will take you forever to remove any hair, and is leaves a lot of hair behind.  </li>
            <li> to use the buffer properly press lightly and go small circular motions in a straight line up and down for like legs or side to side for like the jaw line on your face, then go back in the opposite direction rotating in the opposite direction as well so if you were going clockwise down your leg from the knee to the ankle you would go counter clockwise up your leg from the ankle to the knee.</li>
            <li> Also, how is this particular one different from the other no!no!</li>
            <li> Sunday night, decided I was excited, used it for a half an hour and the tip was dead.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have tried hair buffers with no success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using the nono daily, alternating body parts to every other day.</li>
            <li> and I do mean everything, came right back.</li>
            <li> and you are no longer going too fast so that it is not getting as much and having to go over it several time or going too slow and it stopping and having to start a little farther back</li>
            <li> today my new NONO (the black one) stopped working, it sounds like the motor on it is going.</li>
            <li> However, if you have a really hairy face this thing ROCKS as long as you understand that it is not going to get rid of all of your hair after a few uses.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m finishing up with the stubborn hairs today, then I will get back to you in 2-4 weeks depending how long it takes for the hairs to grow back</li>
            <li> It will only work on super thin hair...</li>
            <li> It was very time consuming to remove even a small amount of hair, which returned in a day or so.</li>
            <li> This product is an absolute waste of money!  </li>
            <li> it may just be me on this because I had long hair, so I&#x27;ll go trim some or something, then get back to you on this later&lt;</li>
            <li> it can work hotter without burning you, still work as well, get as close and last as long (unless it is a defective wire)</li>
            <li> i keep wondering why my dumb ass didnt read reviews on this first!?  </li>
            <li> the rep completely went off on a tangent when I brought up this subject.</li>
            <li> in those areas a complete waste of time over traditional shaving.</li>
            <li> What a complete and total waste of money.</li>
            <li> just threw 270 bucks in the toilet</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, I need to qualify with a few things: I have very sensitive skin, so I do not use the buffer.</li>
            <li> Why such a limited warranty?</li>
            <li> maybe i am not using it the right way, but removing  the little hair under my chin takes a long time and it is not a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> But for the money, buy an epilator, a little pain but much faster, and the same results with much less expense.  </li>
            <li> I admit that I probably was LESS skeptical about this product as most before purchasing because I have tried a variety of different hair removal methods</li>
            <li> The hair on my arms are so thin and light (extremely vellus)</li>
            <li> I had to send back my 2nd NONO due it not even turning on after charging, it also blew the wire on both of my thermicon attachments.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say if it is due to finally having one that works or because it is marketed toward the male consumer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It did remove my arm hair a little easier than my leg hair but gave me ingrown hair near the elbows.&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE</li>
            <li> Their is like a safety indicator thingy on it, so if you are holding it the wrong way it doesn&#x27;t light up or anything...</li>
            <li> My last two were pink whether this is relevent or not</li>
            <li> But, what it does do is get rid of my hair long term.</li>
            <li> It does not get long and silky like befofe.</li>
            <li> Third, it is not a fast process.</li>
            <li> I almost always use the wide heat blade, even above my lip.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed a reduction in regrowth there as well, but it takes so damn long to do.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry it doesn&#x27;t take long to master</li>
            <li> really long hair doesn&#x27;t do</li>
            <li> and it still did not work, IT JUST TAKES LONG TIME</li>
            <li> I was left with a rough stubble on my legs.  </li>
            <li> Took a long time to get product.</li>
            <li> No does burn the hair (hence, the smell) but it does NOT completely remove the hair folicle, which is what it advertises.</li>
            <li> it seemed that the product melted some of the hairs and with the smell of branding cattle after I was done with this process, but still had plenty of long hair on both my legs and underarms.</li>
            <li> Due to my heritage, I have a lot of thick coarse hair on my legs and under my arms and because of the natural aging process I&#x27;ve developed unsightly, dark hair on my upper lip and chin.</li>
            <li> I actually observed two other returns while I was waiting to have mine</li>
            <li> I would definitely have to say the process has been slower with my legs than other areas, but the results are coming along.</li>
            <li> of course due to another set back in time I am not prepared for my 6 week review.</li>
            <li> I am curious if the no!no! guarantees permanent hair removal or simply will lessen hair growth?</li>
            <li> I have read multiple reviews of other systems that state they will eventually just stop working.</li>
            <li> It took a long time and I had to pass the No!No!</li>
            <li> The last 6 months I have used this EVERDAY on my face and neck and other then some burning hair no difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> AND NOW I ONLY HAVE TO USE IT LIKE EVERY OTHER MONTH.  </li>
            <li> or you can have patches of hair left but using the no no first then buffing</li>
            <li> Also, the hair grows back just as it would any other way of hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Other cartridges seem to last longer but you never know.  </li>
            <li> I bought on of the shopping network, QVC or HSN, not sure which one a few years ago when they first came out.</li>
            <li> I actually was patient and gave it a few months only to see absoloutely no result.</li>
            <li> The embarrassing facial hair is gone without constant waxing that lasts half that time!</li>
            <li> Limited warranty...</li>
            <li> It did not lighten my under chin hair growth AT ALL and the smell from the burnt hair really limited when I could use it.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed a slow reduction of regrowth but the fact that thing gets rid of the hair without leaving a bunch of little red pluck spots is the real clincher for me.</li>
            <li> it wouldn&#x27;t work (because the wheel is not spinning at the proper speed and sticking and cause you to burn yourself so it is suppose to shut off) and the red light will come on when the tip goes bad (or if there is another device issue).</li>

            <li> It is definitely taking longer for the courser, dark hair to go away.  </li>
            <li> NO ONE IS STANDING BEHIND THIS PRODUCT OR SUPPORTING when you buy from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hardly had any new growth during my 5 day hiatus.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I was a bit afraid to order my No No Pro, because a lot of people complained they got the same bad customer service my mom did and very few people gave good rating on customer service, but I went ahead and did it anyway because I liked what I was seeing happen when with my mom using hers.</li>

            <li> The tenderness was slight and didn&#x27;t last long.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered the Black NONO on my second return</li>
            <li> That is not realistic in my experience.</li>
            <li> My arm hair looks smoother than the legs since my hair texture is less coarse.</li>
            <li> takes a long time to finish an entire one leg, it takes time to remove hairs of places you wish to move, and on top of that it is difficult to remove the hair, even your finest hair that hasn&#x27;t been shaved, I know, because I tried it on my arms where I do not save and the hair is thin.  </li>
            <li> After 5 weeks of DAILY use, I saw no significant difference between the 2 sides of my chest.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Still left a little stubble, but instead of using the buffer pad included, I would recommend using the Sally Hansen or Nair buffer pads.  </li>
            <li> The only way I can see if their getting burnt, is if their pushing down real hard, but all you do is gently glide it over your skin, and your fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He tried to dodge the 3rd questions above, because if he had answered, it would have painted a negative picture of their company.</li>
            <li> While it does lessen the hair there, it&#x27;s not nearly as much as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I was assured that after a few weeks of regular use, I would see some results.  </li>
            <li> followed the instructions to the letter, and noticed no real results.  </li>
            <li> Not much to tell yet, except I smell burning hair in my sleep now.</li>
            <li> wanted to share a few tips for the upper lip I have learned through my use of the NONO device.</li>
            <li> I have the pink cordless 8800 device.</li>
            <li> After careful consideration, I am trying this tool.</li>
            <li> And go over hairs in opposite directions of growth a few times.</li>
            <li> I wish there were a minus zero rating for this product and this company.</li>
            <li> but you do have to go over quite a few times to totally remove the hair.</li>
            <li> I recieved my no no on a friday and began to use it around 8pm, tried it on a few different places, it worked well.</li>
            <li> I carefully repackaged it according to the instructions.  </li>
            <li> waste your money, and especially your time in hair removal.</li>
            <li> For over $300 it&#x27;s a BIG waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I went over it repeatedly and not much hair came off at all.  </li>
            <li> Not really a questions, but I wanted their response or statement to the numerous complaints about the no-no breaking within weeks or a few months.</li>
            <li> The worst of it all was that the result of using it for several months and multiple returns due to product defects, more hair grew in than was there before because the finer hair got removed and began to grow back.  </li>
            <li> And the long black ones are getting lighter and thinner.</li>
            <li> I did half of my chest daily with this product, the other half was shaved.  </li>
            <li> I spent a lot of time on a small area, because it did not always work and needed multiple swipes to produce any sort of result.</li>
            <li> This product sucks majorly.  </li>
            <li> I do have to come in a get a few black stumps from my chin now and then, especially if I know I am going to be out in the sun with other people.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am disappointment, but not shocked.  </li>
            <li> We especially wanted the small area kit.  </li>
            <li> The photo  has all the extra tips &amp; buffers for small areas shown with it.</li>
            <li> it is too hot and because the angle is all wrong.</li>
            <li> I have to use it every other day</li>
            <li> Instructions are in foreign language.  </li>
            <li> So running around with 3/4 of a leg done and the other one not touched at all</li>
            <li> So running around with 3/4 of a leg done and the other one not touched at all</li>
            <li> after you finish buffing with the other one.</li>
            <li> I almost bought it but was too scared b/c of all of the horror stories of similar past products burning people.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m curious as to how this passed FDA inspection, considering the harm it causes the average user.)</li>
            <li> I wish I would have returned this, but I wanted to try it a couple of times first to see if I was using it wrong.</li>
            <li> Their site has no customer support other than for returns.</li>
            <li> so you still end up shaving or using any other  means of removing hair.</li>
            <li> Which was even more disappointing!</li>
            <li> I have wasted my money, so I feel my only recourse is to warn others not to waste their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If it stays flat to the skin, the wire will have a little trouble zapping it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did loose a few hairs, but it did not remove a path of hair like it shows on the TV commercials.  </li>
            <li> (I am assuming this is maybe due to the hair already being less course in this area.)</li>
            <li> My wife became interested in this product but was a little reluctant to spend what they ask for it; it&#x27;s rather expensive for what it does.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I am just your average consumer, not an esthetician or dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Do you think a regular person would bother to write to all the negative reviewers unless he wasn&#x27;t tied to the company somehow?</li>
            <li> My cousin said it was not worth the money, but I am dark haired....</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s not worth the money, time, and frustration.  </li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY if you have dark hair.</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t expect much in the way of support if you lose a part or it fails for some reason not covered under warranty.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth $10.00.</li>
            <li> But i still have to tweeze ALL the dark hairs.</li>
            <li> at least those results are instant.</li>
            <li> found I have to go slow and pass over the same spot</li>
            <li> I used to have evenly hairy, thick, dark hair with multiple hairs from each pore on my legs.</li>
            <li> claims to slow hair growth and the hair that grows back will be finer and lighter.</li>
            <li> I spent a few minutes with her and told her how to use it</li>
            <li> This is a slow working process that requires daily use.</li>
            <li> did not work as expected it was waste of money</li>
            <li> The idea is that somehow the heat of the cord travels down the hair to the root and damages the follicle.  </li>
            <li> The hair growth has slowed down too.</li>
            <li> you have to go up and down not over or across</li>
            <li> What has not happened is any slowing down in the growth of my hair.</li>
            <li> For my arms, it goes up and down as it pleases.</li>
            <li> Once you get the technique down its fab.</li>
            <li> hair is not removed down to the roots, It is just singed on the end.</li>
            <li> so well it takes longer to get to because the plate in front that is meant to lift the hair up so the wire can burn it ends up holding it down</li>
            <li> Tried this out on both my son and my husband; used a clipper to get the hair down to the recommended length for optimal removal.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product from the mall (though it was the black one).  </li>
            <li> which makes me trust the product even less.  </li>
            <li> My legs, (which have seemed to take the longest to see results) are showing progressively less regrowth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> you will eventually need to use it less and less.</li>
            <li> In fact, it cut in half the time it took me to remove hair from those areas with tweezers.   </li>
            <li> And it takes less time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I slightly cinched the skin.</li>
            <li> Legs have 25 percent less hair and everything is finer in texture.</li>
            <li> The hair on my arms is dark brown, long, and thick.</li>
            <li> but it still takes me less time to nono and buff than it does to pluck.</li>
            <li> I still do use it on my arms occasionally but usually get lazy and buzz over them with the shaver attachment on my Panasonic epilator.</li>
            <li> Besides not working half the time, this burned my face and DID NOT remove any hair.</li>
            <li> The customer service she got was less then acceptable.</li>
            <li> The customer service she got was less then acceptable.</li>
            <li> I have gone from shaving twice to 3 times a week to now less than once a month.  </li>
            <li> The cartridges are expensive running $30, considering they only last one go.</li>
            <li> If I could give this product a less than one-star rating, I would.  </li>
            <li> it wouldn&#x27;t work (it&#x27;s a safety to keep you from burning yourself because you are in one place for too long) and if you press too hard</li>
            <li> it wouldn&#x27;t work (it&#x27;s a safety to keep you from burning yourself because you are in one place for too long) and if you press too hard</li>
            <li> , this is the third month and still no good results.</li>
            <li> Thinking it would work, I wanted to try this little gadget, but it doesn&#x27;t work to my surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also noticed I have little patches here</li>
            <li> -21-12&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to give a little update...</li>
            <li> A little background on my hair situation.</li>
            <li> Takes a little practice Always glide off and lift off the skin.</li>
            <li> the tip has a little wire that heats up and burns your hair</li>
            <li> and it hasn&#x27;t helped me even a little bit.  </li>
            <li> I find this little thing a rip off.  </li>
            <li> Also, it didn&#x27;t even touch the dark hairs on my face!</li>
            <li> I think the problem with the bikini area is simply that the hairs their are really tough.  </li>
            <li> That narrows it down ehh? Haaaaaa!</li>
            <li> My advice to future consumers...DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> Covering my facial hair with makeup only gave my face an unattractive dirty appearance.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it&#x27; will be a waste of money and your time.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to have any solid scientific evidence behind it.</li>
            <li> My chin (my problem area) has a few sporatic hairs that are not noticable.</li>
            <li> My arms are hairless, underarms have a few that I need to use the nono a couple times a week.</li>
            <li> It just grows a few centimeters.</li>
            <li> However, I was unable to remove hair from under my arms or from my legs completely using this product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled and waste your money on a no-no.</li>
            <li> It does not work to destroy the hair roots.</li>
            <li> $270.00 is not cheap.</li>
            <li> The representative turned into a broken record and kept going back to case scenarios within 2-year</li>
            <li> waste your money</li>
            <li> After a few weeks it began to seize after a few strokes and after a month it stopped working all together.</li>
            <li> have had a lot of trouble with this</li>
            <li> The buffer will just take off the burnt part of the hair if you go over it lightly once and leave you with annoying stubble.</li>
            <li> ; Nothing!  Waste of time.</li>
            <li> I can be used alone on places with thin hair like arms and facial hair.</li>
            <li> ,I tried to return at which point they said I couldn&#x27;t because I had it few days over 6 weeks since they sent it to me.</li>
            <li> but, this thing is a waste of money!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The results of this are that on a two week trip the charger got left behind so it couldn&#x27;t be used.</li>
            <li> this is a waste.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste you time or your money.  </li>
            <li> Why waste time with the No</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this as it does not work...</li>
            <li> I bought it with the hope of getting the few wired hairs on my chin....</li>
            <li> It is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> What a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> and i don&#x27;t have to use anything harsh on my face.</li>
            <li> It will work, but this product is not effective for removing thick coarse hair.</li>
            <li> WOW, WHAT false adveritising!</li>
            <li> and I still need to shave at least every other day.</li>
            <li> little background about myself: I am in my late thirties, half Armenian, and have excess hair on my face and arms that make me feel self-conscious.</li>
            <li> It is also hard to predict when the cartridge will stop working and it usually happens when you&#x27;ve done one leg but still need to do the other.  </li>
            <li> I did burn myself a few times but it is just the wire and looks like a small cat scratch.</li>
            <li> Well the small head fell out of the case, no secure compartment, and fell on the floor.</li>
            <li> it will not work on thick dark hair on face or legs.</li>
            <li> It will be here in 7-10 days, then I send them back the bad one in the same box all paid for</li>
            <li> It will be here in 7-10 days, then I send them back the bad one in the same box all paid for</li>
            <li> My rating it based on my results as I can not honestly say that my experience in receiving malfunctioning devices is typical or not.</li>
            <li> I now have bald spots on my legs, platinum thin hair, and single hair pores.</li>
            <li> It is NOT smooth after using the nono, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be, at least not yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No no is not a safe product.</li>
            <li> Fourth, it is WAY to expensive.</li>
            <li> There is no way I would ever buy a product from a company who uses these shady tactics.</li>
            <li> but sometimes I get lazy and slack off.</li>
            <li> At first I was disappointed in the results, because I thought it would be immediate.</li>
            <li> The thermicon tips lasted a couple of months on my arms before needing replacement, and because I was unable to use the facial tips without burning myself, I still have those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No!n tips lasted a couple of months on my arms before needing replacement, and because I was unable to use the facial tips without burning myself, I still have those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We need to complain in order to stop this horrible thing from being sold to more women.</li>
            <li> The tips burn out instantly and are expensive.  </li>
            <li> Not sure</li>
            <li> until the wire has past</li>
            <li> If you can trim it before hand or shave a day or two before you use it so that your hair is no more than 1/4 inch</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> They lie because they tell you no more mustash on the infocommerical yet when you get it</li>
            <li> I bought this about a two years ago and I stopped using it six months after I bought it because the cartridges don&#x27;t last, they are expensive to replace and this machine isn&#x27;t as convenient as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to get it for my son, who, unfortunately, has my husbands genes when it comes to hair growth all over his body including his back.  </li>
            <li> I had tried the Tria Laser in the past (almost $900 bucks), but it was too painful for me even when I was very used to waxing pain.</li>
            <li> given how false the other claims were.</li>
            <li> Hard to use&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> My goal is to go hairless at least for a month.</li>
            <li> He says he has no knowledge of any negative consumer reviews of no-no.</li>
            <li> This product is a dud, does not work, at least not on darker hair.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get my money back in tears by the disappointment.</li>
            <li> AND BY THE WAY I RATE THIS PROCUCT NEGATIVE</li>
            <li> No did not effectively remove the hair as the advertisements promised.  </li>
            <li> It also does not effectively remove the hair, as a result</li>
            <li> I at least don&#x27;t have it on my face.</li>
            <li> Lot&#x27;s of negative reviews, but like all products, not everything works for everyone.  </li>
            <li> 60 days and not a day late?</li>
            <li> this piece of crap  doesnt work very well at all.  </li>
            <li> I am a few days behind schedule, I have 3 days to finish my 5th week and will update on the 7th.</li>
            <li> The growth is now extremely slow.</li>
            <li> Also, my hair is growing SOOO slowly now.</li>
            <li> Then you can rinse off your legs and put on your capi slow lotion</li>
            <li> and they complained that their hair was still thick and needed to use it every 3 days after 3 months.</li>
            <li> slow  </li>
            <li> and they didn&#x27;t explain that the lights change from the setting to the tip ware and if you went too slow</li>
            <li> and they didn&#x27;t explain that the lights change from the setting to the tip ware and if you went too slow</li>
            <li> Thick hair areas takes like legs; it will will take a while</li>
            <li> She has thick hair and after using it for a couple of weeks she did see satisfactory results after some trial and error.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t consider my leg hair to be particularly thick and yet some cartridges stopped working when I wasn&#x27;t even done on one leg.  </li>
            <li> So I was forced to keep it</li>
            <li> (Very very little)!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t mean to be rude, but i don&#x27;t see how people are getting burnt with this...</li>
            <li> But that does mean that it is working.</li>
            <li> I believed the only way to remove this unsightly hair was with expensive electrolysis or laser hair removal treatments until I saw the infomercial for the No!No!   </li>
            <li> I mean I didn&#x27;t get any results at all</li>
            <li> So far I amq disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked a couple of days later when hardly any growth appeared under my arms</li>
            <li> -- aging is bad enough!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Consistency is also critical - don&#x27;t get frustrated</li>
            <li> Bottom line is don&#x27;t waste your money, this is an expensive product.</li>
            <li> I normally have to shave every day and was shocked that the hair growth had slowed!</li>
            <li> This thing sucks!</li>
            <li> The no!no! was MUCH less expensive than laser or electrolisis, and there is NO PAIN!  </li>
            <li> all it does is burn a few hairs and stinks up the room.  </li>
            <li> Took a lot of time to produce poor results&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> The toughest areas are the knees and behind the thigh and calf because you can&#x27;t see what you are doing and have to feel.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , when the hairs are too tall or thick, it&#x27;s useless as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If the manufacturer won&#x27;t stand behind their product who will?</li>
            <li> According to him, all negative reviewers had unrealistic expectations of the no-no because they didn&#x27;t see immediate results after the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve concluded that Radiancy does not fully stand behind the quality of their products.</li>
            <li> and say what is going on I&#x27;m not happy my mother is now out of her warranty because your rep wouldn&#x27;t help her</li>
            <li> and say what is going on I&#x27;m not happy my mother is now out of her warranty because your rep wouldn&#x27;t help her</li>
            <li> I immediately tried cancelling my order after reading poor reviews about this product.</li>
            <li> Talk about poor customer service.</li>
            <li> False advertisment and false claims</li>
            <li> This seriously works people!</li>
            <li> It is a process but it seriously works!</li>
            <li> Ridiculous!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe they can advertise like that, it should be illegal to advertise such false statements!!!</li>
            <li> stinks, when it grows back the itch is so bad I could claw myself bloody.&lt;br /&gt;Waxing and epilating scare me</li>
            <li> I mean after like 15 times over the same spot it kinda worked this is a terrible product</li>
            <li> Return process was difficult</li>
            <li> Worse than that it can be dangerous.</li>
            <li> The underarm area is difficult for me to get and keep the device activated.</li>
            <li> on the monthly payment plan because it was so expensive.</li>
            <li> glow wires are too expensive too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive and all it does is Burn hair.</li>
            <li> It is expensive and if you are not that hairy</li>
            <li> I am of Indian ehtnicity and found that this device is a blatant lie that I fell for on HSN.</li>
            <li> I fell for it, sadly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not giving it all five stars because I think it&#x27;s really expensive</li>

            <li> Maybe I wasn&#x27;t using it properly, but all in all, THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS HORRIBLE!!!</li>
            <li> I did just as the vague instructions directed me to do so, and all that happened was: even the lightest/thinest hair just burned and curled.</li>
            <li> Mine never made the noise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never buy an expensive item like this from Amazon as Nono could not help me and</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t think the smell is THAT bad, but my family does not like it.  </li>

            <li> I paid $300 dollars for this stupid device i never use AND THAT DOES NOT WORK AT ALL!!!</li>
            <li> This is the worst product on the market....</li>
            <li> I had a terrible experience.  </li>

            <li> bought this cuz ive got a skin disease and sometimes i hear removing the hair permanently will help.  so i got my hopes all up think aw maybe we&#x27;ve got ourself a cure :)  WRONG!!  this piece of crap  doesnt work very well at all.  all it does is burn a few hairs and stinks up the room.  i better get my money back asap!!  o and p.s.  i keep wondering why my dumb ass didnt read reviews on this first!?  probley cuz i seen it on doctor oz show and thought what ever item he promoted should be a done deal and guarenteed to work!!  thx doc oz for leading us on to a scam item!!!!</li>
            <li> I received the NONO for Christmas this year!  I am fair skin, and have light hair...but lets face it ladies, unwanted hair is unwanted hair.   Followed the instructions on the NONO was using it.....on the lightest setting...did not feel any discomfort....although it did not seem to remove much hair..  Woke up the following day to burn marks all over my neck and chin..  I look like I have carpet burns all over my neck and face. Thank goodness I have a weeks vacation.   Scabs are finally coming off..This is going right back to sender!!  Thanks but no thanks to the NONO!!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I bought something because of a TV commercial. It looked so simple, easy and convincing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this product is nothing like it claims. First of all, it is finicky to use and often did nothing (you can tell because the light was not flashing). When I got the light flashing it was extremely time consuming. I spent a lot of time on a small area, because it did not always work and needed multiple swipes to produce any sort of result. To treat an area sized 2-3 inches you would need to spend several hours. It can manage only light and fine hair that almost invisible anyway. The product claims that it will not grow back over time, but the hair does grow back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the product on a special discount using the promo on the TV commercial. I was worried about getting my money back given how false the other claims were. It took some aggressive screaming over the phone to get them to give me a refund, but they never refunded the cost of shipping the No!no! unit back even though in their advertising they promise it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DID NOT LIKE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Hard to use&lt;br /&gt;2) Did not work on all hair&lt;br /&gt;3) Took a lot of time to produce poor results&lt;br /&gt;4) Hair grew back&lt;br /&gt;5) Return process was difficult&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LIKED:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Commercial. (Sigh....)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No! NO! NO! DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
            <li> If I could give 0 stars I would. The no!no! is completely worthless. Worse than that it can be dangerous. I&#x27;m all for free enterprise but retailers should just pull garbage like this from their shelves.</li>
            <li> I got my No-No 6 months ago, and wanted to wait so I could write a thorough review. I am pleased with it, but I was not expecting miracles, just the same results I got from epilating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I need to qualify with a few things: I have very sensitive skin, so I do not use the buffer. Also, I do not use it as often as the prescribe. I&#x27;ve used it once or twice a week since I got it, but do use it on the hair at the appropriate length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been impressed that it doesn&#x27;t bother my skin (I have to use it on the highest setting too, though I did work up to it). The only issue I&#x27;ve had is if I go over a spot one to many times, it gets red (like razor burn), but I&#x27;ve used it over eczema without increased irritation. I have \\&quot;burned\\&quot; myself when a bit of skin (underarm) bunched under the wire. The tenderness was slight and didn&#x27;t last long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results on my lower legs were immediate. After one use, the amount of hair that grew back was halved. I have course hair there, and it took care of it nicely. The hair on my upper legs does not do as well, but is still satisfactory. I think the difference is that the hair is finer and evades the wire. I still shave my legs once a week (this keeps the hair the right length to use the No-No and takes care of strays), but that&#x27;s huge compared to the fast growing, once a day of before. The results are similar to when I used an epilator but without the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had much luck with it on my bikini area or under arms. While it does lessen the hair there, it&#x27;s not nearly as much as I had hoped. The underarm area is difficult for me to get and keep the device activated. I may try having my husband do it for me. I think the problem with the bikini area is simply that the hairs their are really tough.  I&#x27;ve gone back to epilating that area, but still use the No-No in-between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought one for a friend (I do like the results on my legs) who has curly hair, and it works great for her.I suspect one of the reasons results differ so wildly is because of how the hair lies. If it stays flat to the skin, the wire will have a little trouble zapping it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps you make your decision!</li>
            <li> I bought on of the shopping network, QVC or HSN, not sure which one a few years ago when they first came out. Thinking it would work, I wanted to try this little gadget, but it doesn&#x27;t work to my surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way it works is that it burns the hair on the surface of your skin, it doesn&#x27;t remove the hair from the root, so you&#x27;ll have hair growing in no time, it&#x27;s basically like shaving. The smell is that of burning hair, so you need to moisturize after using this product.  I returned the product for It takes a long time to finish an entire one leg, it takes time to remove hairs of places you wish to move, and on top of that it is difficult to remove the hair, even your finest hair that hasn&#x27;t been shaved, I know, because I tried it on my arms where I do not save and the hair is thin.  Basically bottom line is I do not recommend this product, it&#x27; will be a waste of money and your time.</li>
            <li> I bought this product from the mall (though it was the black one).  I was assured that after a few weeks of regular use, I would see some results.  I did half of my chest daily with this product, the other half was shaved.  After 5 weeks of DAILY use, I saw no significant difference between the 2 sides of my chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product seems to use the same technology as a bug zapper.  It has what looks like an electrified cord that skims along just above your skin, burning hairs.  The smell of burning hair is strong.  The idea is that somehow the heat of the cord travels down the hair to the root and damages the follicle.  I am not sure that this explanation is actually plausible (which is why I tried it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions to the letter, and noticed no real results.  I think the company relies on TV/internet orders because they hope you just wont send it back for the refund.  It is quite pricey, so I am sure that even with a significant number of returns, they still profit heavily from those who never get around to mailing it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned mine to the mall.  They said perhaps mine was defective, and offered me a new one.  They said that it (defective units) happens sometimes...  which makes me trust the product even less.  I actually observed two other returns while I was waiting to have mine processed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short:  This product did not work for me, as advertised.  I am disappointment, but not shocked.  It didn&#x27;t seem to have any solid scientific evidence behind it.</li>
            <li> Does not work! Huge waste of money and they refused to return my money! Do not buy from this company!</li>
            <li> I love my NONO.  My legs are hair free and I just started doing my bikini area.  I waxed all the time and now I don&#x27;t have to go through the torture of getting my hair ripped out.  The small tip makes using this on my bikini area sooooooo much easier!!</li>
            <li> sory this product was not what we espected and we need to return this product.&lt;br /&gt;  thank you&lt;br /&gt;  gail skellchock</li>
            <li> The smell of burning hair was an instant detractor for my wife. She never used it again. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I were very excited to get this. We especially wanted the small area kit.  The photo  has all the extra tips &amp; buffers for small areas shown with it. However, none of the smaller tips, buffers, lotion or travel case were in the box. We&#x27;ll have to return it &amp; make sure we order the complete set next time. They shouldn&#x27;t add items to the product photo that aren&#x27;t included. Very sneaky amazon!</li>
            <li> I looked at reviews online for this product for months until I finally purchased it myself.  It works VERY well on fine facial peach fuzz.  Nearing 50, I did not like the way this looked.  The no!no! was MUCH less expensive than laser or electrolisis, and there is NO PAIN!  After a couple of months of occasional use, my peach fuzz is almost gone.  My legs, however, are another story.  It is definitely taking longer for the courser, dark hair to go away.  I do see a difference though.  The amount of regrowth is decreasing while what remains is getting finer.  (The razor stubble feel a couple days afterwards is not so scratchy.)  Consistent usage is key!    I don&#x27;t think the smell is THAT bad, but my family does not like it.  I try to use it when no one is home.  Showering afterwards removes the smell from the skin.</li>
            <li> When I was looking into buying the nono I searched out reviews, hoping to find a review to tell me how the nono worked as the weeks progressed. I didn&#x27;t find any, so I bought the nono and decided to do a week by week review for others looking into purchasing this device. There is a 60 day money back \\&quot;guarantee\\&quot;, so here is my first week...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOR THE MEN...&lt;br /&gt; I am using this on my husband too. He is a body builder and wants a smooth chest. He has not had a full week yet, I will update when he does. Update below...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT I AM DOING...&lt;br /&gt;I am NOT using the lotion/buffers that come with the nono. My reasons are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The lotion has parabens in it.&lt;br /&gt;2. It is a hair growth inhibitor and I want to know I am getting the results from the nono device not the lotion.&lt;br /&gt;3. I have sensitive skin and have tried hair buffers with no success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using the nono daily, alternating body parts to every other day. The nono recommends using the nono 3-4 times a week so I am following the directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WEEK 1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just finished my first week of the nono. Not much to tell yet, except I smell burning hair in my sleep now. LOL&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the smaller thermacon attachment it feels like it gets closer to the skin and I burned my upper lip. This did not happen with the larger one. So I only use the larger one now.&lt;br /&gt;I found I have to go slow and pass over the same spot 2-3 times for the hair to burn off. It is NOT smooth after using the nono, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be, at least not yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll change my rating as necessary and will update after I finish my second week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today is actually my third week. I did start to notice a slight thinning of the hair after 2 weeks but wasn&#x27;t sure if it was my imagination or not. Now at 3 weeks I am getting a little excited about my results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WEEK 3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair is definately thinner, not as course, and lighter. The hair on my legs (in addition to lighter and thinner) seems to be beginning to become a bit more sporadic. I noticed more of a difference in the hair on my arms than legs so far. The hair on my arms are so thin and light (extremely vellus) I can barely see them. (I am assuming this is maybe due to the hair already being less course in this area.) The hair growth has slowed down too. I am now alternating body parts to every 2 days. I also noticed I have little patches here and there that have nothing, mainly in the underarm area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a loofah while showering to exfoliate the burned hair and then apply a natural moisturizer. The thermicon attachments seem to last also. I have used the same large thermicon since the beginning and the indicator shows it to still have 3 bars (measuring 3-0).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband has been using the NONO for his chest for 2 weeks now. He does not have a very hairy chest to begin with but has noticed a slower growth and a thinning in the hair.&lt;br /&gt;I will update when he has more results. Also feel free to ask questions if I have not covered something you would like to know:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WEEK 4&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just finished my 4th week and the hair seems to be getting very fine and soft. I imagine it is a much slower process due to me not using the growth inhibiting lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband is not using it on a regular basis, so I apoligize for not being able to give more information on his use of the nono.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Middle of 5th week...OK so my NONO is not working correctly. I called customer service and they are sending me a new one and starting my 60 days over again. I suppose I can&#x27;t complain about that assuming this was a malfuction in the device I recieved and not that the device itself is crap. This kind of screws up my 6 week review for you so I will continue to review after I recieve my new nono. It will be interesting to see if the time lapse will effect the hair growth. I will keep you posted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12-4-11&lt;br /&gt;Ok I just receivedmy new NONO 12-3. I am a few days behind schedule, I have 3 days to finish my 5th week and will update on the 7th. I was without my NONO for 5 days and did not notice new hair growth or anything to make me think I was set back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12-7-11&lt;br /&gt;WEEK 5&lt;br /&gt;I just finished my 5th week with the NONO and I have to say that I am happy with my results. I even changed my rating!&lt;br /&gt;The hair on my arms is almost gone. If I look closely I can see baby fine hairs. I would definitely have to say the process has been slower with my legs than other areas, but the results are coming along. The hair on my legs is very light and soft, I feel more skin than hair if I run my hand against the growth. Any vellus hair I had is gone and the hair that was course is becoming vellus. I have larger patches that have nothing. The growth is now extremely slow. I hardly had any new growth during my 5 day hiatus.&lt;br /&gt;The thermicon I was using ran out, so I would say they last about a month.&lt;br /&gt;I think it will take more than 6 weeks to get the desired results I am looking for. But I think it will be worth it. I am happy to answer any questions. I hope my review helps. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update again on the 14th.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12-16-11&lt;br /&gt;The NONO is on it&#x27;s last chance with me. I had to send back my 2nd NONO due it not even turning on after charging, it also blew the wire on both of my thermicon attachments. Customer service sent me a new NONO and new attachments and started my 60 day trial over. AGAIN. I asked for the Black nono this time after the representive made me aware that it is the latest to be released and they have not had the black nonos returned. So far so good but I have only had this one now for a day. I would have given up and gotten my money back if it were not for the fact that I have noticed such a difference in my hair growth. I really hope this one is not defective. My last two were pink whether this is relevent or not I can&#x27;t say but I would want to know if I was reading this review.&lt;br /&gt;AND of course due to another set back in time I am not prepared for my 6 week review. I realize my two returns may have made the decision for some but I will still post my 6th week to complete my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy to report that my new nono has been working great. Actually better than I imagined. I ordered the Black NONO on my second return and I feel it is more powerful. I can&#x27;t say if it is due to finally having one that works or because it is marketed toward the male consumer. With the black nono 1 pass and the hair burns off.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with my results after 6 weeks. Any hair that was on my upper lip is gone. My chin (my problem area) has a few sporatic hairs that are not noticable. My arms are hairless, underarms have a few that I need to use the nono a couple times a week. My legs, (which have seemed to take the longest to see results) are showing progressively less regrowth.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to share a few tips for the upper lip I have learned through my use of the NONO device. (it took me awhile to get this one)&lt;br /&gt;For upper lip: Again the larger thermicon the smaller one burns me. You can move the nono in toward the nose or outward toward the jawline (as the directions tell you to). But lets be honest that is not how the hair grows. I pull my lips in (as if evening out lipstick) and I stick my toung under my upper lip (depending on the area I am trying to reach) to make a smooth even surface for gliding the nono and not to get burned. And move in an upward motion. Start off on the lowest setting work from there to see what works for you. Do not tip the nono forward, more than a 90 degree angle, this always burned me in the beginning. It is ok to tip it back toward the roller a little. The NONO works best on short stubble. I made the mistake of letting my hair grow out before getting the NONO (used to having to do so for waxing) and it took me longer to use it and more passes to burn the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Iguess that is all for my review. I appreicate all your responses and I will be following any comments for questions. I hope my review helped in your decision to buy this device:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1-19-12&lt;br /&gt;Well today my new NONO (the black one) stopped working, it sounds like the motor on it is going. It seems like these things are designed to work for 30-50 days and break in some way. So I have a choice to make... get a new nono every 50 days or so (as they keep starting over my 60 days) or just get my money back and search out the next best way for hair removal. I&#x27;m very disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6-21-12&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to give a little update... I did receive another replacement nono. This one has been working fine with no problems. I am still using my nono and remain happy with my results. It is not a device that will make you \\&quot;completely hairless\\&quot; in my opinion, but the difference is enough for me to find it worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also like to clear up some confusion, I have been questioned about my four star rating then me saying that I am disappointed... I was disappointed about the devices malfunctioning on me, but not the results I got using the nono. My rating it based on my results as I can not honestly say that my experience in receiving malfunctioning devices is typical or not. However, it is only fair to let any other consumer make the choice to purchase one for themselves by me simply sharing my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Melin</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I originally loved this product and had great hopes.  The results were adequate on lightly haired places.  Legs were a challenge. The worst of it all was that the result of using it for several months and multiple returns due to product defects, more hair grew in than was there before because the finer hair got removed and began to grow back.  There was no permanent hair removal only re-grwoth times 10. Do Not Buy you will be greatly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have dark hair and light skin. I have been getting laser hair removal done professionally for some time, but I am interested in beginning new areas at home. I am curious if the no!no! guarantees permanent hair removal or simply will lessen hair growth? Also, can anyone possibly compare this product to either the silk&#x27;n or the Tria...I am intrigued by all three, but want to get the best treatment for the money I spend. Also, how is this particular one different from the other no!no! hair removal systems-less painful, more effective, effective more quickly, etc? Also, is there some kind of guarantee or warranty on the product in case it is defective or stops working after some time. I have read multiple reviews of other systems that state they will eventually just stop working. Thanks so much for any help you can give me! Oh, and ignore my rating. I have not ever used no!no!-I simply needed to rate the product in order to post some questions. Have a good one!</li>
            <li> No no is not a safe product. It did not work on my legs. I tried it for 3 weeks more often. It worked on the upper lip part but I burned myself twice, very dangerous. I&#x27;ve also read a review that one lady got a scar from no no on her upper lip. Then I called customer service to send it back. On the commercial they say you get the delivery costs back and they pay for the shipping cost if you want to send it back. When I ordered no no, the operator I spoke to said that is truth (she knew I want to try it first without paying). Today I found out that they pay for shipping costs only if I would have payed the full price and only if you try it for exacly 60 days! Not true about the risk free!! I also researched in the Internet and there are many risk with it.</li>
            <li> I would give this a five if it worked immediately like they show. It does not leave me smooth and the buffers are a joke. But, what it does do is get rid of my hair long term. I&#x27;ve been using my nono for 2 months, since Christmas. I now have bald spots on my legs, platinum thin hair, and single hair pores. I used to have evenly hairy, thick, dark hair with multiple hairs from each pore on my legs. Bleh. I am balder in areas that are easy to reach! lol. I also use it effectively on my face and arms. It is too hot even on its lightest setting for my scar on my face. Also, I cannot use it on my bikini area or underarms becuase it is too hot and because the angle is all wrong. Also, my hair is growing SOOO slowly now. I used to shave in the morning and have stubble before dinner. Now I can go 3 days before I have that much growth. The hair on my face is also growing shorter. It does not get long and silky like befofe. It just grows a few centimeters. And the long black ones are getting lighter and thinner. I use it nearly every 3rd day. I know it works, but it is slow and does not work like the infomercial where the hairy chested man gets smooth results. I do have to shave, but I&#x27;ve never had such smooth results after shaving. I used to feel prickly after shaving no matter what, but now I get those ultra smooth legs like you get with nair. I don&#x27;t shave often because its winter, so its a perfect time to nono. I just let it grow and nono whenever I&#x27;m sitting watching TV. The kids think it stinks...lol. It does! But that does mean that it is working. I would recommend this product, but you HAVE to give it time and not expect to stop shaving as soon as you use it. That is not realistic in my experience.</li>
            <li> I wish I had read reviews before I bought this.  It was very time consuming to remove even a small amount of hair, which returned in a day or so. I must say it was not painful in any way, nor did I burn myself, as I used one of the lower settings.  But for the money, buy an epilator, a little pain but much faster, and the same results with much less expense.  I sent it back, I am out the shipping both ways, so I lost $30.00 but no hair.</li>
            <li> This product burned my skin but not the hair, even on the lowest setting. It&#x27;s a definite NO NO if you have sensitive skin. I returned mine.</li>
            <li> A little background on my hair situation. When I would shave I would have stubble by the evening and I could see the dark hair under my skin so it would look like stubble even if it was smooth. I was very fortunate about a year and a half ago to have a friend that managed a medi-spa and gave me free laser treatments. I had about 8 on my leg and unders arms and maybe 3-4 on my full bikini area. Getting just 6 full leg treatments can cost up to $2000! And let me tell you, 6 won&#x27;t get the job done. I still needed maybe another 3-4 treatments for my legs but my friend no longer works at the spa :(. So, I took a chance and ordered the no no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My legs still have patches of hair and I still need to shave at least every other day. My under arms are fine, not hair free but almost. Bikini needs many more treatments. The no no is easy to use and you do get the burnt hair smell. No biggie, light a candle. I did burn myself a few times but it is just the wire and looks like a small cat scratch. I don&#x27;t burn myself anymore. And just for the record, I have been burned the lasers before and it was way more painful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So does it work? Yes. I have had mine about 2 months now and since I have had the lasers before I know that a certain patch may have 10 hairs and another 8 hairs so I have literally been able to count and notice the hairs in a patch getting less and less. I think I have only shaved twice and when I did it was just so smooth and so fast! I use the no no a couple of times a week now. The toughest areas are the knees and behind the thigh and calf because you can&#x27;t see what you are doing and have to feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it sporadically on my bikini and underarms but have really just been focusing on my legs. But, I don&#x27;t want to kid you that it takes dedication and I am lucky because I have a head start with the lasers. If you are still full on hair it is going to be a battle, but it will work! If you can afford lasers, DO IT! I cannot afford itand although $250 is steep, it is still a huge savings. Even with lasers you would still have to set an appointment every month to go in for an hour to be treated....for up to a year! It&#x27;s not a miracle, it takes work but if you are looking at this product you are already sick and tired of shaving. Good luck!</li>
            <li> I am just your average consumer, not an esthetician or dermatologist. It is important I always look my best because my job requires a lot of public speaking. Due to my heritage, I have a lot of thick coarse hair on my legs and under my arms and because of the natural aging process I&#x27;ve developed unsightly, dark hair on my upper lip and chin. Covering my facial hair with makeup only gave my face an unattractive dirty appearance. I believed the only way to remove this unsightly hair was with expensive electrolysis or laser hair removal treatments until I saw the infomercial for the No!No!   The No!No! uses heat to burn hair to the root. No!No! claims to slow hair growth and the hair that grows back will be finer and lighter. So, the more you use the No!No! you will eventually need to use it less and less. No!No! claims it is effective on all hair types. However, I was unable to remove hair from under my arms or from my legs completely using this product. It took a long time and I had to pass the No!No! over my legs and under my arms repeatedly to only removed some of the hair. This tedious process makes using No!No! in those areas a complete waste of time over traditional shaving. The No!No! was very effective to remove hair from my upper lip and chin. In fact, it cut in half the time it took me to remove hair from those areas with tweezers.   I have been using the No!No! now for five months. Some of the hair on my upper lip and chin is still dark and thick, but most of it is lighter and finer than before.  It all grows just as fast as it did before I used the No!No! I have given up trying to use it under my arms or legs because it took too long and the result wasn&#x27;t as effective as shaving.    There are more cons than pros to using this system. First, there is a burning hair smell. This is a good thing and indicates the system is working to remove the hair. However, my family can&#x27;t stand the smell and complain frequently about it. Second, you must use caution overcontour areas or you will burn your skin. Ouch! That hurts and looks bad too. Third, it is not a fast process. You have to get the timing just right. To fast and the system isn&#x27;t effective, too slow and it won&#x27;t turn on. Fourth, it is WAY to expensive. At $270 it isn&#x27;t worth the money for what little hair it removes.    I purchased the No!No! on the monthly payment plan because it was so expensive. No!No! gives a 60-day trail. If you aren&#x27;t happy with the results within 60 days you can return it. Armed with this information, I was sure I had nothing to loose but hair! I elected to keep the product for use removing the hair on my face. However, if I had it all to do over again I would save the money for electrolysis instead. My suggestion for anyone interested in purchasing this product is to determine the type of hair you have and how you want to use the No!No! If you just want to use it to remove fine hair from your face, legs, arms, etc. It will work, but this product is not effective for removing thick coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered the listed No No and didn&#x27;t know much about them except that my wife wanted one.  Well when I gave it to her, she opened it and it says \\&quot;for men\\&quot; on it.  This wasn&#x27;t even an option when ordering it, so I have a no no I won&#x27;t use and she isn&#x27;t a man, so it sits here not being used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a neat designed tool!&lt;br /&gt;It looks like it&#x27;s breaking down fast though, relies on a Li battery, and need to replace glow wires about as many times as you do with razor blades!&lt;br /&gt;The glow wires are too expensive too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the glow wire burns the skin, if you don&#x27;t move it fast enough. Move it too fast and it&#x27;s useless!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, when the hairs are too tall or thick, it&#x27;s useless as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another useless, because it&#x27;s only good for flat surfaces! Any area of skin with unevennesses, and the glow wire will cause burn wounds unlike what a razor can do, that will hurt for days, if not weeks, before it heals!</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I took the time to really research this product before buying it. When google searching for \\&quot;NoNo Product Reviews\\&quot;, you are barraged by a ton of personal blogs and positive customer testimonials... THAT ARE ALL FAKE! They are shills written by people paid by the company to promote their product to unwitting people who don&#x27;t look deeper than the first things they see. Companies like these have a huge budget to pay \\&quot;independent\\&quot; people to write reviews in several forums -- even here in Amazon! Check out all the commentary on 1-star reviews refuting the bad reviews.... They&#x27;re all by a person named \\&quot;A. James\\&quot;. Do you think a regular person would bother to write to all the negative reviewers unless he wasn&#x27;t tied to the company somehow? Do they think we&#x27;re stupid? Of course they do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How insulting and scummy. There is no way I would ever buy a product from a company who uses these shady tactics. Spread the word about this bogus product, and don&#x27;t let anyone else throw their money away to these scumbags.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled and waste your money on a no-no. I have more hair now that I had before on my face. It does not work to destroy the hair roots. It&#x27;s expensive and all it does is Burn hair.</li>
            <li> This will not work! My cousin said it was not worth the money, but I am dark haired....that means my hair grows back fast! If anybody finds a solution that is CHEEP, please let me know! PS: can you rate it zero stars?</li>
            <li> it does work, but this is my first time using it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;things i noticed&lt;br /&gt;1. gives out a funky smell&lt;br /&gt;2. you have to go over an area 3 or so times - it may just be me on this because I had long hair, so I&#x27;ll go trim some or something, then get back to you on this later&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after i finished up&lt;br /&gt;I forgot to post for after I finished... anyways the funky smell wavers after you put on the creme... So i guess any lotion/creme will get rid of the scent.&lt;br /&gt;It does not pick up every single hair, but it was my first time using it, so maybe it&#x27;ll be better as I continue to use it....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mean to be rude, but i don&#x27;t see how people are getting burnt with this... It is so safe I&#x27;d let a teenager or students between ages 13 and up use it. Their is like a safety indicator thingy on it, so if you are holding it the wrong way it doesn&#x27;t light up or anything... The only way I can see if their getting burnt, is if their pushing down real hard, but all you do is gently glide it over your skin, and your fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No! No! doesn&#x27;t work on your armpits, so don&#x27;t try... well some of you may be more successful... I couldn&#x27;t get it to work though. However, I got great results with my legs though :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd time using it - The first time it didn&#x27;t get the stubborn hairs, but my hairs were real long... anyways, put the cream on yesterday and then started again today... after applying just a tiny bit of pressure, it removed the stubborn hairs. So, I&#x27;m finishing up with the stubborn hairs today, then I will get back to you in 2-4 weeks depending how long it takes for the hairs to grow back&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i just figured out how to use it on your arm pits... you have to go up and down not over or across like I was doing.</li>
            <li> I have the pink cordless 8800 device. It is safe on darker skin. So If I have a the patience to see results, it is worth a try. A harvard dermatologist doc said never user laser on the face is you have tan skin.I have a lot of coarse wavy hair and Asian tan skin.. Waxing caused ingrowns and shaving would be a grind. After careful consideration, I am trying this tool. My goal is to go hairless at least for a month. Asking too much?&lt;br /&gt;*****************&lt;br /&gt;Week 1- I start on my arms and legs.First, I wash my arms and legs with soap and water and dry. I glide the device over my stubble. It takes about 1 hour - 3x a week right now. No PAIN!!! but a lot of burnt hair smell. Takes a little practice Always glide off and lift off the skin. Never stop on the skin or you may get a mild burn. Nothing major. And go over hairs in opposite directions of growth a few times.I notice the result is like a smooth shave. The tool burns the surface hair and weakens the hair root below. My arm hair looks smoother than the legs since my hair texture is less coarse. And it takes less time.&lt;br /&gt;**********************&lt;br /&gt;Week 2 - 5 - arms are still smooth and there is less hair to clear. Still 3x a week and 1/2-1hr each session. Tried to do the chin but I slightly cinched the skin. The unit jumps around the chin area. I will not attempt my chin or face since I scar easy. Sticking to threading or my epicure/bellabe spring for my curves on the chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week 6 - need replacement cartridge. It finally broke. I bought a bunch. Legs have 25 percent less hair and everything is finer in texture. I am getting excited to see what happens in another month. I use a hair cream remover once in a while to remove what is left over when I have a event. I notice very smooth and even baby like skin. The hair is thinner and the hair folicals are smaller.I don&#x27;t recommend shaving the stragglers. It makes the hair coarser. And as the hair gets finer, the device works better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall- I use the highest setting on my arms and legs. It does not get all hairs everytime. My arms stay clean for a month. My legs is about 4 days. Better than every other day. 25%reduction overall for me and patches are hairless for months. Used it on my teen daughter&#x27;s legs. Hair did not come back for a month. This product is great for virgin and fine hair.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend was super excited to try this though I had read mixed reviews.  She tried it a couple of times but after it burnt her twice - we boxed it up and sent it back.  Really sad as we have seen some reviews where people love it.</li>
            <li> I have been using no no for more than 5 months and only for my facial hair...  It does not do the job..</li>
            <li> I admit that I probably was LESS skeptical about this product as most before purchasing because I have tried a variety of different hair removal methods and I know that nothing is 100% perfect. I waited a few years to purchase this item because the original model was not recommended for use on the face and that is what I wanted it for. I finally got around to purchasing one in January 2012 and I have to say that I am very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little background about myself: I am in my late thirties, half Armenian, and have excess hair on my face and arms that make me feel self-conscious. My face has a range of black \\&quot;stumps\\&quot; from years of plucking my chin to more fine and lightly colored fuzz on my cheeks. The hair is pretty much everywhere, including my female sideburns. Gross, I know. The hair on my arms is dark brown, long, and thick. I have fair, olive-toned skin so everything shows up on it. I am good at following skin care and other beauty regimens but sometimes I get lazy and slack off. I spend a moderate amount of money on my physical appearance but nothing over the top...I use a combination of drugstore and \\&quot;prestige\\&quot; brand cosmetics and such. I would consider myself to be a medium-high maintenance type of girl and a bit of a product junkie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the product. I found it fairly easy to use and I have not had a lot of problems burns or with the light turning off while in use like many have said, maybe it is the shape of my face? I don&#x27;t know. I almost always use the wide heat blade, even above my lip. It does stink when you use it, hell yes, but I light a candle or my Lampberger and go on with my life. The nono works best on my face and it has been a bit of miracle worker for me. I have noticed a slow reduction of regrowth but the fact that thing gets rid of the hair without leaving a bunch of little red pluck spots is the real clincher for me. I have to use it every other day but it still takes me less time to nono and buff than it does to pluck. I love the fact that I am done with fuzz on my cheeks and sideburns and my makeup goes on so much nicer now. I do have to come in a get a few black stumps from my chin now and then, especially if I know I am going to be out in the sun with other people.&lt;br /&gt;I have also used it on my arms and I have noticed a reduction in regrowth there as well, but it takes so damn long to do. I still do use it on my arms occasionally but usually get lazy and buzz over them with the shaver attachment on my Panasonic epilator. I have not even bothered to try the nono on my legs because it would take an eternity...but that is why I have an epilator and razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very happy with this product but I don&#x27;t think it is for everybody. It is expensive and if you are not that hairy I wouldn&#x27;t bother. However, if you have a really hairy face this thing ROCKS as long as you understand that it is not going to get rid of all of your hair after a few uses. If you are like me just knowing that there is something to help this much is comforting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other unexpected bonus is that this thing fries off skin tags! I discovered this by accident but I am sure glad I did. Oh yeah, and it is cordless and rechargeable to you can take it camping or whatever. And no, I do not work for the company. I am just a hairy Armenian girl looking for some relief : )</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product... I received a faulty unit that will not hold a charge the manufacture will not do anything to help  because I bought it from Amazon. Reall? It&#x27;s over 200 dollars again save your money or just put a match to it you will regret buying this please believe me. If the manufacturer won&#x27;t stand behind their product who will?</li>
            <li> First of all I want to say I am a guy.  I shave two to three times a day to keep my face and neck smooth.  I do not like to have any facial or neck hair to it&#x27;s important for me to be as smooth as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned the No! No! hair removal system for 11 months.  The first 5 months I used it as directed and saw little difference.  The last 6 months I have used this EVERDAY on my face and neck and other then some burning hair no difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not used the capislow because it just smells and I do not like it.  So if the No! No! is relying you use both the thermicon device and the hair retarder it fails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this device trully worked I&#x27;d surely see less hair on my face and neck by now.  Instead I still get 12&#x27;o clock shadow and 5&#x27;o clock shadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recently purchased a home laser system and will do a review on it later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The No! No!  is junk do not waste you money, spend a few more dollars and get at least a 20x hair or more removal system.</li>
            <li> After using this product for two years, I&#x27;ve had no results and it does hurt and has burned me a number of times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a Tria 4x and have had stunningly good results in just two days! I&#x27;m 100% happy with the Tria 4x!</li>
            <li> Hope this review can help shed some light for those who are considering in purchasing a no-no. I&#x27;m sure many people are skeptical about the no-no due to the large number of negative reviews, including this one. I wanted to purchase a no-no, but I had several questions (or concerns) that I wanted answers to first before dropping $270.00. I visited their website and filled out the contact form with a barrage of questions...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s are some of the questions I asked:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;1. Not really a questions, but I wanted their response or statement to the numerous complaints about the no-no breaking within weeks or a few months. (Is it strategically designed to &#x27;conveniently&#x27; malfunction after the 60-day guarantee expires??)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Is it true that certain models have a higher rate of failure?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Why such a limited warranty? $270.00 is not cheap. If it breaks after the 60-days guarantee, am I left with a $270.00 paperweight?  What will the company do to help its customers?&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One week later and still no reply.  So, taking matters into my own hand, I called their 888 customer service number. I didn&#x27;t catch his name, but his extension# is 39. He didn&#x27;t have clear or concise answers for any of my questions.  Or maybe, he was not allowed to answer them... His answers read like a script.  He tried to dodge the 3rd questions above, because if he had answered, it would have painted a negative picture of their company. He abruptly cut me off and said, \\&quot;thanks for calling, have a good day,\\&quot; and hung up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are more details of the conversation between me and the customer service rep.  In follow-up to the questions above:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;1. He says he has no knowledge of any negative consumer reviews of no-no. (Surprise surprise, right?) According to him, all negative reviewers had unrealistic expectations of the no-no because they didn&#x27;t see immediate results after the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Well...that was not my concern at all. I KNOW patience is required to see results. Actually, I believe it will do what it&#x27;s advertised to do.  My concern is the large number of defective no-no&#x27;s being returned or replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As for the 60-days guarantee? He did offer some clarification on this. Yes, there is a 60-days guarantee where you can try no-no for free, and if you don&#x27;t like it, you can send it back, no questions asked. If you purchase the no-no after the 60-days guarantee is over, they now have EXTENDED the warranty to **2 YEARS**. If you get a replacement for a defective device, it does NOT reset the warranty clock. (Although, I&#x27;ve seen a couple of reviews where they&#x27;ve been able to get their warranty got extended because of multiple defective devices and replacements.) I brought this up to the customer service rep, and he says they don&#x27;t do this...so just be aware...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. So, do some models break more than others? One reviewer called customer service for a 3rd no-no replacement. The representative suggested to her to get the black no-no (no-no for men) as those rarely got returned. (hmm...so...is this an indication that there *is* an issue of defective no-no&#x27;s being returned...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I shared this reviewer&#x27;s experience with the representative I was speaking to, and he doesn&#x27;t basically called this reviewer a LIAR. Representatives will not divulge that kind of information. Sure. As for the no-no for men and no-no for women, he said the only difference between the two are the colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Limited warranty... the rep completely went off on a tangent when I brought up this subject. He started reading a script and tried to get me to jump aboard and take advantage of their special promotion...\\&quot;get 1 no-no today, get a second no-no for only $199.99...\\&quot; W-O-W. Ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I kept pressing my questions/concerns about AFTER the 2-year warranty. Customers can get as manyreplacements as needed during the 2-year warranty period, but if they keep receiving defective device that break in a matter of weeks/months, what happens then? Are we just SOL? The representative turned into a broken record and kept going back to case scenarios within 2-year warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;My final question to him: \\&quot;If you (the customer service representative) review an account history of a customer, and you see that they have gone through multiple no-no replacements over a 2-year period (let&#x27;s say 5...and that&#x27;s being generous), you would really offer no assistance to the customer once their 2-year warranty expires?\\&quot; He didn&#x27;t reply yes or no, only that they cannot replace no-no&#x27;s after the 2-years are up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Last thing I said to him before he hung up on me: It&#x27;s not that customers give up on your product, it&#x27;s your company that&#x27;s giving up on your customers.&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer loyalty?  Doesn&#x27;t exist here.  They don&#x27;t care. They&#x27;ll leave you high and dry...with a $270.00 paperweight...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: This doesn&#x27;t feel right at all to me. I&#x27;ve concluded that Radiancy does not fully stand behind the quality of their products. They know it will break over time. In fact, the representative (Mr. Extension #39)  mentioned that there are logged \\&quot;batches\\&quot; of no-no&#x27;s that are known to be defective. Something else to be aware of.  WILL YOU BE ONE OF THE UNLUCKY ONES?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure, given time and patience, no-no will do what is promised in their advertisement. However, it&#x27;s not worth the money, time, and frustration.  Don&#x27;t invest in something that has a track record of breaking over short amount of time. How many replacements will you put up with before calling it quits? Ask yourself these questions before you decide to buy. Think it over...seriously.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s easy to use and there is less hair after each use.  It&#x27;s also easy to care for and stores or travels well.</li>
            <li> This product is a dud, does not work, at least not on darker hair. I am of Indian ehtnicity and found that this device is a blatant lie that I fell for on HSN. It burns the hair off and they expect you to use the hair growth inhibitor cream and sandpaper like buffer after. Hmm if the product does what they claim WHY would we need to follow up with these 2 steps??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually wondered and asked the sales person if this device is only for light/blonde hair and they told me it&#x27;s for all hair types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took SEVERAL passes over the hair on my leg to get them singed off. Of course the thermicon head runs out in about 4 weeks. Then you need to buy more..what a scam.&lt;br /&gt;It did remove my arm hair a little easier than my leg hair but gave me ingrown hair near the elbows.&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE DO NOT BUY if you have dark hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy and I&#x27;m furry.&lt;br /&gt;As in wookie furry.&lt;br /&gt;Shaving stinks, when it grows back the itch is so bad I could claw myself bloody.&lt;br /&gt;Waxing and epilating scare me so I decided to try this.&lt;br /&gt;Bad idea.&lt;br /&gt;It burns your hair...that&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy my smoke alarm didn&#x27;t go off.&lt;br /&gt;But did it work?&lt;br /&gt;No.&lt;br /&gt;I still look like Chewbacca.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended....?...no.&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll try a man groomer next.&lt;br /&gt;No no, suck,suck.</li>
            <li> Painless? NO! Hair removal? NO! Besides not working half the time, this burned my face and DID NOT remove any hair. What a complete and total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I bought the nono about three months ago, and it&#x27;s working great. At first I was disappointed in the results, because I thought it would be immediate. Well, I kept up at it, about 5 times a week, and the hair on my arms is pretty much gone. What does come back is much thinner. It&#x27;s taking much longer for the results to be seen on my legs, but it&#x27;s definitely working on the bikini line. All in all, as long as you have the patience and dedication to actually let this thing work, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> I bought my NoNo a year ago (should have returned it before after the first 3 uses) and it&#x27;s all talk and no results.  The NoNo burns the hair but doesn&#x27;t remove it, and the buffing pad that is supposed to removed the &#x27;crystallized&#x27; hairs just irritated my skin and did not remove the hair.  I was left with charred, much more obvious, burnt smelling hair on my face which I than had to use a cream hair remover on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money this product is an absolute No No!!</li>
            <li> I saw this product on an infomercial and it sounded great.  I was considering giving it a try but decided to research it on the internet. The only place I found any meaningful reviews is on Amazon.  After reading  the reviews, I don&#x27;t understand why anyone would buy this product, thanks Amazon customers.  The old saying &amp;#34; if it sounds to good to be true, it probably is&amp;#34; seems appropriate here.  The internet and Amazon are amazing, thanks!</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work. I fell for it, sadly. Unlike a lot of the reviewers, my unit is still working after 6 months of continous use, surprisingly. What has not happened is any slowing down in the growth of my hair. I faithfully used this on my ape arms for 6 months twice weekly and then took a break to see what happened. Everything, and I do mean everything, came right back. So, I&#x27;ve essentially been spending 45 minutes twice weekly to shave my arms (which takes about 5 minutes using a razor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not use the No!No! on my face as it burned me every time I tried. My unit was defective in the fact that the temperature gauge did not work. It self-adjusts to the temperature it wants to be. I would set it on low for my face, and it immediately sets resets to high. If I tried to do coarser hair, like my bikini-line, for some reason, it goes to low? No amount of cajoling on my part will make the temperature setting work. For my arms, it goes up and down as it pleases. I purchased this from one of the home shopping networks, and unfortunately let it sit around for more than 60 days before I started using it, so I could not return it. I have wasted my money, so I feel my only recourse is to warn others not to waste their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to do my legs with this before I figured out it was not going to work. It was far too time consuming, taking upwards of an hour per leg since I have coarse, hairy legs like a guy (TMI!) I had hoped to do this all winter, and start the summer with smooth skin, but it was far too much work. The unit left far too much stubble even when I was still shaving my legs on a regular basis, took forever, kept deciding my legs only needed the low temperature setting (yeah, right!) and just generally stunk up the room, eliciting complaints from my spouse and child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not use the creams due to parabens, they went right in the trash. I didn&#x27;t mind the buffers, but don&#x27;t think they did all that much. The thermicon tips lasted a couple of months on my arms before needing replacement, and because I was unable to use the facial tips without burning myself, I still have those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just say no. No!n tips lasted a couple of months on my arms before needing replacement, and because I was unable to use the facial tips without burning myself, I still have those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just say no. No!</li>
            <li> It does not remove most of the hair and I have used it religiously for 4 months now. Instead I see wrinkles forming on my upper lip. WRINKLES!!!!! I am positive they were not there when this process began.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just threw 270 bucks in the toilet but I have an idea. I am going to contact the BBB for misrepresentation and I am also going to complain to my attorney general. We need to complain in order to stop this horrible thing from being sold to more women. Maybe we can also get our money back. It is baloney.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WRINKLES!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Purchased this product as a gift for my sister.  Paid extra to have it delivered early but still took four days.  We read directions and could not get it to work correctly.  Called number and was advised by representative that have to shave legs and let hair grow to a stubble before product would work the way it should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advised representative this was not the way the product was advertized and why would anyone buy this product if you have to shave legs before using it.  Was given a number to call to get directions on how to return and it took three days to get through to that number. Return product and was advised monies would be credited to my credit card within seven days.  It is now 46 days later and I am still awaiting credit.</li>
            <li> Once you get the technique down its fab. Plus the people at customer service are always up for giving advice if you&#x27;re struggling!&lt;br /&gt;Bought one for my sis an she couldn&#x27;t be happier :-)</li>
            <li> Did not work!  This product does not rate at all.  Do not purchase!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife for Christmas. It worked on fine hair if she went over the same area several times. However, on the more coarse hair on the legs it did not work at all. After a few weeks it began to seize after a few strokes and after a month it stopped working all together. Even the fine hair removal left stubble. she may as well not used it and just bought a buffer instead. hair is not removed down to the roots, It is just singed on the end. I would not recommend buying this.</li>
            <li> not work save u t mony i got cut and burn on my face stupid dos not do any diffrent</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this because usually I am hesitant to try anything that is from an infomercial.  I received it, charged and used it right away.  Everyone is right, it&#x27;s the smell of burning hair, which essentially is all it&#x27;s good for.  To burn your hair.  This thing is awful.  It did absolutely nothing for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it for almost the full trial time and then called to send it back.  They tried and tried to convince me to keep it, telling me maybe I hadn&#x27;t used it right???  I finally told her, look just send me my money back, it doesn&#x27;t work.  Hesitantly, she did, but it reminded me why I hate infomercials.</li>
            <li> Like everyone else, I was excited to try this.  I have blonde hair and my facial hair is very fine.  I tried it, got the hang of it and was very disappointed in the lack of results.  My fine peach fuzz is now a blonde stubble.  Using it on the bikini line is a joke.  I tried it one last time today. I used the highest setting and made numerous passes over my face.  I did not burn myself but the results were terrible again.  Sending it back today</li>
            <li> Please do NOT waste your money on this piece of junk.  It does not work and the company refuses to honor warranty.  We had to turn them into the Better Business Bureau after months of being ignored.  The replacement unit is far worse than the original.  The tips burn out instantly and are expensive.  I wish there were a minus zero rating for this product and this company.</li>
            <li> It worked great on my face. I needed it because I am on medicine that one of the side effects causes facial hair (awesome right).&lt;br /&gt;My mom purchased this for me. I used it the first time it did make me jump because on the video the lady does it with such ease. They do say in the instruction manual that you have to make sure you hold it correctly for it to work and at first it will take you a couple of tries to get used to it, which for me it did. I&#x27;m not giving it all five stars because I think it&#x27;s really expensive and they could do better on the instructional DVD. Show the wrong way to use it and the right way to use it instead of having a model on the DVD looking perfect.  As for the burnt hair smell they tell you to light a candle. It is really painless it does the job it does not burn your skin.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t work as described I would recommend to anybody the biggest waste of money ever horrible I mean I didn&#x27;t get any results at all</li>
            <li> Instructions are in foreign language.  Not sure how it works.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong - but it doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> I watched a youtube video of a girl doing this and she said the burning hair smell smelled terrible and that it didn&#x27;t work that well at all I mean after like 15 times over the same spot it kinda worked this is a terrible product</li>
            <li> This seriously works people! My husband got this for me as a bday gift. I tried it out and thought ... ok it works but you do have to go over quite a few times to totally remove the hair. (Used on side burns) Directions says to use every 2nd day for 1 month and then after you only need to use it every 5-6 weeks. It is a process but it seriously works! I can go six weeks without redoing it. It has been a year and I do not regret it! The embarrassing facial hair is gone without constant waxing that lasts half that time! I do need replacement tips and and buffing pads which are quite pricey! about $50.</li>
            <li> Very time consuming , not like  shaving or waxing. Took 30 minutes to do the back of my husbands neck.</li>
            <li> Never worked. And it cut my leg.</li>
            <li> have had a lot of trouble with this</li>
            <li> IT TOOK SOME TIME AND EFFORT BUT I BARELY HAVE TO REMOVE HAIR ANYMORE!  I USED MY NONO FOR LIKE 3 MONTHS 3 TIMES A WEEK AND NOW I ONLY HAVE TO USE IT LIKE EVERY OTHER MONTH.  IT TAKES A LOT OF DEDICATION BUT IT IS SOOOOOO WORTH IT IN THE END!</li>
            <li> I got my no no and I love it what can I say but every one should have it The seller I would use again the people were very nice thank you</li>
            <li> My Mom owns the no no hair series and it&#x27;s okay she&#x27;s been using it for a while and her hair is slowing growth. She hasn&#x27;t had hair on her upper lip for a couple months now. Still some where it is thicker but it is not growing back as fast and it is getting softer with each use. Now I use the pro series and I have to say I like it better than the hair series because I have some coarse hair on my chin and it gets it better then the hair series. Both the hair and pro series use the same tips so if you own this one and want to upgrade to the pro you don&#x27;t have to buy more tips right away. It&#x27;s a big plus considering the cost of refill tips. My mom after trying out my pro with her tips wants to upgrade to the pro. If you have thick hair I&#x27;d suggest the pro 5 series the hair is good for thinner and less coarse hair. It still works on it but it takes longer and the longer you have to use your tip per session the quicker it burns out. The pro series has two tips the one like the hair only it has better control it can work hotter without burning you, still work as well, get as close and last as long (unless it is a defective wire) and the then you have the pro 5 which is made for thicker coarse hair and instead of just 3 settings it has 4. The regular pro works great for me, but for my friend has thick dark coarse hair on her legs, almost like a mans beard on her legs she needs the pro 5 series and she says that it works better than razors for her it just takes longer.&lt;br /&gt;How this works is simple the tip has a little wire that heats up and burns your hair, yes you get a burnt hair smell from it and lets you know it is working. It even tells you so in the instructions so why people are complaining about it I don&#x27;t know. It&#x27;s kind of a duh your burning the hair did you expect it to smell like roses even though they tell you it burns the hair and you&#x27;re going to smell burnt hair, that&#x27;s what tells you it&#x27;s working. If you leave it like that you are going to be walking around smelling like you just walked out of a fire so you buff it. The buffer will just take off the burnt part of the hair if you go over it lightly once and leave you with annoying stubble. Go over it a few times and your legs will be smooth. The buffer is like an extra fine sandpaper and it doesn&#x27;t hurt If you have ever used a buffer instead of a razor you&#x27;ll know what you are doing, if you haven&#x27;t the videos don&#x27;t really explain it too well and you will be left with a lot of stubble like you see a lot of people complaining about.&lt;br /&gt;How to use the buffer properly press lightly and go small circular motions in a straight line up and down for like legs or side to side for like the jaw line on your face, then go back in the opposite direction rotating in the opposite direction as well so if you were going clockwise down your leg from the knee to the ankle you would go counter clockwise up your leg from the ankle to the knee. Do this until it is smooth, you may need to wipe away the dried skin and hair off the buffer and where you are doing so that it works better and faster. Then you can rinse off your legs and put on your capi slow lotion then go.&lt;br /&gt;It does take longer than shaving with a razor but it lasts longer than a razor and your legs feel smoother and not only does it grow slower the more you use it, as long as you use the lotion with capi slow, your hair gets softer as it goes. It takes longer when you are first learning to use and it gets quicker the more you use it one because your hair is less and thinner and two because you&#x27;ve learned the perfect speed and you are no longer going too fast so that it is not getting as much and having to go over it several time or going too slow and it stopping and having to start a little farther back so it gets all of it. Don&#x27;t worry it doesn&#x27;t take long to master it&#x27;s kind of like when you first learned to shave your legs with a razor.&lt;br /&gt;Tip really long hair doesn&#x27;t do so well it takes longer to get to because the plate in front that is meant to lift the hair up so the wire can burn it ends up holding it down until the wire has past so it doesn&#x27;t burn it right away. If you can trim it before hand or shave a day or two before you use it so that your hair is no more than 1/4 inch and it will go so much faster and you won&#x27;t burn out your tip as quickly by having to use it so much just to do it. Also in all honesty their buffers are not the greatest they are done after 1 or 2 uses so I got the smooth away kit from amazon (actually when you get it it is called silky smooth but is listed as smooth away) and this works much better and lasts a lot longer. I used to use smooth away all the time instead of a razor before they stopped selling them in stores in my area. Now if you have ever used a buffer instead of a razor you know that it can be time consuming and if you do it too much your skin will be red or you can have patches of hair left but using the no no first then buffing is so much faster and so much better. I didn&#x27;t have any over buffing redness, I only had to go over it a couple times with the silky smooth instead of the normal 15 times when I don&#x27;t use the no no, I didn&#x27;t have any patches of hair left either and it is still good for a lot more uses. Their buffer was only good for one use on my legs, face, underarms and it already wasn&#x27;t working as well after doing my legs before I even did anything else. Also the no no on it&#x27;s own will not slow your hair growth. I had a couple friends try it and they complained that their hair was still thick and needed to use it every 3 days after 3 months. You need the lotion with capi slow  that is what slows the hair growth and thins it. Will it work for everyone probably not, but it has worked for me and I only used it once and my hair is already softer and not growing in as fast as when I was using tweezers and razors.&lt;br /&gt;Customer Service  My mom and I both bought ours from No No and she had to call No No because her No No Hair was having issues with it clicking, a red light was coming on and it just was not working right. The customer service she got was less then acceptable. The person didn&#x27;t want to help her. They couldn&#x27;t tell her what was going on and didn&#x27;t go through the steps to figure out if it was a defect in the device or just the tip needing to be changed. When she got her No No Hair it was still new on the market and they didn&#x27;t explain that the lights change from the setting to the tip ware and if you went too slow it wouldn&#x27;t work (it&#x27;s a safety to keep you from burning yourself because you are in one place for too long) and if you press too hard it wouldn&#x27;t work (because the wheel is not spinning at the proper speed and sticking and cause you to burn yourself so it is suppose to shut off) and the red light will come on when the tip goes bad (or if there is another device issue). Now my mother is a push over she doesn&#x27;t follow through on things if someone says they are going to give her something and she pays for it and doesn&#x27;t get it she won&#x27;t call them back to say hey where is it she just waits and if she gets bad customer service reps (every company has them) she won&#x27;t call back to get someone else and get it taken care of properly and if they don&#x27;t respond to her email she doesn&#x27;t try again she just gets mad and gives up. So I had to call no no again and say what is going on I&#x27;m not happy my mother is now out of her warranty because your rep wouldn&#x27;t help her and she couldn&#x27;t get it fixed or exchange it and the rep didn&#x27;t know what was wrong with it. Well turns out all she needed was a new tip and the rep I got was great, helpful, knew what they were talking about and no problems. So I was a bit afraid to order my No No Pro, because a lot of people complained they got the same bad customer service my mom did and very few people gave good rating on customer service, but I went ahead and did it anyway because I liked what I was seeing happen when with my mom using hers. I gotit two weeks ago and the tip was defective when I put it in the tip light was 1 bar then went to 3 so I figured it was just the way it worked then I used it again for the second time ever today it started out at 3 then went 1 then 3 then 1 then 3 and then the wire snapped. I didn&#x27;t even finsh 1 leg. So running around with 3/4 of a leg done and the other one not touched at all I called talked to a no no rep. I now have a new one of each size tip being sent out to me. no issues, no hassle, he didn&#x27;t try to blame me. I even asked if it was something I did and he reassured me it wasn&#x27;t my fault. It will be here in 7-10 days, then I send them back the bad one in the same box all paid for and I just need to let them know when I get it because it resets my warranty for another 60 days from that day and it gives me 10 days from the day I get them for it to get back to them.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for something as quick as shaving, painless, doesn&#x27;t smell, you can do at home and gives long lasing results, slows hair growth and thins it you&#x27;re out of luck. There is no such thing on the market at this time, but if you are willing to spend the time to use it correctly and buff while say watching TV on the couch before bed and you don&#x27;t mind the burnt hair smell or can use incense to mask it then go for it. I suggest if you have fine hair try their buffers to see how well they work for you if you have thick or coarse hair get you a different buffer system to like I did and use their buffers to polish up after you finish buffing with the other one.having issues with it clicking, a red light was coming on and it just was not working right.

            <li> this thing is a USELESS piece of junk!  and do not even think you will get your money back-you won&#x27;t.  It does not work at all.</li>
            <li> Disappointment. The heads wear out so quickly and my hair isn&#x27;t even that corse or thick. Stinks too. Don&#x27;t feel it was worth the time or money.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t even deserve 1 star. I couldn&#x27;t get my money back in tears by the disappointment. I should known. This is a useless toy!! It does nothing at all! I thought &amp;#34;maybe it&#x27;ll work if I keep using it.&amp;#34; Nothing!  Waste of time. Waste of money!</li>
            <li> It does not work. And the seller was very careless in returning my money when I expressed how it didn&#x27;t work! All they did was offer to exchange it for a new one. But why would I want another of the same product that doesn&#x27;t work? DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product,,  I got results after the first use. Hair grows back thinner and slower.&lt;br /&gt;It works best on thin hair areas like arms and facial hair.  Thick hair areas takes like legs; it will will take a while but it does work.&lt;br /&gt;Problems:&lt;br /&gt;- VERY time consuming but in the long run its definitely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t leave you all hairless and smooth like how they show in the video, definitely need to use something else along with it at first like an epilator or an electric shaver ( I personally use an electric shaver). I can be used alone on places with thin hair like arms and facial hair. I don&#x27;t recommend using regular razor because hair grows back thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Some of the reviews I read, they said it leaves burn marks on face and nick. I use the lowest level/speed ( they are 3 speeds) when I use the lowest setting on face I haven&#x27;t experienced any burns or anything.</li>
            <li> I recieved my no no on a friday and began to use it around 8pm, tried it on a few different places, it worked well. Saturday I skipped it. Sunday night, decided I was excited, used it for a half an hour and the tip was dead. Ridiculous! For almost 300 dollars the fact that the tip didn&#x27;t even last a week is insanity! I will be returning this and I urge others to not waste time or money on no!no!...!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried many methods for hair removal and the No No Hair removal was the least useful and effective method. I actually was patient and gave it a few months only to see absoloutely no result. I had lost most of my hair using IPL machine (VISS) and since I stopped using that device to give No NO a try, I noticed getting more hair. I stopped using my NO NO and went back to my VISS which gives great results but is more painful and time consuming to use. I want results so I am totally okay with that. I wouldn&#x27;t say NO NO is a bad product but just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I find it difficult to use and it does not perform its job of hair removal, I&#x27;m terribly disappointed in its functions, the item was received from a shipper in Israel, I would not recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> I love nono.  It works great. I would recommend this product to anyone. I got one for my daughter and she also loves it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I read the reviews prior to purchasing.  I almost bought it but was too scared b/c of all of the horror stories of similar past products burning people.  This product seems like this is more of the same.  I can&#x27;t imagine having burns or scars on my body/face -- aging is bad enough!  Thank you for the honest reviews.  I will stick with shaving!!  (I&#x27;m curious as to how this passed FDA inspection, considering the harm it causes the average user.)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as advertised. Very disappointed in it. It will burn some of the unwanted hair off but not as stated. Neither myself nor my daughter found that it worked as advertised.</li>
            <li> I love my no no!!! I have this for two years now. Some people said it burned theirs face&#x27;s.  Because they had the setting too high. It take times before you see results. I have gotten so many compliments on my face. I have been asked how I got that  glow. Your skin looks so nice. I would not be without it. IT IS WELL WORTH THE MONEY!!</li>
            <li> Nice, I like the Nono it does what it says it does...</li>
            <li> I bought this device about a year ago and used it as directed for about 3 months. It is difficult and time consuming to use but, I persisted hoping to get results. It worked to remove the hair on my arms but did not work at all on my legs where I have coarser hair. As far as their claims about less hair coming back and eventually stopping, they are absolutely untrue. The same amount of hair remains on my arms. The product is also poorly made and can easily cause burns. The device stopped working completely in about 8 weeks and I had to send it back for replacement. They made me pay for shipping their defective product back to them. The one I received in return was refurbished and they said that the warranty would not be extended to year from the replacement date and the original date of purchase still determined to end of the one year warranty. Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> NO NO HAIR REMOVAL KIT IS a total rip off and  WOW, WHAT false adveritising! i was so excited WHEN I SAW THIS AND ORDERED IT RIGHT AWAY, ONCE I GOT IT, I WAS SO EXCITED AND USED IT AS SOON AS IT WAS DONE CHARGING, I SMELL BURNT HAIR, BUT MY HAIR IS STILL THERE, YOUR LEFT WITH NOTICEABLE STUBBLES. ONLY THE TIPS GET BURNED OFF!!! HOW CAN WOMEN GO OUT WITH STUBBLES??? STUBBLES that never goes away and it does not slow or remove permenantly. AT FIRST I THOUGHT I WAS MISTAKEN, SO I called them and asked about the results thinking i must be doing something wrong, BECAUSE IT&#x27;S WAY TOO DIFFERENT FROM THE ADVERTISEMENT, but they said it was normal and try IT for 6 weeks, AND I WILL SEE BETTER RESULTS. SO I tried for 6 weeks and it still did not work, IT JUST TAKES LONG TIME, IT&#x27;S HOT AND MAKES MY SKIN ALL RED AND I DO NOT HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN!! WHEN THE RESULTS, OR NO RESULTS SHOULD I SAY WAS CONFIRMED,I tried to return at which point they said I couldn&#x27;t because I had it few days over 6 weeks since they sent it to me. I paid $300 dollars for this stupid device i never use AND THAT DOES NOT WORK AT ALL!!! I can&#x27;t believe they can advertise like that, it should be illegal to advertise such false statements!!! I FEEL TOTALLY BETRAYED AND RIPPED OFF!! THIS COMPANY SHOULD GO BANKRUPT AND PAY FOR ALL THE STRESS IT HAS CAUSED ME IN THE LAST 7 WEEKS!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THEY ALSO HAVE MANY DIFFERENT ADS SELLING THIS SAME PRODUCT, ON SOME THEY SAY YOU CAN DO BIKINI AREA, FACE, ETC...BUT WHEN YOU GET THE PRODUCT, IT SAYS NOT TO USE IN THOSE AREA&#x27;S??? MAKE UP YOUR MIND? CAN WE OR CAN&#x27;T WE?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT UNLESS YOU WANT TO PAY ALOT FOR SOMETHING THAT DON&#x27;T WORK!</li>
            <li> This is the worst product on the market....it burned and scared my skin. They lie because they tell you no more mustash on the infocommerical yet when you get it it state not to use it there. I paid almost the original price because they sent it to collection agency but I should be sueing them for the scare and burn and they should be paying me. False advertisment and false claims so you buy this product, however NO NO don&#x27;t do it. As far as it removing the hair permanently perhaps if you are burned and scared no hair is going to grow there. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY THIS IS A SCAM AND IF THERE IS A CLASS LAWSUIT PLEASE LET ME KNOW I HAVE THE SCAR ON MY LIP TO PROVE IT. AND BY THE WAY I RATE THIS PROCUCT NEGATIVE -&lt;100&gt; STARS. I HATE IT* YES YES</li>
            <li> I was highly surprised to receive it before the date of arrival. The product works wonderful brand spanking new they also sent me trial sizes of their products are Argan oil which is a wonderful product I plan on buying in the future.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and everything I expected!</li>
            <li> I really think this was a waste of money. All it does is burn the hair off, along with burning your skin here and there. I would much rather stick with a razor! I wish I would have returned this, but I wanted to try it a couple of times first to see if I was using it wrong. This thing sucks!</li>
            <li> Wife didn&#x27;t like it.  It didn&#x27;t do the job she thought it should do so she wnt back to shaving.</li>
            <li> I have had the No No for 1 year and although it took some getting use to it and really following directions, I love it.  I use it on all hair, legs, arms, underarms, facial etc.  I have gone from shaving twice to 3 times a week to now less than once a month.  You have to take it slow and smooth.  At first I tried to use like a shaver - it isn&#x27;t.  Then it was jerky which is wrong also.  But with time it gets to the slow and smooth which is the correct way and how the instructions say must be used to work.&lt;br /&gt;I think all these reviews that say it doesn&#x27;t work are people who aren&#x27;t using it correctly.&lt;br /&gt;There are things you need to know about it to be prepared.  The smell from your burned off hair will through you (but that means it is being done right). Nothing that the lotion and buffer after use won&#x27;t eliminate.&lt;br /&gt;Consistency is also critical - don&#x27;t get frustrated just keep at it and it is wonderful.  You can&#x27;t imagine how nice it is to not have to worry about shaving all the time.  I live in Florida where shorts and bathing suits are our basic clothing.  I can through them on and not have to worry about hair issues.&lt;br /&gt;For those doubters out there - I almost never review a product unless it is bad.  Which is probably like most of us but I suggested this as a gift to my brother-in-law for my sister for Christmas and because of the reviews he hesitated.&lt;br /&gt;Luckily for my sister he listened to me.  I spent a few minutes with her and told her how to use it and she is already saying good things in the last 2 1/2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;So bottom line have patience and follow their directions and you will get a great product.</li>
            <li> I had a terrible experience.  Customer service is nonexistent.  After receiving the product I looked at all the parts but decided this wasn&#x27;t for me.  I carefully repackaged it according to the instructions.  A refund was never received.  Beware of this product and the manufacturer!!!</li>
            <li> Not sure about this it didn&#x27;t take the hair off easy and when it did it seems like it just burn it. Waiting to see if it grows right back or if it removed it.</li>
            <li> I never review anything but, this thing is a waste of money!&lt;br /&gt; I bought this last year and later returned it.  It works on fine facial hair, but if you want to use it on thicker hair, it will take you forever to remove any hair, and is leaves a lot of hair behind.  I had to go over the same area several times and it still would not remove all the hair.  Also, the hair grows back just as it would any other way of hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money, and especially your time in hair removal.</li>
            <li> So far I amq disappointed.  Does not remove hair well on face.</li>
            <li> This product sucks majorly.  It might \\&quot;look like\\&quot; your legs are touchably soft, but when you touch them they are still prickly.  For what this product does it isn&#x27;t worth the money.  Razors do better work than this thing.  It says in fine print that it may take up to six months for results, well I&#x27;m here to tell you that there is no difference.  This product is an absolute waste of money!  The ony reason they tell you to wait six months is because you can&#x27;t return it after six months!</li>
            <li> I bought this 2 years ago and really gave it a good college try.  It did not lighten my under chin hair growth AT ALL and the smell from the burnt hair really limited when I could use it.  (I didn&#x27;t want to gross out my husband with the smell.)  I have very fair skin and thick thick dark hair under my arms, under my chin and various other areas.  I bought this specifically for under my chin and neck.  I used it over and over, bought new cartridges, etc and it hasn&#x27;t helped me even a little bit.  I have spent thousands of dollars on laser removal in a Drs office and I loved it.  It thinned my hair under my chin and under my arms.  (I got it under my arms because I wanted to wear sleeveless shirts and couldn&#x27;t because I always had horrible razor rash.)  It is common for me to have three hairs growing at once out of one follicle, so I was thrilled when my underarms became almost hairless before I had to quit going to the office for treatments.  I couldn&#x27;t afford to continue there, so I tried this.  It is horrible and I will be giving it to my 14 yo daughter whose hair is sparse and blond…  The only hair I think this will work on.  If she wants to use it fine, if not, I will donate it.</li>
            <li> My wife became interested in this product but was a little reluctant to spend what they ask for it; it&#x27;s rather expensive for what it does. So I bought one for her at Christmas. She has thick hair and after using it for a couple of weeks she did see satisfactory results after some trial and error. Here are some issues besides the smell and face it you&#x27;re burning hair get over it. The issue is the case. The case is small enough to fit in your purse but there is no room for the charger nor is there a compartment in which to secure the extra head, that being whichever one that&#x27;s not in use. The results of this are that on a two week trip the charger got left behind so it couldn&#x27;t be used. Then when we returned home she started using it again. Well the small head fell out of the case, no secure compartment, and fell on the floor. The dog destroyed it. Additionally had a child gotten ahold of it, it could have presented a danger. Beyond that I defy anyone to find replacement parts for this thing. Their site has no customer support other than for returns. I wrote them via their web site over two weeks ago and still haven&#x27;t heard a word from them. So don&#x27;t expect much in the way of support if you lose a part or it fails for some reason not covered under warranty. It&#x27;s a $300.00 crap shoot.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work right at all and costs a lot of money to just lie around in a drawer!!</li>
            <li> this appliance was a compete disappointment. you can smell it burning the hairs but it never get all of them so you still end up shaving or using any other  means of removing hair. If it has been a successful seller, it is because it is sold late at night on tv when people are apt to purchase anything. I was completely dissatisfied. The seller,  however, was very nice when she sold it to me!</li>
            <li> After posting my last review, I read the other reviews and learned that I never should have ordered the NONO in the first place. As I read on and realized the trouble it took to get the refund, I went right to the Better Business Bearau website(bbb.org)and filed a complaint. They got right on it and contacted the company. I received my payment the next week.</li>
            <li> This item indicates it is a hair removal system.  It really only burns the hair.  The hair grows back exactly the same as it was.  Don&#x27;t spend you money this is a waste.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste you time or your money.  I have fair skin and dark thick hair and the No No did not effectively remove the hair as the advertisements promised.  I used the No No as directed (moving the No No slowly over my leg, with the blue light lit, multiple times per session, 3 times a week for 3 months) and did not see a decrease in my hair growth.  It also does not effectively remove the hair, as a result I was left with a rough stubble on my legs.  When I called customer service, the person suggested shaving after using the No No.  Why waste time with the No No?  If there isn&#x27;t a reduction in the amount of hair on my legs and I am going to have to shave too, I&#x27;ll just shave and not waste my time with the No No.  If I want lasting results I&#x27;ll wax my leg.  $270.00 is too much to spend on a device that might work, don&#x27;t risk it!</li>
            <li> this product was a complete dissapointment not only did it not work on the peach fuzz hair it made more hair grow back that was darker and more coarse</li>
            <li> I bought this about a two years ago and I stopped using it six months after I bought it because the cartridges don&#x27;t last, they are expensive to replace and this machine isn&#x27;t as convenient as I had hoped.  I don&#x27;t consider my leg hair to be particularly thick and yet some cartridges stopped working when I wasn&#x27;t even done on one leg.  Other cartridges seem to last longer but you never know.  It is also hard to predict when the cartridge will stop working and it usually happens when you&#x27;ve done one leg but still need to do the other.  The cartridges are expensive running $30, considering they only last one go.</li>
            <li> I used the no no diligently for 3 months and didn&#x27;t see any measurabl results. For over $300 it&#x27;s a BIG waste of time and money. I can&#x60;t imagine how much money was paid to all the models and magazines for the \\&quot;rave reviews\\&quot;. Why is this company still being allowed to fleece the general public with no repercussions?</li>
            <li> Took a long time to get product.</li>
            <li> I immediately tried cancelling my order after reading poor reviews about this product. The CSR I spoke w/ told me it couldn&#x27;t be done because \\&quot;the order wasn&#x27;t in their system yet\\&quot;. I&#x27;m sure it wasn&#x27;t lie but he proceeded to ARGUE w/ me about how I shouldn&#x27;t let people (my fellow reviewers) make choices for me...we argued for about 15 min and I decided to keep it when it arrives and try it. I TRIED IT AND IT DOES NOT WORK EVEN ON THE THINEST HAIR! Maybe I wasn&#x27;t using it properly, but all in all, THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS HORRIBLE!!! I did just as the vague instructions directed me to do so, and all that happened was: even the lightest/thinest hair just burned and curled. Forget about it working in the bikini area- mind you I&#x27;d been waxing prior to using this product. I ONLY TRIED IT FOR 30 DAYS, BUT I COULDN&#x27;T TAKE IT ANYMORE. I FELT LIKE MY SKIN MY DESOLVING FROM THE SMELL OF FIRE. SAVE YOURSELF THE HASSLE AND DON&#x27;T BUY IT. OOOOOR SEE YOUR DERMATOLOGIST FOR ADVICE BEFORE BUYING IT AS IT MAY REACT DIFFERENTLY TO YOUR SKIN!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because they salesman said that my fair skin and hair made me the perfect person to use this product. I followed the instructions perfectly (which was tedious) and it didn&#x27;t help at all! It wasn&#x27;t easy to return but they eventually repaid me.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this as it does not work...I bought it with the hope of getting the few wired hairs on my chin....well after several calls as to perhaps I was not using it right they continued to assure me that with some practice it would work....I should have returned it but didn&#x27;t...it does not remove the wiry chin hairs...I still have to tweeze those...it after several swipes will kind of take off some of the softer hairs...I am very disappointed and would not recommend you spend the amount of money they want for this...cannot imagine using it on legs or underarms unless you had the entire day to work on it and then I don&#x27;t think you could remove the much hair.</li>
            <li> If I could give this product a less than one-star rating, I would.  As others have mentioned, I read the reviews on the products website before purchasing and thought this was a good product...I should have read the reviews on Amazon first.  I wanted to get it for my son, who, unfortunately, has my husbands genes when it comes to hair growth all over his body including his back.  Tried this out on both my son and my husband; used a clipper to get the hair down to the recommended length for optimal removal.  It takes forever to get any hair off; used the buffer and still no luck. No No does burn the hair (hence, the smell) but it does NOT completely remove the hair folicle, which is what it advertises. It is just too time consuming as you have to continually go over the area you are trying to remove the hair from.  My advice to future consumers...DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> I find this little thing a rip off.  It doesn&#x27;t work well at all &amp; constantly stops itself cause it over heats.</li>
            <li> I bought this in hope it would help remove facial hair. It does nothing but burn the hair and stink. It does not remove hair, no matter how often you use it. It just burns the hair at the skin level and grows back, just as fast as it did. I bought mine from the no no website and could not return it in time for my refund. DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE! It is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I always been a hairy person, thank God I at least don&#x27;t have it on my face. I got the nono aprox 30 days ago and I will say, it is too early to say &amp;#34;excellent&amp;#34;, but I admit I have noticed a reduction in volume and thickness of my hair. I am def encouraged to continue using it every 2 days for more firm results. Please don&#x27;t forget to use the nono correctly for good results. I had tried the Tria Laser in the past (almost $900 bucks), but it was too painful for me even when I was very used to waxing pain. I will say the No No! met my expectations, for its price and for the painless sensation.</li>
            <li> I hated it . It was bought for my mother in law and it did not work. So I sent it back.</li>
            <li> This is a slow working process that requires daily use. The fine hair is the first to notice and the thicker more stubborn hair I am still working on</li>
            <li> The NONO was a gift to me and I was surprised to receive it.  It works very nicely and I look forward to seeing how it continues to work in the future.</li>
            <li> did not work as expected it was waste of money and i could not return it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and it doesn’t work. I first thought she wasn’t using it correctly, so I read all the instructions and tried it myself All it does is make a funny burning smell. Useless! And the fine print on the No-No website says you have to order it directly from them under special conditions to get a refund. This is a totally worthless rip-off!</li>
            <li> First day of use and it was okay.  My mom bought it before I could research it for her.  Lot&#x27;s of negative reviews, but like all products, not everything works for everyone.  Tried it to see what everyone is fussing about and to advise my mom.  The smell of burnt hair is tolerable, and if people don&#x27;t like it, light a candle.  It was a little hard to use at first, but I know after a while I was kind of getting the hang of it.  Still left a little stubble, but instead of using the buffer pad included, I would recommend using the Sally Hansen or Nair buffer pads.  I have sensitive skin so I can&#x27;t use the lotion included with the kit, but I washed my face with Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s Deep Cleansing face wash and the chamomile, helped to calm my skin (I use it after I wax my eyebrows, and the redness is gone immediately).  If you need to use a post lotion, I would recommend an aloe based lotion.  Overall, I would try it for a few months before I made any judgements, and I would not pay full price on it just in case it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> no!no! 8800 Series Deluxe Hair Removal Kit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my Nono and thought the clicking sound meant it was working.  I too could smell the hair burning.  I had very light paech fuzz hair and it all grew back darker and thicker and longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before Nono it wasnot very noticable, now I feel like I have a beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called Nono direct and sadi there should be a humming noise.  Mine never made the noise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never buy an expensive item like this from Amazon as Nono could not help me and Amazon return policy window is way to short for an electronic.  NO ONE IS STANDING BEHIND THIS PRODUCT OR SUPPORTING when you buy from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time I will go straight to the vendor to purchase.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work  like it seen on TV</li>
            <li> For $300.00 I thought it should work. You have to keep going over and over the same area to finally get some of the hair . It leaves the stubble longer than if you shaved or waxed. What a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> What a piece of garbage!!! It&#x27;s nothing more than a piece of wire slightly raised above the skin with electrical current passing through it. It works much like an iron or heating coil from a toaster. It burns the hair hence the burning hair smell and burned skin. A class action law suit is what you all need. Wow! So much money for an inferior product. It&#x27;s not worth $10.00. Man did they see you guys coming. Try and get your money back without jumping through the hoops.  60 days and not a day late? Talk about poor customer service. The only good reviews are probably from within their own company using made up names. Hey here&#x27;s one for all of you. Try and find the address of the company. Closest I got was China. That narrows it down ehh? Haaaaaa!</li>
            <li> maybe i am not using it the right way, but removing  the little hair under my chin takes a long time and it is not a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t work well on the face. The speed has to remain steady and there simply isn&#x27;t enough surface on the face to accomplish that.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work at all.  And the burnt hair smell it terrible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed. The no no did not work like it was advertised. On the commercial it shows it being used on a man&#x27;s chest hair and it came right off. It does not work like this at all. Granted i was not dedicated to the whole everyday or otherday thing. But i was not getting it for the fact that it is &#x27;supposed&#x27; to stop or minimize hair growth. I got it because i have really sensitive skin on my legs and wanted something besides shaving. But it wouldn&#x27;t even remove the hair...at all. Even when i went over it several times! Also, it didn&#x27;t even touch the dark hairs on my face! Which was even more disappointing! Again, i have very sensitive skin and i do not want to wax or use any cream on my face! This seemed like a great solution. But IT IS NOT! The only thing it is good for is the very very very thin hairs on my face! It will not take care of dark thick hairs no matter how many times i go over it or how many times i use it!&lt;br /&gt;To sum it up...it will not work on thick dark hair on face or legs. It will only work on super thin hair...which is the only reason i gave it a 2 and not a 1. It is nice on my thin face hair and i don&#x27;t have to use anything harsh on my face. But i still have to tweeze ALL the dark hairs. Is this really worth $300 when it only does 1/5 of the work it promised to do?</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 months now, it does not work. I used it on my face and neck. It burned off some of the hair which kept growing back. I would have to go over the same spot several times for it to work, by then my skin is irritated. It caused my face to break out and my neck. I have never broken out on my neck before using this product and I&#x27;m only breaking out in the area I&#x27;m using it in on my face. Customer service wasn&#x27;t that great either. I tried to return it before my trial period was up but they wouldn&#x27;t refund the shipping until after a certain number of days in which I had to call back. I forgot to call back until a couple days after the trial period ended, which I was unaware of until I called and of course they wouldn&#x27;t let me return it because the trial period ended. So I was forced to keep it, this is the third month and still no good results. Bottom line is don&#x27;t waste your money, this is an expensive product. I am very disappointed in my purchase. I have officially given up on crazy hair removal ideas, just sticking to wax and tweezers from now on- at least those results are instant. Also getting your own wax warmer and supplies for in home use is much cheaper than this product!</li>
            <li> When I first tried the NoNo, I had to get the hang of it - rolling it across my skin. Once I got that down to where it rolls smoothly, I had to go over and over one area many times. Worked great on my face (hair came off fine), but when I tried it under my arms, the hair is much thicker. I went over it repeatedly and not much hair came off at all.  I could smell it burning (I have never burned my skin from it), but got really mad when I seen that the hair wasn&#x27;t coming off. The next day, I gave up and shaved (you can shave while using the NoNo). I was shocked a couple of days later when hardly any growth appeared under my arms (Very very little)! I normally have to shave every day and was shocked that the hair growth had slowed! I now shave in between treatments and use the NoNo 3-4 times a week.  I&#x27;ve only had it for a week, so I have a lot of time to go to see if it eliminates hair growth indefinitely. I would recommend it if you don&#x27;t mind taking time to use it about 15 minutes 3-4 times a week.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try my no no that I received for Christmas from my husband.  I allowed the hair to grow on my legs and underarms to the length of 1-3mm as mentioned in the no no tips.  I went over the same areas 3 to 4 times to make sure I got as many hairs as possible.  I used the buffer over my areas that were treated.  I did loose a few hairs, but it did not remove a path of hair like it shows on the TV commercials.  I am extremely disappointment in this product.  I wanted to have that waxed look with out the pain.  This product did not do as advertised and I used this product several times with the same results.  I would not recommend this to any of my friends.&lt;br /&gt;To me it seemed that the product melted some of the hairs and with the smell of branding cattle after I was done with this process, but still had plenty of long hair on both my legs and underarms.</li>
