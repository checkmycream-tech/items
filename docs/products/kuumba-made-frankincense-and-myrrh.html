            <li>Love love love this scent.</li>
            <li>The scent is ok.  </li>
            <li>It was more on the flowery side.  </li>
            <li>this is the most sensual calming scent I have ever had.  </li>
            <li>my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>It is a winning combination for me.  </li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite scents, I get so many compliments.</li>
            <li>I have fibromyalgia &amp; it seems that rolling a bit on makes me feel better just by the smell.</li>
            <li>but I still ordered more because I wanted to have another on hand.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a wonderful product ;-)</li>
            <li>rich, smoky and exotic.</li>
            <li>I was worried this would be too strong a smell, but it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li>High quality oils and good price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very rich and full bodied.  </li>
            <li>Love to put on my wrists to settle and calm my mind while at work.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many and these folks are consistent across their product line.</li>
            <li>it has  a rich and sweet aroma ,  </li>
            <li>Just right for the outdoors man in your family!</li>
            <li>Not only does it smell great, but it is also very healing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>A little sweet for my taste, but it made mom happy.</li>
            <li>mixed a bit with some Kuumba Made Amber Paste and made my own body deo and personal&lt;</li>
            <li>but I guess it&#x27;s worth it since the oil lasts.</li>
            <li>It goes on strong but starts to mellow out after a bit to a pleasant, long lasting smell.</li>
            <li>It was not what I expected but honestly I had never smelled Frankincense and myrrh together.  </li>
            <li>I have ordered more since my last order.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t used all of my first bottle</li>
            <li>You will see more orders from me in the future!</li>
            <li>very small amount but smells great</li>
            <li>no seriously!</li>
            <li>makes me feel elaxed and whole and pure</li>
            <li>This scent is very strong, so only a tiny drop is needed.</li>
            <li>I wear this all the time but the last blend I ordered smelled so sweet</li>
            <li>Clearly not the original blend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>guess from my past lives eons ago :-)</li>
            <li>I had previously been purchasing the smaller bottles but this size offers much more value for your money.  </li>
            <li>far as Kuumba Made oils go, this is, by far, the one with the longest lifespan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very subtle and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i have actually been using this one as a deodorant (which i cannot do with any of the other Kuumba scents i own) because the smell stays so long, and it over powers any of my potential bodily &#x27;stank&#x27;.</li>
            <li>If too much is used it can be a little overpowering</li>
    </ol>

            <li> : It&#x27;s a sweet-smelling, somewhat masculine scent; (not the spicy-sweet of other F&amp;M blends.)</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Goes a long way</li>

            <li> I am on my 3rd bottle in past 4 years and use reg.</li>
            <li> However, the amount is too little 1/8 oz.  </li>
            <li> And it the cutest little roll-on bottle.</li>
            <li> The roll on bottle is a bit small</li>
            <li> Total disappointment.</li>
            <li> and I never get tired of smelling this myself.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed with the scent.  </li>
            <li> You just need a little bit!&lt;br /&gt;You will not be disappointed!  </li>
            <li> Some people might like it, but I wasn&#x27;t crazy about it.</li>
            <li> i hate being required to do this.</li>

            <li> I had previously been purchasing the smaller bottles but this size offers much more value for your money.  I absolutely love the scent.</li>
            <li> This is one of my all time favorites from now on, I have gotten so many compliments on this one and I never get tired of smelling this myself.</li>
            <li> I love this thing.  Brings me memory from childhood. However, the amount is too little 1/8 oz.  Found the same at health food for a little less.  still is another source to buy it.</li>
            <li> Am loving this oil!  Not only does it smell great, but it is also very healing.&lt;br /&gt;I mixed a bit with some Kuumba Made Amber Paste and made my own body deo and personal&lt;br /&gt;scent.&lt;br /&gt;It is very rich and full bodied.  You just need a little bit!&lt;br /&gt;You will not be disappointed!  Thank you Tom&#x27;s Incense and Amazon!</li>
            <li> very small amount but smells great</li>
            <li> It was not what I expected but honestly I had never smelled Frankincense and myrrh together.  It&#x27;s a musky smell with maybe a citrus undertone...good for the winter and fall.</li>
            <li> My husband just bought this cologne. Ladies...&amp;#34;clears throat&amp;#34; this stuff is amazing! It&#x27;s woodsy and mellow. Just right for the outdoors man in your family!</li>
            <li> I really like it, the only thing I don&#x27;t like is the size of the bottle, and the cost, for such a small bottle. doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> this is the way I remember frankincense  from the 70&#x27;s . rich, smoky and exotic. lifts my mood to smell it</li>
            <li> I bought this product for mom as she is a big fan of frankincense.  She was so impressed with this she went on a sniff-fest.  A little sweet for my taste, but it made mom happy.</li>
            <li> Spiritual and sothing</li>
            <li> Love love love this scent. I wear it at night or after bath.  Wonderful musky smell.  High quality oils and good price. Goes a long way</li>
            <li> Be careful who you order this from. I wear this all the time but the last blend I ordered smelled so sweet it was nauseating. Clearly not the original blend.</li>
            <li> Great smell! I have ordered more since my last order. Please keep this in stock.</li>
            <li> Total disappointment. I thought that this would smell like a church...it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The scent is ok.  I was a little disappointed with the scent.  It was more on the flowery side.  Some people might like it, but I wasn&#x27;t crazy about it.</li>
            <li> Great Christmas gift - how many people actually know what it smells like and the great medicinal purposes?</li>
            <li> Kuumba Made- the best natural fragrance. I&#x27;ve tried many and these folks are consistent across their product line.</li>
            <li> this is the most sensual calming scent I have ever had.  I am on my 3rd bottle in past 4 years and use reg. it last forever.  Love to put on my wrists to settle and calm my mind while at work.  Beautiful.  I highly recommend.  And it the cutest little roll-on bottle.</li>
            <li> This scent is very strong, so only a tiny drop is needed. The scent lasts all day. If too much is used it can be a little overpowering</li>
            <li> the smell is VERY strong. if you have ever smelled anything scented as Frankincense and Myrrh, then you probably know what you are getting yourself into when purchasing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as far as Kuumba Made oils go, this is, by far, the one with the longest lifespan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have actually been using this one as a deodorant (which i cannot do with any of the other Kuumba scents i own) because the smell stays so long, and it over powers any of my potential bodily &#x27;stank&#x27;.</li>
            <li> my favorite scent. guess from my past lives eons ago :-) no seriously!</li>
            <li> The products from KUUMBA are out of this world</li>
            <li> I like this oil it has  a rich and sweet aroma ,  this aroma  is theraputic  makes me feel elaxed and whole and pure</li>
            <li> It is a winning combination for me.  I found this scent while I was on vacation in Provincetown and used it all up. So happy I was able to find more!</li>
            <li> This is not the frankincense and myrrh scent I was used to but it is still a nice pleasant smell: It&#x27;s a sweet-smelling, somewhat masculine scent; (not the spicy-sweet of other F&amp;M blends.) It goes on strong but starts to mellow out after a bit to a pleasant, long lasting smell. The roll on bottle is a bit small but I guess it&#x27;s worth it since the oil lasts. I&#x27;ll be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> I was worried this would be too strong a smell, but it&#x27;s not. Very subtle and smells amazing. I think men or women could use it.</li>
            <li> i love it. i love it. i love it. i hate being required to do this. i love it. i love it</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite scents, I get so many compliments. Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff! I have fibromyalgia &amp; it seems that rolling a bit on makes me feel better just by the smell. I hadn&#x27;t used all of my first bottle but I still ordered more because I wanted to have another on hand. You will see more orders from me in the future! Thanks for a wonderful product ;-)</li>
