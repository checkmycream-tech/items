            <li>but it smells good.</li>
            <li>This feels really good when I comb it through my hair in the shower.  </li>

            <li>that&#x27;s fine and breaks and falls out and nothing really is great.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is amazing..</li>
            <li>amazing</li>
            <li>In addition this product smells amazing.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is amazing.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair silky smooth and smelling great.</li>
            <li>It also has a really nice scent, almost like cherries to me.  </li>
            <li>People always tell me I have nice hair.  </li>
            <li>Always liked Nexxus quality.</li>
            <li>It also has a nice scent.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice almond scent too.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this conditioner and the fact that it works is even more of a plus!</li>
            <li>but it is not as good as it was before it was made widely available.</li>
            <li>It goes it completely smoothes and untangles the hair along with the shine and smoothness, best conditioner ever.</li>
            <li>Great product for all types of hair, its a product worth paying for.</li>
            <li>My beautiful hair was breaking off when I dared to comb,  gently brush it, or even wash it!</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, which I color and have permed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great fun, and some day you will be able to say, \\&quot;... told you so...\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and tends to split but after using this conditioner it looks and feels healthier!</li>
            <li>It is especially good on curly and coarse hair like mine.  </li>
            <li>Tried others and always go back to the best for my hair.</li>
            <li>Does not leave the greasy conditioner feel like most others I have tried.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite conditioner.</li>
            <li>Smells great, coats and conditions my hair really well.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for something to replace Biolage&#x27;s conditioning balm (which I love but wanted change) and this product does the trick.</li>
            <li>love the smell of this product&lt;</li>
            <li>This product is my favorite for moisturizing my hair.</li>
            <li>Even when the ends are trimmed it doesn&#x27;t look healthy.</li>
            <li>I picked this up at walgreens, and it worked like magic.</li>
            <li>Love this conditioner, which I use once a week.</li>
            <li>I so love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Meaning that this product seems to be as good as ever and simply still does a great job as advertised.</li>
            <li>I am REALLY picky; this is great stuff.</li>
            <li>So glad that I did - the results are instantaneous, my hair STOPPED breaking and shedding.  </li>
            <li>I mix it with Humectress, apply after showering and whenever I have changed hairdressers, I&#x27;m always told how healthy my hair is.  </li>
            <li>I has been using it for many years.</li>
            <li>Fabulous product -- I&#x27;ve been using it since the mid-80s!</li>
            <li>Outstanding conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>hair is noticeably more shiny and the conditioner helps a lot with de-tangling (which in turn prevents me from accidentally pulling hair out while combing tangles).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my favorite conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It said 2 day free shipping &amp; it took a week to get here!  </li>
            <li>It keeps my hair healthy even after having the color stripped from my hair.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I HAVE ORDERED THIS MANY TIMES AND JUST LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>How many times have you heard those immortal words &amp;#34;I&#x27;ve tried every product on the market&amp;#34;.?</li>
            <li>Been using Keraphix for years - makes hair stronger &amp; silky - love it</li>
            <li>I bought this along with the emergence restorative strength conditioning treatment and I like this one better.</li>
            <li>This smells great and leaves my hair feeling very silky and healthy.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that damages easily.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO OTHERS, GREAT PRODUCT</li>
            <li>Overview:&lt;br /&gt;I got this conditioner because I was running out and it got some pretty good reviews.</li>
            <li>Excellent hair repair for dry damaged color-treated hair.</li>
            <li>I was so happy because this conditioner leaves my bleached hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I have tried every single hair product out there, including Garnier which I thought was the best...</li>
            <li>Truly a special buy!</li>
            <li>I have ordered this product multiple times through amazon and everytime it was quick shipping and perfect product!</li>
            <li>Now my curls are soft, shiny and healthy looking and it smells really good too...</li>
            <li>I have people comment on how soft my hair is and how nice my hair looks!</li>
            <li>The smell has changed on many of the Nexxus products, however this has still remained true.</li>
            <li>Very good conditioner for dry hair</li>
            <li>My hair is baby fine, and perm damaged.</li>
            <li>Hair becomes silky soft pleasant to touch.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used better conditioners and this stuff wasn&#x27;t super cheap.</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t use it just once I notice a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy using this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experienced hair loss recently</li>
            <li>This really smooth&#x27;s damaged, color treated hair.  </li>
            <li>Excelent Conditioner for smooth and shiny hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also, really great for deep conditioning.</li>
            <li>You want to keep your hair, so never use cheap product.</li>
            <li>but my initial use gave very nice results.</li>
            <li>that it is no longer even close to the original.</li>
            <li>even when I blow dry my hair, it stays nice and soft and I don&#x27;t get the fly away</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been having a hard time finding it in stores, but am thrilled it&#x27;s available on amazon at a good price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how soft and smoothe my hair is now after a shower.</li>
            <li>I leave it in my hair for about 5 minutes while washing everything else, then rinse with cool water.</li>
            <li>I returned it for a full refund.  </li>
            <li>It really works and has kertin in it to help hair grow in stronger and better.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my hair smooth, soft, and healthy.</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick.</li>
            <li>I apply when hair is still damp, put in a big braid and in the morning, you have lovely wavy, healthy hair.</li>
            <li>Love these products they work and are right for my hair as it is coloured and you don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
            <li>Great for Black hair.  </li>
            <li>It makes the hair very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>It is too soon to tell if it will help strengthen, but it sure makes my hair feel silky and soft.  </li>
            <li>It keeps the hair healthy and soft.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s on the pricey side, but I feel that the difference in conditioning is worth it, for me.</li>
            <li>Somehow, this line of products is able to help thinning hair to grow a little more healthy - highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Great classic conditioner with keratin - one of the first on the market long ago - and still holds up.</li>
            <li>Not only does it have a clean refreshing scent, but it volumizes my hair well.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product, really makes my hair soft without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>she was right-</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve bought a &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; brand of conditioner... and it&#x27;s worth the extra money (I&#x27;ve bought two more bottles since my original purchase).</li>
            <li>My hair is very strong as if the product almost worked instantly.  </li>
            <li>One was fine, one was very old and smelled rancid.  </li>
            <li>This product leaves your hair soft and strong.</li>
            <li>Like this product very much.</li>
            <li>I have fine, naturally curly hair and have used this for over 20 years.  </li>
            <li>After using this conditioner, my hair is so much stronger and healthier!</li>
            <li>I HAVE USED MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF CONDITIONERS</li>
            <li>makes my hair soft and tangle free-</li>
            <li>Meanwhile this will repair hair that gets lots of sun and wind as well or better than anything that I&#x27;ve grossly overpaid for in a &#x27;salon&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I really hope the results for the product itself are not disappointing.</li>
            <li>I hope that you still have a large stash of it, as I will come back for more.</li>
            <li>It slowly brought my hair back to &amp;#34;life&amp;#34; and smells great!</li>
            <li>It really makes my hair look and feel better instantly.  </li>
            <li>So, the same is true about this one!</li>
            <li>I got this a week ago and have been using it everyday, i love it!</li>
            <li>Very creamy and makes my hair super soft.</li>
            <li>My husband has baby fine hair and this is the only product that keeps his hair from breaking.  </li>
            <li>This is the only conditioner that agrees with my hair, which is fine, but I have a LOT of it.</li>
            <li>Fine individual strands but a LOT of hair (which is why I cut it).</li>
            <li>Noting that the re-formulation seemed to entail mostly a change of order on the ingredients, or more of one standard ingredient and a bit less of another, I cannot say that I can tell much if any difference.</li>
            <li>My hair was very damaged from over processing and heat.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It really seems to strengthen my hair</li>
            <li>It really works to stop hair loss and adds body.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews on this product before I purchased and I have to say this really works-</li>
            <li>correct produce and fast delivery</li>
            <li>UNLESS it&#x27;s just me getting used to the smell, which would really suck for the people around me.</li>
            <li>Oh god, maybe I smell and no one wants to tell me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really work out for me.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a real</li>
            <li>I found that my hair lost strength and no longer had much shine.</li>
            <li>It is pricey, but doesn&#x27;t take much.  </li>
            <li>Nexxus always does what it is supposed to do at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m starting to realize that to achieve this I should resort back to making my own products.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and this product does not weigh it down.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other conditioners, but my hair is never as shiny and healthy looking as when I use Keraphix.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the first conditioner I have found that actually does tame flyaway hair, leaving it silky and smooth with more body.  </li>
            <li>Keraphix has been the only conditioner that actually corrects and strengthens my damaged hair, and makes it soft, shiny, and defines the curls instead of making frizz, and I have tried sooooo many!</li>
            <li>notable, this conditioner does not leave a &amp;#34;film&amp;#34; or soapscum in my cast iron tub as some of my previous cheap-o shampoos had.</li>
            <li>I also use this as a light leave in, which anyone with curly, damaged or dry hair can benefit from.</li>
            <li>Hard to find this size in retail outlets, so glad I did!</li>
            <li>/&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my hair feeling soft, but doesn&#x27;t leave any residue behind so that&#x27;s pretty good</li>
            <li>I rotate around w high quality conditioners  </li>
            <li>Im always sure to leave just a little of the Keraphix in my ends when I rinse</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for several years, even before they sold out to a general retailer and became available in stores and not exclusively sold at salons anymore.</li>
            <li>I have fine, straight, color treated hair that I have to wash and dry daily.</li>
            <li>I have found it only in Paul Mitchell Wild Ginger which is a wonderful product (no more flat iron) costing about the same as Nexxus.</li>
            <li>I am new to this product...</li>
            <li>this stuff seriously makes my ends amazing by not looking so frizzy.</li>
            <li>This gives you a bit of repair and restoration that is needed, and also allows you to extend your haircut a month or so past the normal recommended time since you don&#x27;t see as many split ends.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair with no tangle and very soft.</li>
            <li>First it&#x27;s essential to say that we cannot expect any hair product to give us a miracle or something.</li>
            <li>Naturally dark brown, dyed light brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always heard you should only buy from a salon, but this is first time I&#x27;ve had the issue.  </li>
            <li>I have tried a number of products with OK results and found this one to be no different than any other keratin conditioner containing hydrolyzed keratin.  </li>
            <li>It lasts a long time and is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s soooo smooth, soft and touchable and frizzies are down to a minimum.  </li>
            <li>Also, the bottles seemed to be filled at a second-market facility because they were overfilled and the neck of the bottle was not clean which made me think they had been re-used or re-filled somehow.  </li>
            <li>Huge waste of money.</li>
            <li>Hair is soft, shiny and manageable.  </li>
            <li>It also makes his hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>People often comment on how shiny and soft my hair looks.</li>
            <li>It works well so far, but I do have some complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells like an old lady (no offense to old ladies, I just don&#x27;t like your smells).</li>
            <li>It makes hair soft and it feels restorative.</li>
            <li>Smooths hair and keeps it soft</li>
            <li>It strengthens and conditions my hair without making it too soft and lifeless.</li>
            <li>I have used it for many years, and it is the only conditioner that gives my hair body and reduces the appearance of split ends, without being too heavy.  </li>
            <li>I got this because my hair has always been thin, but now that I have it at a longer length, I felt like I really needed to do what I could to make it look as healthy as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am sure that I could spend double to triple the price on other products and receive the same results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nothing amazing compared to stuff I&#x27;ve used in the past, but my hair isn&#x27;t the most difficult to work with in regards to conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only people who may not need this are those of you who live in the tropics!</li>
            <li>I searched high and low for this product and found it on Amazon, of course.  </li>
            <li>So when the faceless, uncaring monolith store that has a stranglehold on most markets pays even less attention than usual to the &#x27;demand&#x27; side of the old \\&quot;supply and demand\\&quot;, I get to send them a copy of the receipt from the competition!</li>
            <li>I used this product every two days for a month and it made my hair look alive with extra shine and defined curls.</li>
            <li>This is the only conditioner I have found that helps my thin and fine hair!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money if you are as frustrated as I was with all the products out that that promised healthy shiny hair after two weeks...</li>
            <li>The former &amp;#34;brush full of hair&amp;#34; after brushing is a thing of the past.</li>
            <li>I have very thin fine hair that has been dyed probably way to much.  </li>
            <li>I prefer a natural product that nourishes my hair long term.</li>
            <li>My only concern is that the ingredients are pretty harsh and now that  I&#x27;ve run out of the supply my hair looks dryer than when I started.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and thin, so it needs all the help it can get.</li>

            <li> but it smells good.</li>

            <li> this is quite good</li>

            <li> This conditioner is amazing..</li>
            <li> amazing</li>
            <li> In addition this product smells amazing.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is amazing.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair silky smooth and smelling great.</li>
            <li> It also has a really nice scent, almost like cherries to me.  </li>
            <li> People always tell me I have nice hair.  </li>
            <li> Always liked Nexxus quality.</li>
            <li> It also has a nice scent.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice almond scent too.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this conditioner and the fact that it works is even more of a plus!</li>
            <li> but it is not as good as it was before it was made widely available.</li>
            <li> It goes it completely smoothes and untangles the hair along with the shine and smoothness, best conditioner ever.</li>
            <li> Great product for all types of hair, its a product worth paying for.</li>
            <li> My beautiful hair was breaking off when I dared to comb,  gently brush it, or even wash it!</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, which I color and have permed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great fun, and some day you will be able to say, \\&quot;... told you so...\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and tends to split but after using this conditioner it looks and feels healthier!</li>
            <li> It is especially good on curly and coarse hair like mine.  </li>
            <li> Tried others and always go back to the best for my hair.</li>
            <li> Does not leave the greasy conditioner feel like most others I have tried.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite conditioner.</li>
            <li> Smells great, coats and conditions my hair really well.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for something to replace Biolage&#x27;s conditioning balm (which I love but wanted change) and this product does the trick.</li>
            <li> love the smell of this product&lt;</li>
            <li> This product is my favorite for moisturizing my hair.</li>
            <li> Even when the ends are trimmed it doesn&#x27;t look healthy.</li>
            <li> I picked this up at walgreens, and it worked like magic.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner, which I use once a week.</li>
            <li> I so love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Meaning that this product seems to be as good as ever and simply still does a great job as advertised.</li>
            <li> I am REALLY picky; this is great stuff.</li>
            <li> So glad that I did - the results are instantaneous, my hair STOPPED breaking and shedding.  </li>
            <li> I mix it with Humectress, apply after showering and whenever I have changed hairdressers, I&#x27;m always told how healthy my hair is.  </li>
            <li> I has been using it for many years.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product -- I&#x27;ve been using it since the mid-80s!</li>
            <li> Outstanding conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> hair is noticeably more shiny and the conditioner helps a lot with de-tangling (which in turn prevents me from accidentally pulling hair out while combing tangles).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my favorite conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It said 2 day free shipping &amp; it took a week to get here!  </li>
            <li> It keeps my hair healthy even after having the color stripped from my hair.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I HAVE ORDERED THIS MANY TIMES AND JUST LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li> How many times have you heard those immortal words &amp;#34;I&#x27;ve tried every product on the market&amp;#34;.?</li>
            <li> Been using Keraphix for years - makes hair stronger &amp; silky - love it</li>
            <li> I bought this along with the emergence restorative strength conditioning treatment and I like this one better.</li>
            <li> This smells great and leaves my hair feeling very silky and healthy.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that damages easily.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO OTHERS, GREAT PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Overview:&lt;br /&gt;I got this conditioner because I was running out and it got some pretty good reviews.</li>
            <li> Excellent hair repair for dry damaged color-treated hair.</li>
            <li> I was so happy because this conditioner leaves my bleached hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I have tried every single hair product out there, including Garnier which I thought was the best...</li>
            <li> Truly a special buy!</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product multiple times through amazon and everytime it was quick shipping and perfect product!</li>
            <li> Now my curls are soft, shiny and healthy looking and it smells really good too...</li>
            <li> I have people comment on how soft my hair is and how nice my hair looks!</li>
            <li> The smell has changed on many of the Nexxus products, however this has still remained true.</li>
            <li> Very good conditioner for dry hair</li>
            <li> My hair is baby fine, and perm damaged.</li>
            <li> Hair becomes silky soft pleasant to touch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used better conditioners and this stuff wasn&#x27;t super cheap.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t use it just once I notice a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy using this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experienced hair loss recently</li>
            <li> This really smooth&#x27;s damaged, color treated hair.  </li>
            <li> Excelent Conditioner for smooth and shiny hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also, really great for deep conditioning.</li>
            <li> You want to keep your hair, so never use cheap product.</li>
            <li> but my initial use gave very nice results.</li>
            <li> that it is no longer even close to the original.</li>
            <li> even when I blow dry my hair, it stays nice and soft and I don&#x27;t get the fly away</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having a hard time finding it in stores, but am thrilled it&#x27;s available on amazon at a good price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how soft and smoothe my hair is now after a shower.</li>
            <li> I leave it in my hair for about 5 minutes while washing everything else, then rinse with cool water.</li>
            <li> I returned it for a full refund.  </li>
            <li> It really works and has kertin in it to help hair grow in stronger and better.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my hair smooth, soft, and healthy.</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick.</li>
            <li> I apply when hair is still damp, put in a big braid and in the morning, you have lovely wavy, healthy hair.</li>
            <li> Love these products they work and are right for my hair as it is coloured and you don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
            <li> Great for Black hair.  </li>
            <li> It makes the hair very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> It is too soon to tell if it will help strengthen, but it sure makes my hair feel silky and soft.  </li>
            <li> It keeps the hair healthy and soft.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s on the pricey side, but I feel that the difference in conditioning is worth it, for me.</li>
            <li> Somehow, this line of products is able to help thinning hair to grow a little more healthy - highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great classic conditioner with keratin - one of the first on the market long ago - and still holds up.</li>
            <li> Not only does it have a clean refreshing scent, but it volumizes my hair well.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product, really makes my hair soft without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> she was right-</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve bought a &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; brand of conditioner... and it&#x27;s worth the extra money (I&#x27;ve bought two more bottles since my original purchase).</li>
            <li> My hair is very strong as if the product almost worked instantly.  </li>
            <li> One was fine, one was very old and smelled rancid.  </li>
            <li> This product leaves your hair soft and strong.</li>
            <li> Like this product very much.</li>
            <li> I have fine, naturally curly hair and have used this for over 20 years.  </li>
            <li> After using this conditioner, my hair is so much stronger and healthier!</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF CONDITIONERS</li>
            <li> makes my hair soft and tangle free-</li>
            <li> Meanwhile this will repair hair that gets lots of sun and wind as well or better than anything that I&#x27;ve grossly overpaid for in a &#x27;salon&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I really hope the results for the product itself are not disappointing.</li>
            <li> I hope that you still have a large stash of it, as I will come back for more.</li>
            <li> It slowly brought my hair back to &amp;#34;life&amp;#34; and smells great!</li>
            <li> It really makes my hair look and feel better instantly.  </li>
            <li> So, the same is true about this one!</li>
            <li> I got this a week ago and have been using it everyday, i love it!</li>
            <li> Very creamy and makes my hair super soft.</li>
            <li> My husband has baby fine hair and this is the only product that keeps his hair from breaking.  </li>
            <li> This is the only conditioner that agrees with my hair, which is fine, but I have a LOT of it.</li>
            <li> Fine individual strands but a LOT of hair (which is why I cut it).</li>
            <li> Noting that the re-formulation seemed to entail mostly a change of order on the ingredients, or more of one standard ingredient and a bit less of another, I cannot say that I can tell much if any difference.</li>
            <li> My hair was very damaged from over processing and heat.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It really seems to strengthen my hair</li>
            <li> It really works to stop hair loss and adds body.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this product before I purchased and I have to say this really works-</li>
            <li> correct produce and fast delivery</li>
            <li> UNLESS it&#x27;s just me getting used to the smell, which would really suck for the people around me.</li>
            <li> Oh god, maybe I smell and no one wants to tell me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work out for me.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a real</li>
            <li> I found that my hair lost strength and no longer had much shine.</li>
            <li> It is pricey, but doesn&#x27;t take much.  </li>
            <li> Nexxus always does what it is supposed to do at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to realize that to achieve this I should resort back to making my own products.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and this product does not weigh it down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other conditioners, but my hair is never as shiny and healthy looking as when I use Keraphix.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the first conditioner I have found that actually does tame flyaway hair, leaving it silky and smooth with more body.  </li>
            <li> Keraphix has been the only conditioner that actually corrects and strengthens my damaged hair, and makes it soft, shiny, and defines the curls instead of making frizz, and I have tried sooooo many!</li>
            <li> notable, this conditioner does not leave a &amp;#34;film&amp;#34; or soapscum in my cast iron tub as some of my previous cheap-o shampoos had.</li>
            <li> I also use this as a light leave in, which anyone with curly, damaged or dry hair can benefit from.</li>
            <li> Hard to find this size in retail outlets, so glad I did!</li>
            <li> /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my hair feeling soft, but doesn&#x27;t leave any residue behind so that&#x27;s pretty good</li>
            <li> I rotate around w high quality conditioners  </li>
            <li> Im always sure to leave just a little of the Keraphix in my ends when I rinse</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years, even before they sold out to a general retailer and became available in stores and not exclusively sold at salons anymore.</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight, color treated hair that I have to wash and dry daily.</li>
            <li> I have found it only in Paul Mitchell Wild Ginger which is a wonderful product (no more flat iron) costing about the same as Nexxus.</li>
            <li> I am new to this product...</li>
            <li> this stuff seriously makes my ends amazing by not looking so frizzy.</li>
            <li> This gives you a bit of repair and restoration that is needed, and also allows you to extend your haircut a month or so past the normal recommended time since you don&#x27;t see as many split ends.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair with no tangle and very soft.</li>
            <li> First it&#x27;s essential to say that we cannot expect any hair product to give us a miracle or something.</li>
            <li> Naturally dark brown, dyed light brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always heard you should only buy from a salon, but this is first time I&#x27;ve had the issue.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a number of products with OK results and found this one to be no different than any other keratin conditioner containing hydrolyzed keratin.  </li>
            <li> It lasts a long time and is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s soooo smooth, soft and touchable and frizzies are down to a minimum.  </li>
            <li> Also, the bottles seemed to be filled at a second-market facility because they were overfilled and the neck of the bottle was not clean which made me think they had been re-used or re-filled somehow.  </li>
            <li> Huge waste of money.</li>
            <li> Hair is soft, shiny and manageable.  </li>
            <li> It also makes his hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> People often comment on how shiny and soft my hair looks.</li>
            <li> It works well so far, but I do have some complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells like an old lady (no offense to old ladies, I just don&#x27;t like your smells).</li>
            <li> It makes hair soft and it feels restorative.</li>
            <li> Smooths hair and keeps it soft</li>
            <li> It strengthens and conditions my hair without making it too soft and lifeless.</li>
            <li> I have used it for many years, and it is the only conditioner that gives my hair body and reduces the appearance of split ends, without being too heavy.  </li>
            <li> I got this because my hair has always been thin, but now that I have it at a longer length, I felt like I really needed to do what I could to make it look as healthy as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am sure that I could spend double to triple the price on other products and receive the same results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing amazing compared to stuff I&#x27;ve used in the past, but my hair isn&#x27;t the most difficult to work with in regards to conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only people who may not need this are those of you who live in the tropics!</li>
            <li> I searched high and low for this product and found it on Amazon, of course.  </li>
            <li> So when the faceless, uncaring monolith store that has a stranglehold on most markets pays even less attention than usual to the &#x27;demand&#x27; side of the old \\&quot;supply and demand\\&quot;, I get to send them a copy of the receipt from the competition!</li>
            <li> I used this product every two days for a month and it made my hair look alive with extra shine and defined curls.</li>
            <li> This is the only conditioner I have found that helps my thin and fine hair!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money if you are as frustrated as I was with all the products out that that promised healthy shiny hair after two weeks...</li>
            <li> The former &amp;#34;brush full of hair&amp;#34; after brushing is a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> I have very thin fine hair that has been dyed probably way to much.  </li>
            <li> I prefer a natural product that nourishes my hair long term.</li>
            <li> My only concern is that the ingredients are pretty harsh and now that  I&#x27;ve run out of the supply my hair looks dryer than when I started.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and thin, so it needs all the help it can get.</li>
            <li> With a straight hairstyle I only need a flat iron to tame the ends, which causes dryness, breakage and color fading.</li>
            <li> Hydrolyzed means that the keratin has been broken down to theoretically result in better absorption by the hair.</li>
            <li> only 13.5 ounce so it would last long.</li>
            <li> I use this to help with color and flat iron damage and it has worked wonders on my hair.</li>
            <li> A few years ago, I was noticing dry, split ends in my long, straight hair.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend for anyone that has dry, frizzy, untamed hair.  </li>
            <li> It is not the old formula..use less or it takes forever to rinse out</li>
            <li> It smelled like my mom&#x27;s perfume (which for a 26 year old is not cool).</li>
            <li> Lots of breaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using this product for about a month when a stylist mentioned that my hair was in very good condition (shocking to me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep using this as long as Nexxus keeps making it.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not completely rinsed out - this helps with my ends a lot.</li>
            <li> The broken strands of hair on the top of my forehead are a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t get that usual very soft and silky feeling I would get with</li>
            <li> I probably will not purchase again as I feel other Nexxus conditioners work equally well.</li>
            <li> I left Penney&#x27;s, I tried other (often cheaper) products.</li>
            <li> The smallest amount goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and this product helps with breakage.</li>
            <li> so I have wavy, curly, dry frizzy hair....</li>
            <li> and my hair has become dry and brittle and is falling out.  </li>
            <li> I have severe problem dry hair</li>
            <li> If your hair is somewhat thin like mine, use it from the middle of the shaft down or even just on your ends or else it would weigh your hair down tremendously.</li>
            <li> A friend said it was the dry air up here and that I needed a product that coated my hair and made it harder to break.</li>
            <li> After reading multiple reviews, I carefully selected the product with the Keritin as a highter ingredient (about the seventh) but the bottle came with Keritin way down on the list.  </li>
            <li> You only have to use a little bit and it fully conditions your hair.</li>
            <li> Makes hair look healthy even after a bad color day.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, there is no longer enough &amp;#34;true&amp;#34; keratin to make a real difference in repairing damage and/or split ends.  </li>
            <li> Its only been a few weeks</li>
            <li> hope they don&#x27;t take it off the market because it has been getting harder and harder to find.</li>
            <li> 18 years and have used only small portions because it was not being sold in beauty salons or stores.  </li>
            <li> After over 40 years in the business, I have used other products but there is no comparison.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting harder to find anywhere, so I am trying to stock up!  </li>
            <li> I ordered the other Nexxus products, moisture conditioning treatment and strengthening serum.</li>
            <li> The former chunk of hair in the shower drain is a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> The fake Nexxus conditioner I received in this bottle was the most flowery, smelly conditioner ever --not the subtle coconut of Therappe!</li>
            <li> I have wavy/curley thin hair that i have dyed blonde for years and just can&#x27;t manage to get rid of my really dry ends...</li>
            <li> Has cut down on all my  split ends.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down, either.</li>
            <li> It did not weigh my hair down (note it was a very small amount put on damp hair that was then further styled).</li>
            <li> and I notice less breakage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Eventually they did \\&quot;re-formulate\\&quot;, which typically means that they &#x27;cheapen&#x27; the product to the point</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m going to try to find something that smells a bit less elderly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m black so</li>
            <li> I use this at least once a week since age has started to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> However it helped my hair to be a little bit stronger and look healthier.</li>
            <li> If you want keratin you need it oxidized (read the label), which is not widely available in the US.</li>
            <li> but now I use this everyday as you would a conditioner.</li>
            <li> I live in the mountains at over 7500 feet and had no idea when I moved here 8 years ago that I would be fighting dry hands, dry face, dry mouth, and the worst?</li>
            <li> I was becoming very frustrated and did lots of reading reviews on conditioners.</li>
            <li> My hair is thicker, fuller and quite silky instead of thin, dry and wispy.</li>
            <li> Put it on toweled dried hair for at least 1/2 hour or overnight then wash out and style as usual.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve even used a small amount on my hair after towel drying.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m skeptical that it&#x27;s an actual Nexxus</li>
            <li> but this product left a terrible waxy buildup on my hair with the first use.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it was a defective batch be quad</li>
            <li> This product is a little weak</li>
            <li> so no more straw hair for me!  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, indian hair.</li>
            <li> I damaged my hair due to over dying and a bad hairstylist.</li>
            <li> If you have damaged hair, definitely buy this item and you will not be disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> It was paper thin and falling out in the shower everywhere, if i just touched my hair it would fall out!</li>
            <li> I have very thin damaged hair and it was suggested to me by someone who had undergone chemo therapy.  </li>
            <li> Scary and depressing.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed that we can no longer get this product on subscription.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy from them they will sell you the wrong product and then not give you a refund even though there store page says they do!!!!</li>
            <li> Since I have been trying to grow it out, I have had the WORST time with split ends.</li>
            <li> Horrible product.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Used it all my life. Nothing else comes close</li>
            <li> I was having problems finding this product in any retail stores including salons.  I have always loved this product and have used it for 20 years. It is especially good on curly and coarse hair like mine.  Put it on toweled dried hair for at least 1/2 hour or overnight then wash out and style as usual.  Hair is soft, shiny and manageable.  I hope Amazon always carries it!</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this product.  It works well with my hair type.  It&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I have recommended to friends and they love it too!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner! Hard to find this size in retail outlets, so glad I did! I have been using Keraphix for almost 20 years. Tried others and always go back to the best for my hair. Does not leave the greasy conditioner feel like most others I have tried. My hair is baby fine, and perm damaged. This makes for lots of brittleness and breakage. Keraphix has been the only conditioner that actually corrects and strengthens my damaged hair, and makes it soft, shiny, and defines the curls instead of making frizz, and I have tried sooooo many!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is amazing.. in fact any Nexxus brand is amazing!  This conditioner does wonders to my hair!   I have dry-brittle hair, and this conditioner instantly moisturizes it. After using this conditioner, my hair is so much stronger and healthier! I have noticed a 100% improvement in my hair!   If you have damaged hair, definitely buy this item and you will not be disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> My husband has baby fine hair and this is the only product that keeps his hair from breaking.  It also makes his hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Very good conditioner for dry hair</li>
            <li> This is my favorite conditioner. My hair is fine and thin, so it needs all the help it can get.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner!</li>
            <li> Its only been a few weeks and I&#x27;m very satisfied with the results! My hair is very strong as if the product almost worked instantly.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy from them they will sell you the wrong product and then not give you a refund even though there store page says they do!!!! Order from CosmeticMall or somewhere else instead!!!!</li>
            <li> Smells great, coats and conditions my hair really well.  I was looking for something to replace Biolage&#x27;s conditioning balm (which I love but wanted change) and this product does the trick.</li>
            <li> This product is *amazing*.  My hair used to be course, frizzy, damaged (breakable and split ends) and this conditioner has made my hair do a 180.  Now it&#x27;s soooo smooth, soft and touchable and frizzies are down to a minimum.  It also has a really nice scent, almost like cherries to me.  I definitely recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I use this at least once a week since age has started to dry my hair.  Non greasy &amp; leaves a great shine.  I have very fine hair and this product does not weigh it down.</li>
            <li> My hair was very damaged from over processing and heat. After getting a good trim I started using this. It slowly brought my hair back to &amp;#34;life&amp;#34; and smells great!</li>
            <li> this conditioner works great! Leaves hair with no tangle and very soft. Has cut down on all my  split ends.</li>
            <li> I have very thin fine hair that has been dyed probably way to much.  Lots of breaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using this product for about a month when a stylist mentioned that my hair was in very good condition (shocking to me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell of this product&lt;br /&gt;It really seems to strengthen my hair and I notice less breakage.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve even used a small amount on my hair after towel drying.  It did not weigh my hair down (note it was a very small amount put on damp hair that was then further styled).</li>
            <li> This product is my favorite for moisturizing my hair. I have been  using color on my hair for years and color treated hair dries out. This product restores the moisture! Love it!</li>
            <li> First it&#x27;s essential to say that we cannot expect any hair product to give us a miracle or something. So, the same is true about this one! However it helped my hair to be a little bit stronger and look healthier.</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF CONDITIONERS THAT ALL SAY THEY ARE THE BEST BUT KERAPHIX IS THE BEST</li>
            <li> Ordered 2 bottles.  One was fine, one was very old and smelled rancid.  Threw it away and wont order from them again.</li>
            <li> It is good stuff.  I would say excellent but it is not as good as it was before it was made widely available.</li>
            <li> Great product and price</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by my hair stylist and it&#x27;s awesome! My hair is fine and tends to split but after using this conditioner it looks and feels healthier!</li>
            <li> I have very thin damaged hair and it was suggested to me by someone who had undergone chemo therapy.  It has helped with the damaged hair.  I probably will not purchase again as I feel other Nexxus conditioners work equally well.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, really makes my hair soft without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that damages easily. Since I have been trying to grow it out, I have had the WORST time with split ends. I purchased Neutrogena deep recovery hair mask, and this did nothing- even after leaving it on for 20 minutes. I even bought moroccan argan oil and saturated my hair with it every day, but that didn&#x27;t work either! I was becoming very frustrated and did lots of reading reviews on conditioners. I saw good reviews for this so I gave it a whirl. I leave it in my hair for about 5 minutes while washing everything else, then rinse with cool water. It&#x27;s amazing how soft and smoothe my hair is now after a shower. It doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down, either. Truly a special buy!</li>
            <li> Seems to be disappearing from shelves, but it&#x27;s the best conditioner ever.</li>
            <li> I damaged my hair due to over dying and a bad hairstylist. It was paper thin and falling out in the shower everywhere, if i just touched my hair it would fall out! Scary and depressing. I got this a week ago and have been using it everyday, i love it! My hair hasn&#x27;t fallen out since i started using it!!! It really works to stop hair loss and adds body. Thank god i got this cause now i might be able to save my hair :) very happy with the product and it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> I can see and feel the difference after using Nexxus Keraphix , my hair looks and feel great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner for a couple of years and am very happy with the results. It does seem to help prevent breakage and my hair feels healthier when I use it.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m of several races so I have wavy, curly, dry frizzy hair....I wash it and it looks and feels like straw.  Even when the ends are trimmed it doesn&#x27;t look healthy. I have tried every single hair product out there, including Garnier which I thought was the best...I had always shied away from Nexxus because of the prices, but then I gave in and decided to give it a shot. I bought this along with the shampoo and leave-in conditioner.......Now my curls are soft, shiny and healthy looking and it smells really good too...even when I blow dry my hair, it stays nice and soft and I don&#x27;t get the fly away effect...so no more straw hair for me!  I now swear by this product and this is the only one I&#x27;ll use on my hair.  Definitely recommend for anyone that has dry, frizzy, untamed hair.  It&#x27;s worth the money if you are as frustrated as I was with all the products out that that promised healthy shiny hair after two weeks...all bull!  Nexxus all the way!!</li>
            <li> You only have to use a little bit and it fully conditions your hair. Perfect.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since the 90s.  People always tell me I have nice hair.  I attribute a lot of it to this product.  I&#x27;ve used other conditioners, but my hair is never as shiny and healthy looking as when I use Keraphix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope they don&#x27;t take it off the market because it has been getting harder and harder to find.</li>
            <li> A few years ago, I was noticing dry, split ends in my long, straight hair. I picked this up at walgreens, and it worked like magic. I&#x27;ve been having a hard time finding it in stores, but am thrilled it&#x27;s available on amazon at a good price. I&#x27;ll keep using this as long as Nexxus keeps making it. It keeps my hair smooth, soft, and healthy.</li>
            <li> Had to buy online, as our local store was out. Love this conditioner, which I use once a week.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this product before I purchased and I have to say this really works- makes my hair soft and tangle free-</li>
            <li> This is the only conditioner that agrees with my hair, which is fine, but I have a LOT of it.</li>
            <li> I so love this conditioner.  I&#x27;ve experienced hair loss recently and I bought this conditioner and feel it was one of my best purchases for my hair.  It goes it completely smoothes and untangles the hair along with the shine and smoothness, best conditioner ever.</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s just so so. work the same as regular conditioners but it smells good. only 13.5 ounce so it would last long.</li>
            <li> Great product for all types of hair, its a product worth paying for. Truly food for all types of hair.&lt;br /&gt;It smells pleasing too.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I am disappointed that we can no longer get this product on subscription.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this product and I&#x27;m skeptical that it&#x27;s an actual Nexxus conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the moment I opened the bottle - it didn&#x27;t smell like Nexxus to me - I tried it anyhow - once, twice and I don&#x27;t get that usual very soft and silky feeling I would get with my store-bought Nexxus conditioner.</li>
            <li> This product does just what it says! I recommend Nexxus Keraphix Restorative Strengthening Conditioner to everyone! This product is affordable.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for approx. 18 years and have used only small portions because it was not being sold in beauty salons or stores.  So I thought of Amazon and lo and behold--they had it!  I was so happy because this conditioner leaves my bleached hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> This really smooth&#x27;s damaged, color treated hair.  The price beats local stores. Delivery was quick. I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  People often comment on how shiny and soft my hair looks.</li>
            <li> I was horrified to learn that this product has been discontinued.  I have used it for many years, and it is the only conditioner that gives my hair body and reduces the appearance of split ends, without being too heavy.  I hope that you still have a large stash of it, as I will come back for more.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years, even before they sold out to a general retailer and became available in stores and not exclusively sold at salons anymore. After the change over, the formula stayed the same for a while. Eventually they did \\&quot;re-formulate\\&quot;, which typically means that they &#x27;cheapen&#x27; the product to the point that it is no longer even close to the original. Noting that the re-formulation seemed to entail mostly a change of order on the ingredients, or more of one standard ingredient and a bit less of another, I cannot say that I can tell much if any difference. Meaning that this product seems to be as good as ever and simply still does a great job as advertised. So when the faceless, uncaring monolith store that has a stranglehold on most markets pays even less attention than usual to the &#x27;demand&#x27; side of the old \\&quot;supply and demand\\&quot;, I get to send them a copy of the receipt from the competition! It&#x27;s great fun, and some day you will be able to say, \\&quot;... told you so...\\&quot;. Meanwhile this will repair hair that gets lots of sun and wind as well or better than anything that I&#x27;ve grossly overpaid for in a &#x27;salon&#x27;. I am REALLY picky; this is great stuff.</li>
            <li> Love these products they work and are right for my hair as it is coloured and you don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
            <li> One of the best products on earth. I&#x27;ve been using it for 25+ years!! Combine it with Nexxus Humectress for the softest hair possible!</li>
            <li> correct produce and fast delivery</li>
            <li> Great classic conditioner with keratin - one of the first on the market long ago - and still holds up. I use this with every shampoo, and deep condition once a week with argan oil, and my processed hair actually looks like hair now. Im always sure to leave just a little of the Keraphix in my ends when I rinse so it&#x27;s not completely rinsed out - this helps with my ends a lot. Love this conditioner - smells great too, like coconuts sort of.</li>
            <li> Overview:&lt;br /&gt;I got this conditioner because I was running out and it got some pretty good reviews. You could say I&#x27;m not that picky when it comes to my hair. It works well so far, but I do have some complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Hair type:&lt;br /&gt;Newly cut, Medium-length. Fine individual strands but a LOT of hair (which is why I cut it). Naturally dark brown, dyed light brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my hair feeling soft, but doesn&#x27;t leave any residue behind so that&#x27;s pretty good I guess. It&#x27;s nothing amazing compared to stuff I&#x27;ve used in the past, but my hair isn&#x27;t the most difficult to work with in regards to conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;It smells like an old lady (no offense to old ladies, I just don&#x27;t like your smells). The grandma aroma seems to go away/wash out once I get out of the shower, so it&#x27;s whatever. UNLESS it&#x27;s just me getting used to the smell, which would really suck for the people around me. Oh god, maybe I smell and no one wants to tell me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a keeper but next time I think I&#x27;m going to try to find something that smells a bit less elderly.</li>
            <li> After using this I&#x27;ve noticed my hair felt a bit sturdier. Like the strands were stronger. In addition this product smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work out for me. I&#x27;ve used better conditioners and this stuff wasn&#x27;t super cheap. It smelled like my mom&#x27;s perfume (which for a 26 year old is not cool). Pass.</li>
            <li> Nexxus Keraphix is one of the best conditioners in the world.  I searched high and low for this product and found it on Amazon, of course.  So glad that I did - the results are instantaneous, my hair STOPPED breaking and shedding.  This is a hair saver in a bottle.</li>
            <li> Thank you and no damage or leak.</li>
            <li> Used this item for 30 yrs. best conditioner I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This is NOT a Nexxus product!  I&#x27;ve always heard you should only buy from a salon, but this is first time I&#x27;ve had the issue.  The fake Nexxus conditioner I received in this bottle was the most flowery, smelly conditioner ever --not the subtle coconut of Therappe! I will never buy from this seller again.  And since I left on work trip and vacation I missed the return period by one day. Huge waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have fine, naturally curly hair and have used this for over 20 years.  I mix it with Humectress, apply after showering and whenever I have changed hairdressers, I&#x27;m always told how healthy my hair is.  I attribute that to Nexxus.  I&#x27;ve used the conditioners and shampoo for years.</li>
            <li> Excellent hair repair for dry damaged color-treated hair.</li>
            <li> Horrible product.  Thought I ordered a restorative conditioner (was looking for Nexxus Y serum) but this product left a terrible waxy buildup on my hair with the first use.  I returned it for a full refund.  Not sure if it was a defective batch be quad this is not what I&#x27;m used to from Nexxus.</li>
            <li> This is a great conditioner for color treated or damaged hair. I like how it makes my hair feel and look. Always liked Nexxus quality.</li>
            <li> Wife likes it.  Seems to help add body to hair.</li>
            <li> I had a baby and my hair has become dry and brittle and is falling out.  This feels really good when I comb it through my hair in the shower.  It is too soon to tell if it will help strengthen, but it sure makes my hair feel silky and soft.  My problem could be that I am still breastfeeding and it is stress on my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m all about ingredients when it comes to, well, anything, and this one is tops.  Not only does it have a clean refreshing scent, but it volumizes my hair well.  I buy this all the time.</li>
            <li> Like this product very much. It makes the hair very smooth and soft. I has been using it for many years. It is discountinued now. haven&#x27;t found the replacement from Nexxus for it.</li>
            <li> It is not the old formula..use less or it takes forever to rinse out</li>
            <li> Fabulous product -- I&#x27;ve been using it since the mid-80s!</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight, color treated hair that I have to wash and dry daily. With a straight hairstyle I only need a flat iron to tame the ends, which causes dryness, breakage and color fading. I have tried a number of products with OK results and found this one to be no different than any other keratin conditioner containing hydrolyzed keratin.  Hydrolyzed means that the keratin has been broken down to theoretically result in better absorption by the hair. Unfortunately, there is no longer enough &amp;#34;true&amp;#34; keratin to make a real difference in repairing damage and/or split ends.  For what this stuff costs, you can get the same results from any conditioner with hydrolyzed Keratin. If you want keratin you need it oxidized (read the label), which is not widely available in the US. I have found it only in Paul Mitchell Wild Ginger which is a wonderful product (no more flat iron) costing about the same as Nexxus.</li>
            <li> Excelent Conditioner for smooth and shiny hair.</li>
            <li> Outstanding conditioner.  Great for Black hair.  Pleasant, non perfumy, scent, great before and after feel.  Your hair feels conditioned, moisturized and tamed.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I began using Nexxus products years ago when I worked as a hair stylist at J.C. Penney. All of their products are excellent. I have very fine hair, which I color and have permed. Keraphix works best for my type of hair. When I used Nexxus products exclusively, I noticed that my perms would last an extra month. That&#x27;s a real bonus.&lt;br /&gt;When I left Penney&#x27;s, I tried other (often cheaper) products. I found that my hair lost strength and no longer had much shine. So now I&#x27;m back to exclusively using Keraphix as my conditioner. I&#x27;ll no longer use cheaper products. My hair stays healthier now.I just love Keraphix!</li>
            <li> It really works and has kertin in it to help hair grow in stronger and better.  Use it with Humextrss humidifying conditioner for best results.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve bought a &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; brand of conditioner... and it&#x27;s worth the extra money (I&#x27;ve bought two more bottles since my original purchase). I got this because my hair has always been thin, but now that I have it at a longer length, I felt like I really needed to do what I could to make it look as healthy as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is noticeably more shiny and the conditioner helps a lot with de-tangling (which in turn prevents me from accidentally pulling hair out while combing tangles).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner in conjunction with &amp;#34;Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention: Premium Organic Shampoo&amp;#34; and together, the two have been doing a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also notable, this conditioner does not leave a &amp;#34;film&amp;#34; or soapscum in my cast iron tub as some of my previous cheap-o shampoos had.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite conditioner.  It keeps the hair healthy and soft.  It also has a nice scent.  It&#x27;s worth the money.  My hair stylist told me to purchase this conditioner and I don&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I have used Nexxus products for years.  As a retired hairdresser, I found the products to be excellent for the use the company reccomends.  After over 40 years in the business, I have used other products but there is no comparison.  I am sure that I could spend double to triple the price on other products and receive the same results.</li>
            <li> i ordered this product for my daughter who was told by a friend to try nexxus products because she loves them..she was right- it makes your hair like silk</li>
            <li> Great product! Arrived in great perfect condition!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I always have to have this conditioner on hand, especially being that my hair is damaged and colored. This gives you a bit of repair and restoration that is needed, and also allows you to extend your haircut a month or so past the normal recommended time since you don&#x27;t see as many split ends.</li>
            <li> I started using this after my hair was damaged by a hairdresser, it was the only thing that repaired the damage(and time, like a year) but now I use this everyday as you would a conditioner. Absolutely love it! I have people comment on how soft my hair is and how nice my hair looks!</li>
            <li> This is the only conditioner I have found that helps my thin and fine hair!  If I don&#x27;t use it just once I notice a huge difference.  It is pricey, but doesn&#x27;t take much.  I hope they keep making this, because I have tried tons of brands and this is the only one that works for me!</li>
            <li> Somehow, this line of products is able to help thinning hair to grow a little more healthy - highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It was just what I wanted!  It said 2 day free shipping &amp; it took a week to get here!  But the product is just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Makes hair look healthy even after a bad color day. Hair becomes silky soft pleasant to touch. Heals split ends.</li>
            <li> Very creamy and makes my hair super soft. I&#x27;m black so, it works great on our hair too. It&#x27;s also, really great for deep conditioning.</li>
            <li> The only conditioner I will ever use!</li>
            <li> I am new to this product...but my initial use gave very nice results. It makes hair soft and it feels restorative.</li>
            <li> I have severe problem dry hair that&#x27;s fine and breaks and falls out and nothing really is great. I rotate around w high quality conditioners  this is quite good</li>
            <li> This is the first conditioner I have found that actually does tame flyaway hair, leaving it silky and smooth with more body.  It&#x27;s on the pricey side, but I feel that the difference in conditioning is worth it, for me.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, indian hair. This product is a little weak</li>
            <li> After reading multiple reviews, I carefully selected the product with the Keritin as a highter ingredient (about the seventh) but the bottle came with Keritin way down on the list.  Also, the bottles seemed to be filled at a second-market facility because they were overfilled and the neck of the bottle was not clean which made me think they had been re-used or re-filled somehow.  I really hope the results for the product itself are not disappointing.</li>
            <li> I have loved this conditioner for over a decade now. As someone who is constantly dying and re-dying their hair, it&#x27;s saved my hair countless times. It keeps my hair healthy even after having the color stripped from my hair. It has a nice almond scent too.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this conditioner.  Please Nexxus, put this product back in salons!</li>
            <li> I have afro hair. I used this product every two days for a month and it made my hair look alive with extra shine and defined curls. My only concern is that the ingredients are pretty harsh and now that  I&#x27;ve run out of the supply my hair looks dryer than when I started. I prefer a natural product that nourishes my hair long term. I&#x27;m starting to realize that to achieve this I should resort back to making my own products.  For strength, the best product I&#x27;ve made has been flax seed gel and for shine and definition the best concoction has been honey, sea salt and avocado. Of course, I will still use Nexxus, but not as religiously as I had been using it.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is amazing. The smallest amount goes a very long way. I use this to help with color and flat iron damage and it has worked wonders on my hair. Works better then salon products! A must have</li>
            <li> Nexxus always does what it is supposed to do at a reasonable price. You want to keep your hair, so never use cheap product.</li>
            <li> This product leaves your hair soft and strong. Fast delivery,</li>
            <li> Best conditioner I have found.  Smooths hair and keeps it soft</li>
            <li> Have used this product for about a year. I have very long hair and this product helps with breakage.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product!!!! It strengthens and conditions my hair without making it too soft and lifeless. It lasts a long time and is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Wish it came in a larger size</li>
            <li> This is amazing stuff!  It&#x27;s getting harder to find anywhere, so I am trying to stock up!  It really makes my hair look and feel better instantly.  I ration it!   Later note:   I found out it&#x27;s not made anymore after contacting the company!</li>
            <li> Alot of us used this throughout our youth. The smell has changed on many of the Nexxus products, however this has still remained true. It smells like bananas and coconut. I also use this as a light leave in, which anyone with curly, damaged or dry hair can benefit from. I apply when hair is still damp, put in a big braid and in the morning, you have lovely wavy, healthy hair.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this conditioner and the fact that it works is even more of a plus! It leaves my hair silky smooth and smelling great.</li>
            <li> I HAVE ORDERED THIS MANY TIMES AND JUST LOVE IT.  I WOUL.D ALSO HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO OTHERS, GREAT PRODUCT</li>
            <li> How many times have you heard those immortal words &amp;#34;I&#x27;ve tried every product on the market&amp;#34;.? Well hear them again. I live in the mountains at over 7500 feet and had no idea when I moved here 8 years ago that I would be fighting dry hands, dry face, dry mouth, and the worst? My beautiful hair was breaking off when I dared to comb,  gently brush it, or even wash it! I couldn&#x27;t figure out what was going on. A friend said it was the dry air up here and that I needed a product that coated my hair and made it harder to break. She told me to get this. I had tried everything,  but this works, people. Two weeks using it and the breaking stopped.  I ordered the other Nexxus products, moisture conditioning treatment and strengthening serum. The former &amp;#34;brush full of hair&amp;#34; after brushing is a thing of the past. The former chunk of hair in the shower drain is a thing of the past. The broken strands of hair on the top of my forehead are a thing of the past. My hair is thicker, fuller and quite silky instead of thin, dry and wispy. The only people who may not need this are those of you who live in the tropics!</li>
            <li> Been using Keraphix for years - makes hair stronger &amp; silky - love it</li>
            <li> I bought this along with the emergence restorative strength conditioning treatment and I like this one better. This smells great and leaves my hair feeling very silky and healthy.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product multiple times through amazon and everytime it was quick shipping and perfect product! I have wavy/curley thin hair that i have dyed blonde for years and just can&#x27;t manage to get rid of my really dry ends... this stuff seriously makes my ends amazing by not looking so frizzy. If your hair is somewhat thin like mine, use it from the middle of the shaft down or even just on your ends or else it would weigh your hair down tremendously. Love this stuff, will keep buying !!</li>
